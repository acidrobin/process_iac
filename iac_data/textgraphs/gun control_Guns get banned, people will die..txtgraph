If guns are banned, people will die. No question about that. The question is how many.My kung fu grandmaster gave a very good short speech today about gun control. He is an ex-cop, and he used to train the police officers in our town. He is very wise and offers an interesting insight into gun control. He told us a story today, about a police officer that was off duty and in plain clothes who was approached by a man with a large knife. The officer told the man to back down, however the man kept coming at him. The officer was forced to pull out his gun and kill him. If this was a civilian, he/she would be dead.I gained a useful insight into what it feels like to be assulted during today's class. I was pinned down and being choked by a man 200lbs and over 1 foot larger than me. After awhile, I realized that there was almost no hope of getting out (this was training, of course. Not real.) If you are confronted with a situation like this, and are not carrying a gun or other weapon, most likely you will be injured or killed by the attacker. Even with martial arts training, our grandmaster acknowleges that in some situations, you have to just do what you can, and hope you get out alive, especially if you are a small person.Violent crime will continue to happen no matter what, however whether it rises or falls is up to the voters and the politicians. If you think violent crime will never happen to you, put yourself in the place of the people that it has happened to, especially the dead ones. Then think twice about voting for gun control.

Guns get banned, people will die.

It's easy to come up with scenarios where you think a gun is the only escape, but then there are plenty of alternatives where guns take lives unnecessarily, be they because children get hold of them, or nutcases, or someone who's just had a bad day.The advantage of being confronted by a knife wielding maniac (as opposed to a gun wielding maniac) is that he/she has to come within arm's reach.Smiley

That's because so many scenarios exist where those without a gun die for that fact. These situations occur every damn day in the real world, they're not the stuff of Hollywood movies.So?If you're arguing that nutcases have guns, then that's a poor argument for the stance of "You don't need a gun, what're you afraid of?"The disadvantage is that to dealing with a knife wielding maniac without a gun forces you to get within stabbing range.

So what? Whether killing is a personal or impersonal matter, the bottom line is that somebody IS going to be killed and that's all there is to it. I highly doubt somebody's BEING killed is of less importance than HOW they were killed.

And if guns are banned, the only people who will have them will be the Government and criminals. How is that a good thing when the whole reason for the Constitution allowing them was for individual self defense and to stand against Government Tyranny? Banning individual ownership of guns defeats the whole purpose and the principles upon which this Country was founded.

True, you might die falling over a twig, but the point is that an idiot with a gun can kill 2 or 3 people before you can blink, which could hardly be said for someone with a knife. Also, you can run from somone with a knife, but turn your back on a gunman and you may not get 2 paces.And yes, it is fair comparison (my typing is reasonable), and do you really think that it would take an hour to knife 2-3 people, or to gun down 15? Nice try at derailing the argument but it didn't work. The comparison was between the number of people who can be picked off by a gunman and those stabbed by a knifeman in similar lengths of time.As for somone killing me, I dare say I could get 3 or 4 before anyone was able to react. Or I could just go into a school or some other place where guns aren't regularly carried. Then I could plough my way through a whole host of people before anyone got to me. And remember, running away isn't a great defense against a gun.Scenario: Man runs into street and starts stabbing people, after the second one has gone down people realise what's going on and either run away from him (to escape - remember out of reach is out of danger) or towards him (to grab him - chances are he will only manage to stab one of them before he is incapacitated).Alternatively: Man runs into street with gun. Bang, bang, bang, that's 3 gone already. People start running. Bang, bang, there go 2 more. Assuming someone in the area has a gun and kills him at this point, problem solved (but 5 dead already). If not, those running towards him are probably dead meat. Those running away will be next.Have you spotted the the difference yet?Smiley

Uhhh smiley, it isn't as if banning guns hasn't been tried in England and is failing miserably. http://www.fff.org/comment/com0512f.aspIn response, allow me to quote at length from “Gun Control in England: The Tarnished Gold Standard,” written by historian Joyce Lee Malcolm and published in the fall 2004 issue of Journal on Firearms & Public Policy:[Between 1997 and 2003] crimes with [banned firearms] have more than doubled.... In 2002, for the fourth consecutive year, gun crime in England and Wales rose — by 35 percent for all firearms, and by a whopping 46 percent for the banned handguns. Nearly 10,000 firearms offenses were committed....Clearly since the ban criminals have not found it difficult to get guns and the balance has not shifted in the interest of public safety....In the four years from 1997 to 2001 the rate of violent crime more than doubled. The UK murder rate for 2002 was the highest for a century....A recent study of all the countries of western Europe has found that in 2001 Britain had the worst record for killings, violence and burglary, and its citizens had one of the highest risks in the industrialized world of becoming victims of crime....And here’s the icing on the cake: “[A] United Nations study of eighteen industrialized countries, including the United States, published in 2002 ... found England and Wales at the top of the Western world’s crime league, with the worst record for ‘very serious’ offenses.” [Emphasis added]And all this while crime in the United States, including violent crime, has been steadily falling. The “Wild West” seems to be 3,000 miles to our east.“Nevertheless,” observed Derek Phillips, legislative advisor for the UK’s Office of Legislative Affairs, “‘tough’ legislative regulation, so evidently ineffective in achieving the purpose claimed for it, continues as a policy.” The UK’s ban on private firearms ownership has left the people there completely defenseless in the wake of rising crime. A young American turned British bobby has shown the courage to suggest that more guns might be the answer, but rather than take an honest and rational look at the evidence, the British would rather hide behind an irrational hatred for firearms and an even more irrational contempt for American sensibility on this issue. Guns in the hands of police officers — and private citizens — make everyone safer. Cowering from the criminal element and denouncing “gun drunk” Americans won’t change that simple fact.

What if you're in a wheelchair and can't run away?Yeah it could take you an hour to pull off something like that. I for one don't think you have the skills necessary to shoot accurately enough to hit 15 people, especially if they're moving.Trouble with the comparisonn is that it's highly flawed. The minute that shots begin to ring out people are going to start running and moving and make it hard to get off a clear shot and hit a target. With a knife nobody hears anything until it's too late.And I dare say that I'd like to see you even try.Some people are physically unable to run at all. They'll die soonest.You're assuming that every shot will hit a person rather than missing entirely. You're also assuming that each shot will provide an instant kill, when in many cases they don't.I spotted the difference a long time ago. Unlike yourself my arguments tend to use more in the way of logic than you do. What you use is baseless anti-gun rhetoric designed purely to scare people.

I loved the wheelchair scenario. What if the person in the wheelchair is 20 feet away (out of arm's reach)? Do they then have a better chance if the maniac has a knife or a gun?Maybe you're right about my gun skills, or maybe I would just pick a crowded marketplace where no aiming is necessary. Either way the gun is a far easier way of killing large numbers of people in a far more indiscriminant way than a knife.No, the comparison is not flawed. You say that the knife is quiet, so nobody hears anything before it's too late. You think when they hear the gun shot there's still time to get out of the way? You are also still ignoring the range of an attack with a gun.At close range (5-10 feet), I dare say I could hit my target. Do you think you could get further than that before the bullet hit home? I'd be far more willing to take my chances against a maniac with a knife.As for me trying to scare people, all you have to do is look at how many people die from gun related incidents in the US to be scared. If you aren't scared by that then I don't think there's any hope for you.Smiley

You don't think it's possible?Neither. That 20 foot distance can be crossed in a matter of just a few seconds. If the maniac wants to kill the person in the wheelchair and the only defense they have is to try and flee then they're gonna die.It's a very safe bet that I'm right.A lot of good a crowded marketplace will do you if you suffer a doublefeed jam and don't know how to properly clear it and return the gun to a state of functioning.And either way death is death and it's as simple as that. It's not like people are going to be less upset finding out that their loved ones were stabbed to death than they'd be if they were shot to death.You're still ignoring the facts of the real world. If you can't aim properly then you can't hit your target. If you can't hit your target then the effective range is useless.You'd think so at least.In the North Hollywood Shootout of 1997, a wounded police officer shot by AK-47 rounds was able to make it to cover 90 yards away and wait for help.Well then I guess there's no hope for me, because I'm not scared by the number of deaths.Why am I not scared? Because I know the facts involved.

My point of view is that I've got a right and a responsibility to protect myself and my family. If a gang of thugs try to perpetrate a home invasion, whether or not they've got guns or not, I'm at a serious disadvantage. Also, only law abiding citizens obey the law. Ban guns and criminals can still find a way to get them. I mean, how long have DRUGS been illegal? Yet, plenty of criminals get their hands on them.Either way, we need to be able to protect our homes from invasion. Four or 5 guys busting into a house in the middle of the night will require more than a bat to deal with. I don't plan on ever letting my family be hurt in any way by miscreants. Period.

The bible is very clear in its warning that "those who live by the sword (a weapon) will die by the sword". By that it teaches that the criminal who lives by violence will die by violence, and we see that result every day in the lives of violent offenders who are killed.And remember when Peter cut the ear off of the Centurion who came to arrest Jesus? Jesus rebuked him because Jesus knew He had to die for Humanity; so He healed the guards ear, but He never told Peter to lay down his sword. Neither the bible nor Jesus ever promoted pacifism at all. In fact, he told this to his disciples. Luke 22:36: "Then He said to them, But now, he that has a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that has no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one." So Jesus believed in self defense, but not offensive violence. Here's a link that explains the scriptural perspective very well.http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu_Uhj_...lf-Defense.txt

If someone takes your cloak, do not stop him from taking your tunic. 30Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back. 31Do to others as you would have them do to you. 32"If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even 'sinners' love those who love them. 33And if you do good to those who are good to you, what credit is that to you? Even 'sinners' do that. 34And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you? Even 'sinners' lend to 'sinners,' expecting to be repaid in full. 35But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked. 36Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.I would have thought this was a pretty well known quote, so I'm surprise you haven't come across it. I believe they call it the Sermon on the Mount. Perhaps you should pay more attention to your lord and saviour's teachings rather than misinterpretting your own cherrypicked sections.Smiley

It doesn't matter to me if the bible says to Kill everyone (as God seems so inclined to do every so often) or kill no one even to save your own butt. It's MY responsibility to take care of my own and I will meet any threat with as much force as necessary to maintain my family's safety. Period.

I am well aware of these passages smiley. But unfortunately for your point, they aren't referring to self defense at all. But are dealing with loving ones enemies and praying for those who hate you and reject God.

Now let's see:Matthew 5:38-4238"You have heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.'[g] 39But I tell you, Do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. 40And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. 41If someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. 42Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.Luke 6:27-3627"But I tell you who hear me: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, 28bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. 29If someone strikes you on one cheek, turn to him the other also. If someone takes your cloak, do not stop him from taking your tunic. 30Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back. 31Do to others as you would have them do to you. 32"If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even 'sinners' love those who love them. 33And if you do good to those who are good to you, what credit is that to you? Even 'sinners' do that. 34And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you? Even 'sinners' lend to 'sinners,' expecting to be repaid in full. 35But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked. 36Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.I would have thought this was a pretty well known quote, so I'm surprise you haven't come across it. I believe they call it the Sermon on the Mount. Perhaps you should pay more attention to your lord and saviour's teachings rather than misinterpretting your own cherrypicked sections.Smiley

I agree that it is perfectly valid to protect oneself, but should that really go as far as killing?The point of my latest post was merely to point out to Archie that to say that neither the bible nor Jesus ever promoted pacifism is like saying that Mahatma Gandhi was into full contact karate. His assertions on the subject of christianity get more rediculous every day. Can we agree on that?And CUNxTime, I agree with your view on the validity of the bible, but I also think that the teaching of Jesus, as portrayed in the bible, are a decent philosophy, assuming you don't just twist them every which way so that they fit in with your own views.Smiley

That's all well and good, but that doesn't say that we shouldn't protect ourselves against harm.Not a word in those verses is against active deterrent.

Let's face it Archie, you stated categorically that neither the bible nor Jesus ever promoted pacifism. If you truly believe that then there is quite simply no hope for you whatsoever. The whole point of Jesus' teachings was to do with forgiveness and, yes, pacifism. Those were the central tenets. The fact that you twist every scripture you quote to fit you blasphemous philosophy shows that you have no idea of what christian philosophy really is.With every assertion you make you become more and more ludicrous. It is quite obvious that you are no more a christian than I am.In fact, I feel insulted on behalf of all true christians that you could call yourself such.Smiley

I am well aware of these passages smiley. But unfortunately for your point, they aren't referring to self defense at all. But are dealing with loving ones enemies and praying for those who hate you and reject God. For further analysis, here's a decent link that deals with both passages.http://www.religion.emory.edu/facult...hew/matt3.html

All you have proven here smiley, is that you don't even know what the word pacifism means. Here, for your information is what it means, and no way can you find scriptural support that the bible teaches it at all.Note the bolded: Under any circumstances. So if Jesus was a pacifist, why did He order the disciples to purchase swords in Luke 22:36? Can you answer that? Why would they need swords if they were not supposed to use them under any circumstances? And if God is a pacifist then how do you explain all the times He ordered the OT Jews to defend themselves and to destroy their enemies? How do you explain that smiley? So here's the bottom line smiley, you may want to project your anger onto me and claim that my understanding of christianity is flawed, but the fact is that you have no idea at all what Jesus, or true christianity represents at all. And the proof of that is that I have supported my beliefs with extensive documentation above while all you have done is yell at me and insult me with no scriptural evidence "in proper context" to support your claims AT ALL. And since we're talking about Jesus and the bibles perspective on pacifism, actual scriptural evidence is required to prove your point.

Sometimes killing is the only thing that'll stop the attacker from continuing their assault against you. I know this first hand and that's one of the cold hard realities of life. Sometimes anything short of death just doesn't work and you've got to accept that fact.Maybe you'll be fortunate enough to never encounter such a situation in your lifetime, if so you're lucky. But if not then you'll come upon a situation where you have to make a very hard decision: only one person gets to live and walk away, and it's either going to be you or your attacker.Pacifism means the use of no force, ever. That means no use of force against somebody trying to kill you. So in a way the Bible really doesn't promote pacifism. There's a difference between turning the other cheek, and remaining in place as somebody murders you for no reason.

I have been told by more than one cop, be it a friend, or at the shooting range, that if my home is ever invaded or if I'm ever attacked and the option to kill or wound the aggressor exists; to always kill without hesitation. To wound a criminal is to invite a lifetime of lawsuits and medical expenses for a lowlife who would have killed me if the situation was reversed. Beside, if they will break into a strangers home in the middle of the night then they are presumed to be very bold and very dangerous. That's also why I have an alarm system though, so it will never come to a confrontation as the horn will scare them off. But if it didn't and they proceeded to confront me, I wouldn't bother trying to reason with them over the noise of the alarm.

from Luke: 47While he was still speaking a crowd came up, and the man who was called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss him, 48but Jesus asked him, "Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?" 49When Jesus' followers saw what was going to happen, they said, "Lord, should we strike with our swords?" 50And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear. 51But Jesus answered, "No more of this!" And he touched the man's ear and healed him.

Recently passed in Georgia was a bill that allows persons with concealed carry permits to carry their weapons into restuarants, parks and other public places. (Applause!)It will be interesting to read the statistics regarding handgun shooting deaths before and after the change. I'm wondering whether the killings of evil perps by law-abiding citizens should be counted in a separate tally....say 'good deaths by gunfire'.

It is precisely those numbers that motivates me to support the right for law abiding Americans to own weapons for self defense smiley. If you disarm honest people, the only armed people left will be the Government and criminals. How is that a good thing when the whole reason for the Constitution allowing them was for individual self defense and to stand against Government Tyranny? Banning individual ownership of guns defeats the whole purpose and the principles upon which this Country was founded.

I must assume that you haven't read the whole thread sinjun because I covered this early on. Here's the quote. Jesus understood that He had to die for the sins of humanity so he rebuked Peter for his actions, but He never told the disciples to lay down their weapons forever at all. On the contrary, he told them in Luke 22:36 to purchase swords before leaving on a mission to evangelize.

That's simple, because He thought that two was enough for that night in the garden as He prayed that he could be spared being crucified.I purposely avoided being accused of distorting the scriptures by posting an objective link that dealt specifically with the passages in question that you relied on. So I didn't twist anything at all. You just don't like how REAL BIBLE SCHOLARS interpret the bible in opposition to your humanistic interpretation. Oh really mr bible scholar? His giving His life couldn't have been because He knew He was here to die for our sins, could it? Pacifism had absolutely nothing at all to do with Jesus being crucified and if you understood the Gospel, you would know that. It was all about Him sacrificing Himself for the sins of Humanity and paying the price that only He could pay to redeem us. Here, smiley, read on from Luke 22:Luk 22:41 And He was withdrawn from them about a stone's throw, and He knelt down and prayed,Luk 22:42 saying, "Father, if it is Your will, take this cup away from Me; nevertheless not My will, but Yours, be done."Luk 22:43 Then an angel appeared to Him from heaven, strengthening Him.Luk 22:44 And being in agony, He prayed more earnestly. Then His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground.Jesus suffered greatly just at the thought of what was to come. See this link for the relevance of sweating blood. http://foraclearview.blogspot.com/20...-of-blood.html And He knew that He could call to 10,000 Angels and they would save him from this plight. So dying on the Cross had absolutely nothing at all to do with being willing to die for pacifistic reasons rather than fight for His life, but had everything to do with being willing to die for the sins of humanity rather than cling to a life that He loved very much. So once again you have shown how little you understand about what the bible really say's as you insist what you want it to say. And yet again, you offered no evidence other than your opinion that is full of misinformation and insults directed at me. Thanks for contributing absolutely nothing of actual factual value to this debate at all, but have just infused it with your secular humanist opinion of what you would like the bible to say.

Thank you Lord that you found me worthy of saving according to your grace, mercy and unconditional love for me, a sinner. I am humbled by my salvation smiley, not proud or pompous because of it. And if you understood the Love of God within your heart as I do, you too would be humbled and would agree with everything I have said here today.

Why am I not surprised that you would consider me being a sinner, something to envy?

It's easy to come up with scenarios where you think a gun is the only escape, but then there are plenty of alternatives where guns take lives unnecessarily, be they because children get hold of them, or nutcases, or someone who's just had a bad day.The advantage of being confronted by a knife wielding maniac (as opposed to a gun wielding maniac) is that he/she has to come within arm's reach.Smiley

One city, everyone carried a gun, the other city guns were banned.

If we had better guidelines in place, the mentally ill wouldn't get a hold of a gun, and if people were responsible with their weapons, children would not get a hold of them. There is no need to go crazy and ban guns, which would probably kill more than it saves, not to mention the infringement on our civil liberties.

The problem with your assumption smiley, is that we can prove by observing other Societies that have banned all handguns that your expected outcome just doesn't occur. Just as drugs have been outlawed for decades, so are they available through an underground supply. We also know that criminals can buy weapons with less hassle and sometimes for less money than law abiding people. So cutting off the legal supply will only arm the very people who pose the problem while victimizing the people who need to be able to protect themselves from violent criminals.It's also offensive that the gun control advocates automatically assume that pro gun advocates are hungry to kill people with their weapons. I know that I have never aimed a gun at anyone in anger, or for any reason at all. And my home is alarmed so that it is protected against illegal entry. That is a primary defense against being placed in the position to be confronted on my own property.http://www.fff.org/comment/com0512f.aspHere is documented evidence that the Banning of handguns in GB has failed miserably if cutting down on crime and violence was the goal.[Between 1997 and 2003] crimes with [banned firearms] have more than doubled.... In 2002, for the fourth consecutive year, gun crime in England and Wales rose — by 35 percent for all firearms, and by a whopping 46 percent for the banned handguns. Nearly 10,000 firearms offenses were committed....Clearly since the ban criminals have not found it difficult to get guns and the balance has not shifted in the interest of public safety....In the four years from 1997 to 2001 the rate of violent crime more than doubled. The UK murder rate for 2002 was the highest for a century....A recent study of all the countries of western Europe has found that in 2001 Britain had the worst record for killings, violence and burglary, and its citizens had one of the highest risks in the industrialized world of becoming victims of crime....Why would the USA want to disarm its citizenry and subject ourselves to the same experiment when we can see how it is failing in GB?

There are all kinds of bad guys out there, however I don't think saying "Hey man, I don't want no trouble" will make him walk away. If someone wants to kill or hurt you, there is nothing but force that can stop them. Its not as easy as it looks when someone has broken into your house with a baseball bat and/or a knife or gun.

Despite Archie's selective statistics, violent crime has fallen in the UK in recent years, but linking it to a relatively minor alteration in gun laws (even before the handgun ban there were heavy restrictions on their use) is a bit daft. The article quotes "gun crimes" but that includes possession of a firearm so is a bit of a red herring.Additionally, Christ's commands on turning the other cheek are clearly pacifist in nature, and this is evidenced by the early church emulating Christ in not fighting a martyr's death.

What imaginary point is that again? The whole argument the antigun advocates used in order to get guns banned in England was to cut down on violence. The evidence shows that people who are capable of killing others, don't need guns to do it necessarily, but will be violent by what ever means are available at the time. The only thing the gun ban accomplished was to disallow the victims from being armed so they had no chance at all of protecting themselves.

But the end result is much less likely to be death if no guns are involved. A gun gives you a sense of invulnerability (which is why you are so reluctant to give them up), thereby making a criminal much more likey to undertake a break-in/mugging etc if he has one.The criminal feels safer, the victim feels safer, but they're not.Smiley

But if a handgun gave you a sense of invulnerability if you possessed it, how would you feel if you were staring down the barrel of the source of your invulnerability? Also, would you argue that the criminal, with the same weapon as the victim, is safer than the victim? Why would this be when they are essentially on an even playing field?It also seems that you assume that once a victim pulls out a gun to defend themself the criminal is always fatally wounded. I bet you'd be surprised at the number of crimes stopped by someone with a gun where not a single shot was fired.

You might think so, but would probably be surprised.Gunshot woulds can be simpler and less deadly than knife wounds, because some rounds will follow along the bone and come out the other end and never hit anything vital. Being stabbed doesn't have any such result.Then how come they say they fear armed people more than they fear the cops?

Speaking for myself I would say that the only thing which has ever given me a sense of invulnerability (and a very false one at that) was consuming too much alcohol during various college weekends. I found that in every instance the effect was not only temporary but also deeply regretted the following hung over mornings....Carrying a firearm has never given me a sense of invulnerability. I am rather more conscious of the tremendous responsibility I have for my actions when I do choose to carry. Self-defense is the first right of nature. Carrying a firearm for me is merely one way in which I exercise that right against those who would seek to do me harm. I disagree with the argument that the presense of a weapon gives rise to the motive to commit a crime, and that I am less safe with a gun than without.---“And indeed, gentlemen, there exists a law, not written down anywhere but written in our hearts; a law which comes to us not by training or custom or reading but by derivation and absorption and adoption from nature itself; a law which has come to us not by theory but from practice, not by instruction but by natural intuition. I refer to the law which lays it down that, if our lives are endangered by plots or violence or armed robbers or enemies, any and every method of protecting ourselves is morally right. When weapons reduce them to silence, the laws no longer expect one to await their pronouncements. For people who decide to wait for these will have to wait for justice, too--and meanwhile they must suffer injustice first. Indeed, even the wisdom of the law itself, by a sort of tacit implication, permits self- defense, because it does not actually forbid men to kill; what it does, instead, is to forbid the bearing of a weapon with the intention to kill. When, therefore, an inquiry passes beyond the mere question of the weapon and starts to consider the motive, a man who has used arms in self-defense is not regarded as having carried them with homicidal aim”. Cicero, Selected Political Speeches, p. 222 (M. Grant, trans. 1975)“If a slave, says Plato, defends himself, and kills a freeman, he ought to be treated as a parricide. This is a civil law which punishes self-defense, though dictated by nature. . . .It is unreasonable. . .to oblige a man not to attempt the defense of his own life. . . .Who does not see that self-defense is a duty superior to every precept. . . .[T]he laws of an Italian republic, where bearing fire-arms is punished as a capital crime and where it is not more fatal to make an ill use of them than to carry them, is not agreeable to the nature of things.” Montesquieu, The Spirit of Laws, pp. 59, 60, 64, and 79-80 (trans. T. Nugent, 1899).

So converted BB guns and farm house break ins are good things now?Just more examples of the fallacies of gun control, however people who fear guns will do anything to get rid of them, even if it means sacrificing the good of society.

Restricted access to firearms means it is less likely that a criminal will have access to one, desperate ad-hoc solutions such as those described occur as the change is not immediate. No can wave a magic wand and remove the effects of American style gun culture which make criminal ownership of a gun desirable as a status symbol more important to individuals than the actual reliability of such weapons.Shotguns are the weapons of armed robberies which are declining due to increased use of electronic transactions, as such farmhouse robberies for the weapons should decline with that.

Restricted access to firearms does not equate to a criminals access to a firearm. The sheer size of the US allows residents to do nearly anything without Big Brother looking over your should. You think we can monitor so many acres of land to see where illegal guns are being transported in... sold.. etc. Hell, we can't even stop the southern invasion from Mexico, you think we can stop illegal shipment of guns????!!!Which sociologist claims guns as a status symbol has clearly never shot a gun, or has such a stigma against guns they fear looking at it. Seriosly, certain people just like shooting guns. Maybe it's the little demolitionist in us that drive a gun enthusiast to sit perfect still and drop a target (non-human of course) at half mile.Where is the statistics that shows shotguns are the favorite among thieves? I would assume it owuld be a 22-cal handgun. Easy to conceal, and quiet as heck when you want it to be. Shotguns are no fun when you're trying to climb a window.

A common myth. Since there are so many background checks and such, do you think a criminal can just walk into a gun store and buy a gun legally? They get their guns where junkies get their drugs, the black market.This is called gang culture, not American culture. This is how it is with criminals, not your everyday American.Aren't the "farmhouse robberies" in the UK, and not the US? Aren't we talking about the US here? Because I am.

UK just the hard of understanding...emoticonXRolleyes REstrictions on the access to firearms took place in the UK specifically removing handguns from the Legal market and making it harder to obtain other firearms.This has had the effects of a temporary increase in the theft of shotguns from farms which are then used in armed robberies, typically of Post Offices or armoured vans, (Corner shops and petrol stations subjected to armed robbery usually face knives or baseball bats) this crime is on the decrease generally due to the use of plastic. Credit card fraud is the growing crime in that area.City gangs/drug dealers prefer handguns as they are easier to conceal and wield, these have become scarce but following American culture view such weapons as status enhancing. The result is that they often use the BB gun conversions which are prone to misfire.The "black market" aquires its weapons from ostensibly legal sources, thus removing that link has a knock on effect. There aren't black market factories producing Brownings or Smith & Wessons, they ultimately come from a 'legal' source. Burglars usual armament is either a knife or crowbar, never a gun.Just to repeat in case any more yanks want to try the fallacy of "moving the goalposts".UK

Your entire argument can be analogised by this. Criminals are going to get drugs anyway, why not make all drugs legal? The simple answer is that criminalising an item reduces supply of that item.Will introducing gun restrictions decrease gun supply? UndoubtablyWill decreased gun supply result in lower gun ownership? AbsolutelyWill this lower gun ownership be similar in criminals? Yes, but less so.Will increaced enforcement of gun control laws force criminal gun ownership further down? Absolutely.You are also focusing too much on 'criminals'. Every criminal was born an innocent child. As I've stated elsewhere, it is often crimes of passion, or of opportunity (in other words, crimes which are not pre-empted) where guns are used. If the individual in question did not have easy access to a firearm, they may still attack someone, or break into a house through an open window they happen to spot. But the chance of someone getting killed as a result is much less that if the the proto-criminal is armed.I'd rather be attacked by a knife than a handgun.

That would suggest you think the instructors at the Royal Millitary Acadamy Sandhurst have never fired a gun... Guess again.Weapons have always been regarded as status symbols right back to prehistory, we have carvings of axeheads on many of our stone circles, swords were regarded as talismanic, the most famous example being Excalibur, swordsmiths were regarded as having magical powers.Today an officers sword is an mark of office, if he is dishonourably discharged his sword will be broken in front of him. Guns have replaced combat weaponry across most of the planet, leaders such as Saddam Hussein etc. had propaganda pictures of them firing guns.In many parts of the world people fire guns as an act of celebration, eg. at a wedding.In UK gang culture memebers ape US and carribean rap videos featuring performers displaying guns.

Thats quite a generalization, care to cite some sources?I also find it curious that gun control usually has no effect on crime. Funny that Washington DC is ranked number 17 in cities notorious for violent crime, yet it has some of the strictest gun control laws. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_Washington,_D.C. I also find it interesting that the states notorious for gun control are also notorious for crime. I seen and read interviews with criminals, their identity concealed, who were for gun control. Gun control makes criminals lives much easier, because they can keep their guns, while they don't have to deal with armed citizens.I know we are talking about the UK here but I have cited the US for comparison.

And you've failed to prove that Rip is right in his claims.It's not an act. My standpoint is the correct one, you just can't see that from your angle.I'm with you. What you're trying to say is that a criminal's official title actually makes a difference.I've still yet to see any supporting evidence that "gangs" carry guns while "burglars" don't. This is just the statement of one person who isn't even here to defend his position.What I've spotted is that criminals in general DO have guns in the UK, proving that the 1997 nationwide handgun ban proved to be nothing more than an absolute failure. I don't really give much of a damn on what a criminal calls themselves, the fact remains that criminals are armed, citizens (subjects in this case) aren't, and the UK is just downright unsafe.As asked earlier, what about when the armed criminals come looking for you?

And you've failed to prove that Rip is right in his claims.It's not an act. My standpoint is the correct one, you just can't see that from your angle.I'm with you. What you're trying to say is that a criminal's official title actually makes a difference.I've still yet to see any supporting evidence that "gangs" carry guns while "burglars" don't. This is just the statement of one person who isn't even here to defend his position.What I've spotted is that criminals in general DO have guns in the UK, proving that the 1997 nationwide handgun ban proved to be nothing more than an absolute failure. I don't really give much of a damn on what a criminal calls themselves, the fact remains that criminals are armed, citizens (subjects in this case) aren't, and the UK is just downright unsafe.As asked earlier, what about when the armed criminals come looking for you?

Well of course they're gonna say gun-related crime has decreased, they're all about gun control for God sakes. That's like asking McDonald's if fast food is healthy.Your fancy states are fun to look at, but I've actually talked with people unfortunate enough to live in the UK, and their position has consistently been that the UK has become more dangerous than New York or Washington DC.

Sound like you didn't actually read any of it then. Why am I not surprised.You can read can't you?If your friends live in a major population centre then perhaps they've had some bad experiences.I lived there for 34 years and had very few. I never came into contact with anyone with a gun (except a farmer once whilst on his farm).And for those of you who are following this, the fancy 'states' (sic) that OX is trying not to give much heed to include a table that shows that the gun deaths in the USA per 100,000 population (homicide, suicide and other) tend to be 4 or 5 times higher than anywhere else on the planet.No wonder he seems to think that all criminals carry guns and are out to shoot you in the face.Smiley

I live in the UK. The only time I've seen guns in real life was on an army base, unless you count air rifles. The idea that criminals habitually carry guns in the UK is absurd. Yes there are dangerous places in the UK, there was a murder in my nearest town earlier this year (with a knife), which shook people up a bit, but it only takes a minimum of common sense to be perfectly safe - don't hang around the town centre in the early hours of the morning at the weekend. Any criminal carrying a gun is far beyond petty crime like burglary or street robbery - the only ones for whom the risk is worth the reward are those dealing in massive quantities of drugs whose entire life is lived outside the law. To try and conflate petty crime with major drug cartels is utterly preposterous.

I haven't been convinced of anything. The fact that UK police are being issued body armor speaks volumes about the "success" of gun control. I'm still sticking to my position that criminals in the UK do have guns and that they will use them on you. So obviously the UK isn't all that safe now is it?Seriously dude, from from the pages of BBC News. Police have absolutely no need for bulletproof body armor if there aren't armed criminals to deal with. And that fact that 11 police forces have put in orders for body armor just speaks volumes.

We have more than twice the armed households and half the homicides. And even less firearm homicides than they do annually. What the gun control nuts always forget when condemning the USA's homicide rates is how much larger our population is and how many more armed citizens we have than those you're comparing us to. When those numbers are considered, we come out looking much better than they do statistically speaking.

Ah, Archangel, if only you understood basic maths.Let's take two countries, A and B. A has a population of 100,000 and B has a population of 200,000. To make up some more figures, lets say 5 people were killed in A last year and 20 were killed in B. So, you want to combine the two.Country/Total Homicide (per 100,000)A------/5 (5 killed of 100,000, so 5 per 100,000)B------/10 (20 killed of 200,000, so 10 per 100,000)Correct version:A&B---/8.3 (25 killed of 300,000, so 8.3 per 100,000) NOT Archangel's version:A&B---/15 (Look, I added up the figures! That's right, isn't it...?)To combine A and B you need to take a weighted average of the two values, as the values are fractions per population value, NOT pure figures. Were you to do this correctly, England would have had a much more significant weight than Northern Ireland (which you had to include to drag down the UK figures), so the value remains much less than the States.To clarify, this is NOT nit-picking and choosing my standards of judging. It's correcting a fatal flaw in your maths.

Typical obfuscation of the facts. The graph listed the Countries separately, so combining them to equal GBs combined numbers is correct. In other words, 10.36 homicides for GBs combined population is precisely what those combined numbers show.

Sorry Archie, you cannot take a proportion of one country and a proportion of another country and then add the two together to get the proportion of the whole.Let's make it really simple.If country A had 50,000 per 100,000 and country B had 50,000 per 100,000 then you would be wrong to say that the two added together would make 100,000 per 100,000.The correct figures for UK should have been 3.25 (Total), 1.85 (Firearm), 1.4 (non-gun). And while we're on the subject of your mistakes, you included the figures for the Republic of Ireland (not part of the UK) in your incorrect answer.Don't worry Archie, it's basic mathematics.

No, it doesn't. You have combined the numbers incorrectly. Northern Ireland has a population of approx 1.5 million, Scotland 5 million, Wales 3 million and England 50 million. If you weight the numbers correctly:Total deaths Gun deaths Non-gun deathsWhole of UK: 1.62 0.26 1.35That is the actual figure. What you seem to have failed to understand is that per 100,000 is a figure that is comparable between two groups but that to combine figures you need to use absolute values, it's like when you add fractions and you have to use a common denominator before you add the numerators otherwise you're stuck.And that's before we get into the fact that the Northern Ireland figures are hopelessly skewed by the (then still ongoing) paramilitary activities in the province, funded largely by Irish Americans.

Because each Country's stats per 100,000 are in accordance with their own population numbers, then by adding up the numbers in each category and totalling them as Great Britains total per 100,000 is totally accurate. Or as accurate as the numbers given in the graph is anyway. And if you have a problem with them, then talk to iangb cuz he posted the link to show that the USA has a much higher murder rate than England.What he forgot to take into account is that England Wales isn't the whole of GB. You must include Scotland, N. Ireland and Ireland to get an accurate tally to compare with the stats for the USA. And as the numbers show, GB has less guns in homes but more gun homicides per 100,000 than the USA does. Here are the numbers below again, and here is the link again, do some math yourself and stop beating a dead horse and making excuses for the obvious. http://www.guncite.com/gun_control_gcgvinco.html

No, it doesn't. You have combined the numbers incorrectly. Northern Ireland has a population of approx 1.5 million, Scotland 5 million, Wales 3 million and England 50 million. If you weight the numbers correctly:Total deaths Gun deaths Non-gun deathsWhole of UK: 1.62 0.26 1.35That is the actual figure. What you seem to have failed to understand is that per 100,000 is a figure that is comparable between two groups but that to combine figures you need to use absolute values, it's like when you add fractions and you have to use a common denominator before you add the numerators otherwise you're stuck.And that's before we get into the fact that the Northern Ireland figures are hopelessly skewed by the (then still ongoing) paramilitary activities in the province, funded largely by Irish Americans.

Ok, I'll do this step by step:In England and Wales the figures are 1.41 deaths per hundred thousand, for a population of around 50 million. Multiplying up this equates to 705 actual deaths (with me so far?).Do the same for Scotland we get 2.24 in a population of 5 million gives 112 deaths.And again for Northern Ireland we get 6.09 in a population of 1.5 million, for a total of 91.Add THESE figures together we get a total number of deaths for the whole of the UK, giving 908 deaths from a population of 57.5 million, which equates to a rate of 1.57 (if you're wondering why this figure is slightly different from the ealier one it is because I used approximate populations rather than the figures given, in order to clarify the calculation). The method you suggest is similar to saying I got 20% on one exam, and 30% on the second exam so I got 50% overall. You simply can't stack proportions in the way you suggest.

Now Jo, you are making a mistake. It's called "trying to educate people who don't want to learn". AA, S&P, OX, etc. have got a preconcieved conclusion and will ignore facts or claim they actually support their preconcieved conclusion to advance their political/religious aims, in this case they don't want to put their toys and status symbols away as they associate them with their manhood whether they admit this or not.I'm sure theres some logical fallacy that sums this up.They calim that they need guns for defence, yet between them not one appears to have used a gun in that role in a combined period of ownership in excess of a century. They also make reference to shooting at targets "half a mile away" self defence at half a mile? The fact is if you aren't military oror a farmer a gun is a toy and used in a recreational manner.

First of all, Is Ireland no longer a part of the UK now? Why did you leave their numbers off? And since all of the stats on the graph are based on the number of victims per 100,000 of each countries respective population, why does the fact that one Country has 2.24 homicides per 100K and another has 6.09 per 100K change the result that combined, those two populations have a combined homicide rate of 8.33 per 100,000 based on their total populations? The combined population of 6,774,111 based on those two countries populations is still an accurate number based on the graph that iangb posted. And the numbers per capita are accurate and still higher than the USA when compared to our population of what was 272 million at the time the stats were recorded. The fact remains that according to iangb's link, the USA had a homicide rate of 5.70 per 100,000 and Great Britain, based on the same criteria had a homicide rate of 10.36 per 100,000. So to summarize, take same numbers iangbs link gives for the numbers per 100,000 based on America's population of 272 million and you'll come up with the number of homicides we had that year of 1999. So apples to apples, the math stands.

First Ireland (strictly the Republic of Ireland) has not been part of the UK since the 1920s. Secondly, if we do as you suggest and calculate the number of homicides in the US in 1999, we get 15,504. Now the population of the US is 5 times the population of the UK (near enough), so the comparable figure would be 3000 homicides in comparison with 900 in the UK. This is consistent with the rate of homicide death for the whole of the UK which I have calculated.I'm not trying to be insulting but have you had any education in mathematics?

Let's use your exact example. Country A has 2.24 homicides per 100K. Country B has 6.09 homicides per 100K. Assuming that A and B are the same size (not the case in the main example, but meh...) the combined homicide rate is 8.33 PER 200,000 or 4.165 per 100,000. It's basic mathematics!Let's go hypothetical again. Country C and Country D are equal in size, and for some unknown reason both have a homicide rate of 75,000 per 100,000. Particularly dangerous, you may think. However, by your logic, the combined homicide rate of C and D is 150,000 per 100,000. This is blatantly impossible. Instead, the combined rate of C and D remains at 75,000 per 100,000.Finally, in a vague hope at getting this into your skull, let's look at population division. Country X has a population of 800,000, and homicide rates of 10 deaths per 100,000 - so total homicides in X are 80. If I take a small (and representative*) sample of X, the homicide rate for that smaller sample will still be 10 per 100,000 - the most obvious example is if I take a sample that is 1/8 the size of X, I will get a population of 100,000 with 10 homicides. With me so far?Let's say that I split X into two equal parts, Y and Z. (Assuming Y and Z are representative*) Y and Z will both still have homicide rates of 10 per 100,000 - they will both be 400,000 in population and have 40 deaths each. When you recombine Y and Z to make X, the homicide rate stays at 10 per 100,000. If it did not, you could mess up any analysis simply by splitting up a country and then recombining it, over and over.And no, Ireland is not a part of the UK. This is why 'Northern Ireland' and 'Ireland' are listed separately.*If Y and Z are unrepresentative it still works as long as Y and Z make up the entirety of X, but I don't want to go into that because I suspect that it will confuse you.

Let's put this another way to see if we can convince you.Here's the table - tidied up a bit.Following your logic, if you live in Scoltand you are around 2.5 times less likely to be murdered than if you live in the USA (5.70/2.24 = 2.5445).If you live in England/Wales you are more than 4 times less likely to be murdered than if you live in the USA (5.70/1.41 = 4.04).If you live in N.Ireland you are slightly more likely to be murdered than if you live in te USA (6.09/5.70 = 1.068).However, if you live in one of the above (without specifying) then you are 70% more likely to be murdered than if you live in the USA (9.74/5.70 =1.708).So the risk of living in "one of the above countries" is far greater than living "a specified one of the above countries".Look at it another way.If you live in Scotland your chances of being murdered are 2.24 out of 100,000. However, if you live in one of the other countries listed then your chances of being murdered are 13.82 out of 100,000 (5.70+6.09+1.41+0.62=13.82). That's more than 6 times more likely. With those stats you'd never venture out of Scotland.And if you added in the likelyhood of being murdered in one of the other many countries of the world . . . . . .

So what? The non-homicide crime rates are on the sharp increase, and it's because the honest people are unarmed and the criminals aren't. Criminals are free to break into anybody's house, at any time, even in broad daylight, and take what they want, because they can hold the homeowner at gunpoint, and the homeowner can't do anything.

Are you going to admit that you were wrong, Archangel? Or can we just take you changing the subject as an imlicit admission?And the home office page you link to shows a graph of burglary only (burglars do not carry guns in the UK, as a rule), and is dated October 2004, the copyright information is irrelevant. Burglaries have fallen considerably in the UK in recent years (around in the last decade, http://www.crimestatistics.org.uk/output/Page55.asp ). I'm not sure why US crime figures should be any more reliable than UK ones, particularly when the US has 51 separate jurisdictions, compared to 3 in the UK, and the US has a much bigger problem of ghettoisation in cities which is likely to lead to the underreporting of crime.As for using a blog as a source... emoticonXClown

Also, this might explain why British stats are so skewed in favor of the UK appearing safer than the USA, but it's all an illusion since they don't count so many crimes in the statistics.Here:http://wheelgun.blogspot.com/2007/08...-of-crime.htmland here: http://wheelgun.blogspot.com/2007/01...ime-in-us.htmlCrime in the UK versus Crime in the USThere is a discussion going on about gun control and the right to defend yourself over at A Tangled Web. Since my figures on crime in the UK versus crime in the US are couple of years old, I thought I would take a look at the currently available statistics.The public misconception is that the UK is a safe country and the US violent, but the truth is just the opposite. Depending on which numbers you choose, the violent crime rate in the UK is five times higher than the rate in the US.

Plenty of people use guns for self defense, and the millions of people that do would be dead right now if you had your way. The fact that you twist facts and throw around insults shows how desperate you are and your disconnection from reality. We have provided multiple sources that have shown that gun control does not reduce crime, and all you have put forth is questionable numbers and insults.Where the hell did we say this? Furthermore, anyone who calls a gun a "toy" obviously doesn't have the adequate knowledge to participate in a gun debate.

Now Jo, you are making a mistake. It's called "trying to educate people who don't want to learn". AA, S&P, OX, etc. have got a preconcieved conclusion and will ignore facts or claim they actually support their preconcieved conclusion to advance their political/religious aims, in this case they don't want to put their toys and status symbols away as they associate them with their manhood whether they admit this or not.I'm sure theres some logical fallacy that sums this up.They calim that they need guns for defence, yet between them not one appears to have used a gun in that role in a combined period of ownership in excess of a century. They also make reference to shooting at targets "half a mile away" self defence at half a mile? The fact is if you aren't military oror a farmer a gun is a toy and used in a recreational manner.

Interesting how California has some of the strictest gun control laws, yet it has higher homicide than most of the states, yet Vermont has very lax gun laws, yet it has only 2 murders per 10,000.

Damn right you can't change the facts, and here they are!Read 'em an' weep sucker!1997/8England and Wales 738 deaths recorded as homicide. (59 victims shot, 39 with a handgun, 12 with a long barrel shotgun, 4 with a sawn off shotgun, 3 with a rifle and 1 unknown)Scotland 88 deaths recorded as homicide.Northern Ireland 40 deaths recorded as homicide.USA 10369 murders were commited using a firearm, 1963 murders commited with a sharp instrument.Murder Per 10,000 inhabitants in 1997Alabama 10Alaska 9Arizona 8Arkansas 10California 8Colorado 4Conneticut 4Delaware 3DC 57Florida 7Georgia 8Hawaii 4Idaho 3Illinois 9Indiana 7Iowa 2Kansas 6Kentucky 6Louisiana 16Maine 2Maryland 10Massachusetts 2Michigan 8Minnisota 3Missippi 13Missouri 8Montana 5Nebraska 3Nevada 11New Hampshire 1New Jersey 4New Mexico 8New York 6North Carolina 8North Dakota 1Ohio 5Oklahoma 7Oregan 3Pennsylvannia 6Rhode Island 3South Carolina 8South Dakota 1Tennesee 10Texas 7Utah 2Vermont 2Virginia 7Washington State 4West Virginia 4Wisconsin 4Wyoming 4http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib...9/rp99-056.pdf

Let's have some fun and use this table to try and further convince Archie that his mathematical methods leave something to be desired.If we add up all the figures in this table we get 351 murders (hope that's right - did it in my head) per 100,000 people. That's around 250 times higher than the figures for England/Wales (1.41). How can you stand to live in such a wartorn country? And OX thinks it's safer.So now let's come back to reality and average that 351 out over the 51 murder rates given.351/51 = 6.88Do you see how 6.88 per 1000,000 is much closer to reality than the 351 per 100,000 that Archie would have got?Come on Archie, just admit that you got the maths wrong. Are you too proud to admit your error? Pride is one of the deadly sins you know.Archie if you can be man enough to admit that you made a mistake, then I'll be man enough to admit that miracles do happen.Deal?Smiley

Equally interesting that the capital city of Vermont (Montpellier) has a population density of 784 per square mile and Vermont has a total p.d. of 65.8/sq.mil, whereas California has a p.d. of 233.8/sq.mil and four major cities with p.d.'s of 8,205 (LA), 3,871.5 (San Diego), 5216.3 (San Jose) and 16,380 (San Fransisco).It's also interesting to note that although there is a difference between the laws of the US states regarding gun control, there is very little to differentiate between states (with the exception of DC, which is excusable because of it's unique status amongst the US states). The minutae of legality is largely irrelevant unless there is a large difference between populations.Uh, several sources I've quoted at you disagree. Gun defence is rarely used - true on it's own, but especially in comparison with the number of illegal uses of guns. Do I really have to go and find my PubMed sources again?I would guess the .50 caliber debate, although I haven't really looked at it...As soon as I call Canada part of the USA, you can use this as a valid excuse.If you google image search 'britain' or 'great britain' or look at google maps, the difference is obvious.

So, that's 14,000 knife victims for a population of just over 60,000,000. To stick with recent methods of reporting that would be just over 23 knife attacks per 100,000 people (23.333).What would a knife attack equate to in the USA? Probably something like Aggravated Assault. Would that be fair?If we look at a table of crime statistics in the USA, Aggravated Assault figures for 2006 are 862,947 for a population of around 300,000,000 (or 287.6 per 100,000).Ooh! That's over 12 times higher. Hope you've got good medical insurance.I can play this game as long as you like.Smiley

38 stabbings per day for a year (note that not all of these will be deliberate, some will be accidental/self-inflicted) is 13,870 per year. The USA gets 14,860 homicides per year - approximately 41 per day.The US also experienced 1,390,695 cases of 'violent crime' (which has yet to be defined) and 862,947 cases of 'aggravated assault', of which 136,496 were from a knife. 14,000 knife wounds per year is nothing.To make it fairer to work out differences...UK. 14000 wounds per year, population ~60,000,000 = 23.3 wounds per 100,000USA. 126,496 wounds per year, population ~301,000,000 = 42.0 wounds per 100,000Yup, pretty safe.

The US and the UK are completely different areas with cultural differences, population differences, and social differences.However, when gun control was enacted in Washington DC, crime did not go down at all. Its also strange that many states notorious for gun control (California, New York) are also notorious for crime. However states like Vermont and South Carolina have lax gun laws yet much less crime than California or NY.

See the 'knife attacks' portion of MY SAME POST. That's not including attacks, either.Oh, absolutely. The fact that the UK is far safer is really only a minor piece of evidence in this argument, although it is evidence. However, if you look through this thread you will see that the pro-gun side keep trying to indicate that the UK is more dangerous. That is why we keep responding... For example (all taken from this thread)"However, my main point still stands. Gun control didn't work out too great in the UK" - SnP"Your fancy states are fun to look at, but I've actually talked with people unfortunate enough to live in the UK, and their position has consistently been that the UK has become more dangerous than New York or Washington DC." - OmegamonX"you will see that Great Britain's murder rate numbers are much higher than the USAs. [bad maths]" - ArchangelBecause they didn't enforce it enough? Remember, I've shown that enforcement leads to reduced crime.The problem is that DC is unique among the other states in that it is a single city with a population density of ~9,000. That's really quite hard a place to enforce laws in.Did you even read my reply to your exact same argument a few posts back?

There's also evidence that bigfoot exists, but that doesn't amount to much.Dude, lemme try and make things understandable for you. In the places like California and New York and DC, where gun control is absolutely tight and crime is high regardless, the laws aren't going unenforced. To even get a gun, you need to get permission from the police to become a gun owner. The application process is very difficult, and it's not at all uncommon for it to be stretched out to over three years, just to find out you've been denied and need to start all over again.Nobody in these places legally owns a gun without the police having full say it in. You can't buy a gun from anywhere in these states without the full written authority of the police, and then you have to register the with them as well.Of course for the people in DC the laws are much worse. The ownership of handguns wasn't exactly banned per se, it was just that you couldn't own an unregistered handgun, and the registration program for handguns was terminated in 1977.The "lack of enforcement" excuse doesn't fly in this case. Lack of enforcement is why criminals keep getting out two years into a ten year sentence. Lack of enforcement isn't the reason that criminals are running around with guns and using them in an illegal manner.The population of Washington DC is about 570,000. New York City on the other hand, has a population size around 8,000,000. So don't tell me that Washington DC is so damn hard to police and enforce the laws in, it really ain't that big or that crowded.

I'll take this as an admittance that twice now (the first time was 'me-too'-ing when Archie gave his dire maths), you've tried to prove that the UK is more dangerous, and failed both times - in fact, both pieces of evidence show the opposite of what you claim. That's a bit more... substantial than Bigfoot.Feel free to believe that the UK is more dangerous. Until you can actually give evidence that this is the case, however, everyone else remains free to justifiably believe that you are entirely incorrect.You miss my point entirely. I'm not saying that people in DC are still selling legal guns despite the ban, I'm saying that there is insufficient activity to remove handguns from those who already illegally possess them. My link shows that when such enforcement is put into effect, there are 'significant' results.You've made exactly the same mistake as your last source, in that you rely on 'big numbers' without actually looking at a relative comparason.DC has a population density of ~9000 people per square mile, as stated above. From Ripskar's data (above) there were 57 murders per 10,000 people, or (to standardise) 5.7 murders per 100,000 people.New York City has a population density of 27,147 people per square mile. However, the FBI database (via Wikipedia) tells me that there were 7.3 murders per 100,000 people. Compare that with the 5.7 in DC and you've quite nicely proved my point.EDIT: Further investigation reveals a typo in ripskars data - the homicide rate is per 100,000, not per 10,000 - making the homicide rate in DC much larger. The data is 10 years old - more recent data from wikipedia give a rate of 35.7 per 100,000. Obviously this is still much larger than the more densely populated New York - feel free to disregard the 'smalled' text (this forum doesn't support strikethrough, alas) - I only left it there because it contains useful links.Instead, my reply would be that it is interesting to note that NY's crime has fallen massively in recent years - murder rate was ~4 times larger in 1990, as was violent crime (and the city's population was smaller by ~1/8th). While this still doesn't quite make it comparable with DC, a crime drop of this magnitude is interesting nonetheless. The drop is "attributed by criminologists to [changed police tactics], the end of the crack epidemic and demographic changes" (wikipedia). The much slower rate of crime reduction in DC is merely attributed to 'gentrification' - essentially demographic changes. Doesn't this imply that the police in DC haven't been doing as much as the police in NY?

Yeah I guess you're right, those pesky things like constitutional rights really get in the way of enforcing the laws on the books. The Fourth Amendment really gets in the way of the police being able to carry out a warrantless raid on somebody's home to ensure that they don't have illegal guns anywhere. Maybe we should be more like Britain and have far less obstacles that would get in the way of official police business.Your point is flawed because you changed the number of DC murders to something much lower simply for the sake of argument. It doesn't work that way. DC has hundreds of firearm-related deaths each year, so considering their low population levels the rate would have to be 57 murders per 100,000 people.

Do you, or do you not admit that your mathematical analysis of the data in that table of crime figures within the UK was incorrect?Or is your pride getting in the way of you admitting the truth?You go no about the truth ad nausium, but when it comes down to it . . . nothing.Smiley

So...you're perfectly alright with there being violent crime so long as people aren't being killed?

Let it be noted that the British guy has answered yes, that they'll be perfectly willing to put up with all instances of violent crime against themselves and others so long as nobody is getting killed as a direct result of the criminals having all the power in this equation.

You said you're alright with criminals having imitation guns, which most people aren't going to be able to tell is a phony, so they can continue using the threat of harm to rob people and avoid confrontation from potential victims. That's support for violent crime.Such a statement is faulty because there are so many variable to factor in. But long story short, I'm content to continue living in America, because I know that if I need to then I can defend myself, against man or beast. You can argue that in the UK you don't need to defend yourself so it's safer, but that doesn't change the fact that you really can't defend yourself.

Sorry, to properly parody your question I'm not allowed to be specific until I see what you've answered.But just so you know, something that counts as 'violent crime' does not count as 'homicide', if you are talking about 'a decline in homicide at the cost of a rise in violent crime'.Not so. I have a hockey stick, and (more importantly) a window that leads to the outside world... that's all I need.Uh, he said 'alright' where the alternative was that they carry real guns. I'm still struggling to see how you consider this to be a bad thing.Would you rather you were robbed by criminals using an imitation gun, or a real gun?

I've read your laws regarding the use of force. I hate to tell you this but the criminals have more rights than you do. You might be able to knock them down, but you can't hurt them or they can turn right around and sue you for something like the use of excessive force and causing serious bodily harm.Well if I'm unable to tell the difference between a real gun and an imitation gun, it doesn't really make much of a difference now does it?Unless you notice something that isn't right, like the muzzle being extremely small and not likely capable of firing a real bullet, the question of "Is that gun real or is it fake?" isn't going to be something going through your mind. All you're gonna see is a bad guy with a gun.

Why would I want to harm them more than to knock them down? I'm not for lynch mob mentality ('justice' at the personal level), remember?If you get robbed and no-one is harmed, how is it a 'violent' crime?If you get robbed and someone is harmed, this is more likely to be the case with a gun involved. Undeniably so.

Maybe because for all intended purposes the person who crawled in through the window is intent on causing you bodily harm? Or maybe because you're human and when the fight or flight response is triggered and set to fight you wind up treating the situation as life-threatening and want to make sure that you don't get hurt?A problem with simply knocking down an attacker is that they can just as easily get back up again. If you can only shove them to the ground then that might make them mad and then they really would kill you. If you can disable them, like causing them a great amount of pain or breaking their kneecap, then they're not going to want to do anything except lay on the ground or try and get away.Alright lemme see if I can explain this to you. I've done a lot of studying on the laws regarding self-defense and protecting yourself. As the law currently is, if you introduce the use of a weapon of any kid, be it a knife or a gun or a hammer or a broken broom stick, that becomes assault with a deadly weapon and it's considered a violent crime even if nothing violent happened, because the violence and threat of harm was implied by producing the item in question.I don't know how it is over there, but violence can simply be implied and the crime gets considered as a violent crime.

...if I broke their kneecap, or they broke their kneecap falling over, would they really have grounds to (successfully) sue me if I claimed that it was in a fight in which I was not the aggressor? That's quite different to finding criminals with gunshot wounds in their backs...But a replica gun /isn't/ a 'deadly weapon' no matter how you skew it, so the crime just becomes intimidation, surely? It's not the threat, it's the 'deadly' bit which makes it a 'violent assault'.

There's currently a case over here where a criminal fell through the roof of a homeowner, who ordered him to get out, he resisted and was subsequently shot by the homeowner. He then sued the homeowner for use of excessive force and the case was allowed to go to trial even though the plaintiff had to admit his guilt to the crime.Here's another issue with your "reasonable force" ideas. Let's say you do have an attacker inside your home or apartment and you do knock them down. Let's say that for the sake of the argument they fall like an idiot and wind up hurting themself because they didn't know how to land properly. Now they have grounds to charge you with excessive force because they got hurt on your property and you were involved.What you guys deserve to have over there is what we're slowly getting over here one state at a time; the castle doctrine. This law states, amongst other things, that a criminal can't file charges against you if they were hurt in the commission of a crime. It also says that you're allowed to use whatever amount of force is necessary if you feel that you're in danger of bodily harm or death.Not over here. So many police have faced mocked-up BB guns that laws have been passed that state using a fake gun in the commission of a crime will be treated the same as if the gun was real, and personally I think this is a good idea.When a criminally-inclined individual produces a weapon of any sort, that shows that they aren't reasonable, that shows that they're fully intent on causing violence against you.

That's not quite the same as successfully suing someone - that would be if the court case won. That is what i doubt would happen.Again, I doubt very much that this would succeed in court. Besides, what's to stop the criminal hitting his head on a wall and ten claiming you did it? What's to stop them doing that if you happen to meet in a quiet alleyway?Doesn't this (as you've worded it) allow paranoid schizophrenics to run rampage? Doesn't it also give give unjust power to the homeowner - who can (yes, I'm using it a lot recently) assume a lynch mob mentality, do whatever he likes to the trespasser and then claim it was justified?I thought this was 'treated by the police at the time', not 'treated by the law after the facts are known'. It justified police shooting kids with BB guns who may have been carrying a deadly weapon - something I'm uncertain about but which is probably just about justifiable.If someone produces a fake gun it doesn't prove that they're intent on causing violence. It proves they're intent on intimidating you.

Maybe, but the fact that a criminal can admit their guilt and sue the innocent party that injured them is just insane. In a way they're waving their fifth amendment rights in trying to sue somebody, because to do such they need to incriminate themselves as having been involved in a crime in order to have a leg to stand on.Good question, what is stopping them right now?Anybody can claim it if they want, but the police are still going to investigate the incident to see if you're telling the truth. If they have evidence that supports your claim then the law specifies that an overzealous District Attorney can't recommend that you face criminal charges anyway. But if the evidence is to the contrary, the castle doctrine isn't gonna help you one bit.Well because police training is responsible for them treating the sight of a realistic-looking fake weapon as a real weapon, and so much public outcry over criminal youth being shot when they weren't lethally armed, these laws are being passed.Maybe over there, not over here though.

It doesn't matter that they waive their rights. Anyone who chooses not to buy a gun is doing this.And it's important that criminals can still recieve equal protection from the law regarding crimes commited upon them. If a criminal broke into a house, was beaten and raped and then let go, would you say that the homeowner should not be punished?The fact that they would be laughed out of court and not receive anything for it?It's the same reason that most burglars who are caught will not sue the homeowner - only if they think they will benefit from it. This is pretty much never the case, unless it is justified.It's your house. I'm fairly sure you could make up a story that isn't on line with the truth.That's my point. The law is to protect the police at the time of the incident, not to prosecute an individual after the fact.I'm not talking about legally, I'm talking about in reality. Someone with a fake gun doesn't have intent to cause violence, because he doesn't have the means to cause violence.

There's a difference in this instance. The fifth amendment is there so you don't have to incriminate yourself as having done something wrong.Alright, that's kind of funny in a way. That'd definitely show some forethought and planning ahead of time.Police still have the authority to search and gather evidence. If you get in the way they charge you with obstructing justice. If you lie you're charged with that too.The point is, use of a fake weapon will still result in real charges. At least over here it will.Excuse me? What'd you say? Somebody without a weapon doesn't have the means to actually cause violence? You're saying that an unarmed man can't have intent to cause violence since he's unarmed? That's positively crazy and plain nonsense.Just because you're unarmed doesn't mean that you have no intent or means to harm someone. You can face charges for beating somebody to a bloody pulp with your bare hands.

I'm aware what the fifth amendment states. But it's just as possible to choose to waive that right as any other, such as the 2nd.Huh? I missed what you're saying entirely, sorry. Are you saying the criminal would plan to be raped? Or the homeowner planned to rape the criminal?You mean, 'caught' lying. I'm not suggesting, I'm just saying that it's a plausible outcome.This may be - I'm afraid I'm going to ask for a source that say that producing a replica gun results in charging with attempt to cause violence, however, because the law doesn't make sense to me (see below).But the fact that he suddenly produces a fake gun doesn't suddenly mean that he has the intent to cause violence, is my point. The fake gun is moot. However, if the gun was real, then it would be much more serious...
