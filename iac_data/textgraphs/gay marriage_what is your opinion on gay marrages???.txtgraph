perhaps you should have spelt marriage correctly?? You can cut the XXXX anytime...Since you refuse to be more specific I will just write what I feel.My opinion on gay "marrage" is that it is a union that is illegal in most parts of the United States. It normally means two people of the same sex trying to join in a union similiar to a traditional marriage of a man and a woman.

My take is quite simple, really. Marriage is a lifelong bond between a man and a woman for the following reasons:A) Completion-Not to say that there are no complete singles out there, but the old addage is true. opposites attract.B) A Help-Mate-To aid each other in the building of their lives togetherC) Procreation and rearing of children-Not attempting to put down childless couples (Whether by choice or circumstance).

I'll assume you mean "would I like it to be legal" or "would I vote for it to be legal"....oddly enough I have to decide this in a few months.Either way...no to both of those.
attacks

Not only should it made legal but if it is not made legal then all marriages should be ended. Either all people should be allowed to marry the person of their choice or no one should be allowed to marry.Also no one should be allowed to vote on wether or not someone should be allowed to marry.

Throughout history, even ion remote times, marriage has always been a union between a man and a woman. As the millenia rolled on it was found that marriage was a solid bedrock upon which society was founded. The union produced children who in turn built upon that foundation. These unions were sanctified by whatever religion was in force at the time. If one ignores the screams and squeaks from the so-called intelligensia who are themselves a tiny minority in the world at large then this basis continues. Even if one does not ignore the squeaks etc, then they are only from a tiny majority against a vastly silent majority who feel the idea of marriage is right.If two people of the same sex wish to cohabit and live together, then I have no problem with them creating a civil contract which sorts out their rights vis-a-vis themselves. I have no problem with them if they wish to celebrate such a contract privately.It is not a marriage and should not be recognised as such.

The family is the core unit of society.Any thing which undermines the family undermines the society.It doesent matter what kind of family you have, anything that hurts it, hurts us all.Not letting gay couples marry hurts our society.Once again the religious undermine our society so they can have the luxury of compliance with their most cherished beliefs.

Gays are producing members of society just like straights are.We pay taxes.We have kids. Raise families.There is no legitimate reason why gay tax dollars should have to pay for straight marriage benefits and rights, while being excluded from those benefits and rights ourselves.The only major difference between our relationships is the gender of the people we love.Denying a relationship based on the gender of its participants is gender discrimination. And as such, subject to strict standards before it can be legitimate in the eyes of the law.

Totally agree all the homosexual people that I know are just that.Not any question of impressing mnyself.Marriage was set up in the dim and distant path as a union between man woman for a variety of good reasons. In my opinion that is the way it should stay.If homosexual people wish to live together as far as I am concerned that is fine. With a good contract etc they can ensure that the legal rights available to married heterosexual couples can be available for them.Nevertheless, marriage is a union between a man and a woman. IMO there it should remain.

What "good reasons" exist for denying gay people the right of marriage?Oh goody!For a second there I didn't think I was going to get your permission for that...No. We can't.We can make up a "good contract" to get ourselves many of the rights and benefits associated with marriage, but a good chunk of them are denied.What contract can I write up that forces insurance companies to provide coverage for both myself and my partner under the same plan?What contract can I write up that forces hospitals to acknowledge visitation and "next of kin" rights for myself and my partner?What contract can I write up that forces the state to acknowledge that my partner is a legitimate parent in the untimely event of my death, when the state explicitly forbids my partner from being recognized as a legitimate parent?And do you realize that a good chunk of the "gay marriage legislations" that states are writing up are making it EVEN EASIER for these contracts that we can write to be ignored and disregarded?Yeah.And a woman's place belongs in the kitchen.< end sarcasm >Hopefully you have more than just your opinion and your religion for why gays should be discriminated against.

This is not based in fact. First, outside the West, polygamy has always been at least as common as monogamy. On what basis do you claim that that marriage is the "bedrock" of society? Marriage has historically been the basis of extending and joining families. Procreation was not primarilty its purpose. When the idea of the marriage contract came along, it was an issue of property. The imposition of religion came along late in the game, several hundred years ago.In any event, say that everything you say is true, none of this speaks the fact that if marriage is a good thing for society, why can it not also be a good thing for the gay members of that society?Intelligentsia? Where'd you get that? Anyway, it is a tenet of democracy that the majority cannot exclude rights of a minority. (The "tyrranny of the majority")You simply cannot privately achieve all the rights and benefits of marriage by a civil contract. Even when done, they are often challenged by "real" family members. It costs a lot, too.You say it is not a valid marriage, so therefore it isn't? It isn't a legal marriage, so it shouldn't be permitted to be legal?

Substance A has more effect at fighting the fire than Substance B.Whereupon you insist that we fight the fire with JUST Substance B...Makes no sense...I wasn't saying that.That wasn't the point of my analogy.If you have any real questions about what I was saying, then please go back and re-read and ask them.Jesus understood SOME SPECIFIC REASONS for divorce, but forbade marriage after the divorce.And quite frankly, I think your "churches" should figure that out before we try to hand things back to JUST them and pretend that is a better solution...What holes?What "holes" does it supposedly have?In other words, churches ARE NOT doing the RIGHT job that you think they should...But we should hand it back to churches that are CURRENTLY DOING IT WRONG, and then expect them to do better...emoticonXDonno Am I missing the point where you are actually showing why churches WOULD DO a better job?Or is it more that you JUST WANT churches to have sole custody of the marriage issue, and that you ALSO WANT them to do a better job.Not that they ARE or WOULD do a better job, but rather that you WANT THEM to do a better job...

They have a few options.1) Sit around and wish for a better situation. Wish really hard...2) Get married. They HAVE that option, unlike gay couples which do not.3) Fight for legislation which would give them the specific benefits they don't.Your response is inane.It's like having a "whites only" drinking fountain, and then trying to compare a black man who CANNOT drink from that fountain to a white man who would like a drink, but doesn't want to drink from THAT fountain...Could you imagine that ACTUALLY taking place?Archie Bunker: "Oh geez. I am really thirsty, and that drinking fountain water looks good."George Jefferson: "I'm thirsty too, but I am legally restricted from drinking from that fountain. It's against the law."Archie Bunker: "I'm allowed to drink here, and I want the water, but I don't want to drink from THAT drinking fountain. My predicament is so awful. Why won't somebody give me water that doesn't come from THAT fountain?I guess we're in the same boat, eh?"To try and compare the two is mind-boggling!

Returning to this.Are you really proposing that friends and roommates receive marriage benefits? Gay marriage "lessens the sanctity" of marriage, but best-buds nuptials do not?

yeah I know.I'm saying that there should be a better system. For example, if you had a best friend who you are roommates with...both hetero for the sake of argument...and never wish to get married then could they get some of the benefits you described? My Uncle actually was single until he died but he had a female friend who he was best friends with...why couldn't they get some kind of benefits if they so choose? Hospital vistiation rights and things of that nature are obviously the most important in this kinda situation.It just seems the single folks are the ones getting screwed over in the marriage deal :)

Why not? If that's what they want to do, why should they be discriminated against? You say you want equality, so why shouldn't EVERYONE get marriage benefits? Whether or not they tie the knot shouldn't matter, right? I think Steeeeve's point is that gay marriage opens a huge can of worms in society because it means marriage is no longer clearly defined--anyone that comes along wanting marriage benefits might as well have them if we're going to make the line transparent or make it able to be moved. This is why a lot of people view marriage as, by the nature of the institution, an opposite-sex thing. Gay marriage redefines marriage.

This line of reasoning is inane.It's like having a "whites only" drinking fountain, and then trying to compare a black man who CANNOT drink from that fountain to a white man who would like a drink, but doesn't want to drink from THAT fountain...Could you imagine that ACTUALLY taking place?Archie Bunker: "Oh geez. I am really thirsty, and that drinking fountain water looks good."George Jefferson: "I'm thirsty too, but I am legally restricted from drinking from that fountain. It's against the law."Archie Bunker: "I'm allowed to drink here, and I want the water, but I don't want to drink from THAT drinking fountain. My predicament is so awful. Why won't somebody give me water that doesn't come from THAT fountain?I guess we're in the same boat, eh?"Of COURSE it matters. That's an issue of wanting to have your cake and eat it too.All you have to do to get this right is to APPLY FOR A MARRIAGE LICENSE.You apply and get the marriage license, you get the benefits.Your argument is like insisting that people should be able to get the marriage benefits even if they don't want to get the marriage license.It's like saying that people should be able to drink water when they don't want to open their mouth.They should be able to own a gun without actually having one.It's mind-boggling!The line is not transparent.A legitimate state interest is required for discrimination.That isn't "transparent".Those groups that have a legitimate state interest against them, lose out.Those that don't have such an interest, can get married.So far, I have presented arguments showing that gay marriage is the only group that doesn't have a legitimate state interest against them, but is prohibited from marrying.And on another level, your approach is inane.All you're protecting is the NAME of marriage. That's it.That's all your protecting.The BENEFITS you want to make available under a modern day "separate but equal" approach, which was last tried on the blacks.But the NAME ITSELF you want to preserve for whites.I mean heterosexual couples...Including interracial marriage "redefined" marriage. That's a fact, no matter how hard you want to deny it.A lot of people viewed marriage as, by the nature of the institution, requiring two people of opposite genders and the same race.There is no requirement of marriage (that has a legitimate state interest) that homosexual couples cannot meet.There is no other group that I have seen anybody else name that is denied marriage but also doesn't have a legitimate state interest against them.If all you've got is an unwillingness to redefine, then quite frankly you've already lost.

It doesn't matter. Whether or not people COULD get those benefits by tying the knot is no more relevant than the fact gays could get the benefits by tying the knot the way marriage is NOW. Neither are examples of wanting to marry as the system allows NOW, and both are examples if wanting the system changed to accomodate them. If singles don't want to get married, but want the benefits, it's a form of discrimination to not give it to them. And frankly, I can't see why the state should have an interest in discriminating in this way. You're basically trying to say "oh, let's just move the line of what constitutes marriage JUST enough to include one more group and leave every other arrangement out." But other groups might just as well try and demonstrate, successfully perhaps, than the state has no interest in disciminating against them either--you see, if marriage is viewed a maleable institution, the state has no interest giving anyone those benefits and not giving it to others. The only feasible and truly fair solution, since you've decided to screw it up for everyone, is to have a system of giving these benefits that has nothing to do with marriage whatsoever. That way, whoever wants to tie the knot can, and it will have nothing to do with whether or not they get benefits.No, it doesn't work that way. When my wife and I got married, we had to stand before a public official and declare our intent to "marry." It wasn't just filling out paperwork. You haven't shown jack. on the non-consent examples, all you've given is some conjecture on why it may make it a little harder on the govt to do so. What's the state interest in not giving benefits to polygamists? Too much paperwork and tax headache? What--their love not worth it to you??? What's the state interest in keeping two people co-habitating from getting benefits who, for whatever none-of-anybody's business don't want to tie the knot and be "married"? Too easy? What--who the heck are you to tell them their love isn't as good?? You haven't given any reason, that I've seen, for discrimination for those two things that couldn't be said for gay marriage too.That's right, because the term "marriage" means a LOT. Not something to be molded and redefined every time someone wants to come along and do so.

Wow.That's like saying a black guy could put on white make-up and pretend to be a white guy in order to drink from the white drinking fountain.It DOES matter.There is NO comparing the *plights* of a heterosexual couple who wants MARRIAGE benefits while REFUSING to marry, and a homosexual couple who WANTS to marry and is REFUSED to have it allowed.It's amazing how many arguments you attempt to make by stripping the issue of its details to make it vague, and the important aspects as meaningless.And yes. A black man who is forbidden to drink at a white only drinking fountain is just like a white man who can drink but doesn't want to drink at THAT fountain.Just out of curiousity, I have no problem repeating the analogy.Each time you try to dance around it, I enjoy saying it again because I know you can't address it.Do you think others don't notice that?No. It's not.They CAN GET the benefits. They just don't make the EFFORT to GET the benefits.It's like saying that a man wants to vote, but he doesn't want to register in order to do so. Ergo, he is "discriminated" against.He can vote if he registers. There is nothing stopping him. He doesn't have to act like a republican or straight or white to be able to vote.All he has to do is register.But of course, you would compare a man's refusal to register to vote with a black man who is restricted from voting...They have an interest in setting up rights and privileges associated with marriage.If people don't want to apply for marriage and obtain the rights, that's their own look-out...Uh. YEAH!If they can successfully demonstrate that, then they can marry legally.That's how it works!Wrong. Dead wrong.The SAME INTERESTS that exist for giving those rights to straight couples ALSO exist for gay couples.Can you name any benefit/privilege that exists where straight couples have an "interest" that doesn't apply for gay couples???

That's seems to be a pyrric approach for you, but I have no problem with it.There is ABSOLUTELY NO REASON to do it that way though...Cause you see, your stupid complaint still exists in this form as well.What if a couple doesn't want to have to sign up to get that benefit?What if a couple balks at the idea of signing a form in order to get those benefits?Your solution DOES NOTHING TO SOLVE YOUR DILEMMA.I'll take "meaningless comments that do absolutely nothing to alter my argument" for $1,000 Alex...< end sarcasm >Jyoshu, you don't get it.For polygamists, they COULD FIX the situation by legislation. But IT WOULD REQUIRE legislation to fix it.The marriage codes are currently not set up to accomodate them.If they actually got the marriage laws to reflect the polygamy possibility, their hurdle would be fixed.That's not discrimination. It's stupidity.If they don't want to tie the knot, then they don't get the benefits.Plain and simple.Discrimination is when you tell a group of people that they CANNOT do something.It is NOT when a group of people REFUSES to do something.There are multiple jobs in the paper today. I am not going to put in a resume to any of them.Does that mean I have been illegitimately discriminated against if they don't hire me??? emoticonXBanghead The term "marriage" will STILL mean a lot when the state recognizes there is no legitimate state interest to prevent gay marriage.Quite frankly, if the heterosexuals didn't want it to be "molded and redefined", they should have KEPT IT OUT of the governmental venue.But you know what PUT it in the governmental venue?MISCEGENATION laws.There were no marriage certificate requirements before miscegenation became an issue. In fact, the legal documentation of the marriage license can trace its ROOTS TO MISCEGENATION LAWS.They used it as a legal tool to prevent blacks from marrying whites, just as the marriage license is used as a legal tool to prevent gays from marrying today.The irony of it all is amazing...History DOES repeat itself...Just look at the history of the law Massachusetts is using to prevent out of state gay couples from marrying in their state...

There is a distinct difference between discrimination and unfair discrimination. We don't allow children to vote, or adults with uncontrolled seizures to drive. We often discriminate for the social good. When persons become disenfranchized from the opportunity to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, we called that unfair discrimination, and hopefully are enlightened enough to change laws to correct that.Marriage would be defined the same way it is now with only one single change, the gender of the spouses. It would be very clearly defined. It wouldn't apply to "anyone" who wants marriage benefits, but to couples who want to get married. There is no slippery slope. This would not lead to further expansion of marriage to that of roomates, or siblings, or farm animals. Because in addition to the rights of marriage, the responsibilities would be there. Roomies who are casual acquaintenances would not be willing to accept the commitment. No one gets harmed with same-sex marriage, so it is unlike incest or polygamy. The other slippery slope canards, bestiality, necrophilia, inanimate objects, etc. are too absurd to comment upon.The idea that if we change the definition of marriage to include same-sex couples, it would change the definition of marriage is a tautology and is tantamount to merely being against the idea.In any event, if opposite gender acquaintences choose to get married now, there is nothing to stop them. I know of a circumstance when a woman married a friend when she developed a chronic medical condition and needed the health insurance. I know of two cases of "divorced" couples who are no longer living together and are living as though they are divorced, including pursuing relationships, but do not finalize the divorce to keep health benefits for the mom and kids. Should we be scrutinizing married people to be certain they are not gaming the system?

I know of a few cases whereby military members got married to get married military benefits. A few other cases where I'm sure that factored into the decision to get married.You see, for a lot of the lower enlisted personnel, they are bunked on base in the military's facilities. Much like a dorm room...They don't get any financing for living anywhere else.But if an E-3 gets married, the military will pay for him and his wife to live off base in something that is significantly nicer.I'm not positive, but I believe there is actually a military pay boost in other ways as well regarding "married" and "unmarried" status.

If you don't like that then tough...my opinion is no less valid as it is, afterall, an opinionYeah it is. I say "questioned" and you freak out like there is some great meaning behind that. Get a grip. The ONE survey (as if one is enough to prove things in other situations) has some questions regarding tactics and it seems it goes against methods done by other surveys...either way, doesn't matter to me.yeah, assuming your survey is correct I would still make that claim.It really isn't that hard of a concept. You bring the system back to the church in hopes that people will change their values to more a Christian view. This is done in businesses all the time when talking about certain functions being brought back into a company.There shouldn't be much to figure out. Even so, it is better to give it back to them then keep it in the current system...IMOhaha I said "wholes"..oops.When people challenge the validity of ONE survey then it brings "holes" into it.No, the state is not doing the right job and the church is allowing it. I see the divorce rate at 50% and I blame a disconnect of values....not that complicated. You are making it more than it is. I think if left 100% to the state you would see an increase in the divorce rate as marriage will have 0 meaning left.

Not "refuted" or "destroyed", but just "questioned"...My poll is accurate, and its accuracy is not in "question".And your "pointing out" is like saying that the straw field being on fire proves we should move back to planting hay...Which also catches fire...Those marriages where the partners are ATHEIST have a higher success rate than those where the partners are Jewish or Christian.Yet, in your mind, that proves that we have to bring marriage back to religion.Again, I see you adding up 1+1 and saying it's blue.I just don't get your claim.It's like having a fire where we are fighting it with two substances. Substance A has more effect at fighting the fire than Substance B.Whereupon you insist that we fight the fire with JUST Substance B...Makes no sense...I wasn't saying that.That wasn't the point of my analogy.If you have any real questions about what I was saying, then please go back and re-read and ask them.Jesus understood SOME SPECIFIC REASONS for divorce, but forbade marriage after the divorce.And quite frankly, I think your "churches" should figure that out before we try to hand things back to JUST them and pretend that is a better solution...What holes?What "holes" does it supposedly have?In other words, churches ARE NOT doing the RIGHT job that you think they should...But we should hand it back to churches that are CURRENTLY DOING IT WRONG, and then expect them to do better...emoticonXDonno Am I missing the point where you are actually showing why churches WOULD DO a better job?Or is it more that you JUST WANT churches to have sole custody of the marriage issue, and that you ALSO WANT them to do a better job.Not that they ARE or WOULD do a better job, but rather that you WANT THEM to do a better job...

Why should someone marry some they would not choose to?If a single person does not want to marry, they do not have to.If you think the benefits given to married people are innapropriate or unjust, that is a different topic than denying people the right to marry the person they choose.It is not really a double standard at all, which would be a set of circumstances that establishes a different set of provisions for one person over another. Everyone who gets married is a single person.

Gay people can get married....just not to whome they choose. What if a single person doesn't want to marry? All of a sudden a double standard.And you are calling my post inane?Not exactly chief. George Jefferson would have to say "I'm thirsty but I want to drink from this other fountain as I like it more although I am legally allowed to drink from the fountain that Archie just drank from".Keep digging.Your example is mind-boggling.

yeah, it seems rather unfair that you think your marriage is above everyone else and their situation that they choose. The problem with your argument is that you want to get what you want for gays and then pull the rope up and not let anyone else get the "equality" you so desperately want.Straight people are beneficial to society too....yet you wish to be a hypocrite when it comes to "equality" for others seeking the same thing you are.

You know what's truly hilarious in all this.SOME on the right are arguing that when you give gay couples the same rights and benefits as straight marriages, THAT somehow cheapens and diminishes their marriages.But here Steeeeve is trying to give those benefits to EVERYBODY who cannot or does not want to get married...Complicated??? emoticonXWow And for the record, gay marriage IS beneficial to society. Proven numerous times in numerous ways.In fact, I can't think of any straight marriage benefit to society which doesn't have an equivalent or corollary with gay marriage benefits.Can you?

likewise, if a gay man doesnt' want to marry a women then they do not have to. You are just moving the barrier to a different spot but you still want to single out people. It makes no sense that you call some "barriers" discrimination but yours...well that is ok.ok, but that is not my point.not single in the sense I refer to. And it is a double standard to say "hey, you can't deny marriage to some" and then once you are included in the some say "no one else gets what we have".To say "well if you allow gay marriage anyone can marry"...yeah, but anyone can marry now. You come back with "well they can't marry who they want". I say, and? A single person can't get what he wants either...which is the benefits with no marriage. You already said it was about the benefits.
attacks
Why should someone marry some they would not choose to?If a single person does not want to marry, they do not have to.If you think the benefits given to married people are innapropriate or unjust, that is a different topic than denying people the right to marry the person they choose.It is not really a double standard at all, which would be a set of circumstances that establishes a different set of provisions for one person over another. Everyone who gets married is a single person.

But how is allowing people who don't want to tie the know but cohabitate to have benefits dangerous (as in your examples of allowing seizure prone adults to drive)? So I can't see how allowing single people to get these benefits would be a problem.I realize that "slippery slope" can be a fallacy in some cases, but that doesn't mean it can't happen. Precedents can be set. What you view as a simple addition of language is broadening it--making it more open-ended. At least that's the way it looks to me.But gay people can do that too; if people are going to marry not for love but for benefits, gays can do that by marrying someone of the opposite sex just for the benefits. It's not like gays don't have that option now.I wouldn't be opposed to some means to make sure they aren't lying before they get the benefits.

There is a distinct difference between discrimination and unfair discrimination. We don't allow children to vote, or adults with uncontrolled seizures to drive. We often discriminate for the social good. When persons become disenfranchized from the opportunity to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, we called that unfair discrimination, and hopefully are enlightened enough to change laws to correct that.Marriage would be defined the same way it is now with only one single change, the gender of the spouses. It would be very clearly defined. It wouldn't apply to "anyone" who wants marriage benefits, but to couples who want to get married. There is no slippery slope. This would not lead to further expansion of marriage to that of roomates, or siblings, or farm animals. Because in addition to the rights of marriage, the responsibilities would be there. Roomies who are casual acquaintenances would not be willing to accept the commitment. No one gets harmed with same-sex marriage, so it is unlike incest or polygamy. The other slippery slope canards, bestiality, necrophilia, inanimate objects, etc. are too absurd to comment upon.The idea that if we change the definition of marriage to include same-sex couples, it would change the definition of marriage is a tautology and is tantamount to merely being against the idea.In any event, if opposite gender acquaintences choose to get married now, there is nothing to stop them. I know of a circumstance when a woman married a friend when she developed a chronic medical condition and needed the health insurance. I know of two cases of "divorced" couples who are no longer living together and are living as though they are divorced, including pursuing relationships, but do not finalize the divorce to keep health benefits for the mom and kids. Should we be scrutinizing married people to be certain they are not gaming the system?

I already told you, that doesn't matter. It's discrimination either way, that can't rightly be justified. Maybe the single people can't either for various reasons--economic for instance. It doesn't matter--the point is it's unnecessary discrimination in BOTH cases.I'm not comparing any "plight". This isn't about anyone suffering; this is about the fact that both are examples of unnecessary discrimination. If you want to start a separate discussion on how much gays are suffering a plight because they can't get couples' benefits, be my guest. You're trying to make an issue of degree here in terms of which has it worse off, and that's not even the point. It's irrelevant to the fact that both are unnecessary forms of discrimination. You can use innacurate analogies all you want for all I care. The more proper analogy would be in cases of shorter waterfountains; what you're doing would be like short people wanting to re-make every waterfountain to be suitable for their height rather than putting a frickin' short fountain beside the tall one which is the sensible thing to do. You aren't just wanting a drink from the same fountain, you're trying to redefine the water fountain from the way it's normally made. So smoke on that analogy for awhile.You can get benefits too as a gay person, just not the way you want to. They can get benefits too, just not a way they want to. From the standpoint simply being unnecessary discrimination, that's the bottom line--they're the same. The fact you think one is a worse degree of a problem than the other isn't the point.But hey, I understand how you feel--I don't like the idea of singles getting marriage benefits either. In fact, I think marriage benefits should stay to being what they're FOR: for MARRIED opposite-sex couples. At least I can admit that one is, for all practical purposes, no different than the other; yours is the inconsistent position. The point to all this is that whether you realize it or not, or want to admit it, what you're wanting to do is make marriage more open-ended. There's nothing any more special or any less invalid about gay marriage than any other group out there wanting couples' benfits.

Man. You are REALLLY STRETCHING that "single people discrimination" XXXX, aren't you. You keep trying to compare CANNOT marry to REFUSES TO marry.And we've already covered this absurdity.Telling a gay person that they can get married to a woman is like telling a Christian that a law outlawing wearing Christian jewelry just means they have to wear an Islam sikh jewelry instead.WoW!!!What a load of XXXX. George Jefferson would have to PUT ON WHITE MAN'S MAKE-UP to drink at that fountain, just like gays would have to imitate straights in engaging in a STRAIGHT marriage to get "marriage" rights.But by your thinking, if George Jefferson had wanted to marry Edie, he should have just settle for "his" drinking fountain and married a black woman instead, right? After all, that's HIS drinking fountain that he was "legally allowed to drink from"...Unbe-fricken-lievable. I am amazed at how you insist that I marry like a straight person to get marriage rights.The arrogance of the majority...

Ok lets go with this thinking to the real world for a second. If you give a single person the benefit of inheriting his own pension when the single person dies and the single person dies does he inherit his own pension? If not then who does. If you give a single person the right to visit themselves in the hospital and if not then will they be stopped from visiting themselves in the hospital? If you give a single person automatic title transfer to the house the single person owns and lives in and the single person dies then does the title transfer to the single person?

If you had read the whole thread (which you obviously haven't) then you woul see that two single people could enter a contract to do these things. I gave some examples of this. What if you wanted your best friend to get to visit you..or maybe get your pension...things of that nature.

Ahhh. Forever misrepresenting my statements, as usual.There is a difference inbetween CAN marry, and just plain DON'T WANNA marry.My response included somebody who was RESTRICTED from doing something.Not just not wanting to, but RESTRICTED from doing it.Likewise, you are comparing a case of RESTRICTED from marrying, to JUST DON'T WANNA marry.Flounder all you want. You still haven't overcome the inanity of that obstacle.There is no comparing restricting blacks from marrying ANY white person, and a white person just not wanting to marry another white person.

I am glad you see the logic is stupid. Now you know why saying "straight people should just marry" is just as stupid as saying "gay people should marry a woman"Thanks :)

....wrong postnot really, my opinion is based on observation and that is all there is to it. It really isn't something you can prove. If you don't like that then tough...my opinion is no less valid as it is, afterall, an opinionYeah it is. I say "questioned" and you freak out like there is some great meaning behind that. Get a grip. The ONE survey (as if one is enough to prove things in other situations) has some questions regarding tactics and it seems it goes against methods done by other surveys...either way, doesn't matter to me.yeah, assuming your survey is correct I would still make that claim.It really isn't that hard of a concept. You bring the system back to the church in hopes that people will change their values to more a Christian view. This is done in businesses all the time when talking about certain functions being brought back into a company.There shouldn't be much to figure out. Even so, it is better to give it back to them then keep it in the current system...IMOhaha I said "wholes"..oops.When people challenge the validity of ONE survey then it brings "holes" into it.No, the state is not doing the right job and the church is allowing it. I see the divorce rate at 50% and I blame a disconnect of values....not that complicated. You are making it more than it is. I think if left 100% to the state you would see an increase in the divorce rate as marriage will have 0 meaning left.

Are you and Jyoshu reading from the same script?There is no "problem" with my argument.ANY OTHER GROUP that can show there is no legitimate state interest for their discrimination CAN ALSO be included.You know the truly stupid thing about your argument?It's a "damned if you do, and damned if you don't" approach.If I want to allow JUST gay marriage, then you criticize me because I'm allowing too limited of a scope.But if I want to allow OTHERS beyond gay marriage, then you'll criticize me because I'm opening it up to the masses...But the thing you CANNOT seem to respond to is the fact that I have a unilateral approach. ANY marriage discrimination occurring without a legitimate state interest should not be allowed.Anybody that can climb that rope should, IMO.Those that cannot, that's too bad.Here we go again with this inanity.There is a difference inbetween gay couples which are FORBIDDEN from marrying...... and straight couples that JUST DON'T WANNA marry.To try and say that we are discriminating against the straight couples who CAN marry but CHOOSE NOT to marry is just plain retarded.

You miss the point. The point is a gay person "CAN MARRY" to get the equality in benefits just like a single person "CAN MARRY" to get the equality benefits. It just so happens that the single person and gay person can't do it in the means they wish. So the logic used by you and thelmoose is stupid or inconsistent.

You're missing the point, Jyoshu.If SOCIETY WANTS to let these people have benefits they currently can only get if they marry, let them. But it is NOT discriminatory to not recognize marriage rights for somebody who CHOOSES NOT TO MARRY.The precedent has ALREADY been set.We are not talking about ANY new precedents.NONE of our arguments include setting any new precedents.Do you get that?And likewise, black people could marry other black people for the benefits...... and let's ignore the fact that they are racially prevented from marrying white people.You can't use this as an excuse to ignore the discrimination which IS occurring.Just out of curiousity, is the "sanctity of marriage" crowd on board with this idea?Or are they ignoring the straight couples who trample the ideals of marriage, while they want to keep all gay couples out regardless of ideals...Just curious...

The problem with what you are saying is that you don't have a solution and I do. I think having it all in the church would create a more meaningful marriage and make the church more responsible for the marriage instead of the state. This would make the church more likely to help resolve disputes and things like that. There is no evidence to show that this wouldn't work or would work but clearly having it in its current form is just not working.

Oh. My bad. I didn't realize you used italic font.That obviously means it DOESN'T matter...< end sarcasm >I get the fact that YOU THINK it still means discrimination when a couple who CAN marry and get MARRIAGE benefits just REFUSES to marry...But it's not.It's like saying that a man who WANTS to get a job, but never applies for one, is discriminated against. It's just plain a losing argument.You can't be serious.By analogy, do you believe If somebody DOES NOT register to vote, and they aren't allowed to vote because they REFUSE to register, you think that refusing to fill out the paperwork and go through the motions means that it's unjustified discrimination?emoticonXDonno No. It's not.Let's say we change the laws and allow MARRIAGE benefits for the unmarried.Can some idiot come along and say "Hey. I didn't apply for this benefit with my girl-friend, and I don't want to take the time to apply, but I'm discriminated against because I'm not getting what I never applied for"That fits your logic, and would be acceptable to you, correct?Just plain WOW!Requiring somebody to APPLY and fill out the paperwork to REGISTER for marriage rights is an "unnecessary form of discrimination"...WOW!This is something you have repeatedly FAILED to address.I'm going to bring it up again.There is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about the way that marriage is "made" that doesn't allow for gay marriage.There is no benefit given by straight marriage that isn't applicable for gay marriage.There is no purpose given by straight marriage that isn't applicable for gay marriage.It's not an issue of "made" for a purpose.It's an issue of somebody saying "this marriage is just for straights", and then you refuse to budge from that position.Man. You two keep arguing in circles, except I am the one CLOSING the circle, and you refuse to address the final arguments...Telling me that I can marry like a straight person does to get marriage is like saying that a Jewish person can have freedom of religion under a law preventing Judaism if he worships Jesus.There is no comparison in that and a man who complains about not having freedom of religion, just because he CHOOSES not to worship.No. They aren't.Another analogy.Would you tell a black man that he can "legally" marry a black woman, and that his complaints against miscegenation laws aren't real?And that his "discrimination" is like the discrimination of a white couple who DOES NOT WANT to marry?No matter how you look at it, it's inane.Hold the phone there Jyoshu.I just plain DO NOT CARE if "singles" in a couple, who want couple benefits like marriage benefits, get those "benefits".I don't care.My point is that using this stupid "I don't wanna, but I want the benefits anyways" argument to try and ignore the unjustified discrimination against gay marriage is stupid. Stupid squared.There is no comparison between "I don't wanna" and "I am legally forbidden from"The straight couple CAN legally marry. Ergo, NO discrimination. There IS NO DISCRIMINATION against a couple who have the CAPACITY to enter into marriage, but then choose not to.The gay couple CANNOT legally marry. And furthermore, there is NO REASON for preventing them from marrying.What you two don't get is that this IS NOT just about the "benefits". The benefits provide a convincing argument, but if marriage had NO benefits, the state WOULD STILL have to afford gay couples the right of marriage.And maybe that's the solution to all this absurdity.Say that we hypothetically strip ALL benefits from marriage. We STILL HAVE an argument for gay marriage. NONE of my arguments rest on a need for "benefits".My arguments rest on the fact that marriage IS A RIGHT.

You fail to see that it would be a different critizism. When you want to open it up to gay marriage only and claim its for "equality" and that my position is "discrimination" then you are being a hypocrite because you are doing the same thing! so if you decided you wanted to open it to all then I wouldn't have an argument against you being inconsistent but rather that it is a bad idea. You just like the limit the definition of marriage to include gay marriage and not go further:) So in a sense you can say you are not discrimnating but in reality you are...fine, if I maintain the definition of marriage to a man and a woman then there is no discrimination occuring without legitmate state interest. ok, two best friends are FORBIDDEN from obtaining marriage type benefits.

Period.That doesn't mean we should give marriage over to the people who do the worse job.Quote him.Show where he said that.Throwing gasoline on a fire is not a solution when you don't have water.And I have plenty of ideas for solutions. Require counseling before marriage, and before divorce. Bring back "fault" divorce. Educate people about the difficulties of marriage.Once again, when Christians are doing a WORSE JOB at marriage, the solution is NOT to hand things over to the Christians.emoticonXBanghead

For someone that doesn't like to be "misrepresented" you sure did it to me. I didn't say I would critcize you if you wanted to allow it all (although I kinda would). You fail to see that it would be a different critizism. When you want to open it up to gay marriage only and claim its for "equality" and that my position is "discrimination" then you are being a hypocrite because you are doing the same thing! so if you decided you wanted to open it to all then I wouldn't have an argument against you being inconsistent but rather that it is a bad idea. You just like the limit the definition of marriage to include gay marriage and not go further:) So in a sense you can say you are not discrimnating but in reality you are...fine, if I maintain the definition of marriage to a man and a woman then there is no discrimination occuring without legitmate state interest. ok, two best friends are FORBIDDEN from obtaining marriage type benefits. DISCRIMINATION!!! the fact that you can't see that is amazing.

Touche. Their tactics are really so tiresome and absurd - they remain argumentative to the end, throwing up any shred of a comment they can muster. I think they are now advocating everyone to be allowed to get all marriage benefits even if they have no desire to be married because they are concerned about being inclusive to all. OR are they advocating getting married willy-nilly to persons you don't even want to marry? And gays should be satisfied with marrying someone other than the person they want to commit to? But at the same time, same-sex marriage would be unthinkable. Quite silly, really.Do steve and jyosh really think they are making a logical argument? I don't know which is sadder, to be so deluded as to think being contrary is a debate, or they know they are being illogical, but say it anyway.You ask if they try this trick in real life. You are assuming they have one.

Marriage involves two people, it has nothing to do with a single person not getting the benefits. A straight single person can get married and get the benefits. A single gay person cannot get married and get the benefits, because gay people cannot get married. At least not to someone they are physically and romantically involved with. On the flip side, there are no laws to prevent a gay man from marrying a lesbian. Which in essence is a gay marriage. The fact that they are of the opposite sex is irrelevant. They are both gay and they are not sleeping together. Yet they can become a part of your glorious sacred institution, not because they are in love with one another but because one has a penis and one has a vagina. Genetalia is actually the deciding factor on who can and who can't married. Love, commitment, companionship, trust, etc, are the actual ingredients that give marriage it's substance. Those same things are what we all think of when we think of marriage. Oddly enough, those things are not a factor in deciding who can and who cannot get married. The genders of the potential couple come before the aspects of marriage that actually define what marriage is all about. It's undeniably wrong for one group of people to exclude and hate another group of people because of who they love.

likewise, if a gay man doesnt' want to marry a women then they do not have to. You are just moving the barrier to a different spot but you still want to single out people. It makes no sense that you call some "barriers" discrimination but yours...well that is ok.ok, but that is not my point.not single in the sense I refer to. And it is a double standard to say "hey, you can't deny marriage to some" and then once you are included in the some say "no one else gets what we have".To say "well if you allow gay marriage anyone can marry"...yeah, but anyone can marry now. You come back with "well they can't marry who they want". I say, and? A single person can't get what he wants either...which is the benefits with no marriage. You already said it was about the benefits.

But gays are choosing NOT TO MARRY as well, in terms of how the state sees marriage. That's what you refuse to see.Ah . . . the Vegas-Shortlived Marriage argument. If you want to fight for marriages to have a minimum-required time frame before divorce, go right ahead. Different issue, different merits.Oh ok, so you just want to discriminate against those who CAN'T get the marriage license but need the benefits, for, say financial reasons. I see. Who said it has to be a case of "refusal"?Voting doesn't require demonstrating a commitment to the state that they may not want to do. The issue here is that we are talking about couples' benefits. And there may be some that want or need to get those even if they arne't a MARRIED couple. I'm not saying that would be a common occurance, but even if the possibility is there, marriage is still an inequitable institution regardless.The point here is that it's YOUR logic, Foundit--it's the logic of the whole gay marriage proponent movement. YOU'RE the one wanting the state to start seeing other things than marriage to be marriage. Get it? You're wanting couples' benefits to go to things that the state doesn't view as marriage.Those could be said for any number of arrangement possibilities, so that reality alone doesn't cut it for your purposes of wanting to start broadening marriage. You keep trying to pretend that gay marriage doesn't open th can of worms here, but it does because you're really saying that marriage has to include other things.I told you, we could just as easily be dealing with the issue of someone who couldn't get the license for whatever reason. And as far as "I don't wanna" goes, from the state's perspective that's exactly what gays are saying by not marrying the state's way.????? emoticonXWow What the heck is the "right of marriage" from the state's perspective OTHER than the benefits? Tell us what else it is the state is providing!!! I'm dying to know, because as a married person, I must be missing out. It's not like anyone's preventing you from tying the knot to whoever you want, right now. I'd be married regardless of what the state does or doesn't do.

You're missing the point, Jyoshu.If SOCIETY WANTS to let these people have benefits they currently can only get if they marry, let them. But it is NOT discriminatory to not recognize marriage rights for somebody who CHOOSES NOT TO MARRY.The precedent has ALREADY been set.We are not talking about ANY new precedents.NONE of our arguments include setting any new precedents.Do you get that?And likewise, black people could marry other black people for the benefits...... and let's ignore the fact that they are racially prevented from marrying white people.You can't use this as an excuse to ignore the discrimination which IS occurring.Just out of curiousity, is the "sanctity of marriage" crowd on board with this idea?Or are they ignoring the straight couples who trample the ideals of marriage, while they want to keep all gay couples out regardless of ideals...Just curious...

no, damned if you do damned if you don't implies two possiblities of thought...eat the chicken dont eat the chicken...those kinda things.I'm not claiming an equality violationyeah but it has to pass your random state interest test. I suppose you just want the courts to randomly decided what is or isn't a "state interest". If thats the case then I am going to want judges that think a majority vote is enough of a state interest and then you should have no problem with this. Under your definition of discrimination yes it is...but I'm not pretending like I am not.I don't require a legitimate state interest as that phrase has no real meaning.They just want to be friends with marriage benefits. What if it were two males..it doesn't matter. And maybe not even all the "benefits" although we said this would be for another topic.I'm just talking about friends...you seem to want them to marry when these friends don't want to but do want the benefits...they can't. You can't comprehend this for some odd reason.

WAIT! Did you just define marraige as something? Fine, I define it has a man and a woman...not just two people. If you can define it why can't I?they can't get benefits if they don't want to marry...just like a gay person can't get benefits if they dont want to marry (in this case a woman). You make it seem like it is literally impossible for a gay person to marry...when it is not....they just can't do it in the means they want. Same with a single person.And thats the point...if two single people want to share the benefits but don't want to get married as they have no "romantic" involvement then why are saying they can't get benefits for your type can...DISCRIMINATION! :pIt is so funny to hear you guys talk about this and pretty much use the same arguments that your anti-gay marriage folks use. Things like "that's not the definition of marriage" and "marriage is a union between two people...not single people living together". HAHA, this is exactly why I don't support your cause, because you are just arguing the same thing the other side is...you just want to draw a different line.

It is more consistent than any other arguement you guys have made. So you have gays that want marriage benefits. You can look at this as single people, married people, and gay couples that can't marry but are not single. three groups. Now you can have two single people live together. Perhaps they are best friend with no romantic or other feelings other than just friends. Now we have three relationships. Currently we restrict marriage benefits to only one of those relationships. So the first point is when I say "why can't the friends relationship get benefits" someone responded with "they should just marry"...or rather do something they don't want to do (or maybe aren't allowed to do). But if you use that as your argument "they should just marry if they want benefits" then you have to agree with the argumetn that a gay man should just "marry to get benefits".Second point, gays claim they want equality. So you have three relationships here. Why should the friend relationship not get these benefits while the other two should? There is no equality in that...just a different line in the sand. So argue that there should be a different line not that some people are "discrimnating" against you guys...as you wish to do the same. If you try to claim that the "friends relationship" could get married then you are asking them to change the frame of their relationship. You could just change the term in government to some different meaning which would allow anyone to enter into an argument with anyone in which they would receive some benefits. There wouldn't be much "romance" in that but rather just a contract that you sign on to for whatever reason. Perhaps you could even get different kinds of contracts to how much you wanted the other person to get. This would be the only equality in this situation. With the current system it just doesn't allow for 2 kinds of relationships to get benefits.

If a black man chooses to ride at the back of the bus, that isn't discrimination.It's when a person IS REFUSED to be allowed the choice to ride at the front, that is discrimination.If a gay man chooses not to marry, that's his choice to make.That's irrelevant to discrimination.Do you think that blacks choosing to ride at the back of the bus meant anything regarding discrimination? Or was it the fact that their ONLY choice was the back which defined the discrimination...No. It wasn't an "argument".It was an observation about the contradictions within the anti-gay marriage position.But I see you took my observation out of context, and pretended my statement was something it wasn't.Not surprising...."can't"?Who "can't" get a marriage license that would receive "financial reasons" for wanting one?Enlighten me. Are you talking about something real, or just purely made up...It's a lump package.No substitutions.Take it or leave it...Or change it, but changing it is a different argument.Yeah.... YOU keep talking about "couples' benefits".Let's cut through the XXXX.MARRIAGE is a right.The benefits associated with marriage ARE NOT a "right", persay...The state could decide to alter one of those benefits at any time. Remove one from the list. Add another. That's a state decision. The court wouldn't bat an eye.The only thing is that those benefits are ATTACHED to marriage, which is a right.Ergo, if you want to talk about giving non-married couples the "benefits", go for it. But it's not a "rights" issue.YOU want to focus on the benefits, and you're entitled to do that.But it IS a separate issue.And here we have a false-hood, ladies and gentlemen.What he is about to describe is not my "logic".My "logic" revolves around legitimate state interests and the RIGHT of marriage.This isn't my argument.This is your attempt to boil away the essential details from my argument, and then rephrase my argument so you can joust with a strawman.Marriage "benefits" are not a right. MARRIAGE ITSELF is a right. And as such, it is subject to the scrutiny of the 14th amendment.If you can show me any court ruling that says marriage BENEFITS THEMSELVES are a right, you could make progress in pretending you have an argument.Until then, you don't got squat.No. It's not. And it's amazing you are keeping this XXXX up this long...What you are talking about is a HETEROSEXUAL COUPLE who wants a BENEFIT associated with marriage, but DOES NOT WANT to marry.What I am talking about is a HOMOSEXUAL COUPLE who wants to MARRY. Period.Marriage is a right.The benefits are ASSOCIATED with marriage, but they are not a right.Double WoW!Do you get what "marriage" is? At all?The benefits are there to help the marriage.And now you think that the BENEFITS are the central issue, and you don't understand the state's perspective ON marriage???Why do you think the benefits exist in the first place?It's BECAUSE of the marriage.The marriage came first.Your whole current presentation is like arguing that people should get the "tax deduction" for having a kid, even though they don't have a kid. That it's "discriminatory" to not give them a tax deducation for a kid they don't have.And NOW, you're even fixating more on the TAX DEDUCTION while you ignore the KID and the PURPOSE of the tax deduction's presence in the first place.And historically, the "right of marriage" has been one of denial.Like I pointed out, the marriage license owes its origins to the attempt to prevent blacks and whites from inter-marrying.Here, the "right of marriage" is about keeping gays from marrying.And on another level, I can't help but wonder if you can appreciate how when the anti-gay crowd illogically complains about gays "damaging" marriage, what you are suggesting is ACTUALLY DAMAGING marriage.Currently, marriage offers benefits AND responsibilities.Kind of like having your cake, but then you have to exercise afterwards to burn off the calories.What YOU want is a buffet WITHOUT responsibility. Which will allow couples who WOULD marry to ask more and more why they should marry if all they have to do is to sign up for "benefits" with no committment.You don't seem to get that part of the reason that they DO get the benefits is because they HAVE made the committment. A committment you now want to neuter.People complain about gays wrecking marriage, but it's ideas like yours which are the REAL threat...

You keep trying to pretend that gay marriage doesn't open th can of worms here, but it does because you're really saying that marriage has to include other things.I told you, we could just as easily be dealing with the issue of someone who couldn't get the license for whatever reason. And as far as "I don't wanna" goes, from the state's perspective that's exactly what gays are saying by not marrying the state's way.????? emoticonXWow What the heck is the "right of marriage" from the state's perspective OTHER than the benefits? Tell us what else it is the state is providing!!! I'm dying to know, because as a married person, I must be missing out. It's not like anyone's preventing you from tying the knot to whoever you want, right now. I'd be married regardless of what the state does or doesn't do.

I AM talking about your condemnation of two possibilities of thought.#1: Allow only gay marriage. Don't allow other forms of marriage.#2: Allow gay marriage and ANY OTHER form of marriage.You condemn BOTH schools of thought.emoticonXWow emoticonXDonno emoticonXWow emoticonXDonno emoticonXWow Then what's all this XXXX about how NON-MARRIED couples need to get benefits as well?You can "want" that all you want, but it ain't going to happen.And "state interest test" is not "random". There are a variety of rulings on it, establishing what does and does not constitute.You alleging it's "random" out of ignorance is not an argument.NEITHER AM I.I admit that it's discrimination.It's JUSTIFIED discrimination, based on STANDARDS. Constitutional standards.Did you really think I was denying it was discrimination?Because if you did, that would be another example of your failure to comprehend...Is there a logical fallacy for when an opponent just plain refuses to acknowledge reality?"legitimate state interest" has meaning.Your refusal to acknowledge it is not an argument.The marriage BENEFITS are not a right.They are a legal requirement associated with the right of MARRIAGE.If you want to lobby for them to become INDEPENDENT benefits, then go for it.But they aren't a right, and as such have no meaning under my arguments.Why can't they?Why can't they marry?And how can I "comprehend" this argument of "can't" when it's virtually brand-new...

no, damned if you do damned if you don't implies two possiblities of thought...eat the chicken dont eat the chicken...those kinda things.I'm not claiming an equality violationyeah but it has to pass your random state interest test. I suppose you just want the courts to randomly decided what is or isn't a "state interest". If thats the case then I am going to want judges that think a majority vote is enough of a state interest and then you should have no problem with this. Under your definition of discrimination yes it is...but I'm not pretending like I am not.I don't require a legitimate state interest as that phrase has no real meaning.They just want to be friends with marriage benefits. What if it were two males..it doesn't matter. And maybe not even all the "benefits" although we said this would be for another topic.I'm just talking about friends...you seem to want them to marry when these friends don't want to but do want the benefits...they can't. You can't comprehend this for some odd reason.

You are the master of vague innuendo of a pretense of an argument.What "series of events" have I gotten wrong?Or was that just something you were tossing out to hopefully make people think you had something, when you got nothing?it's a public message board Steeeeve.People don't have to be "asked" to give arguments.Arguments are given all the time without anybody "asking".Learn to cope with that...No. It hasn't been answered.That was the first time I asked that specific question. So how you could answer the question before I supposedly asked it is amazing.You claim that the church can make changes to "marriage" once they get exclusive control. And that they need to get control of marriage to improve it.I'm asking WHAT IMPROVEMENTS can they make to marriage ONLY WHEN they have exclusive control?Obviously, for the HIGHER DIVORCE RATE of Christians, they can make policy changes and policy enforcements WITHIN the church to fix the situation.Why haven't they done this yet?What changes could they make that they can only make when they get control? Actually, it is a question.A question you refuse to answer.Do you think others aren't seeing your refusal to answer a simple question regarding YOUR claim, and realizing how lame of a front you are putting up?Let me get this straight.The "L" word is not allowable, but telling me I act like a 5-year old is acceptable.Would it do any good to ask how I am supposedly trying to "change the frame of debate" in the first place?Or would that be yet another question you refuse to answer, because vague innuendo is all you got?The start of that "mileage" should be actually EXPLAINING the slur and the basis for why you threw it out there.False allegation.I already threw out ideas for improvement. They are not "doing nothing".You seem to think that blind condemnation of my ideas, with no reason given, is better than me showing that we shouldn't give marriage over to the churches because they are CURRENTLY DOING A WORSE JOB...And what's to prevent the religion from defining their own standards?Because if the state gets out of the game, their "definitions" go with it.The religions CAN CURRENTLY define marriage as they please. Catholics sure as heck do. They have MORE RESTRICTIVE definitions than other sects, and comparing the Christian sects to other Christian sects, Catholics do A BETTER JOB AT KEEPING DIVORCE DOWN. (Because of their restrictive definitions, IMO.)So again we come back to the question you won't answer.WHAT CHANGE will the churches do to improve marriage which they can't do currently?

negative assurance is no assurance at all :) You also should refresh on your series of events.You weren't asked to give your argument.asked and answered. See above posts.oh it exists..no question about that. It shouldn't be that surprising anyway. that seems like a logical statement to be made after someone did a study like that.Because everytime someone disagrees with you, you act like a 5 year old when you debate...resorting to smoke and mirror tactics to change the frame of debate away from what the person is talking about.And should I get as much mileage out of your slur as you do for other, more relevant issues?You think doing nothing is better? Any way you go you are "hoping" it will work....time to learn about risk.actually the state does. It is a state defined issue. Divorce, marriage, settlements, everything is up to the state and its laws.

I'm going to reply to this one sentence, and point out how central it is to this continuing farce...Gays WANT MARRIAGE.Not just marriage "benefits".We want MARRIAGE.MARRIAGE is a right.The marriage BENEFITS are not rights. Not rights in the sense that they are guaranteed to any citizen.The state could change the marriage BENEFITS all they want. They can obviously add more, as they have in the past. They could DELETE some if they like.The state cannot arbitrarily "delete" a right. They couldn't suddenly decide to revoke the right to vote or free speech.Jyoshu and Steeeeve are concentrating on the BENEFITS and trying to make an argument out of them that just plain doesn't exist. I challenge them to show me any case where a "benefit" for marriage has been ruled as a right SEPARATE FROM marriage itself.I challenge them to show me any case where a person NOT ACTING upon a right is actionable.A man can refuse to register to vote, and then claim discrimination because he won't be allowed to vote. The man could claim that he doesn't want the government to track him as reasoning for wanting to refuse to register.But the truth is that his refusal to SIGN UP for the right doesn't constitute unjustified discrimination against his right.A man could insist that he be given a tax deduction that is typically given to people with dependents, when he has no dependents. He may "want" it all he wants, but that doesn't mean that he should get it.So far, Jyoshu and Steeeeve have presented NO REAL REASON as to why these people should get these marriage benefits without getting married, beyond the fact that it would "help" them.Marriage benefits, AND RESPONSIBILITIES, exist BECAUSE OF the marriage. They exist to help strengthen the marriage, and to help the marriage.There is an INTEREST in helping the MARRIAGE.J&S just want the marriage benefits thrown out there as conveniences for the people, while we ignore the PURPOSE of the benefits as they were created in the first place.And, they can want that all they want. They can lobby for it if they please.But they have no legal argument to demand that they be separated from marriage...

It is more consistent than any other arguement you guys have made. So you have gays that want marriage benefits. You can look at this as single people, married people, and gay couples that can't marry but are not single. three groups. Now you can have two single people live together. Perhaps they are best friend with no romantic or other feelings other than just friends. Now we have three relationships. Currently we restrict marriage benefits to only one of those relationships. So the first point is when I say "why can't the friends relationship get benefits" someone responded with "they should just marry"...or rather do something they don't want to do (or maybe aren't allowed to do). But if you use that as your argument "they should just marry if they want benefits" then you have to agree with the argumetn that a gay man should just "marry to get benefits".Second point, gays claim they want equality. So you have three relationships here. Why should the friend relationship not get these benefits while the other two should? There is no equality in that...just a different line in the sand. So argue that there should be a different line not that some people are "discrimnating" against you guys...as you wish to do the same. If you try to claim that the "friends relationship" could get married then you are asking them to change the frame of their relationship. You could just change the term in government to some different meaning which would allow anyone to enter into an argument with anyone in which they would receive some benefits. There wouldn't be much "romance" in that but rather just a contract that you sign on to for whatever reason. Perhaps you could even get different kinds of contracts to how much you wanted the other person to get. This would be the only equality in this situation. With the current system it just doesn't allow for 2 kinds of relationships to get benefits.

So you disagree with this comment?"It is the civil benefits that are at issue."So you would be ok with gays being allowed to marry but have no benefits with this marriage?Those are federal constitution requirements. The federal government can revoke them. In fact, the state could too until the 1940s or so.I'm not sure I understand. If someone said "marriage benefits and rights and privileges are protected under the 14th amendment." (or wherever) would you disagree with that statement?

Civil benefits ARE an issue. They are not the CENTRAL issue though.The CONSTITUTIONAL ARGUMENT for gay marriage does not rest upon the "civil benefits" though. It rests on the fact that MARRIAGE is a right.The "civil benefits" are an issue because I pay taxes just like you do.Therefore, I should be eligible to marry my partner, just like you are, since there are no legitimate state interests against that marriage.It's a separate issue, referring more to a logical argument.I am "ok" with gays being allowed to marry WITH THE SAME benefits that straight marriages have.If straight marriages were neutered of their benefits, then that is a situation equal with your proposition...The "federal constitution" requirement I am referring to regards denying people rights, under the 14th amendment.Marriage IS A RIGHT, as recognized numerous times. It doesn't matter how many times you want to stick your head in the sand on that fact, it's still a right.The federal government cannot arbitrarily revoke rights, unless it has satisfied the requirements for amending the constitution to state that something is no longer a right.MARRIAGE benefits and rights and privileges are protected under the 14th amendment, to the extent that you cannot arbitrarily grant ONE couple a benefit that you deny to another couple without legitimate state interest.But JUST HAVING a benefit that is associated with marriage is not protected.There is no "right" to be able to name who you want to include on your insurance paperwork.There is no "right" to be able to automatically assume another person's pension.There is no "right" to arbitrarily name somebody that you claim immunity from being forced to testify against.These BENEFITS are not rights.With that said, I challenge you to show me any case where such a "benefit" has been ruled as a right SEPARATE FROM marriage itself.

Obviously the courts do in your opinion...you will say something to the effect of "the state can't discriminate based on anything with regard to marriage without state interest"..."state interet" being another term defined by the court depending on the day. So you say well not having gay marriage is not in the interest of the state although two state courts decided it was. Why? Because all of a sudden you know what a legitmate state interest is and your opinion is more correct then those XXXXXX in the courts...It is just interesting how the constitution always agrees with you.

The difference is that blacks weren't trying to change the definition of what a seat was in order to be able to sit there. Perhaps it's a couple that can't afford it for some reason. Maybe one is an invalid and can't get to the court house. It really doesn't matter because the principles are the same, and that's the bottom line here: It's unnecessary discrimination.Again I ask, what do you think is involved with marriage from the state's perspective OTHER than the benefits? You seem to think there's something magical from the state's point of view about marriage. From the STATE'S perspective, a marriage is tantamount for NOTHING other than the giving of benefits. There's no other interest by the state OTHER than that. Get it? Perhaps you'd like to enlighten everyone about all the NON-benefit matters of marriage in terms of the state, since you seem to think they are there. Holy cow!! You already have the right to get married, Foundit--to anyone or anything you so choose. Nobody is going to block the door of the chapel!!! You just won't get benefits for it.  That's the ONLY interest the state has!! What other interest do you think they have, Foundit??? Tell me!! The only reason they recognize ANYONE'S marriage would be to give benefits.If you don't understand this simple matter, I don't see how we can proceed any further.

If a black man chooses to ride at the back of the bus, that isn't discrimination.It's when a person IS REFUSED to be allowed the choice to ride at the front, that is discrimination.If a gay man chooses not to marry, that's his choice to make.That's irrelevant to discrimination.Do you think that blacks choosing to ride at the back of the bus meant anything regarding discrimination? Or was it the fact that their ONLY choice was the back which defined the discrimination...No. It wasn't an "argument".It was an observation about the contradictions within the anti-gay marriage position.But I see you took my observation out of context, and pretended my statement was something it wasn't.Not surprising...."can't"?Who "can't" get a marriage license that would receive "financial reasons" for wanting one?Enlighten me. Are you talking about something real, or just purely made up...It's a lump package.No substitutions.Take it or leave it...Or change it, but changing it is a different argument.Yeah.... YOU keep talking about "couples' benefits".Let's cut through the XXXX.MARRIAGE is a right.The benefits associated with marriage ARE NOT a "right", persay...The state could decide to alter one of those benefits at any time. Remove one from the list. Add another. That's a state decision. The court wouldn't bat an eye.The only thing is that those benefits are ATTACHED to marriage, which is a right.Ergo, if you want to talk about giving non-married couples the "benefits", go for it. But it's not a "rights" issue.YOU want to focus on the benefits, and you're entitled to do that.But it IS a separate issue.And here we have a false-hood, ladies and gentlemen.What he is about to describe is not my "logic".My "logic" revolves around legitimate state interests and the RIGHT of marriage.This isn't my argument.This is your attempt to boil away the essential details from my argument, and then rephrase my argument so you can joust with a strawman.Marriage "benefits" are not a right. MARRIAGE ITSELF is a right. And as such, it is subject to the scrutiny of the 14th amendment.If you can show me any court ruling that says marriage BENEFITS THEMSELVES are a right, you could make progress in pretending you have an argument.Until then, you don't got squat.No. It's not. And it's amazing you are keeping this XXXX up this long...What you are talking about is a HETEROSEXUAL COUPLE who wants a BENEFIT associated with marriage, but DOES NOT WANT to marry.What I am talking about is a HOMOSEXUAL COUPLE who wants to MARRY. Period.Marriage is a right.The benefits are ASSOCIATED with marriage, but they are not a right.Double WoW!Do you get what "marriage" is? At all?The benefits are there to help the marriage.And now you think that the BENEFITS are the central issue, and you don't understand the state's perspective ON marriage???Why do you think the benefits exist in the first place?It's BECAUSE of the marriage.The marriage came first.Your whole current presentation is like arguing that people should get the "tax deduction" for having a kid, even though they don't have a kid. That it's "discriminatory" to not give them a tax deducation for a kid they don't have.And NOW, you're even fixating more on the TAX DEDUCTION while you ignore the KID and the PURPOSE of the tax deduction's presence in the first place.And historically, the "right of marriage" has been one of denial.Like I pointed out, the marriage license owes its origins to the attempt to prevent blacks and whites from inter-marrying.Here, the "right of marriage" is about keeping gays from marrying.And on another level, I can't help but wonder if you can appreciate how when the anti-gay crowd illogically complains about gays "damaging" marriage, what you are suggesting is ACTUALLY DAMAGING marriage.Currently, marriage offers benefits AND responsibilities.Kind of like having your cake, but then you have to exercise afterwards to burn off the calories.What YOU want is a buffet WITHOUT responsibility. Which will allow couples who WOULD marry to ask more and more why they should marry if all they have to do is to sign up for "benefits" with no committment.You don't seem to get that part of the reason that they DO get the benefits is because they HAVE made the committment. A committment you now want to neuter.People complain about gays wrecking marriage, but it's ideas like yours which are the REAL threat...

Since he apparently thinks that from the state's POV that marriage and the giving of marriage benefits are not the same thing, I'm now pretty much of the conclusion that he simply doesn't understand the issue. Apparently he doesn't realize that when people talk about "the right to marry", they are simply talking about the right for the govt. to recognize their marriage in order to give them benefits. emoticonXWow Anyone can marry anyone at any time. They can make a lifelong commitment, have a big cake, lots of guests and all the champagne they want if they so choose. The govt. doesn't care--the only role they play in terms of that marriage is regarding govt. benefits.

This coming from the guy who is arguing that the BENEFIT of marriage is something that sees discrimination when a heterosexual couple chooses NOT to marry, that's a laugh riot.I have told a variety of people your argument to try and look for a better way to explain your error to you.The majority response so far is "Why are you even bothering with him?"If you can quote me where I claimed the BENEFIT ITSELF was a right, independent of marriage, that would be a start.Until then, this is just another lame situation where you have an "opinion" that I said something that I didn't actually say, and you'll "believe" that I had a stance thatSarcasm is not an argument.Your refusal to acknowledge reality is not an argument.Fact #1) SCOTUS has acknowledged marriage is a right multiple times in multiple rulings.Fact #2) The 9th amendment is interpreted in acknowledging that the list of "rights" in the constitution is not pretended to be a complete one. Rights of the people do exist that are not listed in the constitution.Marriage is one of those rights.Fact #3) I do not claim marriage is a right "defined by" the 14th amendment.Ignore those facts as you will. Attempt to obfuscate reality if you must.It's not working...Just because you can't keep up doesn't mean it's "all over the place".There is a consistency here on two fronts.A consistency on my side, whereby my arguments have remained consistent over time.And a consistency where you attempt to misrepresent my argument, and pretend that your misrepresentation is an argument....Actually, I have no problem with the states defining marriage in a CONSTITUTIONAL manner.It's when their definition VIOLATES the constitution that the courts must correct the mistake.If the definition is constitutional, then the state legislation definition stands.A subtlety, but an important one.A fact you shouldn't misrepresent.You keep pretending snide remarks are arguments.They aren't.The state can SAY what "interest" they have put forth for justifying discrimination.The COURTS say whether or not the interest is "legitimate".Being majority vote does not make it "legitimate".Laws based solely on religious beliefs are not "legitimate"."Legislative disapproval of homosexuality alone is not enough to justify any measures the legislature might choose to express its disapproval. Under the rational basis test, there must be a showing that the measures adopted have a rational relationship to a legitimate legislative concern. "http://www.kscourts.org/kscases/ctap...0130/85898.htmYour snide remarks are not evidence of anything but your own disapproval, which is not an argument.Steeeeve, if you want we can GO BACK AND EXAMINE their claimed "legitimate state interests" that they ruled on.Like the pretense of "procreation", when it's obvious that procreation is a standard applied SOLELY to gays and straight couples who can obviously NOT procreate are excluded.We can go back and poke holes in their rulings if you like, and show why they aren't legitimate.And you can sit back and talk snidely about things without actually making an argument.Would you like that?ROFLMAO!And I suppose it's your position that the constitution agrees with you?Are you AGAIN criticizing me for something YOU YOURSELF are guilty of?Answer me truthfully. Is it not also accurate to say that you present arguments were "the constitution always agrees with you"???But regardless, there are plenty of constitutional rulings that I don't like, but I support regardless. The Boy Scouts have a right to discriminate. I don't like it, but I understand the underlying principle and support it.I can point to court rulings which CLEARLY establish the rules and boundaries I am talking about. And I HAVE done precisely that.

But they WERE trying to change the meaning of the "black section" and the "white section" of the bus..."can't afford it"?Quite frankly, I have no problem making it free.In fact, I think a constitutional argument similar to the "polling tax" issue could be raised against the issue of requiring a fee to engage in the right of marriage."The 1966 Supreme Court case Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections extended this explicit enactment as a matter of judicial interpretation of a more general provision, ruling that the imposition of a poll tax in state elections violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution."I don't know enough about the specifics of the case to see if nuances would distinguish between the two outcomes..."invalid"? I believe a simple notary would be all that is required.What else do you got?What other non-real excuses can you make up?What do you think is involved with bus seating from the state's perspective?You don't seem to get that the benefits DO NOT MATTER.The 14th amendment does not require that the discrimination be qualified as monetary. It just talks about the discrimination and the JUSTIFICATION for the discrimination.Your question is irrelevant. When the marriage license first came, it was JUST about the license. Then the government started steadily adding on benefits until now the list is above 1,000.Your pretense as to how the "state's perceive" marriage is irrelevant.Like I said, it just plain DOES NOT MATTER.Marriage is a RIGHT. period. Unequivocably.Even if there were no benefits, the discrimination of marriage WOULD STILL be wrong.If blacks had to sit on the left side, and whites on the right of the bus, it would still be ILLEGAL DISCRIMINATION. It doesn't matter if one seat is better than the other. Governmental recognition.Discrimination exists in governmental recognition.The "Loving" couple in Virginia had a "right" to get married in some chapel if they pleased, but they DID NOT have the right to the governmental recognition.As long as the governmental recognition still exists, the constitutional argument is still valid and contestable.You don't get that I can boil my case away of all the smoke-screen that you throw out there, and it's STILL the same.My argument doesn't reside on the benefits.I don't see why your pretense is legitimate?Marriage, and its legal recognition, preceded the benefits.If you listen to people talking about the benefits of marriage upon society (Note, DIFFERENT from the benefits the government gives married couples)...... you'll see that it is virtually devoid of any mention of the "governmental benefits" list itself.It helps make society more stable. It strengthens familial bonds.ALL of these are reasons why government has an interest in marriage that DO NOT RESIDE upon the governmental benefits.You want an answer to your question?Because it BENEFITS SOCIETY. That is why the government has an interest in marriage.

The difference is that blacks weren't trying to change the definition of what a seat was in order to be able to sit there. Perhaps it's a couple that can't afford it for some reason. Maybe one is an invalid and can't get to the court house. It really doesn't matter because the principles are the same, and that's the bottom line here: It's unnecessary discrimination.Again I ask, what do you think is involved with marriage from the state's perspective OTHER than the benefits? You seem to think there's something magical from the state's point of view about marriage. From the STATE'S perspective, a marriage is tantamount for NOTHING other than the giving of benefits. There's no other interest by the state OTHER than that. Get it? Perhaps you'd like to enlighten everyone about all the NON-benefit matters of marriage in terms of the state, since you seem to think they are there. Holy cow!! You already have the right to get married, Foundit--to anyone or anything you so choose. Nobody is going to block the door of the chapel!!! You just won't get benefits for it.  That's the ONLY interest the state has!! What other interest do you think they have, Foundit??? Tell me!! The only reason they recognize ANYONE'S marriage would be to give benefits.If you don't understand this simple matter, I don't see how we can proceed any further.

You will undoubtable try to claim that you meant it was "with marriage" are you are already backing out of your claim. http://4forums.com/political/showpos...6&postcount=62You wrote in response to "The point there was that marriage benefits themselves aren't even guaranteed by the constitution.""The marriage benefits and rights and privileges are protected under the 14th amendment as well."awaiting your "you misrepresent me you liar" post....Its the 9th amendment now? dang...well I guess your above comments are out.

This coming from the guy who is arguing that the BENEFIT of marriage is something that sees discrimination when a heterosexual couple chooses NOT to marry, that's a laugh riot.I have told a variety of people your argument to try and look for a better way to explain your error to you.The majority response so far is "Why are you even bothering with him?"If you can quote me where I claimed the BENEFIT ITSELF was a right, independent of marriage, that would be a start.Until then, this is just another lame situation where you have an "opinion" that I said something that I didn't actually say, and you'll "believe" that I had a stance thatSarcasm is not an argument.Your refusal to acknowledge reality is not an argument.Fact #1) SCOTUS has acknowledged marriage is a right multiple times in multiple rulings.Fact #2) The 9th amendment is interpreted in acknowledging that the list of "rights" in the constitution is not pretended to be a complete one. Rights of the people do exist that are not listed in the constitution.Marriage is one of those rights.Fact #3) I do not claim marriage is a right "defined by" the 14th amendment.Ignore those facts as you will. Attempt to obfuscate reality if you must.It's not working...Just because you can't keep up doesn't mean it's "all over the place".There is a consistency here on two fronts.A consistency on my side, whereby my arguments have remained consistent over time.And a consistency where you attempt to misrepresent my argument, and pretend that your misrepresentation is an argument....Actually, I have no problem with the states defining marriage in a CONSTITUTIONAL manner.It's when their definition VIOLATES the constitution that the courts must correct the mistake.If the definition is constitutional, then the state legislation definition stands.A subtlety, but an important one.A fact you shouldn't misrepresent.You keep pretending snide remarks are arguments.They aren't.The state can SAY what "interest" they have put forth for justifying discrimination.The COURTS say whether or not the interest is "legitimate".Being majority vote does not make it "legitimate".Laws based solely on religious beliefs are not "legitimate"."Legislative disapproval of homosexuality alone is not enough to justify any measures the legislature might choose to express its disapproval. Under the rational basis test, there must be a showing that the measures adopted have a rational relationship to a legitimate legislative concern. "http://www.kscourts.org/kscases/ctap...0130/85898.htmYour snide remarks are not evidence of anything but your own disapproval, which is not an argument.Steeeeve, if you want we can GO BACK AND EXAMINE their claimed "legitimate state interests" that they ruled on.Like the pretense of "procreation", when it's obvious that procreation is a standard applied SOLELY to gays and straight couples who can obviously NOT procreate are excluded.We can go back and poke holes in their rulings if you like, and show why they aren't legitimate.And you can sit back and talk snidely about things without actually making an argument.Would you like that?ROFLMAO!And I suppose it's your position that the constitution agrees with you?Are you AGAIN criticizing me for something YOU YOURSELF are guilty of?Answer me truthfully. Is it not also accurate to say that you present arguments were "the constitution always agrees with you"???But regardless, there are plenty of constitutional rulings that I don't like, but I support regardless. The Boy Scouts have a right to discriminate. I don't like it, but I understand the underlying principle and support it.I can point to court rulings which CLEARLY establish the rules and boundaries I am talking about. And I HAVE done precisely that.

Tell me.When the state recognizes a marriage, does it sit near the exit door and hand the newlywed couple a bag of "benefits" as a parting gift?Or is it more of a case that they get married, and then SEPARATELY OTHER LEGISLATION that says married couples have this benefit and that benefit kick in.I'm amazed that you don't realize how distinct and separate the two are.Like I said, evidently uncontested, the state could go through and neuter virtually EVERY BENEFIT THEY ASSIGN with marriage, and it would still be a marriage.Your problem is that you are confusing the car accessories with the car itself. The car accessories are there to help the car, but the accessories don't MAKE it a car.Heck, a married couple could refuse their "benefits" left and right and they would STILL BE MARRIED.The man and woman could get separate insurance. They could not make claims on each others pensions. They could willingly testify against each other in court (if I understand this right correctly).Even without the benefits, the marriage STILL EXISTS.Sanctity of marriage?You two are REALLY disturbing in how you seem to think marriage is JUST the benefits. THAT is a REAL threat to the sanctity of marriage... emoticonXWow ROFLMAO!You "two" get really lost in the big picture. Missing the forest for the trees and all.I'm the one who "doesn't understand"?Tell me. WHO ELSE is perpetuating this comedy routine you two are currently engaged in?Is ANYBODY ELSE trying to promulgate that the benefits associated with marriage ARE RIGHTS UNTO THEMSELVES??? Is ANYBODY else trying to proclaim that the state's interest in marriage is JUST to GIVE BENEFITS???My gawd man. You think I don't understand "the issue"?I don't think you get the fact that you and the cheese are standing alone, squeaking loudly without support.And again Jyoshu tries to obfuscate the issue.When people talk about "the right to marry", they are talking about the right TO MARRY.Often, they know that there is a laundry list of benefits and responsibilities that come with it. Sometimes, THEY DON'T.I have come across a variety of people that just plain ARE NOT AWARE that marriage affords them benefits. Or at least so they say...Does that mean they aren't really married?Marriage, at its core, isn't about the presents.Even if a married couple elope and don't get any presents, they are still married.And likewise, if tomorrow the government decided to try and strip marriage of all its benefits, it would STILL BE MARRIAGE.That is what you don't get...WRONG!You don't seem to get that the government accounting office's list involves Benefits and RESPONSIBILITIES.Responsibilities like spousal support. Responsibilities that talk about the committment BETWEEN the partners.Tell me Jyoshu. Do you really not get that the purpose of marriage IS NOT the benefits?Earlier we talked about SOME couples who got together for the benefits, and just for the benefits, but they are few and far between.The government's interest in recognizing marriage DOES NOT rest upon a desire on the part of the government to hand out party gifts.It rests on the fact that marriage BENEFITS SOCIETY.THAT is their interest.The "benefits" help FURTHER that interest by helping make things easier for the couple, but if you think that the purpose of the government's involvement is just benefits, then you are sadly mistaken...

Since he apparently thinks that from the state's POV that marriage and the giving of marriage benefits are not the same thing, I'm now pretty much of the conclusion that he simply doesn't understand the issue. Apparently he doesn't realize that when people talk about "the right to marry", they are simply talking about the right for the govt. to recognize their marriage in order to give them benefits. emoticonXWow Anyone can marry anyone at any time. They can make a lifelong commitment, have a big cake, lots of guests and all the champagne they want if they so choose. The govt. doesn't care--the only role they play in terms of that marriage is regarding govt. benefits.

The funny thing is that you seem to ALREADY UNDERSTAND the error you have made in trying to paraphrase my statements.When I said "MARRIAGE benefits", of course I was talking about "with marriage". The word "marriage" was a qualifier for the phrase "marriage benefits".I was not saying that the BENEFITS ALONE are rights.I've explained this in other posts.

Your willingness to pretend that misrepresentation of my statements is an argument.The viewing audience will note that Steeeeve habitually CLAIMS that I said this or that, or that I'm changing from this or that, but he DOES NOT PROVE his claim. Even above, when he actually made a SINGULAR ATTEMPT to back up his claim, he UNDERSTOOD as he misrepresented my statements what I was going to say in response.He ALREADY UNDERSTOOD what I was going to say my comment meant.But he chooses to disbelieve my statements on my comments, and go for his own misrepresentation instead...Again, are you guilty of this?You keep complaining about things that you are guilty of.Again, snide comments are not an argument.Your ignorance of legal history is not an argument.The fact that the majority alone does not constitute "legitimate" is obvious. The reasoning just as obvious.The constitution repeatedly protects the rights of the minorities from the "tyranny of the majority".Every single piece of legislation that SCOTUS has overturned which lacked a legitimate state interest had a MAJORITY VOTE which brought it into law. Miscegenation laws. Sodomy laws.That fact alone should demonstrate that "majority" alone does not mean "legitimate".As for "what standard", I would recommend you research for yourself at this stage of the game.I mean, I'm all willing to help educate your ignorance, which you are obviously displaying in snide comments left and right, but typical summary that I give on the issue of "state interest" is on another computer, and I lack the inclination to type a new one just so you can misrepresent and ignore it...Actually, no. But thanks for the demonstration that you once again get it wrong when trying to pretend to give my position...I'm working off the existing definition of "legitimate", which has a variety of portions. One of those portions is consistency and equality.Like how people could claim reading is a legitimate state interest for voting, but then violate the "legitimate" state interest by applying the reading requirement TO ONLY ONE RACE. Blacks.Or how people could claim "procreation" is a legitimate state interest for marriage, but then violate the "legitimate" state interest by applying a procreation requirement TO ONLY GAY COUPLES and never to straight couples.Same here, with the example I gave.We were both wrong. Isn't that refreshing?Or am I going to be the only one to admit it...And again, arguments made out of snide comments and ignorance.The legal precedents establishing that marriage is a right go back for decades.The legal precedents establishing requirements for legitimate state interest in rights discrimination go back even further.Once again, you FAIL to argue against the actual point.

Wow, you tried to refute it after you realize you screwed up...what else is new. The question you responded to was very clear and your response is clear....atleast be man enough to admit you were wrong. When you say "protected under the 14th amendment as well" it doesn't mean "with". Keep backtracking... its funnyYes it does....it doesn't say they are protected by the constitution....but you try to somehow bring in the 14th amendment to say SOME rights can't be denied now....well, they can unless you believe in substantive due process which you do. The SOME rights is a list that is unclearThey weren't saying marriage is a right protected by the constitution if that is what you are asking. You can look at the Lawerence v. Texas case or actually follow the court to see a majority of the justices use the word "liberty" in the 14th amendment to defend marriage, abortion, etc. Your refusal to actually follow the history of the constitution prior to 1950 is the reason you can't get beyond these mysterious rights in the 9th and 14th amendment. Atleast the justices on the supreme court admit they evolved into the constitution...you just claim they were always there...crazyI'm not the one that finds rights outta no where.Yeah it does in some cases but that doesn't make a majority not a "legitimate" state interest. Why can't you find a standard? It should be easy since everything you have is based on that. I did my homework, the "state interest" tends to be what the "evolving constitution" dictates. Look at Texas v lawerence...they found no state-interest because.....wait....oh, right, they didn't like the law as it was "unfair". Oh a definition of state interest. Where did it come from? OUT OF THIN AIR a state interest must include equality. The odd thing is your definition says "you can't not be equal unless you have a state interest which includes people being equal". In other words, everything fails your test. haha, keep drinking that kool aid...goes down smooth.Do you agree with the reasoning in the case or just the outcome (as based on how you see the law...obviously you don't like the outcome in a moral sense)?precedent doesn't mean anything if it is wrong. The Loving case (one of the first living constitutional cases) was incorrectly reasoned....anyone with an orginial understanding of the constitution admits this and its in fact a critizism of it. At the time of Loving where did you get that right from? You can't claim precedent if you can't tell me how it orginally came about.

That's what I'M saying. You're the one who seems to think that the govt. has some TWO things going on: marriage and the giving of marriage benefits. The giving of marriage benefits IS the interest the govt. has in recognizing marriage. That's ALL it's about, from their perspective. I can't believe you don't get this. Uh, no. If the state stopped giving marriage benefits, then they no longer have a reason to recognize marriage. There's no point. From the state's POV, marriage is a non-legal matter at that point. Why would they need to still recognize it? They could have made a commitment and a ceremony or whatever, but if they aren't getting marriage benefits, their marriage is irrelevant to the govt. What else does the govt. DO for couples other than give them benefits for marriage? Dude, this is just downright hateful of you to say, not to mention just wrong. It's YOU who seems to think marriage and govt are interrelated here. YOU'RE the one who doesn't seem to get that you can get married anytime without the benefits, RIGHT NOW. And I've stated, in posting to YOU before that I'd be married even if I weren't getting benefits, so you and I both know you are just chain yanking. If I still had any respect for you remaining whatsoever, it just went right out the window.You DON'T get it. You haven't been listening. Listen carefully: It's not the "benefits" that are the right--it's the govt's GIVING OF THE BENEFITS that we're talking about here. That's what you, as a gay person, are fighting for. There's no substance to govt. marriage OTHER than it's giving of benefits. That IS the right you seek. Is this getting through in any way whatsoever? Because it's clear as crystal. And that's one more than is on your team right now, on this issue. You DON'T understand the issue. That's pretty obvious at this point.OMG!!!!! emoticonXBanghead emoticonXBanghead That's exactly what I've been trying to get you to see!!!!  Could you stoop to ANY further level of dishonesty here???? Did you just decided to change your argument since you know you were wrong??? Yes, if the govt. stopped giving benefits, marriage would go on. There's a reason (duh!) That's because the only interest the state has in marriage is to give benefits!!!! I already told you, you can get married ANYTIME. No one is going to block the door to the chapel. You just won't get the benefits? Remember, we've already been over all this. But I'm glad you're finally realizing that marriage and the benefits (the government's part) are two separate things. That's a good sign that maybe you're starting to understand how all this works a bit better (even though you're trying to pretend you were of that thinking all along)LOL!!!!!! Foundit, those "responsibilities" ARE benefits. Do you not realize that it BENEFITS the spouse for the other spouse to have that responsibility? Do you not realize it's a BENEFIT to the children for the couple to support it? Those demands of resposibility ARE BENEFITS.I'm not even going to validate that with a response because you know good and well YOU'RE the one who needs to be asked that question.

I do care about it, that is why I tried to explain to you that men and women are just plain old everyday people. Your man / woman concept of marriage illustrates a preoccupation with "the flesh", a conflict of interest to your spirit.

WAIT! Did you just define marraige as something? Fine, I define it has a man and a woman...not just two people. If you can define it why can't I?they can't get benefits if they don't want to marry...just like a gay person can't get benefits if they dont want to marry (in this case a woman). You make it seem like it is literally impossible for a gay person to marry...when it is not....they just can't do it in the means they want. Same with a single person.And thats the point...if two single people want to share the benefits but don't want to get married as they have no "romantic" involvement then why are saying they can't get benefits for your type can...DISCRIMINATION! :pIt is so funny to hear you guys talk about this and pretty much use the same arguments that your anti-gay marriage folks use. Things like "that's not the definition of marriage" and "marriage is a union between two people...not single people living together". HAHA, this is exactly why I don't support your cause, because you are just arguing the same thing the other side is...you just want to draw a different line. The least you can do is just admit that and stop this "equality" BS that you don't really care about.

You just refuse to get this.The MARRIAGE benefits are "protected under the 14th amendment as well" BECAUSE they are associated with marriage.When not associated with marriage, they have NO 14TH AMENDMENT protections.Ergo, if a man and a woman are married, and the law says that married couples must have duo insurance benefits, then an insurance company cannot come along and arbitrarily say that a white married couple qualifies, but a black married couple does not.BUT, if a NON-MARRIED couple tries to apply for protection, THEY HAVE NO GUARANTEE if their benefit is applied for WITHOUT MARRIAGE.All of this is consistent.I have been backing up EACH STATEMENT WITH EXAMPLES which should have helped explain it to you.It's you who refuses to accurately repeat what I am saying.You're desparate to try for any kind of contradiction, because you have no real argument otherwise...Coming from you, that's hilarious.Isn't there some little 14-year old girl, who happens to be a rape victim, that you want to pick on and call names?The NINTH AMENDMENT ESTABLISHES that they are unclear.It EXPLICITLY states that there IS NO LIST of rights in the constitution that is exclusive. Some rights STILL EXIST which are not listed in the constitution.Our founding fathers were not trying to make an exhaustive list, and they acknowledged they didn't in the 9th amendment.The truly bizarre thing is that I am not so much arguing a point with you now as trying to get you to ACCURATELY RELAY MY POSITION. You keep trying to distort it over and over again, and claim I said this or that in some vague terms, but you aren't actually ARGUING against anything I said.Like this:When I talk about the 14th amendment, I am referring to how it TREATS RIGHTS.When I talk about the 9th amendment, I am referring to how it ESTABLISHES THE EXISTENCE OF NON-ENUMERATED rights.The 14th amendment, under the equal protection clause, PROTECTS RIGHTS.The really stupid thing about this discussion is that a LOT of what I am saying is not really debatable. This IS how the courts are applying these concepts.But you're trying to turn confusion into an argument, because you've got nothing else...Actually, that is PRECISELY what they were saying.Loving v Virginia BOTH repeated the fact that marriage is a right, and ALSO established that its thinking for its ruling was that it was protecting that right under equal protection by insuring that a legitimate state interest exists before discrimination can occur.That IS what happened.Enough of this stupid misinterpretation XXXX.Steeeeve, YOU EXPLAIN what you think Loving v Virginia did.1) Did it state explicitly that marriage was a right?2) Did it use the fact that marriage is a right, and the 14th amendment, to rule that the Loving's right to marriage could not be denied and must be protected?

Wow, you tried to refute it after you realize you screwed up...what else is new. The question you responded to was very clear and your response is clear....atleast be man enough to admit you were wrong. When you say "protected under the 14th amendment as well" it doesn't mean "with". Keep backtracking... its funnyYes it does....it doesn't say they are protected by the constitution....but you try to somehow bring in the 14th amendment to say SOME rights can't be denied now....well, they can unless you believe in substantive due process which you do. The SOME rights is a list that is unclearThey weren't saying marriage is a right protected by the constitution if that is what you are asking. You can look at the Lawerence v. Texas case or actually follow the court to see a majority of the justices use the word "liberty" in the 14th amendment to defend marriage, abortion, etc. Your refusal to actually follow the history of the constitution prior to 1950 is the reason you can't get beyond these mysterious rights in the 9th and 14th amendment. Atleast the justices on the supreme court admit they evolved into the constitution...you just claim they were always there...crazyI'm not the one that finds rights outta no where.Yeah it does in some cases but that doesn't make a majority not a "legitimate" state interest. Why can't you find a standard? It should be easy since everything you have is based on that. I did my homework, the "state interest" tends to be what the "evolving constitution" dictates. Look at Texas v lawerence...they found no state-interest because.....wait....oh, right, they didn't like the law as it was "unfair". Oh a definition of state interest. Where did it come from? OUT OF THIN AIR a state interest must include equality. The odd thing is your definition says "you can't not be equal unless you have a state interest which includes people being equal". In other words, everything fails your test. haha, keep drinking that kool aid...goes down smooth.Do you agree with the reasoning in the case or just the outcome (as based on how you see the law...obviously you don't like the outcome in a moral sense)?precedent doesn't mean anything if it is wrong. The Loving case (one of the first living constitutional cases) was incorrectly reasoned....anyone with an orginial understanding of the constitution admits this and its in fact a critizism of it. At the time of Loving where did you get that right from? You can't claim precedent if you can't tell me how it orginally came about.

Anyone with a brain can see you contradicted yourself...sigh, there is no hope for you.None that I know of.ok...but there must be some basis for you deciding marriage is one of these so called "rights". If there isn't a list I'd like to know where you got it from.confusion? I'm not the one creating rights outta no where, applying them using a different amendment, claiming things NO JUSTICE CLAIMS and then saying someone else is confusing the post. Every right you claim is actually done using substantive due process and normally not your beloved 9th amendment.So now the Warren court are the founding fathers? Atleast you admit your thinking starts in the 1950s. So you think justices should create rights? I still don't recall Loving saying the "right to marry" is in the 9th amendment. "These statutes also deprive the Lovings of liberty without due process of law in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. "I also disagree with that statement...but thats a different story

You just refuse to get this.The MARRIAGE benefits are "protected under the 14th amendment as well" BECAUSE they are associated with marriage.When not associated with marriage, they have NO 14TH AMENDMENT protections.Ergo, if a man and a woman are married, and the law says that married couples must have duo insurance benefits, then an insurance company cannot come along and arbitrarily say that a white married couple qualifies, but a black married couple does not.BUT, if a NON-MARRIED couple tries to apply for protection, THEY HAVE NO GUARANTEE if their benefit is applied for WITHOUT MARRIAGE.All of this is consistent.I have been backing up EACH STATEMENT WITH EXAMPLES which should have helped explain it to you.It's you who refuses to accurately repeat what I am saying.You're desparate to try for any kind of contradiction, because you have no real argument otherwise...Coming from you, that's hilarious.Isn't there some little 14-year old girl, who happens to be a rape victim, that you want to pick on and call names?The NINTH AMENDMENT ESTABLISHES that they are unclear.It EXPLICITLY states that there IS NO LIST of rights in the constitution that is exclusive. Some rights STILL EXIST which are not listed in the constitution.Our founding fathers were not trying to make an exhaustive list, and they acknowledged they didn't in the 9th amendment.The truly bizarre thing is that I am not so much arguing a point with you now as trying to get you to ACCURATELY RELAY MY POSITION.

I do care about it, that is why I tried to explain to you that men and women are just plain old everyday people. Your man / woman concept of marriage illustrates a preoccupation with "the flesh", a conflict of interest to your spirit.

No. I didn't.All you're doing is claiming over and over again that I did.The truly hilarious part is that you RECOGNIZED what I was trying to say in one of my posts, but you chose to believe ANOTHER INTERPRETATION that would mean contradiction instead.Ignoring me when I repeated what I was ACTUALLY SAYING, to instead believe that I was saying something I said I wasn't saying.Anyone with a brain can see you're REALLLY reaching with all this.You are losing out on actually HAVING any arguments, so instead you try to claim contradictions where there are none.Did you scare off that girl you were bullying?Haven't found any other 14-year old rape victims to bully?Too bad...See, THIS is part of my proof for why you have almost NO REAL READING comprehension.THIS is part of my proof for why your claims to "remember" things is pure and utter XXXX.OVER and OVER again, I have stated that Loving v Virginia establishes marriage is a right.But here, you can't seem to recognize your question has already been answered numerous times.HOW can you claim to comprehend what I'm saying when you CLEARLY CAN'T REMEMBER the things I repeat for you?1) Not "outta no where".Loving v Virginia establishes marriage is a right.2) "applying them using a different amendment"???Again, WHY do you think that is a problem?The 14th amendment applies to ALL rights.3) "no justice claims" There are a variety of courts that clearly disagree with you on this.4) You are confusing the post.THIS SENTENCE of yours is a perfect example.NONE of what I said above is new.But you disregard it all for your own misinterpretation."due process" is a legal concept we APPLY TO rights."Due process" actually also creates some rights.But it doesn't create the right of marriage.For marriage, it's an APPLICATION to rights.What the heck do the "founding fathers" have to do with this.The marriage license, and the right of legal marriage recognition, came AFTER the founding fathers. It was used as a tool to enforce miscegenation laws.Just because the founding fathers didn't say something doesn't mean it's not applicable.I think you've got your head stuck too much in the philosophy of needing people who have been dead for hundreds of years to tell you how to think...1) Justice acknowledge the existence of rights.2) Actually, I use "Loving" because of its multiple conveniences.They CITE PRECEDENT acknowledging the existence of marriage. OTHER CASES BEFORE which explicitly stated that marriage is a right.3) And, as always, you try to distort and malign simple English to come away with bizarre conclusions as to what is being said.The "right to marry" is not "in" the 9th amendment.The 9th amendment acknowledges the existence of NON-ENUMERATED RIGHTS, which allows the courts to do away with any stupid argument that "marriage isn't in the constitution, and thus not a right".THAT is what the 9th amendment does.No. I think it's the same story.You two are playing an inane routine whereby you want to try and distort my position into a laughable farce...... but here is something that I want to know about what you ACTUALLY believe.Do you think Loving v Virginia should have been decided so that the Loving couple's marriage SHOULD NOT be recognized by the state?I believe you may have already answered this, but I would love a refresher, also a straight answer for the viewing audience....

What you don't get is that there are MULTIPLE PIECES OF LEGISLATION on this. And they all have INDEPENDENT ASPECTS.There are laws establishing the requirements for legal recognition of marriage.There are OTHER LAWS establishing the benefits and privileges which are associated with marriage.OTHER laws.Do you REALLY THINK that the government is recognizing marriage just so it can give out benefits to married people?NO. It recognizes marriage because marriage HELPS SOCIETY and its stability.Hell. Even YOUR SIDE argues that much, so it truly baffles me this position I see whereby you seem to think marriage is ABOUT THE BENEFITS for the government.The benefits are there to HELP the marriage.Not to BE the point of the marriage. Marriage enhances society's stability.THAT is why they give benefits for marriage.Which came first Jyoshu?Governmental recognition of the marriage license?Or the laundry list of over 1,000 benefits that come with marriage?The government's involvement is to help strengthen the marriage bond.THAT is their purpose for being involved in marriage.WHY do they want to strengthen the marriage bond?Because marriages AID SOCIETY. It's the fricken truth.ANYBODY who wants to trivialize marriage by separating the marriage benefits FROM THE MARRIAGE ITSELF is only helping to damage marriage.Dick and Jane don't need to get married to get on each others insurance.Dick and Jane don't need to "commit" to anything to get the benefits of marriage.They can get the "benefits" without the "hassle" of the marriage committment, by what you are talking about.It's not "hateful".It's an accurate observation of the conclusion of what you are advocating.Jyoshu. Please write this down.Write it down a 100 times on a blackboard if necessary.I GET the fact that I can "marry" at any time without governmental recognition.The point is that, by the constitution, that should not be MY ONLY OPTION.Do you think somebody could have just told the "Loving" couple of Loving v Virginia that "you can just get married in a chapel, without governmental recognition"...Would that be acceptable to them?No. I'm not.Would you give the same approach to the Loving couple?There are significant ideals in play here that you are blindly disregarding in your desire for me to not have legal recognition of marriage.MOREOVER, it's interesting to note that your "interest" in marriage IS PURELY GOVERNMENTAL.You obviously don't care that I can "marry" without the government. You don't care that this is legal for me.You ONLY CARE about the LEGAL definition of marriage...Jyoshu. You're revealing more about YOURSELF than you are about me...Oh wow.I thought we had been on the same page on that for quite some time now.I guess not.But now it's equal, eh?Wow.

Here's a challenge for you...Show me ANY COURT RULING, or even a court challenge if you can't find a ruling, whereby people have stated that the "GIVING OF THE BENEFITS" is a factor guaranteed by the constitution independent of marriage.Can you do that?What you don't seem to want to get is that I don't see ANYBODY ELSE trying this stupid farce that you and Steeeeve are trying to pull off.You're arguing something out of a fantasy book. Not out of constitutional precedent.Over and over again, I give legal precedents for my statements. Loving v Virginia. Lawrence v Texas.

That's what I'M saying. You're the one who seems to think that the govt. has some TWO things going on: marriage and the giving of marriage benefits. The giving of marriage benefits IS the interest the govt. has in recognizing marriage. That's ALL it's about, from their perspective. I can't believe you don't get this. Uh, no. If the state stopped giving marriage benefits, then they no longer have a reason to recognize marriage. There's no point. From the state's POV, marriage is a non-legal matter at that point. Why would they need to still recognize it? They could have made a commitment and a ceremony or whatever, but if they aren't getting marriage benefits, their marriage is irrelevant to the govt. What else does the govt. DO for couples other than give them benefits for marriage? Dude, this is just downright hateful of you to say, not to mention just wrong. It's YOU who seems to think marriage and govt are interrelated here. YOU'RE the one who doesn't seem to get that you can get married anytime without the benefits, RIGHT NOW. And I've stated, in posting to YOU before that I'd be married even if I weren't getting benefits, so you and I both know you are just chain yanking. If I still had any respect for you remaining whatsoever, it just went right out the window.You DON'T get it. You haven't been listening. Listen carefully: It's not the "benefits" that are the right--it's the govt's GIVING OF THE BENEFITS that we're talking about here. That's what you, as a gay person, are fighting for. There's no substance to govt. marriage OTHER than it's giving of benefits. That IS the right you seek. Is this getting through in any way whatsoever? Because it's clear as crystal. And that's one more than is on your team right now, on this issue. You DON'T understand the issue. That's pretty obvious at this point.OMG!!!!! emoticonXBanghead emoticonXBanghead That's exactly what I've been trying to get you to see!!!!  Could you stoop to ANY further level of dishonesty here???? Did you just decided to change your argument since you know you were wrong??? Yes, if the govt. stopped giving benefits, marriage would go on. There's a reason (duh!) That's because the only interest the state has in marriage is to give benefits!!!! I already told you, you can get married ANYTIME. No one is going to block the door to the chapel. You just won't get the benefits? Remember, we've already been over all this. But I'm glad you're finally realizing that marriage and the benefits (the government's part) are two separate things. That's a good sign that maybe you're starting to understand how all this works a bit better (even though you're trying to pretend you were of that thinking all along)LOL!!!!!! Foundit, those "responsibilities" ARE benefits. Do you not realize that it BENEFITS the spouse for the other spouse to have that responsibility? Do you not realize it's a BENEFIT to the children for the couple to support it? Those demands of resposibility ARE BENEFITS.I'm not even going to validate that with a response because you know good and well YOU'RE the one who needs to be asked that question.

Yes, that's all part of govt. recognition of marriage. It crosses both federal AND state laws. The federal govt. recognizes marriage SO that the states can give benefit to couples.What reason would it have to recognize marriage for that purpose? The only reason it would do so would be to promote marriage, and so we are right back to it's giving of benefits. From the govt's perspective, it's ALL ABOUT THE BENEFITS.From the govt.'s standpoint they ARE the marriage. It sees it as something to recognize for the giving of benefits.Right--it's WHY THEY RECOGNIZE MARRIAGE--to give it benefits.The benefits increased over time. But the answer to your question is that benefits and govt. recognition came at the same time, because they are, for all practical purposes the same thing from the govt.'s standpoint. Paperwork and beuracratic process doesn't care about the wedding, Foundit. It doesn't care about the the color of the cake or the works spoken in the vows. It's concern is the benefits given. By the way, don't confuse census data with legal marriage recognition. I'm wondering if your insistence on the idea that govt. recognizes marriage to some degree independent of the purpose of benefits is because you assume that the seeing of marriage in census data amounts to "recognition." That's not what this is about.And how do you think that is accomplished, Foundit?? (Hint: the benefits!)That's odd, because I'd think if someone married JUST for the benefits (one and the same, you see), it would be pretty darn shallow. I already told you I'd be married regardless of the benefits, so pardon me if I find it pretty disingenuous of you to level such assertions at me.No, because their's was a case where they were wanting to MARRY, not have a gay union. Remember, society's understanding of marriage is opposite-sex--the reason you want to redefine it. I find it interesting that you always try to go back to Loving when Loving was not decided based on a marriage concept that was other than opposite-sex.Well, that IS the debate, Foundit: whether gays should have legal marriage recognition. Sorry if I didn't deviate enough from the debated issues here, for you.Of course not; that's like asking me to show you a court case that shows social security is about benefits to seniors instead of some other independent reason for it's existence. It's basic common sense, Foundit. Courts don't have to define what hasn't even been challenged.You've missed the whole point, then. The point was never to argue for those things; it was to show you how ridiculous the arguments for gay marriage are, because they are essentially identical to the arguments for any other group that comes along wanting marriage. I never said it was likely to happen. And to show you because those other things are basically indentical to your push in terms of arguments, that you are really trying to do nothing more than to broaden marriage from it's accepted definition. In trying to move the line just enough in marriage to include you, you make the line moveable to begin with. THAT'S what you don't seem to get.Then go ahead and tell me what other interest it has in legal recognition, Foundit. You keep saying "because it benefits society" but the govt. has not need to recognize on those grounds unless it PROMOTES it, which it does VIA BENEFITS. So we're right back to the benefits.

We have a SERIOUS disjoint in reasoning here, and I don't think you recognize it.Your approach to this is like saying "Why did I drive the car to the store? Because I wanted the car to be parked in the store parking lot."To which the obvious rejoinder is, "WHY did you want the car to be parked there?"Likewise, you are claiming that the state recognizes marriage "SO that the state can give benefits to couples".But you never answer the question of WHY would the state want to give benefits to couples. Not once do you even fathom the existence of that question.My answer is simple, and it DOES answer the question you can't. We give married couples marriage benefits TO STRENGTHEN the marriage, because marriage STRENGTHENS society.emoticonXWow emoticonXWow emoticonXWow You can't comprehend why the government would recognize marriage to make society more stable???You don't think the government has an interest in a stable society???Zounds! emoticonXBanghead Seriously. I just have to ask.Do you SERIOUSLY need me to answer that question for you???Because it just blows my mind that you would even try asking that question.It's like asking "Which way does earth's gravity pull?"WOW!So you think that we give marriage benefits AS A REWARD for marriage???Okay now. Let's back-track a few pages...Back to a time and place where two posters were sitting behind their computer screens arguing that marriage benefits should be given to couples WHO ARE NOT married.Do you notice any disjoint in the two presentations???Or do I need to spell that out too?And you can back up this claim with what exactly???"If you are going to make that accusation, you need to pony up and prove it."***JyoshuAgain, that's like saying we drove the car to the store so the car would be in the parking lot...WHY would they want to give marriage "benefits"?You finally got around to answering that question, I believe...No. They aren't.Look at ANY legislation on marriage. Do they say that couples who are married and get insurance benefits will get this new benefit???Or do they JUST TALK ABOUT MARRIED COUPLES???Cause you see, a married couple DOES NOT HAVE TO take advantage of their benefits. They can get separate car insurance. They can not tell the hospital that they are husband and wife, and take the repercussions of withholding that info.But they ARE STILL MARRIED.Again, you are confusing the car ACCESSORIES with the car itself.1) I'm not talking about the wedding or the cake. Strawman...2) Likewise, two people being married DOES NOT CARE about whether or not the couple ACTUALLY USE any of their benefits.Gee. Something I never brought up...And you're wondering if I'm "confusing" an issue that was never even mentioned.Put your mind at ease. I'm not talking about that.What I AM talking about is the BARE ESSENCE of the thing. Just the WEDDING LICENSE ITSELF.If THAT was all that existed, then the government WOULD STILL have to recognize a gay couple's right to be named on one.I was right...PURE disjoint in our thought processes, and hopefully we can tie them together.DUH!!!I AGREE that they help marriage with marriage benefits, and that is how they help society.I AGREE with that.THAT was MY POINT.I'm trying to get you to go ANOTHER STEP in realizing that the PURPOSE of marriage benefits IS NOT THE BENEFITS, but rather the EFFECT MARRIAGE HAS ON SOCIETY.emoticonXWow They are one and the same...But if somebody married for just the benefits, THAT would be shallow...Forest for the trees...My comment HAD NOTHING to do with YOUR PERSONAL outlook on marriage. So your offense is purely in your head regarding any implications about your own "marriage"...It was an observation on how OTHERS would be changed by your new system regarding marriage and marriage benefits. How THEY would treat it when the "benefits" are removed from the "responsibility" of marriage.But nice try to side-step my argument. All it did was give me one more chance to repeat what my argument REALLY is to correct your misrepresentation....Good gawd. We're back to this obfuscation again.Jyoshu. I realize you may not want to admit it, but society's rules on marriage HAVE CONSISTENTLY CHANGED OVER TIME.Fifty years ago, a HUGE majority in this country defined marriage by BOTH "opposite sex" and "SAME RACE".Today's CURRENT society has the popular definition as just "opposite sex".But back when Loving v Virginia was decided, THEIR definition WAS NOT TODAY'S definition.THEIR definition WAS a change from the "modern" definition (of that day).And you are ONCE AGAIN obfuscating my point.My point did not rest upon the TYPE of couple in Loving v Virginia.It was regarding THEIR MOTIVATION for marrying, and how modern gays have the SAME MOTIVATION for marrying.It was regarding THEIR MOTIVATION for getting the state to recognize their marriage, just like gays have today...So, as I often do when you obfuscate, I'll repeat the argument...Do you think somebody could have just told the "Loving" couple of Loving v Virginia that "you can just get married in a chapel, without governmental recognition"...Would that be acceptable to them?

Remember, society's understanding of marriage is opposite-sex--the reason you want to redefine it. I find it interesting that you always try to go back to Loving when Loving was not decided based on a marriage concept that was other than opposite-sex.Well, that IS the debate, Foundit: whether gays should have legal marriage recognition. Sorry if I didn't deviate enough from the debated issues here, for you.Of course not; that's like asking me to show you a court case that shows social security is about benefits to seniors instead of some other independent reason for it's existence. It's basic common sense, Foundit. Courts don't have to define what hasn't even been challenged.You've missed the whole point, then. The point was never to argue for those things; it was to show you how ridiculous the arguments for gay marriage are, because they are essentially identical to the arguments for any other group that comes along wanting marriage. I never said it was likely to happen. And to show you because those other things are basically indentical to your push in terms of arguments, that you are really trying to do nothing more than to broaden marriage from it's accepted definition. In trying to move the line just enough in marriage to include you, you make the line moveable to begin with. THAT'S what you don't seem to get.Then go ahead and tell me what other interest it has in legal recognition, Foundit. You keep saying "because it benefits society" but the govt. has not need to recognize on those grounds unless it PROMOTES it, which it does VIA BENEFITS. So we're right back to the benefits.

Ahh yes. You are in obfuscating OVER-DRIVE this afternoon.My point was regarding YOUR POSITION on this issue, and the hypocrisy of your position.You CLAIM to be against the redefinition of marriage, but it's interesting to note that you HAVE NO PROBLEM with me "redefining" marriage in a non-legal way.Your ONLY seeming issue is with a LEGAL redefinition of marriage.You realize, of course, that this basically mutes your earlier contentions.Your attempts to complain about non-married couples not getting rights, and trying to tie that argument into the gay rights marriage?And the "hasn't even been challenged" aspect also goes to show you admitting that your outlook upon that issue is yours and virtually yours alone...And you think I'm the one out of touch with reality!You've got all the puzzle pieces, but you can't figure out what you're putting together...My GAWD. I have to repeat myself with you so much it's like a broken record for a deaf person...The point where they ARE NOT "essentially identical" comes in with the LEGITIMATE STATE INTEREST.If the other groups lack a legitimate state interest, then they lose. Plain and simple.That's what happened in Loving v Virginia. The state DEFINED MARRIAGE as being opposite sex / same race. That was their DEFINITION Jyoshu.And if you ever bothered to READ Loving v Virginia, you'ld see that they said this definition was unconstitutional. They DID NOT say that because of any "essential" definition of "marriage" being JUST about "man / woman".They DID it because the state lacked a LEGITIMATE STATE REASON for racial discrimination in marriage.1) Are you contesting the fact that marriage benefits society?Because if you agree that marriage benefits society, your request is meaningless.2) As I pointed out above, OF COURSE these benefits help "promote" marriage. I never argued otherwise. They also STRENGTHEN marriage, and a myriad of other building verbs.3) My point of contention HAS NEVER been about benefits having a positive effect on marriage. I have been SAYING OVER AND OVER again that marriage benefits have a positive effect on marriage.My point has been that the GIVING of the benefits IS NOT THE REASON for giving the benefits.The GIVING of the benefits helps to STRENGTHEN marriage, and thus help STRENGTHEN society.My point of contention is to get you to take the next obvious step in development. That it's not JUST about giving benefits...

Yes, that's all part of govt. recognition of marriage. It crosses both federal AND state laws. The federal govt. recognizes marriage SO that the states can give benefit to couples.What reason would it have to recognize marriage for that purpose? The only reason it would do so would be to promote marriage, and so we are right back to it's giving of benefits. From the govt's perspective, it's ALL ABOUT THE BENEFITS.From the govt.'s standpoint they ARE the marriage. It sees it as something to recognize for the giving of benefits.Right--it's WHY THEY RECOGNIZE MARRIAGE--to give it benefits.The benefits increased over time. But the answer to your question is that benefits and govt. recognition came at the same time, because they are, for all practical purposes the same thing from the govt.'s standpoint. Paperwork and beuracratic process doesn't care about the wedding, Foundit. It doesn't care about the the color of the cake or the works spoken in the vows. It's concern is the benefits given. By the way, don't confuse census data with legal marriage recognition. I'm wondering if your insistence on the idea that govt. recognizes marriage to some degree independent of the purpose of benefits is because you assume that the seeing of marriage in census data amounts to "recognition." That's not what this is about.And how do you think that is accomplished, Foundit?? (Hint: the benefits!)That's odd, because I'd think if someone married JUST for the benefits (one and the same, you see), it would be pretty darn shallow. I already told you I'd be married regardless of the benefits, so pardon me if I find it pretty disingenuous of you to level such assertions at me.No, because their's was a case where they were wanting to MARRY, not have a gay union.

No, the STORE is the benefits, not the parking lot. You've already done that: on of the few times you've been correct on this--because it promotes and encourages marriage. That's WHY the govt. recognizes marriage, to give the benefits. It's seems you are trying to prove the the goals over the real-world effect; the fact that the govt. wants to promote marriage isn't really relevant; gays are fighting to get marriage benefits. That's what the govt. does. That's what legally married entails. Period. Anything else is superfluous and is nothing more than in the realm of ideas and goals. I never said that was not the case. It doesn't change the fact that for the govt,. it's about the benefits. That's all that matters in terms of how they deal with couples. Period.Huh?? Where did you get that? i never claimed such at all. I'm saying that the benefits are all there essentially is to marriage from the govt.'s perspective. You keep wanting to shift into the realm of "goals" here, and that's not really what we're talking about. We're talking about what marriage IS to the govt from their perspective. On paper, it plays out in the form of giving benefits to couples. For making a commitment, sure. On the couples' end, the marriage IS the commitment they make between the two of them. On the govt's end, on paper, it's about the benefits. I don't understand why this is so hard fo you. you're trying to make this WAAAAAAY too complicated.It doesn't matter--the govt has still made the benefit available. They've given the benefit.You might as well be trying to argue that social security is about something other than giving social security.

We have a SERIOUS disjoint in reasoning here, and I don't think you recognize it.Your approach to this is like saying "Why did I drive the car to the store? Because I wanted the car to be parked in the store parking lot."To which the obvious rejoinder is, "WHY did you want the car to be parked there?"Likewise, you are claiming that the state recognizes marriage "SO that the state can give benefits to couples".But you never answer the question of WHY would the state want to give benefits to couples. Not once do you even fathom the existence of that question.My answer is simple, and it DOES answer the question you can't. We give married couples marriage benefits TO STRENGTHEN the marriage, because marriage STRENGTHENS society.emoticonXWow emoticonXWow emoticonXWow You can't comprehend why the government would recognize marriage to make society more stable???You don't think the government has an interest in a stable society???Zounds! emoticonXBanghead Seriously. I just have to ask.Do you SERIOUSLY need me to answer that question for you???Because it just blows my mind that you would even try asking that question.It's like asking "Which way does earth's gravity pull?"WOW!So you think that we give marriage benefits AS A REWARD for marriage???Okay now. Let's back-track a few pages...Back to a time and place where two posters were sitting behind their computer screens arguing that marriage benefits should be given to couples WHO ARE NOT married.Do you notice any disjoint in the two presentations???Or do I need to spell that out too?And you can back up this claim with what exactly???"If you are going to make that accusation, you need to pony up and prove it."***JyoshuAgain, that's like saying we drove the car to the store so the car would be in the parking lot...WHY would they want to give marriage "benefits"?You finally got around to answering that question, I believe...No. They aren't.Look at ANY legislation on marriage. Do they say that couples who are married and get insurance benefits will get this new benefit???Or do they JUST TALK ABOUT MARRIED COUPLES???Cause you see, a married couple DOES NOT HAVE TO take advantage of their benefits. They can get separate car insurance. They can not tell the hospital that they are husband and wife, and take the repercussions of withholding that info.But they ARE STILL MARRIED.Again, you are confusing the car ACCESSORIES with the car itself.1) I'm not talking about the wedding or the cake. Strawman...2) Likewise, two people being married DOES NOT CARE about whether or not the couple ACTUALLY USE any of their benefits.Gee. Something I never brought up...And you're wondering if I'm "confusing" an issue that was never even mentioned.Put your mind at ease. I'm not talking about that.What I AM talking about is the BARE ESSENCE of the thing. Just the WEDDING LICENSE ITSELF.If THAT was all that existed, then the government WOULD STILL have to recognize a gay couple's right to be named on one.I was right...PURE disjoint in our thought processes, and hopefully we can tie them together.DUH!!!I AGREE that they help marriage with marriage benefits, and that is how they help society.I AGREE with that.THAT was MY POINT.I'm trying to get you to go ANOTHER STEP in realizing that the PURPOSE of marriage benefits IS NOT THE BENEFITS, but rather the EFFECT MARRIAGE HAS ON SOCIETY.emoticonXWow They are one and the same...But if somebody married for just the benefits, THAT would be shallow...Forest for the trees...My comment HAD NOTHING to do with YOUR PERSONAL outlook on marriage. So your offense is purely in your head regarding any implications about your own "marriage"...It was an observation on how OTHERS would be changed by your new system regarding marriage and marriage benefits. How THEY would treat it when the "benefits" are removed from the "responsibility" of marriage.But nice try to side-step my argument. All it did was give me one more chance to repeat what my argument REALLY is to correct your misrepresentation....Good gawd. We're back to this obfuscation again.Jyoshu. I realize you may not want to admit it, but society's rules on marriage HAVE CONSISTENTLY CHANGED OVER TIME.Fifty years ago, a HUGE majority in this country defined marriage by BOTH "opposite sex" and "SAME RACE".Today's CURRENT society has the popular definition as just "opposite sex".But back when Loving v Virginia was decided, THEIR definition WAS NOT TODAY'S definition.THEIR definition WAS a change from the "modern" definition (of that day).And you are ONCE AGAIN obfuscating my point.My point did not rest upon the TYPE of couple in Loving v Virginia.It was regarding THEIR MOTIVATION for marrying, and how modern gays have the SAME MOTIVATION for marrying.It was regarding THEIR MOTIVATION for getting the state to recognize their marriage, just like gays have today...So, as I often do when you obfuscate, I'll repeat the argument...Do you think somebody could have just told the "Loving" couple of Loving v Virginia that "you can just get married in a chapel, without governmental recognition"...Would that be acceptable to them?

The point of an analogy is often to help demonstrate deficiencies in another person's thinking.Here, you rewrite mine without any comment as to how my thinking is supposedly wrong.You just rewrite it. No explanation given. No pretense as to how my analogy was supposedly wrong...emoticonXWow You're not even trying to argue. Your response itself ignores several factors of the analogy in the rush to rewrite it.Working with your analogy, bypassing the fact that you failed to learn anything from mine...Let's say a man goes to the store to get "marriage benefits"...WHY does the store give out these "marriage benefits"?Do they exist just to give out those "marriage benefits"?Or do they do it to BRING IN MONEY. That, by analogy, being the driving issue / motivation for the government's actions.The government gives out marriage benefits why? To improve society's stability.You're playing a game of cause and effect Jyoshu, and you're claiming the effect IS the cause. And in the big scheme of things, ESPECIALLY considering the government, it doesn't make sense.Take welfare for example. Does welfare exist just to give poor people money? Or does it exist because it helps poor people not to starve. To help them to get a roof over their head?Soooo close, yet so far away...And on a lot of levels, it's like you're saying "tom-ay-to", and I'm saying "tom-ah-to".The only problem being that we're talking about spaghetti sauce and the ONLY thing you're focusing on is "tom-ay-to", while I bring up the meat and the mushrooms and the ...You admit I'm "correct on this".What exactly am I "incorrect" on Jyoshu?Where am I significantly wrong that doesn't boil down to a shift in perception?PERFECT place to stop you...I am trying to say the PURPOSE of something IS THE GOALS. The goal of a better society.Whereas I see you trying to say the PURPOSE of something is the MECHANISMS of the PLAN. The giving of the marriage benefits.The purpose of a plan IS NOT the plan itself.Stop you here again, because you just don't get it.Sitting at the back as opposed to sitting at the front doesn't have any real "benefits".What YOU don't seem to get is that EVEN IF THERE WERE NO MARRIAGE BENEFITS, gays would be fighting for gay marriage, because it's a fight against discrimination. Unjustified discrimination.Like I said earlier, the marriage benefits add an additional nuance, but it's the MARRIAGE which is the focus.LOOK at the marriage law-suits. How many say "We are a gay couple and I want duo insurance"?Typically it revolves around "We are a gay couple, and we want to MARRY."YOU are myopically focusing and fixating on the marriage benefits.You are failing to hear me when I repeatedly tell you that it's the MARRIAGE ITSELF which is the driving force.And we get back to the whole issue where you are diminishing the governmental role in "marriage", but it's THE ONLY ISSUE YOU FIXATE ON.It's hilarious to note how on one hand you try to diminish governmental marriage to JUST the marriage benefits...... but on the other hand you claim it's the REDEFINITION that you don't like about marriage.And going a step further, you have no problem with us getting these "marriage benefits" you claim are the government's PURPOSE in marriage under a different name...So the heart and soul of why YOU CLAIM the government is interested in marriage, is okay for us to get as long as it's just under a different name.I can't help but wonder if you realize how amazingly crippling this is to your self-proclaimed motivation, as you are refusing to respond to it. Earlier you obfuscated from my point. Now, you are avoiding it.Again, we come to an area where you refuse to contradict, but you repeat your perspective. A perspective which is different, but not contradictory of my points...Tell me, if all it is to the government is "marriage benefits", then what is the significance of just including the SAME BENEFITS under a different name???No. You didn't "claim" that, but you DID ASK ME A SPECIFIC QUESTION querying my statement.Let's repeat...foundit66: "It recognizes marriage because marriage HELPS SOCIETY and its stability."jyoshu: "What reason would it have to recognize marriage for that purpose?"Ergo, my question to your question.Do you understand why the government would recognize marriage to help society and its stability?Note, and I'm trying to cut off your obfuscation in advance, I am not questioning whether you AGREE WITH MY ASSESSMENT. I'm asking whether or not you understand why the government WOULD recognize marriage to help society and its stability.You questioned the reason for my claimed connection.Even if you don't agree with my claimed connection, surely even you can understand the REASON WHY such a connection could logically exist.No, Jyoshu, that is what YOU don't want to talk about.I am talking about the REASON WHY GOVERNMENT GIVES MARRIAGE BENEFITS.The PURPOSE the government has in giving them out.I think you're finally coming to realize that you're out of rope, and at the end you've hung yourself.So now, you want to frame the discussion in a COMPLETELY NARROW and UTTERLY MEANINGLESS way...There are sooooo many aspects of this discussion you have just COMPLETELY DROPPED. And now, you're essentially left with nothing.Just out of curiousity, of the XXXX you're continuing to harp on that you haven't dropped, what MEANING do you think it has for preventing gay marriage???Does it have ANY meaning? Any at all?Or are you just trying to narrow the focus of the conversation away from points you can no longer address to avoid admitting that you are at the end of your rope?(And as a fore-warning, don't even try pretending that I have been the one "dropping" things, because you should know by now that I am more than happy to go back and bring up a LAUNDRY LIST of questions you never answered, and points that you stopped discussing...)Actually, I think you're trying to over-simplify it, like I have been showing in analogy after analogy.But to put it simply.1) The MARRIAGE ITSELF is the right. Not the "benefits" of marriage.2) The PURPOSE the government gives out marriage benefits is not just because they want to give out marriage benefits. It's because giving out marriage benefits STRENGTHEN the marriages, which in turn STRENGTHENS society. And that is a goal of our government. To strengthen society.I think our current disjoint rests solely on the fact that you want to focus AWAY FROM any discussion of "purpose", and focus EXCLUSIVELY on the letter of the law.And quite frankly, that's a meaningless discussion.This sounds like one of those "if a tree falls in the forest" scenarios.If the government makes marriage benefits available, but a married couple doesn't partake of them, does that mean that the government has "given" anything?If I tell John that he can come by my house and get brownies, but he never comes by to get them, then I have not "given" him anything.If the married couple does not partake of the marriage benefits, they have not been "given" marriage benefits.And I can't help but think this is an example I should have come up with, because I think it helps prove my point...Again, you think that the purpose of a social program is about GIVING the social program.Like saying the purpose of driving to the store is to DRIVE to the store.Maybe you need to listen to Bush talk about Social Security reform. See if he just talks about the program being about giving social security.Your analysis just plain lacks any depth...

So is marriage a constitutional right or just a regular right in your opinion?Yet they said the right was from the 14th amendment in the substantive rights in the word "liberty"....never the less, lets assume marriage is a right, the 14th amendment says these can be taken away with "due process"...why doesn't due process mean the democractic process set up in the constitution? Perhaps you think it can be subject to the democractic process. Your next argument would be "equal protection"(i assume) which is more valid than a substantive argument. In this case I would first like to ask you would it be ok (in your view of the constitution) if the states got rid of marriage all together? Afterall even Loving admitted the states have full power of marriage.wait, you realize my quote was from the Loving case right? I wasn't "distorting" anything.I think the 14th amendment equal protection clause only deals with race in a strict way (it was one of the "slavery amendments" after all) and so the case should have just done the equal protection argument. They had it right when they said "the fact of equal application does not immunize the statute from the very heavy burden of justification which the Fourteenth Amendment has traditionally required of state statutes drawn according to race."So in conclusion, yes VA was wrong (as they normally are) and the Lovings should have been able to marry...but only on equal protection grounds. Now lets assume no equal protection clause existed. I would have to say that VA could (sadly) ban interracial marriage. In other words I don't think the justices can say a law is unconstitional because it is morally wrong even though this clearly was a case of a morally wrong law.I think this was an overall nice post :) please do one in return.

No. I didn't.All you're doing is claiming over and over again that I did.The truly hilarious part is that you RECOGNIZED what I was trying to say in one of my posts, but you chose to believe ANOTHER INTERPRETATION that would mean contradiction instead.Ignoring me when I repeated what I was ACTUALLY SAYING, to instead believe that I was saying something I said I wasn't saying.Anyone with a brain can see you're REALLLY reaching with all this.You are losing out on actually HAVING any arguments, so instead you try to claim contradictions where there are none.Did you scare off that girl you were bullying?Haven't found any other 14-year old rape victims to bully?Too bad...See, THIS is part of my proof for why you have almost NO REAL READING comprehension.THIS is part of my proof for why your claims to "remember" things is pure and utter XXXX.OVER and OVER again, I have stated that Loving v Virginia establishes marriage is a right.But here, you can't seem to recognize your question has already been answered numerous times.HOW can you claim to comprehend what I'm saying when you CLEARLY CAN'T REMEMBER the things I repeat for you?1) Not "outta no where".Loving v Virginia establishes marriage is a right.2) "applying them using a different amendment"???Again, WHY do you think that is a problem?The 14th amendment applies to ALL rights.3) "no justice claims" There are a variety of courts that clearly disagree with you on this.4) You are confusing the post.THIS SENTENCE of yours is a perfect example.NONE of what I said above is new.But you disregard it all for your own misinterpretation."due process" is a legal concept we APPLY TO rights."Due process" actually also creates some rights.But it doesn't create the right of marriage.For marriage, it's an APPLICATION to rights.What the heck do the "founding fathers" have to do with this.The marriage license, and the right of legal marriage recognition, came AFTER the founding fathers. It was used as a tool to enforce miscegenation laws.Just because the founding fathers didn't say something doesn't mean it's not applicable.I think you've got your head stuck too much in the philosophy of needing people who have been dead for hundreds of years to tell you how to think...1) Justice acknowledge the existence of rights.2) Actually, I use "Loving" because of its multiple conveniences.They CITE PRECEDENT acknowledging the existence of marriage. OTHER CASES BEFORE which explicitly stated that marriage is a right.3) And, as always, you try to distort and malign simple English to come away with bizarre conclusions as to what is being said.The "right to marry" is not "in" the 9th amendment.The 9th amendment acknowledges the existence of NON-ENUMERATED RIGHTS, which allows the courts to do away with any stupid argument that "marriage isn't in the constitution, and thus not a right".THAT is what the 9th amendment does.No. I think it's the same story.You two are playing an inane routine whereby you want to try and distort my position into a laughable farce...... but here is something that I want to know about what you ACTUALLY believe.Do you think Loving v Virginia should have been decided so that the Loving couple's marriage SHOULD NOT be recognized by the state?I believe you may have already answered this, but I would love a refresher, also a straight answer for the viewing audience....

My post was not stupid. These things happen as a direct result of being excluded from marriage. If you argue against gay marriage you are argueing for these things to happen.

You got it all wrong Matthew...I just wanna see you "loose" your home, have your children taken away, and you not be able to see "each other" when in the hosptial.You thought this was about gay!? No way!! Just you. It is actually a conspiracy with Jyoshu, Jim, Bassman, and myself. We all live in a big house out in Kansas where we go around the internet trying to "get" certain gay people.See...I can make stupid posts too :)

That's funny.I've heard similar comments about you...Marriage is the right.The benefits are not.Rosa Parks focused on something as "pointless" as a seat.Do you have any comments for her?ROFLMAO!You two started out trying to proclaim that the BENEFITS THEMSELVES should be given to all regardless of marriage status, and that it was "discrimination" to not give marriage benefits to somebody who refused to marry, and I am the one playing the game.Seriously Jyoshu.Do you think you are fooling ANYBODY here beyond your twin "steeeeve"?I've responded to every point you made.You, in turn, chose to drop some aspects of the issue and focus on the increasingly pointless and inane.I pointed that out in my last post.I asked you point-blank WHAT ASPECT of what you were currently arguing about had anything relevant against stopping gay marriage.I think the sudden realization that you had dropped all your points which pretended merit, and that you were only discussing pointless commentary was the real reason you posted this.So be it.

Foundit, the reason I didn't elaborate is because I'm realizing there's little point--you are unconvincable on anything. Frankly, I'm not sure why you're here, when you argue things infinitum. This is getting endlessly tiresome--I'm not interested in a forever discussion where you are determined to endlessly focus on a something so pointless as marriage as a goal rather than benefits. I don't know why you're making such a freaking big deal out this. You know what? If you want to think of federal marriage recognition as a goal or whatever-other besides it's interest in the giving of benefits, knock yourself out. This endless game of yours is not worth my time. I've never seen someone so prone to taking one thing out of something I said and beat a horse to death over it. How you can't see it's about the benefits is beyond me. But either way, it's not worth all this. emoticonXDonno

No Steeeeve. Not everyone.You did have company in your bullying, but I don't think anybody took it as far as you did.I know she was a rape victim because she stated she was.Or is this another situation where you believe whatever is convenient for you, so it helps your cause?You know Steeeeve, your endless questions demonstrating your IGNORANCE, by which you reply with PURE SPECULATION that is convenient, and you pretend that's an argument...... that's pretty boring.Loving v Virginia STATED that it was a right.They quoted PREVIOUS RULINGS which also explicitly stated that it was a right. They quoted PRECEDENT of other rulings which established it was a right.Of course, you know NONE of this. YOu haven't even bothered to look at what I'm discussing. Instead, like your usual debating tactic, you argue out of ignorance and a desire to just say what is convenient for your stance.And when I said "establish", I meant it as in "to prove". Like a man could "establish his innocence in a court of law". Not create.Yes.Where did I bring up the founding fathers again?I discussed their intentions with the 9th amendment, ensuring that nobody in later generations tried to claim that the ABSENCE of a right in the constitution meant that the right was not protected. Is that what you're trying to misapply?

Why would I put you on my ignore list?I personally think you need somebody to shine a light on some of the irrational comments that you make.I'm sure you would like me to not point out these issues, but that just ain't gonna happen...Seriously Jyoshu.Are you saying that Rosa Parks was making a mountain out of a molehill?Or do you see something of substance in her fight that I haven't stated?Because believe you me, I see a LOT MORE of importance to Rosa Parks' fight than just a "seat".I say what I said because by YOUR ARGUMENT, I see you are trying to diminish the fight for equality to "just a seat".The DISCRIMINATION is important. Whether it be in a bus seat, or the right to get married, or the benefits themselves.Some people want to use the government as a tool to establish that one group is better than another. To ignore equality, in favor of discrimination.An anti-American ideal.Don't mix terminology...I am talking about MARRIAGE ITSELF being a legal and constitutionally protected right.The BENEFITS exist, and people are entitled to them, BECAUSE THE LAW STATES that married people get this benefit and that benefit.But that DOES NOT MAKE the BENEFITS rights in and of themselves, independent from marriage.I say "entitled to them" as a substitution to YOUR "having a RIGHT to them", because I want to be perfectly clear on what I AM and AM NOT saying. To not blur the lines of what IS recognized as A right, and what the law states that people are "entitled to".Now then, do you disagree with ANYTHING that I just said.Or do you just not like the WAY I said it?I want a serious answer to this question.

Wow.If you think I want to call the marriage benefits "rights", then you have virtually NO CLUE as to what I have been saying.Just plain wow!No, Jyoshu, I've spent a lot of my posts in this thread RESPONDING TO WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT.YOU asked me what I thought the governmental purpose of recognizing marriage was.I stated it. I stated that the PURPOSE of recognizing marriage is because marriage strengthens society, and that is the interest of the government.Loving v Virginia says that marriage is "fundamental to our very existence and survival". It says nothing about a governmental interest to hand out benefits...And then YOU spent a lot of time insisting that my perspective was wrong. YOU DROPPED OTHER ARGUMENTS to discuss this irrelevant issue.Sure. I followed you along for the ride, but YOU lead the show.No. It's not worth ANYTHING to me, and I explicitly told you that in a previous post. I said it was devoid of meaning for the issue of gay marriage.AND PRECISELY as I predicted, you are now trying to blame this derailment of relevance on me. YOU DROPPED ISSUES right and left which actually had a little merit to fixate on how you just couldn't believe how I would think that the government's "purpose" for recognizing marriage and for giving marriage benefits was anything other than wanting to give benefits.This was all you baby.What the heck are you babbling about now?ROFLMAO!!!Yeah. SINGLE-HANDEDLY, and ALL BY MYSELF, I have been insisting we talk about this while you and Steeeeve have been trying to beg me to discuss something else.Seriously Jyoshu. I would LOVE to pick up other relevant issues.Relevant issues in our discussion that YOU DROPPED.Like the importance of giving out marriage benefits to couples who don't want to marry. And how that affects gay marriage.Like the legitimate state interest for gay marriage, and the legitimate state interest for other forms of marriage.MULTIPLE topics that you keep dropping, and you kept dropping, just so you could keep harping on this topic.But it's all me. Just because I continue to talk about SPECIFICALLY what you said in your last post.The question remains. If YOU wanted to discuss other topics, WHY AREN'T YOU???The above are the topics I would love to hit on.Are you game?Or are you just going to continue to whine about how all I want to talk about is THIS irrelevant topic.False. False. Wrong. Just plain WRONG.There ARE significant differences.1) Cohabitation? A male-female cohabitation HAS THE OPTION to marry.Gay couples CANNOT LEGALLY MARRY.That's a HUGE difference.The difference between a white man CHOOSING not to drink from the white fountain, and a black man being LEGALLY RESTRICTED from drinking from the white fountain.2) Polygamy? The laws just aren't set up for polygamy marriage. There are WAYYYY too many gaps in the law.If a man marries two women, and one of them divorces, does the other wife have the capacity to sue for alimony?And that's just the tip of the ice-berg.Are you for real???I HAVE ALREADY DONE THIS on a variety of different occasions in conversations that YOU DROPPED.And now you pretend like you're bringing something new to the table...

if you want to call what I said "bullying" then yes, I would treat anyone that asked that question the same.Can you make a single post without an insult? Doubtful.What if I am a rape victim? Does that mean you have to treat me differently?My first post to her (in that topic) insulted all 14yr olds. If you wish to discuss this further you can do so on that forum thread.I asked a question! Is it impossible for you take a simple question as just that? You are unbelievable sometimes. This is why I called you what I did...and deservingly so.Ok, then who created this as a right?Fine, there are rights outside the constitution...who establishes these? How do you know "marriage" was one of these rights they mean't to have when writting the 9th?haha, you are the one that thinks the 9th amendment means a right to marriage exists outside the constitution. Surely when they wrote that amendment they knew what they were doing.That was meant to be insulting...I admit that. You just do it no matter what. I was even going to be the bigger man and try and stop this nonsense with my last point but you continued to insult. Tell me, is there a reason we should continue to even post to each other? Or are you just going to insult in every post no matter what?He/she pulls stuff that is reported normally. I have more knowledge on the constitution then you do it seems. You have no basis for decisions and no understanding of the history behind the document. This was clear when you discussed the 1st amendment and it is clear when you talk about the 9th and 14th amendment. It is also clear when you contradict yourself and then claim you didn't when called on it. You mask this by insulting people every chance you get and then change directions in posting to try and tear down the other person. The only reason I even post to you know is to give myself amuzement by reading such ridiculous claims and statements...but you probably knew that :)I complain that this is all you do.

if you want to call what I said "bullying" then yes, I would treat anyone that asked that question the same.Can you make a single post without an insult? Doubtful.What if I am a rape victim? Does that mean you have to treat me differently?My first post to her (in that topic) insulted all 14yr olds. If you wish to discuss this further you can do so on that forum thread.I asked a question! Is it impossible for you take a simple question as just that? You are unbelievable sometimes. This is why I called you what I did...and deservingly so.Ok, then who created this as a right?Fine, there are rights outside the constitution...who establishes these? How do you know "marriage" was one of these rights they mean't to have when writting the 9th?haha, you are the one that thinks the 9th amendment means a right to marriage exists outside the constitution. Surely when they wrote that amendment they knew what they were doing.That was meant to be insulting...I admit that. You just do it no matter what. I was even going to be the bigger man and try and stop this nonsense with my last point but you continued to insult. Tell me, is there a reason we should continue to even post to each other? Or are you just going to insult in every post no matter what?He/she pulls stuff that is reported normally. I have more knowledge on the constitution then you do it seems. You have no basis for decisions and no understanding of the history behind the document. This was clear when you discussed the 1st amendment and it is clear when you talk about the 9th and 14th amendment. It is also clear when you contradict yourself and then claim you didn't when called on it. You mask this by insulting people every chance you get and then change directions in posting to try and tear down the other person. The only reason I even post to you know is to give myself amuzement by reading such ridiculous claims and statements...but you probably knew that :)I complain that this is all you do. You just can't stop. I'll probably get bored sometime soon and put you back on the blocked list...but for now I need a good laugh.

All I am seeing in your post is a bunch of contradictions...marriage is not a right from the 9th amendment before it was...perhaps its the 14th amendment now..who knows? It existed outta no where and was just uncovered by a judge some how (I suppose they could say anything was a right if thats the standard). You say you use the current legal precedent as your backing for what you say as if legal precdent is always right but then when someone quotes the 3 cases that upheld the ban you all of a sudden find this precedent to be incorrect.Why can't you just give a straight answer about how the constitution guarntees a right to marriage for gay couples? You obviously believe it is beyond just an "equal protection issue" and that "marriage" is actually a right guarnteed by the constitution. If this is incorrect please say so but atleast answer me this ( I don't recal you answering it when I asked the first time) Can a state get rid of marriage all together? Furthermore, explain how a judge discovers a right that exists due to the 9th amendment? What criteria is used!? Your round-a-bout answers will just not due anymore...give it to me straight for once. Finally, explain why marriage gets to be defined by the court. Do you disagree with O'Connor in the Lawerence case?The questions would certainly help if you wish to have a civil discussion about the constitution.

< yawn >So I guess if I think that you "deserve" an insult, then I should just go ahead and say it then, eh?But then you'll just complain about me insulting you, while I apparently "deserve" it...Hmmm. Decisions, decisions...It's not so much "created" as a right, as it is RECOGNIZED as a right.I think it's a fundamental disjoint in how we look at things.You look at things as needing a road-block to inhibit governmental restriction on an issue.I look at things as needing to justify why the government is restricting an issue in the first place.Your perspective focuses on why we shouldn't limit freedom.Mine looks at justification for why we do limit freedom.1) The courts can recognize them as rights.I imagine the legislature too.2) I never claimed that.Again, you pretend snideness is an argument.1) The 9th amendment DOES mean that rights not listed in the constitution STILL EXIST. That is CURRENTLY how the 9th amendment IS interpreted, despite your desire for it to be otherwise.2) And yes. They did know what they were doing when they wrote that.You find my comments that I hope your actions of insulting a 14-year old rape victim are not taken as indicative of all Christians as "insulting"?You take insult WAYYYYY too easily.Do you think your actions of insulting a 14-year old rape victim WERE indicative of all Christians?Do you think those actions SHOULD BE generalized onto all Christians?Where, precisely, is the insult here???Right now, I see it more as an issue of you claiming insult when there is none.It's your M.O. Distort what the other person said and interpret it differently than intended.In some ways, I wonder if you WANT me to insult you, or you just WANT to claim insults, so you can emoticonXCry and claim victim...Again, you make sweeping generalizations, but in the end I am the one who quotes legal precedent. I am the one who quotes the constitutional concepts AS THEY ARE CURRENTLY interpreted.Again, WHO has the interpretation that is supported by the CURRENT CONSTITUTIONAL APPLICATION of those issues???Not you...But I am the one who isn't interpreting it right...YOU, who are advocating a constitutional interpretation DIFFERENT from the actual applied interpretation, you claim you got it right...Really Steeeeve.Keep on blowing smoke. Maybe somebody is buying it... emoticonXDonno Wrong-o again.You claim I "contradict" myself by MISINTERPRETING what I originally said.In fact, one of those times you ADMITTED that you understood how I meant it. Or rather, how I was going to say I meant it.But you just don't want to believe the AUTHOR is saying what the AUTHOR is saying...

And thus begins Steeeeve's misrepresentations.The funny thing is that I have explained this to him NUMEROUS times, but he keeps claiming that what HE THINKS I meant is what I really meant, instead of obviously ME KNOWING what I meant when I said it...Misrepresentation #1.The 9th amendment establishes that rights exist that are not listed in the constitution. The founding fathers never intended the constitution to be a complete list of what our rights were, and acknowledged that there were rights that they did not talk about in the document.THAT is my position.Not what Steeeeve claims...You could argue that.And somehow I suspect that these rights that you think "they could say anything" about would be a list of rights that you don't agree with...Legal rulings are not always right Steeeeve.Even you seem to get that...When I say that a precedent is incorrect, I EXPLICITLY EXPLAIN WHY I believe it to be incorrect.Instead of acknowledging that fact, you instead try to generalize...Steeeeve, how many times do I have to give that answer before you REMEMBER it and stop misrepresenting it?It's fairly simple.1) Marriage IS a right. Recognized as so by numerous court rulings.2) The 14th amendment's equal protection requirement requires a LEGITIMATE STATE INTEREST before any form of marriage can be discriminated against.3) There is no legitimate state interest against gay marriage.THREE simple points. NONE of these have changed over time.And I have explained these REPEATEDLY.And yet you claim I haven't given a straight answer???And here we come to another delicious contradiction that Steeeeve represents.He claims that I haven't given him a "straight answer".But somehow he KNOWS the basis of my argument...emoticonXDonno It's like claiming you don't know where the cookies went, when you've got cookie crumbs on your mouth...Regardless, what do you mean by "obviously believe it is beyond just an "equal protection issue" "???Let me guess.Another question I'll get no answer to?1) Actually Steeeeve, this is the first time I've seen you answer this question.Can you show me where you have asked this question before???Or should I expect that this is yet another question you won't answer?2) I honestly don't know what you mean by this question.Marriage is recognized on multiple levels. Both the state and the federal government have their marriage recognition legislation.So theoretically, without understanding fully what you mean by "get rid of", even if the state "got rid of" marriage, the federal marriage would still exist. Marriages performed in other states would still be required to be recognized by the federal constitution.3) To formally get elaboration, what do you mean by "get rid of"?Describe the hypothetical mechanism you are talking about...Like I said, judges don't "discover" rights. They don't "create" rights.They acknowledge the existence of rights.It's like acknowledging that society likes celebrities. The observation isn't a "creation" of that, but rather just observing reality.1) I can't help it if you don't like my answers. You want me to say "create" in regards to judges acknowledging the existence of rights, and that's not my position. If I refuse to use your word to describe the situation, that isn't a "round-a-bout" answer.2) You have NOOOOOO room to criticize here Steeeeve. I have asked you a variety of questions you have routinely avoided.For you to complain about me and "round-a-bout answers", while you AVOID COMPLETELY answering, is VERY hypocritical....AGAIN you prove my point.You repeatedly claim that I "change" my position, or I "contradict" myself, but time and time again you prove that it is YOU WHO CANNOT ACCURATELY PORTRAY my position.This is proven by you asking a question that I HAVE ALREADY ADDRESSED.1) Marriage IS DEFINED BY THE LEGISLATURE.2) If the legislature's definition puts up unconstitutional restrictions, the courts REMOVE THOSE RESTRICTIONS.But it is still the legislature that has the ultimate control.Even more so as the legislature could pass a constitutional amendment (Oooohhhh. Really? Why don't they try that???) that can make the courts stick to the legislated definition as "constitutional".O'Connor in Lawrence case. You mean her singular "concurrence" vote...I assume you're referring to this gem."Unlike the moral disapproval of same-sex relations--the asserted state interest in this case--other reasons exist to promote the institution of marriage beyond mere moral disapproval of an excluded group."1) I agree that "moral disapproval of same-sex relations" was the asserted state interest, and that it was invalid.2) I agree that "other reasons exist to promote the institution of marriage".3) I agree that "reasons exist to promote the institution of marriage beyond mere moral disapproval of an excluded group". The reasons promoting the institution of marriage include its positive effect on strengthening society.4) I don't see any legitimate reasons for preventing gay marriage. If you have any, lay them out...5) To ask a question that I expect will go on the pile of the avoided questions, do YOU agree with O'Connor in her concurrence?And not just here, but in her position in general?Or are you trying to pick out one spot that you agree with, and you disagree with most of her statements.You recognizing MY ACTUAL RESPONSE would certainly help if you wish to have an civil discussion...

You know Steeeeve, maybe I just need to take a different tactic with you to neuter this "contradiction" XXXX whereby you pretend I have said two different things, and often NEITHER are what I actually said...1) Marriage is a right. Recognized as such by the courts.You think the courts shouldn't recognize it as a right? Then give an EXPLICIT ANSWER as to why they shouldn't. Argue with them.2) Equal protection applies to marriage. Recognized as so by the courts.You think the courts shouldn't apply equal protection to marriage? Then give an EXPLICIT ANSWER as to why they shouldn't. Argue with them.3) Courts have ruled that procreative capability is a legitimate state interest...Whoops! That's mine.But a demonstration that I'm not asking anything of you that I am not doing myself.Procreative capability IS NOT a legitimate state interest because it violates equal application. Procreative capability is a standard that is applied SOLELY to gay couples, and NEVER to straight couples.Just like literacy voting requirements were invalidated because they were applied just to blacks and not to whites, so the "procreative capability" argument also fails.Enough of this whining about how my position is supposedly "contradictory" as you proceed to misrepresent the hell out of it.Actually ARGUE a point Steeeeve.Because you misrepresenting my statements on the 14th and 9th amendment are not an argument...

Okay, I know I'm very late to this thread but I wanted to give my two cents. Hope someone has 3 pennies because I've got a nickle...My personal opinion is that it's the personal business of the one's involved. That's there business, not mine. Frankly, I don't want to know. But the way I see it, a person has very few chances at real happiness in this world.Also, the idea of 2 gay couples getting married (or getting the right to get married or whatever) isn't really going to affect me. At least, I don't see how it would affect me.

what is your opinion on gay marrages???
