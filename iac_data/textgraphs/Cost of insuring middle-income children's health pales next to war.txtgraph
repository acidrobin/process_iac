Cost of insuring middle-income children's health pales next to war

The president's claim that this program was too expensive rings hollow in the face of the massive deficit spending resulting from a war in Iraq — now in its fifth year and costing between $6 billion and $9 billion each month to prosecute, according to the Congressional Budget Office. It is profoundly hypocritical to have government employees, who enjoy federally controlled health care, deny the same to their constituents on the grounds that it will lead us down a slippery socialist slope. Non sequitor. Spending on one program does not justify spending on another. Hopefully you do not elect to max out your credit card because you are already paying thousands to a mortgage company. You could just as easily justify the war spending by pointing to the massive cost of welfare (367 Billion according to the 2007 budget.) Poor logic.There are actually plenty of reasons to oppose this bill. The first big Duh is that it covers “children” up to the age of 25. The second big Duh is that you cannot pay for the program on the backs of tobacco users. Want another Duh? How ‘bout the $83,000 income ceiling. Call me particular, but when you invoke poor children to gain support for a bill I sort of expect the bill to cover people who are poor and children. Go figure. Here’s a little background for ye on SCHIP. It was initially enacted by the Republican Congress in 1997. By definition, SCHIP was focused on those children whose parents couldn’t afford to purchase insurance individually and whose employers did not provide a family health insurance benefit.HOWEVER… Instead of re-authorizing SCHIP with a funding increase to include those children eligible under the original criteria, the Democratic majority in Congress proposed a broad expansion of SCHIP to include hundreds of thousands of adults as well as upper-income children already covered under private insurance. The price tag is more than double the current program—$35 billion for the expansion alone. In some states, families earning up to $83,000 a year would be eligible for this “low-income program.”Trent Lott offers the following observations:How do Democrats plan to pay for this massive funding increase? By raising your taxes, of course, starting with a 61-cent-a-pack tobacco tax. Some contend that when you increase tobacco taxes, tobacco use drops. Common sense, often missing from Washington debates, says we can’t have it both ways. If we tax people out of smoking, then we’re taxing children off SCHIP. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, a tobacco tax is “the most regressive” and will hit the poor and working class harder than most, the very people whose children SCHIP was intended to help. Then there’s the slight of hand: CBO says Democrats hide about $40 billion in unpaid costs in their expansion through budget gimmicks. After five years, Congress will be forced to raise taxes further or drop millions of children off the SCHIP rolls in 2013. The problems aren’t just limited to funding issues. This massive increase voids a sound rule requiring states to enroll 95% of eligible children in SCHIP before allowing adults on the program. Identification regulations are also relaxed for legal and illegal immigrants to sign up for SCHIP. SCHIP and Medicaid combined already cover the same number of Americans living at or below 200% of poverty. The problem isn’t that SCHIP needs to reach more people. It needs to reach the right people. The Republican alternative to the SCHIP reauthorization was simple and focused on children who otherwise would have no health insurance. Our alternative was an $8 billion a year, or 33%, increase in the current program. A 33% increase in a program as large as SCHIP is hardly anti-kid. Our alternative would have prevented “crowd-out,” where families drop their pre-existing, private insurance policies to sign up for an entitlement. Every dollar going to cover a middle-income adult is a dollar taken away from the very child SCHIP was intended to help.To this, Democrats accuse Republicans of refusing to help children. That’s the height of political demagogy.

I agree the Shrub has lost it once again. He supports wasting almost 1 trillion dollars killing people but opposes spending less then 5% of that money to help save children. What happened to his culture of life? I guess in his culture of life people get bombed and children die of preventable diseases.

I'm not quite clear on the rest of your points so I will address this one. The "poor logic" is not mine. Your example does not quite lend itself to the principle I mentioned. It is more logical to assume that if we should choose to spend government money on the people who contributed to it, including those who already receive "government welfare", i.e. employees, armed services, et al. it would be reasonable. Where is the logic or value in literally wasting that kind of OUR money attempting to prosecute a war without end? Where is OBL . . . . the one responsible for 9-11? After this amount of time and money Iraq is a fiscal dump! To continue this war rather than taking care of our own is wasteful, irresponsible and frankly stupid. ".....now in its fifth year and costing between $6 billion and $9 billion each month to prosecute, according to the Congressional Budget Office is beyond reason." (First thing you know this could add up to be real money.) $4,000 a second. As Dr. Phil asks, "What are you thinking?" I guess it's all in where you place value on your fellow countrymen.

Abstinence 1, S-Chip 0by Amanda RobbDemocratic leaders are right to contest President Bush’s veto of their bill to expand the State Children’s Health Insurance program. But sadly, their “bipartisan compromise” will leave millions of young Americans vulnerable to sickness and suffering of the most preventable kind.To entice Republicans to support the bill, the House of Representatives agreed to increase money for abstinence-only sex education by $28 million, to a total of about $200 million a year. Abstinence-only courses, the only form of federally financed sex ed, teach that sexual activity outside of marriage is likely to cause psychological and physical harm.If that were true, our health care system would be not only broken, but besieged. A 2002 survey found that 93 percent of American adults had had premarital sex by the age of 30.In addition to provoking shame about a nearly universal activity, abstinence-only sex education is ineffective and dangerous. Last April, a 10-year study found that students who took abstinence-only courses were no more likely to abstain from sex than other students. Previous studies revealed that abstinence-only students avoid using contraception.

No, Matthew, it's the simple law of profit and loss. When a business gets priced right out of the marketplace, it fails.How? God didn't say that the government has an exclusive right to my wallet either.

nonsense people will still have to buy things and there will still be a need to make things.That is a selfish unchristian attitude.

And there will be others to take its place. I am so tired of the line of arguement that over taxation will drive business out of business. Nonsense So then it is better to have people die on the streets to save your wallet?

Probably the best argument to end the war is that we can't afford the war but even if we end the war we are still in debt. Only way to solve that problem is to lower benefits and raise taxes...the exact opposite of what anyone would want.

I notice that nobody has responded to Herr Mutz's claims that 25-year olds and people that make $ 83.000 are not poor children and therefore the program should not be expanded. I wonder why?Furthermore, trying to "win" the argument by saying that Herr Mutz is a filthy neocon (when he's actually the opposite) is a testament on how weak the oppositions arguments really are. And if you really have to go that way, just call him a Nazi and be done with it.Tricks and treachery are the practice of fools, that don't have brains enough to be honest.And to have the money for the program come out of the pockets of only a specific group of people is just despicable. But I guess it's always easy to spend other peoples money.Here's a newsflash for you guys: The US (both people and government) is BROKE. You have over $70 trillion worth entitlements floating around, no money to pay for them and you've just maxed out all your creditcards. Now is not a good time to add more entitlements to the list, no matter how "noble" your intentions are.

Can you explain these taxes that you say Michigan has that other satates don't? Michigan is hardly liberal. Not all of michigan is liberal and not all of it is detroit. The west side of the state is a cithgap stronghold. If detroit was removed from Michigan the state would be reder and more conservative then Texas. I live in a small west michigan town of 20000 people there are 50 chruches and two christianist radio stations. The local sherifs race is is being hotly contested by 3 rebublicans and no other party. I go to vote and there are only republicans on the ballot locally. The state just raised taxes to pay for a 1.9 billion dollar budget deficit, there was nothing but the schools, medcade, and prisions left to cut. Those legislators that voted for tax increases are now facing recalls for voting to increase the income tax from 3.9 to 4.3% and extending the sales tax to include services, like palm reading.

According to Tax Foundation Data, Michigan ranks 14th in State and Local Tax burden with these taxes encompassing 11.2% of income. If you factor in Federal taxes, the citizens of Michigan fork over 31.9% of their income. This percentage ranks them 21st out of the 50 states and myriad territories. The only reason Michigan doesn't rank higher on the list of highest taxed states is that the other Blue states are competing for the dubious honor. Of the top 14 taxed states, 12 are blue... What makes this even more extraordinary is that there were only 19 blue states to begin with, the vast proportion of which are the highest taxed in the union.

Well, spending money on wars is never a good thing, but just because that's bad, doesn't mean that spending it on other programs is good.I'm not knowledgeable enough about this subject to make any kind of judgement call on this one, but in general if someone writes something you think is factually incorrect, it's a good thing to call on them on their alledged BS instead of ignoring them.Here in Holland we used to have socialized medicine where our employers held back money from our paychecks. The employers then added a certain amount for each employee and then gave it to the government, who in turn gave it to the insurance companies. Employees were then able to choose from a list of insurance companies that their employers drafted.Unemployed people were only required to pay a token amount ($25-$50 per month) and got their insurance through a government insurance company.Health insurance was mandatory by law.These days we have a semi socialized/corporate medicine system. All people are still required by law to have health insurance. The employers no longer hold back any money and the people can buy insurance directly from any number of health insurance companies. The government makes sure that no insurance company raises the prices too much and that all people that apply for insurance get it.Insurance companies are not allowed to refuse anyone on medical reasons. That means that even a person that has AIDS, cancer and the birdflu can get insurance for the exact same price as a fit and healthy person.As a conservative I'm not too happy about any kind of socialized medicine. I think that a true free market can deliver any service better and cheaper than a government controlled market. But all things considered, when you have a system, any system, that makes sure that all the people have health insurance, one can't really complain.

So you think that the gubment which could not respond to Katrina, could not find WMD, could not protect its citizens from lead-painted Chinese toys, could not guarantee food safety, cannot find Osama, wastes “$4,000 per second” on an unwinnable war and can not protect its borders is somehow going to fix healthcare?By the way, we already have some socialized programs including law enforcement, state and government workers, etc. We also have social programs which we can afford i.e. social security, medicare.Interesting that you tout Social Security as a gubment success. Have you by any chance compared your social security benefit to the benefit you would have derived from privately investing? If the gubment were to take your SS tax dollars and invest them even conservatively you would have a far higher standard of living. The social security my folks paid into now barely covers their property taxes and grocery costs. I suppose the answer would be to raise their taxes to increase their benefits? Meanwhile the medicare trust fund will be out o’ money by 2020. Think medicare is a success? Ask a physician who must deal with the paperwork and wait for reduced payment or the participant who must wait for services. From the Social Security Administration’s 2007 annual report: http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TRSUM/trsummary.htmlEach year the Trustees of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds report on the current and projected financial status of the two programs. This message summarizes our 2007 Annual Reports. The financial condition of the Social Security and Medicare programs remains problematic; we believe their currently projected long run growth rates are not sustainable under current financing arrangements. Social Security's current annual surpluses of tax income over expenditures will soon begin to decline and then turn into rapidly growing deficits as the baby boom generation retires. Medicare's financial status is even worse. Medicare's Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund is already expected to pay out more in hospital benefits this year than it receives in taxes and other dedicated revenues. The growing annual deficits in both programs are projected to exhaust HI reserves in 2019 and Social Security reserves in 2041. In addition, the Medicare Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) Trust Fund that pays for physician services and the new prescription drug benefit will continue to require general revenue financing and charges on beneficiaries that grow faster than the economy and beneficiary incomes over time. The drawdown of Social Security and HI Trust Fund reserves and the general revenue transfers into SMI will place mounting pressure on the Federal budget. In fact, this pressure is already evident. For the first time, a "Medicare funding warning" is being triggered, signaling that non-dedicated sources of revenues-primarily general revenues- will soon account for more than 45 percent of Medicare's outlays. By law, this warning requires that the President propose, and the Congress consider, remedial action. End quote And that is the Social Security Administration admitting the system is bust!Your avatar would lead one to believe that ye are a Vietnam veteran. Why no mention of your VA benefits or efforts to secure them? Nevertheless, as a Vietnam era Veteran you should be nearing the age of medicare eligibility. Your medical insurance problems will be resolved on the backs of the younger generation as those baby boomers retire en masse. Fewer than 2.5 workers will be available to provide the tax moneys necessary to sustain the program. The solution: Cut benefits or increase taxes on those remaining tax payers. BTW, only the neo-conservatives here are against all of us having some kind of decent, affordable coverageI don’t suppose you would suggest that neocons (or anyone else) are opposed to food, but I don’t suppose you would suggest that anyone who does not support universal grocery subsidy is an evil neocon. What about shelter? Universal gubment sponsored housing! Only a neocon would question the cost! Surely food and shelter are more fundamental needs than medical care. The problem is not that folks are opposed to others having these things. The problem is how to pay for these big society ideas without raising taxes to an onerous level. Americans already spend 1/3 of the year at work simply to satisfy their current tax burden. I doubt many of them would be excited to have to work until May or June to satisfy the tax man.

So your overtaxation claim can not be upheld.I guess that’s my fault for not accepting your personal anecdote over the statistics provided by the Tax Foundation or the US Census Bureau. According to the former, Michiganders pay 11.2% in state and Local taxes, just slightly above the national average but high enough to place them at #14 out of 50 states. That sir is more than 36 other states, ergo Michigan IS one of the highest tax states. Moreover, the US Census bureau ranks Michigan as #8 in total tax burden. The best data for Michigan appears in the per-capita tax rating in which Michigan is 18th with an average per capita tax burden of $2,324. Eighteenth is still well above the median. (http://www.census.gov) To be fair, Michigan ranks 3rd among states who impose a flat fee individual income tax structure. Yey Michigan!

If you think private is better than universal, sponsored by the government, the borders are open. ]C'mon over. So you think that the gubment which could not respond to Katrina, could not find WMD, could not protect its citizens from lead-painted Chinese toys, could not guarantee food safety, cannot find Osama, wastes “$4,000 per second” on an unwinnable war and can not protect its borders is somehow going to fix healthcare?By the way, we already have some socialized programs including law enforcement, state and government workers, etc. We also have social programs which we can afford i.e. social security, medicare.Interesting that you tout Social Security as a gubment success. Have you by any chance compared your social security benefit to the benefit you would have derived from privately investing? If the gubment were to take your SS tax dollars and invest them even conservatively you would have a far higher standard of living. The social security my folks paid into now barely covers their property taxes and grocery costs. I suppose the answer would be to raise their taxes to increase their benefits? Meanwhile the medicare trust fund will be out o’ money by 2020. Think medicare is a success? Ask a physician who must deal with the paperwork and wait for reduced payment or the participant who must wait for services. From the Social Security Administration’s 2007 annual report: http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TRSUM/trsummary.htmlEach year the Trustees of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds report on the current and projected financial status of the two programs. This message summarizes our 2007 Annual Reports. The financial condition of the Social Security and Medicare programs remains problematic; we believe their currently projected long run growth rates are not sustainable under current financing arrangements. Social Security's current annual surpluses of tax income over expenditures will soon begin to decline and then turn into rapidly growing deficits as the baby boom generation retires. Medicare's financial status is even worse. Medicare's Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund is already expected to pay out more in hospital benefits this year than it receives in taxes and other dedicated revenues. The growing annual deficits in both programs are projected to exhaust HI reserves in 2019 and Social Security reserves in 2041. In addition, the Medicare Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) Trust Fund that pays for physician services and the new prescription drug benefit will continue to require general revenue financing and charges on beneficiaries that grow faster than the economy and beneficiary incomes over time. The drawdown of Social Security and HI Trust Fund reserves and the general revenue transfers into SMI will place mounting pressure on the Federal budget. In fact, this pressure is already evident. For the first time, a "Medicare funding warning" is being triggered, signaling that non-dedicated sources of revenues-primarily general revenues- will soon account for more than 45 percent of Medicare's outlays. By law, this warning requires that the President propose, and the Congress consider, remedial action. End quote And that is the Social Security Administration admitting the system is bust!Your avatar would lead one to believe that ye are a Vietnam veteran. Why no mention of your VA benefits or efforts to secure them? Nevertheless, as a Vietnam era Veteran you should be nearing the age of medicare eligibility. Your medical insurance problems will be resolved on the backs of the younger generation as those baby boomers retire en masse. Fewer than 2.5 workers will be available to provide the tax moneys necessary to sustain the program. The solution: Cut benefits or increase taxes on those remaining tax payers. BTW, only the neo-conservatives here are against all of us having some kind of decent, affordable coverageI don’t suppose you would suggest that neocons (or anyone else) are opposed to food, but I don’t suppose you would suggest that anyone who does not support universal grocery subsidy is an evil neocon. What about shelter? Universal gubment sponsored housing! Only a neocon would question the cost! Surely food and shelter are more fundamental needs than medical care. The problem is not that folks are opposed to others having these things. The problem is how to pay for these big society ideas without raising taxes to an onerous level. Americans already spend 1/3 of the year at work simply to satisfy their current tax burden. I doubt many of them would be excited to have to work until May or June to satisfy the tax man.

I gave you real data with the percents from my paycheck. Unless you can list some tax that I pay that those in others states don't pay you have no case. Your claim is false, no matter what statistics you are using when put up against the reality or real data. The Michigan income tax is going to 4.35% however that is still lower then the 4.4% that it was in 1995.
attacks
Then you do not have a claim that Michigan is one of the highest tax states. I gave you the detail percentages from my paycheck. We have a 6% sales tax and dealing with the p&L's from the business I am in I know that there are no other taxes out there. So your overtaxation claim can not be upheld.I guess that’s my fault for not accepting your personal anecdote over the statistics provided by the Tax Foundation or the US Census Bureau. According to the former, Michiganders pay 11.2% in state and Local taxes, just slightly above the national average but high enough to place them at #14 out of 50 states. That sir is more than 36 other states, ergo Michigan IS one of the highest tax states. Moreover, the US Census bureau ranks Michigan as #8 in total tax burden. The best data for Michigan appears in the per-capita tax rating in which Michigan is 18th with an average per capita tax burden of $2,324. Eighteenth is still well above the median. (http://www.census.gov) To be fair, Michigan ranks 3rd among states who impose a flat fee individual income tax structure. Yey Michigan!

Not really.Let me simplify it for you:Spending on war is worse than spending on healthcare, BUT spending on anything is bad when you're BROKE(!). No you didn't.

Interesting. Making value judgements seem not to be a part of your logic. Spending on war or on health care seem to be the same in your opinion here. Maybe you should have read back a littler earlier in the thread. I did!!Here in Holland we used to have socialized medicine where our employers held back money from our paychecks. The employers then added a certain amount for each employee and then gave it to the government, who in turn gave it to the insurance companies. Employees were then able to choose from a list of insurance companies that their employers drafted.Unemployed people were only required to pay a token amount ($25-$50 per month) and got their insurance through a government insurance company.Health insurance was mandatory by law.I presume by what you wrote that having a conservative view trumps practicality. My wife and I pay $2,000 a month to Aetna for health care which cannot be bought elsewhere due to health reasons. Every other company will not insure us. Why? type II diabetes and high blood pressure. . .that's it! We still have a large deductible and co-payments for drugs. So, if you like free, truly free market, come on over. If you think private is better than universal, sponsored by the government, the borders are open. ]C'mon over. By the way, we already have some socialized programs including law enforcement, state and government workers, etc. We also have social programs which we can afford i.e. social security, medicare. BTW, only the neo-conservatives here are against all of us having some kind of decent, affordable coverage. Heath care here is a train wreck in many instances. If I didn't have (or could not afford) insurance, had a heart attack requiring surgery, my wife and I would be out on the streets. So, our choice is clear. . . .gamble or pay $2K a month. What would you do?

The funny thing about statistics is that they are data. The statistics I have quoted reflect the total tax burden of the average citizen of Michigan. Your pay check does not constitute a sizable data pool and does not reflect all the taxes you pay. Your real data is not complete. Your figures do not include property taxes, sales taxes, gasoline taxes, tobacco taxes, telephone taxes, local taxes and imbedded taxes. It also does not reflect the payroll taxes paid by your EMPLOYER. Your employer does not pay this tax but merely subtracts it from your total compensation. I have rather patiently provided you with real-world data I have provided citations and statistics from three separate sources which you have countered with a pay stub. Your pay stub does not negate the previously posted statistics which consistently place Michigan in the ranks of the highest taxed states. The US Census ranks Michigan in the top 20% of taxed states. Your paycheck cannot erase that. If we take you at your word and assume your provided figures are correct (but adjust the income tax to the current flat-rate of 3.9%, your payroll deductions account for a total of 22.55% of your total income. Lets look at some of the taxes ye missed: Property TaxesProperty Taxes per $1,000 of Personal Income: This measure. from the U.S. Census Bureau, is probably the best measure of the relative burden of taxes. In fiscal year 1990, Michigan ranked 10th among the 50 states with $47.09 in property taxes per $1,000 of personal income. The national (50-state) average was $35.62. Michigan's high burden also placed it second among the 12 Midwestern states. http://www.educationreport.org/article.aspx?ID=5802The mathematician in ye will inform you that $47.09 out of every $1,000 = 4.79%. Even if you pay rent to a landlord you are absorbing this tax in increased rent.22.55%+4.79% = 27.34%.Sales Tax:Here it gets a little tricky. The average Michigander (Michigoose?) pays $781 per year in sales tax. Given that the average per capita income in Michigan is $37,538 the average per capita sales tax expenditure equals 2.0% of the average per capita income.22.55%+4.79%+2.0% = 29.34%Gasoline:Michigan’s gasoline tax is a modest $.19875 per gallon. According to the US Department of Energy, the average American consumes 500 gallons of gasoline per year. This means that the average Michigander forks over just about $100 in gas taxes. Add the nearly $100 you pay in federal gasoline taxes and you have another .5% of tax. Factor in the additional costs for 6% sales tax (not factored in the above sales tax calculation) and you reach 0.75%22.55% + 4.79% + 2.0% + 0.75% = 30.09%. Tobacco Tax:According to the Michigan Tobacco Settlement Filings, as of 2002 there were 2.4 Million smokers in Michigan. Taking the US Department of Health and Human Services data, we can conclude that these smokers consume an average of one pack per day. The Michigan Tobacco Tax (4th highest in the nation) stands at $2.00 per pack. Each day, smokers cough up $4.8 million in tobacco tax or $1,752,000,000 per year. Given the 2006 population of the State of Michigan, we can extrapolate the average per capita cost for the tobacco tax at $175.00. 22.55% + 4.79% + 2.0% + 0.75% + 0.4%= 30.49%. For a difference of , 7.94% or $2,980 per capita.Well Matthew, it would appear that I discovered nearly $3,000 worth of taxes you didn’t realize you were paying. I’m beginning to understand why you think people should pay more taxes to fund more socialist endeavors. Add in local and municipal taxes, user fees, ad valorem taxes, tolls, utility and telephone taxes, and your percentage will reach those put forth by the US Census Bureau and the Tax Foundation.If you have real data from a reputable source please put it forward, or at least call me a bigoted neocon. Anything but please do not put your pay check forward as evidence. It makes you look ill-informed and makes this all too easy.

WEll duh. Point is in this country we find money for the things "we" believe in, i.e. war.That's the difference in reading the bill AND reciting what's heard. I've taken the time to read the bill. The figures mentioned are there but in a completely different context as stated here. Anyone else can do the same. My point exactly.Well, I hate to tell you this but my daughter is employed by a pharmaceutical co. Most of us understand how and why lobbists work So, I don't think most of us "Americans" are as naive as you believe.Not the same personalities but the same principles, yes. This problem was originated by Pres. Nixon. by supporting the founding of HMO's. So, it can be changed. Interesting how we Americans look at our country. Love America, hate the government.In this country the government is made up by the people but in many instances not FOR the people. Thehrefore change is possible if we can get cronically mentally lazy people off their bones and begin to think and vote. I can go to any natural food store and buy any vitamins or supplements I care to buy. . . .or order on the internet.Welcome to the wonderful world of corporatism (i.e. fascism).

[QUOTE=E Mutz;288530]If you think private is better than universal, sponsored by the government, the borders are open. ]C'mon over. No, it won't be fixed with this administration. Fortunately our government has been run by far more competent people in the past and I'm sure will be in the future.By the way, we already have some socialized programs including law enforcement, state and government workers, etc. We also have social programs which we can afford i.e. social security, medicare.This sounds as if you want the same incompetent government to manage your money. I've looked at the same scales and you're right. It is a shame. Pathetic. Couldn't agree more.I wouldn't suggest a tax increase. The money would be there except Mr. Bush decided to cannibalize the program to support other programs. The money was there when he was elected. $$$$ was there until 2050. Here in Florida, where "old" is originated, no one waits for a doctor. Medicare works pretty well here. No it isn't perfect. Physicians, if they participate with insurance companies agree to accept the "scale". You only pay full price when you pay cash. What would you suggest as an alternative? Do your parents already receive a healthcare plan from the government? Medicare? I don't begrudge them at all but it can be enlarged to include the larger population.Fortunately I do not have disailities stemming from action in VN. I did use my GI Bill for education. I'm not sure what you mean. Are you suggesting it is my fault or my generation's fault for this broken system? Also, what about the more than 25000 injured vets in this war? It appears the man in the white house has disrupted this economy for a long, long time. Taxes are a re-occuring theme in your statement. How is the useless "homeland Security" financed? How is the war being financed, other than through bonds? Mr. Bush has presumably "lowered" taxes when all the while he is digging the tax pit deeper every day for generations to come. So, when a president comes in to attempt to stop the damage, he (she) will be accused of RAISING TAXES. Yet it will be inevitable.BTW, only the neo-conservatives here are against all of us having some kind of decent, affordable coverageHuh?Yes they are but 47 million Americans are not without food. I wouldn't call health care a "big society" idea. I call it a human right. I agree. But I think we can both agree that there's a few dollars of "pork" which could be reduced from the budget before a tax increase to pay for health care would be necessary.

Are you saying that people in other states don't pay property taxes, sales tax, tabacco tax, or gas taxes?No I am saying that they pay less property, sales, tobacco and gas taxes. How could Michigan rank 8th out of 50 if those other states didn't pay those taxes? In the case of property taxes, 40 States pay less. 46 States pay less tobacco tax. The average sales tax is 5% and Michigan's 6% sales tax exceeds that average. Overall, Michiganders pay more than the residents of 42 other states according to the US Census. But next year, the tax burden will rise and Michigan will likely pass up some of those blue states who currently bear a higher tax burden.
