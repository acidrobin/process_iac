That seems to be the biggest question in the debate over abortion. The answer is not a single day but rather it is each persons opinion. The pro-life people say that a fetus is a human when the sperm fuses with the egg. The extreme pro-choice people say that it is a fetus until birth. I disagree with both.When a fetus is a one celled organism then it is in no way a human. The supporters of the idea that is it human say that it has the DNA that makes us human. They are right, but so does the skin you shed all the time. So does all the blood you have ever lost. All those cells have the blueprint that makes us human. So it is not DNA that makes us, us.So what makes a human? DNA gives a blueprint but it certainly does not decide when the blueprint has been completed enough to call it human. The answer must be in the make up of the fetus. Organs, a nervious system, a brain, all these are the things that make us human. Those things are not developed until 7-10 weeks after conception though (depending on your source). Many like to show proof that they start to develope earlier but again, unless something is completed and is operating then it cannot be regarded as developed. Based on that information I would have to say that abortion should be legal until 7-10 weeks after conception. Once that time period has passed and the fetus has a functional nervious system and brain then abortion should only be reserved for the rare cases that the mothers life is in danger. That solution seems to be the closest that both sides can get to agreeing though many from both sides reject it because they are to hardheaded to budge. I would like to hear from anyone that has any thoughts on the subject though. What do you think?

At what point are we called human?

We are human at conception. The sperm and ovary cells are human before they even connect. A fingernail clipping is human.What you mean is; when do we become a person.

I am curious about your position. Why have you chosen the nervous system and brain and organs as the cutoff points for the humanmeter? Have you done so arbitrarily? Does this mean that if these are not as you said "completed and operating (developed)" then we are not human? If this were true there would be alot of handicapped people who are not human. Christopher Reeve and all the other quadrapalegic and parapalegics like him would be in trouble. What IQ determines a fully developed brain?

Christopher Reeve had an operating brain and organs. His nervious system was damaged. Obviously your example has no ground. As for IQ, it is not IQ that I am depending on to decide on if a fetus is human or not. I am simply deciding on if the brain is formed or not. Operational is a better term.

The state of development is very imporant as well. The brain and nervous system are far from fully functional at the 7 to 10 week period. One can even say that the brain and nervous system continues to develop even after birth. So, the important question would be - when is the brain and nervous system sufficiently developed to be called a person (or "human", in the way that I am guessing you mean it)? In my opinion, the deciding factor comes when the brain is sufficiently developed to support a rudimentary mind, emotions, sense of pain, etc. My understanding is that this does not happen until roughly the 30th week - into the third trimester. Up to that point, the brain may be developed enough to control various bodily functions. However, without at least a rudimentary mind, a body is just that - a body. A mind needs to exist for there to be a person.

That is something similar to the view of French law that allows elective abortion to be carried out up to 12 weeks into a pregnancy term.I disagree with that position but concur with the view of UK law that recognises that the foetus becomes viable (ie. it would have a good chance of surviving birth) at 24 weeks- at this point and later elective abortion is illegal- although the option of abortion remains for instances where the mothers life is endangered or if the baby has developed various genetic disorders.

While I agree that the brain continues to develope even until adulthood there is a point where the physical structure of the brain is complete. While there are arguements that it isn't done until the third trimester we must be safe on this. Afterall we don't want to be wrong. I choose the 7-10th week because even pro-life groups say it isn't developed until then.

Well, when comparing a young blastocyst and a 40 year old no legs with someone who is abitrarily deemed as being the perfect specimen of humanity, two main differences are with regard to size and development.

Size isn't relevant surely, just development but other than this case of abortion I can't see where discrimination based of development occurs, especially as we are talking pure CNS development.Though I suppose we discriminate against children based of development (and size I suppose), they can't vote, drive, or do a whole host of things.

Because you, like many anti-abortionists, cling to the ridiculous dogma that "life begins at coneption". A new cell is a new life. A dead cell is the end of that life.Of course "a new human life" is not the same as a new life or the claim that life begins at conception. A new human life begins at conception, or when the heart beats, or when there is brain funtion or when it is born etc: it refers to a specific form of life, but it still doesn't clearly define when it starts.

The sperm has half the DNA of the male with a ton of weirdness added - the chromosomes the sperm has will be quite different to the ones the rest of the body has, likewise with the eggs.The information in the sperm will be contained within the male's genome, but it will be organised differently.It needs more than just a new set of DNA to make a person, unless you want to start including cancer cells. There are no nice clear cut definitions about life, human or personhood in science, they are all kind of vague around the edges either not including or including other things that you wouldn't really associate with the original thing.

It is also defined as "A spiritual state regarded as a transcending of corporeal death" and "The time for which something exists or functions" (with the latter having the example of "the useful life of a car". So unless you want to convince us that a car is a human being that begins at conception, it really does matter that you selectively quote, as selective quoting is dishonest and is indicative of someone who has lost the argument.No it doesn't. It has a unique combination of just under half of the male's DNA with a few random changes thrown in. The DNA of a sperm is different from that of the male. That is why sperm cells are protected from the male's immune system by guard cells as the DNA is different and the immune system recognises it as a "foreign" organism.

I'd disagree with that too. The "weight of scientific opinion" won't offer a fixed point at which life begins. To offer a quote from "Health and Development: Conception to Birth" ISBN 0 7492 81529:"There is a common belief that life begins at the moment of conception, i.e. when the sperm fuses with an egg. This is a step forward from past years, when life was alleged to start at the time of 'quickening', i.e. when a woman could feel her fetus moving inside her. However both these opinions suffer from an underlying falsehood: that life 'begins' at all. Life is a continuum; gametes are produced by living parents, and fuse to produce new living individuals, but unfused gamets are nonetheless alive and capable of metabolic activities"

We can each decide on some arbitary point; we just cannot agree on just one arbitary point. There is nothing to find out. You can no more "find out" when a continuum like life starts than you can "find out" at what speed an accelerating car is suddenly "going fast".Why does it matter?

the problem with this discussion is that we are confusing legal and moral issues. We are assuming that a law must be moral, and morality absolute. This doesn’t always happen in real life. Most laws are just a compromise or the result of whatever the majority ( in an ideal democracy) think is right or convenient.It might be morally wrong to abort a child but it is convenient.

To offer a quote from "Health and Development: Conception to Birth" ISBN 0 7492 81529:"There is a common belief that life begins at the moment of conception, i.e. when the sperm fuses with an egg. This is a step forward from past years, when life was alleged to start at the time of 'quickening', i.e. when a woman could feel her fetus moving inside her. However both these opinions suffer from an underlying falsehood: that life 'begins' at all. Life is a continuum; gametes are produced by living parents, and fuse to produce new living individuals, but unfused gamets are nonetheless alive and capable of metabolic activities"

You didn't actually read it, did you? It completely supports my position. The article clearly discusses the scientific position (which it too terms the "Metabolic View") before discussing philosophical positions (all the other views).

whatever ones view of abortion, making it illegal is not going to stop it. If you make abortion illegal, it will just drive it underground with all its nasty consequences. Abortion existed long before it was made legal. Leave aside the moral,religious,ethical reasons for opposing abortion and look at it from the practical point of view - what do you hope to gain by making it illegal ? It sure is not going to stop it. So why not make it safe and legal and leave it to each person's belief to decide. We have two choice (1) legal and Safe (2) illegal and unsafe. Which option would you prefer ?

Actually Steeeeve, the arguement has generally succeeded in Western Democracy- abortion was re-legalised to allow access to abortion services that were both professional and regulated, with the attendant benefits this brings to women who choose to have one.

Successful in Western Democracy? Are you serious? Shall we examine how abortion came to be legal in the United States?In the US, abortion came to be legal by judicial fiat, not democratic rule. Seven members of the Supreme Court decided that abortion should be permissable, not the U.S. Congress. 7 people deciding that abortion should be legal in a nation that had a population of over 200,000,000 hardly sounds like democratic rule.As we all know, the US Supreme Court's failure to answer the personhood question allowed them to concoct a right to privacy where the decision to have an abortion had to remain one between a woman and her doctor. Justice Blackmun, writing the opinion in wade, said in Section 9A that "[t]he appellee and certain amici argue that the fetus is a "person" within the language and meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. In support of this, they outline at length and in detail the well- known facts of fetal development. If this suggestion of personhood is established, the appellant's case, of course, collapses, [p157] for the fetus' right to life would then be guaranteed specifically by the Amendment." Democratic rule? Seven men determined that the fetus was not a person. Democratic rule? More like tyrannical despotism.

It sort of does in an arse-about-face way. It tells us that polititians cannot turn to science for a definitive answer on when a new human life starts, a new human comes into existence, when a new person joins the human race etc (or however else the question is phrased). It tells us that it isn't a simple black-and-white situation and that we must use ethics and philosophy to come up with a completely subjective moral view on the issue and that that must then guide any law making.

Good point, but it does not really help us from a legal point of view does it?

He very clearly said "generally succeeded in Western Democracy". There are western democracies beyond the borders of the USA. I do not know if OccamsRazor is correct in the implication that most western democracies re-introduced legal abortions because of the safety and wealfare argument, but it definately applies here in the UK as it was the central argument to the successful bill to legalise abortion in 1967.I suspect that OccamsRazor is correct and that the majority of western democracies have made abortion legal in recent years at least in part because of the success of the safety argument and that the USA is a bit of an oddity in this regard.

No philosophy is not a science. Philosophy is a mixture of the branch of maths known as logic and subjective human thought. Science has to use philosophy at times, but does so with caution as it is often an imprecise discipline.

Philosophy is not a science. But science is a type of philosophy: one based on the assumption of empiricism, cause and effect and so on. In a sense, science is far less precise than philosophy, as it makes a host of assumptions. However, many philosophers do present things in a somewhat subjective way.

I disagree. The scientific method replaced the old empiricism ways of pre-modern scientific knowledge advancement with a precise mathematical based method removed from philosophy. The scientific method takes empirical data and subjects them to statistical analysis. It is the result of the statistical analysis that progresses knowledge through science, not the empirical data.Quite the opposite. Science seeks to minimise the assumptions, the variables, the subjectivity of pure empiricism by the use of the precision of statistic analysis. Done properly, science is as precise as it can get.Only "many"?

Empiricism and 'natural philosophy' suffered from subjective "gut reaction" conclusion, rather than objective analysis via maths. Sure it is a continuation, in the same way that heart transplant surgery is a continuation of bleeding patients to balance their humours.Is it? It is more the case that science assumes the phisical universe exists and is measurable in a repeatable way.

Well if they just use personal opinions, it's not science. If they used the scientific method then it is science.But my question is, why does it matter if it is a life? The term life isn't even fully defined. In biology our teacher told us life is like the supreme court ruling on what constituted pornography. "We'll know it when we see it". So what does life mean? Is a seed (embryo) considered a tree (human)? I think it needs to have a few more qualifications than that. Does it have to be able to support itself outside the mother? Some fully alive humans can do that. It really doesn't matter whether it's alive or not, the real moral issue seems to be a taking away a potential life. So the question is at what point is it necessary to continue to raise the potential life. Everyone agrees that at birth they are responsible for the baby. Some think they should be responsible for him/her at conception. Is using a condom wrong? It stops a potential life from forming. The problem is that we know if we were in that condition we would want to live. We can't relate to a sperm or an egg, but once it's one being (a baby) we can relate more to it. When we can relate more we can put ourselves in the baby's shoes more and not want to allow people to "kill" it.Personally I don't see why abortions are necessary late into the pregnancy. In the first one or two weeks you would think the mother and father could decide whether to keep the baby or not. Right now I think you get 2 trimesters. I agree we should err on the side of life but we have to think of the mother too. I think abortions should be allowed, but they should be as early as possible.

1) Stealing and abortion are two separate issues. The former is in every culture a crime, the latter is not. Therefore abortion is not necessary a crime.2) Stealing does not automatically endanger the life of the thief, whereas an abortion is always a life threatening medical procedure. Making it illegal and thus forcing a human being to go to a butcher instead of a doctor is cruel and heartless and constitutes, if abortion is considered a crime, a de facto cruel and unjust punishment.But we know that moral right is a gang of implacable, cold hearted zealots.

Well, science is also vulnerable to gut reactions. You can't simply analyse data and have a scientific theorem. There's always a level of hypothesis dictating how the data is analysed and what data you choose etc. And a better comparison is that Newton's calculus is a continuation of the algebra that had gone beforeThose are two huge assumptions, and both rely on the assumption that our senses can inform us accurately about the world. This is what empiricism is. Science also presupposes that logic is correct and that cause and effect exists, neither of which is covered by empiricism.

Science, properly done, doesn't have "gut reactions". It's the scientists that have those reactions if they do poor science. One makes assumptions in coming up with a hypothesis. One tests that hypothesis though with random sampled data (not chosen data) and there are objective rules on which statistical method must be used to analyse the data depending upon its form and size. If that hypothesis is not rejected by the data, then it becomes part of a theorem and human knowledge grows.I do not agree that that is a better comparison. The modern scientific method is not a refinement of natural philosophy and empiricism, it is a wholely different approach. Thus I feel my comparison is better.

I'm not familiar with UK abortion laws. What criteria has to be met in order to abort a >24 week old fetus? Is there a top 10 list of allowed genetic disorders? How severe does the potential disorder have to be?
attacks
That is something similar to the view of French law that allows elective abortion to be carried out up to 12 weeks into a pregnancy term.I disagree with that position but concur with the view of UK law that recognises that the foetus becomes viable (ie. it would have a good chance of surviving birth) at 24 weeks- at this point and later elective abortion is illegal- although the option of abortion remains for instances where the mothers life is endangered or if the baby has developed various genetic disorders.

The 1967 act "...allows termination of a pregnancy at any time if there is a significant risk of the baby being born seriously disabled."It doesn't specify what "seriously disabled" is: it's it left to the discretion of the doctor.

At this point in this countries life I would love to see all abortion made illegal. Why you ask?To let it mess us up. That's right I want the conservatives to go hog wild. All you moderates and liberals out there just stand back and let them rip apart this country.When their kid comes home in 10th grade with a positive preg test they might go OMG you can't raise a kid...... your just a kid! Suddenly these adoption agencies that you scream about so much will be overflowing with millions of unwanted babies. On top of that hundreds of thousands of women will be perminently scared for life from untrained quacks performing their abortions. The crime rate would skyrocket from children with no proper upbringing. Raised by the media and completely ignored.The rich won't worry about anything because they will simply fly to another country to have their abortions. They always can get around things.Then once the conservatives sit back and see what they have done with a smile, their smile will slowly turn to confusion. "Weren't we right to make everything illegal???? Well at least we have a million kids that that wouldn't have come into existance. Now lets get rid of condoms because those have prevented millions of other kids from coming into existance." Just wait the conservatives are already attacking condoms.... That isn't the furture, that is now.Oh the future is bright with teens not using condoms because "they don't work." Then since they WILL get preg they have to have a child. Imagine the number of unwanted children...... imagine the destruction of the family unit.Family values guys? Your lucky you have moderates and libs to keep you in check, you are your own worst enemy.

At this point in this countries life I would love to see all abortion made illegal. Why you ask?To let it mess us up. That's right I want the conservatives to go hog wild. All you moderates and liberals out there just stand back and let them rip apart this country.When their kid comes home in 10th grade with a positive preg test they might go OMG you can't raise a kid...... your just a kid! Suddenly these adoption agencies that you scream about so much will be overflowing with millions of unwanted babies. On top of that hundreds of thousands of women will be perminently scared for life from untrained quacks performing their abortions. The crime rate would skyrocket from children with no proper upbringing. Raised by the media and completely ignored.The rich won't worry about anything because they will simply fly to another country to have their abortions. They always can get around things.Then once the conservatives sit back and see what they have done with a smile, their smile will slowly turn to confusion. "Weren't we right to make everything illegal???? Well at least we have a million kids that that wouldn't have come into existance. Now lets get rid of condoms because those have prevented millions of other kids from coming into existance." Just wait the conservatives are already attacking condoms.... That isn't the furture, that is now.Oh the future is bright with teens not using condoms because "they don't work." Then since they WILL get preg they have to have a child. Imagine the number of unwanted children...... imagine the destruction of the family unit.Family values guys? Your lucky you have moderates and libs to keep you in check, you are your own worst enemy.

Because the rich can't be bothered to waste their time being pregnant unless they actually want to have the kid. Having an abortion is taking personal responsibility for your actions.

"Maybe responsibility will creep back into the equation."It is responsibe to use a condom. Regardless, when two people get wrapped up in a mood and are going to have sex, rarey is the posibility of an abortion thought of. Thanks to you conservatives the chance of them using a condom would get lower anyway because "condoms don't work" right? So it would be unprotected sex..... lovely."They can afford nannies, so your argument is weak prima facie."Nice way of puting it but it doesn't hide the fact your not all that quick. The rich do whatever the rich want to do. If your 14 year old daughter is pregnant, even if your rich, you fly her to a place where she can have an abortion. The rich would get what they want, regardles of the law. You disagree with that?"Fathers "did the right thing" because they didn't have an easy way out and the liberal culture of illegitimacy hadn't caught hold yet."Here is where conservatives really show how stupid they are. They actually think the world is the same as it was in the 50's. College is almost required now to get a decent job. If you have a baby on the way while you are at college there is no way that a guy can support a mother, and a child while you attend full time at a college. In the 50's all a man needed to do was pick up a job and he could live reasonably well with his new family. In todays workforce you must have some education if you ever plan to live comfortably with a family. A child at an early age destroyes your chances of education. Sure you can survive on 2 fulltime jobs and never being a father but rather a pay check that only allows your wife and kid to live in a modest apartment or low income home. Is that the family values you are defending. A poor, overworked family? Of course there is the other option I told you about which is adoption which will be overflowing with babies of women that just cannot make it in the world with a baby and no dad. Or the girl is to young to raise the child.Again, this is not the 50's. If you think we still live then and the present economy still is set up exactly as it was in our grandparents time then go ahead.... think that. You further show how narrowminded a conservative is.

It's not narrow-minded, it's incredibly far-sighted. Think of all the manufacturing jobs lost overseas because American workers value themselves too highly to do such repetitive labour. But if they're desperate because they've just knocked up a woman and need to take responsibility for it, they'll grab that tedious underpaid job that their college tuition was spent to avoid. But more likely they'll just **** off and leave the woman to raise the child on her own.*Yay responsibility!*I've known single mothers to be able to live off of student loans and charity quite well actually.

Phychology is a science in some regards, as the scientific method can be used in some experiments to test hypotheses. However it, like other aspects of medicine is constrained by ethical issues surrounding experimenting on people (especially children). Therefore much of it is based upon medical empiricism, not science.
attacks
I gave you an example...pscyhology is science..and they don't always use the scientific method. Science means so many things..I don't know where you are getting this stuff from.

Hmm, I must admit I've no idea what "SCOTUS" is. We have no constitution here in the UK: our laws are created by parliament through a simple majority system and they are interpreted by the courts. If the courts find the laws too vague, nothing will happen about it until such time as parliament passes a new version of the law.Despite being vague, I couldn't find any reference to it being tested in court here. That may very well be due to the fact that I only made a cursory check though.
attacks
I see. Sounds too nebulous to stand up to scrutiny in the US. I'm guessing that the SCOTUS would strike down such as law as being too vague.

once again, you don't need the scientific method to be considered a science. If you don't believe this, then so be it...but first thing you learn about psychology is it is the science of behavior (among others). Science doesn't mean scientific method...all the scientific method is, is a way to conduct an experiment. I know a psychologist (which is a science) that comes out with results of things all the time...He doesn't use the "scientific method" yet it is still science. So no matter how much we go threw this in the end science has no real answer on when life begins.

But its meaningless if you can not define life in any meaningful way, let alone start pointing to where that begins.Its a vague concept under these circumstances, not something you can define in a way that can be used in court.

Basically saying that abortion being illegal and war not says that you care more about a code because someone near by shares it than you do about a thinking being that can experience the same things you can.Its OK to kill someone because they disagree with you and are willing to force their opinion on you but not if they are incapable of thought and action, yet share DNA with someone who does not want it who lives nearby?A human that is recognisably a person is more important to me than a dog yes, but to qualifiy as a person it has to reach certain requirements. If you are not possessing a more developed mind than the dog, then you have less rights than the dog. If something does not suffer, nor cause another to suffer by having things inflicted upon it then I really don't mind what happens. I don't see any wrong there - early on a fetus is just a thing, admiteded later its not. But whilst it is not any different physically from slime I kill to stop getting sick then its in the same category.Seems to me a lot easier to decide and work round a view based on what is actually there - than purely potential or focus on something that it has in common but has no real effect (DNA).

If you are asking someone like Steve for an answer whilst he was indulging in the "science" of washing the dishes, then yes the answer is meaningless. From the perspective of real science though, there is a clear answer: there is no single point at which human life starts. Therefore as you say, this proper answer simply points to the question being meaningless instead.
supports
Does anyone have a definite answer then, and if science can't come up with one do we really care what they have to say anyway in that case? Surely this just points out that this is not really a good question to ask and not actually related to the question in a meaningful way?

That is precisely the position of Peter Singer and I agree. But I go one step further I don’t think human lives are more important than animal lives such as dogs per se. I am very attached to my dog for instance and I consider his life more important and valuable to me than the life of somebody I don’t know of. The value of a life is realative.

The question is not: when did life on earth begin? The question is when the life of a human being begins? And the answer is: at the moment of conception, when a spermatozoid fertilizes an egg. This is not the same thing as sticking colour labels at different electro magnetic waves.

That's nice. It is also the scientific view. Any other position is one based on ethics and politics, not science.There are varying opinions because there is no single point at which is does begin. We can each decide on some arbitary point; we just cannot agree on just one arbitary point. There is nothing to find out. You can no more "find out" when a continuum like life starts than you can "find out" at what speed an accelerating car is suddenly "going fast".Why does it matter? It no more matters than knowing exactly at what wavelength orange light becomes red. It is completely subjective and nothing would be achieved by a concensus even if it could be reached.

Well, Winston! In that case I would argue that my life began with a gleam in my father's eye!

OK so in your opinion you claim lief starts at "the moment of conception". The problem here is, conception doesn't take a moment: it takes around 20 hours. So when, in that 20 hour period, does the life of a new human being begin?And of course there is the killer-XXXX problem to the whole "life begins at conception" argument: twins. The zygote can split into two separate zygotes at any stage up to two weeks. So at two weeks old this "human being" suddenly becomes two "human beings". Did the lives of two human beings begin at "the moment of conception" in this case or at the moment of division into two? The question is of course nothing like "sticking colour labels at different electro magnetic waves", it's more like asking how many angels can dance on the head of a pin: ie it is meaningless. Trying to pick an arbitary point and claiming that it is the start of a new human being's life is as preposterous as claiming an answer to how many angels can dance on the head of a pin...

It is preposterous to consider angels as they do not exist except on the fantasies of Christians.So let us concentrate on reality. Let us tackle the problem from the other end. Can we say that the life of a new human being begins before a spermatozoid penetrates the egg? Of course not. The moment the division of the fertilized cell begins life has definitely began. Why do you care about exactly at which precise millionth of a second the life of a human being begins? When somebody tells you that she is pregnant do you interrogate her to ascertain exactly when she became pregnant, or you tell her that she was always pregnant because life is a continuum?

Really? Can you prove they do not exist? They probably do not exist except on the fantasies of Christians, but to claim it as an absolute is the real preposterous action.Why not? The unfertilized egg and the sperm have the potential to form one or more new humans, just as the fertilized egg does. On what basis do you make the claim that the unfertlized egg is not a (potential) human yet the fertilized egg is a (potential) human?I don't care (I regard it as a meaningless quesion), you do. You have now moved the goal posts BTW from the "moment" of fertilization to the "moment" of mitosis.When in your opinion does a woman become pregnant? At the moment of conception? At the moment of implantation of the embryo in the uterus wall? When she notices? No I wouldn't tell her she'd always been pregnant: life is a continuum, but the time spent in the womb is a discrete finite event (though saying precisely when it starts is more vague).

I don’t have to disprove the existence of Angels as it is the other way around. You show me one and we’ll take it from there. Show me the money!!! Seeing is believing!! Etc etcI still don’t understand why you have an aversion to establish when conception occurred. To me conception begins when a sperm fertilizes an egg in the fallopian tube. Division then begins as it moves towards the uterus, by the time it reaches it (7-10 days) it is called a blastocyst. If you want to pick any time after fertilization and call it conception, be my guest! Resorting to ‘moment of mitosis’, moment of ‘fertilization’…. It just trying to avoid giving a straight answer.A potential new life is not the same as an actual new life. If a sperm stays in a man’s testicles and never fertilizes an egg inside a woman no child will ever be conceived by the two of them. You are pretty good at moving the goal posts now you are making no distinction about the potentiality to create life and actually doing it. So everybody is a criminal because theoretically anybody can commit a crime. C’mon give me a break.

Incorrect: you do. You made the absolute statement "angels ... do not exist except on the fantasies of Christians". So put up your proof or admit you made an absolute claim you cannot back up with any evidence. You may find it useful to read "The Dragon In My Garage" by Carl Sagan (eg http://www.godlessgeeks.com/LINKS/Dragon.htm) to understand why your current position is untenable.I don't. Experiments have established that conception occurs over a period of some 20 hours. Please avoid the use of strawmen. I have in no way indicated a desire to redefine what conception is.True, but this apllies to you. You naively claimed life started at the "moment of conception" and have been in full retreat since as "moment of conception" is a nonsense statement.And if an event kills the zygote before it has time to split into twins, then the second child will never be conceived. The lines between a potential new life and an actually new life are blurred and so it makes no sense to claim there is a single "moment" at which a new life starts.Incorrect: I am just pointing out there isn't a clear and precise distinction. There is a distinction, but it's blurred along the edges.Well some have used that argument to lock up people with psychiatric problems, but it's not an arguemtn I buy.

On the contrary Carl Sagan conclusion is to reject the dragon hypothesis due to lack of evidence. That is my position: the existence of Angels have never been proven therefore I can say that they do not exist until it is proven that they exist. What are you going to argue next: the existence of Santa Claus? The moment of conception is the moment when a new life actually begins and that moment is when an egg is fertilized by a sperm. After this, division of the fertilized egg begins I don’t know if a microsecond after or a few seconds after. I still don’t know the importance of finding when it precisely began. The reason you want to blur the lines is because you want to go back to the original statement than since life is a continuum no new life is ever began. It must be for religious reasons I suppose. Of course a human being is not created out of dead matter, but it doesn’t mean that we can not say: ‘at this point in time this new being began his life’. Even if you say that the moment of conception takes 20 hours. Well, 20 hours is a specific period of time. Before those 20 hours there was no new human being after those 20 hours there is.

I most certainly will tell you to. You are making the assertion, so you must back up that assertion. Failure to do so on your part shows your assertion to be a hollow one, ie an act of faith.So in your opinion, a new human life starts some 20-30 hours after the sperm fertilizes the egg.

Science is great at identifying cause/effect and measuring quantifiable parameters, but it doesn't necessarily make it the ideal tool for subjective observations and analyses.

Fakultat Katholische Theologie, Lehrstuhl fur Moraltheologie, Otto-Friedrich-Universitat Bamberg.PIP: The question of when human life begins can be answered in an elementary way: with the union of egg and sperm cells, because this process is the precondition to the development of human life. This would be a comfortable pronouncement if there were no conflict-laden medical-ethical, penal, and sociopolitical interests associated with the question. The hypothesis that unilaterally answers the question of the beginning of human life based on a clear ethical and legal creed regarding the duty of protection of human life from the beginning in the prenatal phase has been found incorrect. Regarding the moral and ethical aspects of social function in a pluralistic society, meaning, understanding, and values are discussed with respect to experiences and opportunities in life to evaluate the meaning of healthy sexuality and partnership in parallel with work, the economy, the environment, and their bearing on pregnancy conflicts. Another issue is the living world, plausibilities, and ethical as well as moral discourse. Socialization means the introduction into a living environment, without which the human being is unable to communicate or have its identity. This is a cultural and structural reality that has its values affecting conflict of pregnancy. Liberal attitudes, moral consciousness, and the penal code also have a weighty role with solidarity, tolerance, and overcoming conflicts without force entering into the picture. The discussion of the German Parliament about Section 218 of the abortion law extensively dealt with the right to self-determination of women but hardly any talk about the duty to respect the right of potential human being. Regarding the conflicts of pregnancy, the duty to protect human life is a moral stance derived from theological ethics stating the unwavering support of life right from fertilization when the soul enters it. In a Christian view the regulations under Section 218 are tolerable because in a pluralistic society compromises have to be accepted. PMID: 8303917 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]

Just because Sartre CLAIMS to be a scientist doesn't mean that he is.Shoot, I can claim to be a nuclear engineer on the same basis.I'd like to know where Sartre was educated, what his degree was in, what kind of grades he made, the professors he studied under, whether or not he's written any scientific papers that have been critiqued by the scientific community, plus a number of other items to shore up his claim to be a "scientist."Of course, Sartre is not going to share this information with us.

Regarding the conflicts of pregnancy, the duty to protect human life is a moral stance derived from theological ethics stating the unwavering support of life right from fertilization when the soul enters it. In a Christian view the regulations under Section 218 are tolerable because in a pluralistic society compromises have to be accepted. PMID: 8303917 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]

Just because Sartre CLAIMS to be a scientist doesn't mean that he is.Shoot, I can claim to be a nuclear engineer on the same basis.I'd like to know where Sartre was educated, what his degree was in, what kind of grades he made, the professors he studied under, whether or not he's written any scientific papers that have been critiqued by the scientific community, plus a number of other items to shore up his claim to be a "scientist."Of course, Sartre is not going to share this information with us.

There is NO scientific, definitive answer to when exactly life begins. Because of that, I believe that we should take the most conservative stance that human life begins at conception.
supports
So we still can conclude that science doesn't really have an answer to our question then.

haha, I woulda said "none of your business" buy nice. And what does the science community think of when life begins? Because there are only like 10 scientists in the world I figure you would know emoticonXRolleyes

Unless the woman is never, ever late and is on a certain cycle, she will not even know she's late for a month or so. I have never met such a woman.Anything can make you late, a cold, the flu, anxiety, and pregnancy.Simple denial works a certain part as well.

Sorry for the delay with my response, I've been on holiday and all that jazz.To business:Well, I would agree that the mechanism by which abortion access was reached in the US is (on the face of it) undemocratic..... then again how many other binding laws are made through such process in your nation? Many I would imagine- this seems to be the nature of your system.Also remember that popular opinion is not the only issue that matters when making law (thank goodness!).

Successful in Western Democracy? Are you serious? Shall we examine how abortion came to be legal in the United States?In the US, abortion came to be legal by judicial fiat, not democratic rule. Seven members of the Supreme Court decided that abortion should be permissable, not the U.S. Congress. 7 people deciding that abortion should be legal in a nation that had a population of over 200,000,000 hardly sounds like democratic rule.As we all know, the US Supreme Court's failure to answer the personhood question allowed them to concoct a right to privacy where the decision to have an abortion had to remain one between a woman and her doctor. Justice Blackmun, writing the opinion in wade, said in Section 9A that "[t]he appellee and certain amici argue that the fetus is a "person" within the language and meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. In support of this, they outline at length and in detail the well- known facts of fetal development. If this suggestion of personhood is established, the appellant's case, of course, collapses, [p157] for the fetus' right to life would then be guaranteed specifically by the Amendment." Democratic rule? Seven men determined that the fetus was not a person. Democratic rule? More like tyrannical despotism.

I see where you are coming from now, well made points.

It sort of does in an arse-about-face way. It tells us that polititians cannot turn to science for a definitive answer on when a new human life starts, a new human comes into existence, when a new person joins the human race etc (or however else the question is phrased). It tells us that it isn't a simple black-and-white situation and that we must use ethics and philosophy to come up with a completely subjective moral view on the issue and that that must then guide any law making.

Now you understand the need for a SCOTUS Justice that has actually read the Constitution. In the Roe v Wade dissenting opinion, the SCOTUS was scolded for using its "raw judicial power".

SCOTUS= Supreme Court of The United States yes?Perhaps it would, which shows interesting contrasts between two different legal systems.But as Clive14 had previously stated, the law has been deliberately drafted to allow the Doctor to make a judgement in the case by case reality of the world they work in (although I add not all UK doctors are happy with this responsibility the law has granted them).I'm more than sure all the Justice's who serve in the SCOTUS are familiar with the US Constitution- and perhaps in the case of Roe vs. Wade, a bit of "raw judicial power" was in order......

I see. Sounds too nebulous to stand up to scrutiny in the US. I'm guessing that the SCOTUS would strike down such as law as being too vague.

Hello people, this is my first post on this forum and to be honest, I just googled "politics" and clicked on the first link that seemed interresting and I registered, just because I was looking for something to debate about.The reason that the first post I make is in this thread is because I think that abortion is a really important thing to be discussed. (because I think it is fundamentally wrong, but I'll explain that in another thread and stay on topic in this thread ;) )The question that was asked first, namely "at what point are we called human" or "when does our life begin" is a real tricky one and there are no certain answers for this question, but I believe that one must first explain what is meant by "life" before you can answer the question whether life begins at the fertilisation of the egg, the blastula formation or any other moment in the pregnacy. (I'm pretty sure noone thinks that life begins when you're 10 years old or so ;) )One needs to define life first before one can say when it begins. I didn't think of this myself, to be honest, but the coincidence is that this year a had a course (I'm a student) zoology and our professor, Arnold De Loof) had us read this book (called: Communication, Life, Mega-Evolution) that he wrote and that tries to define life and that tries to explain the necessity to define life to be able to form an ethical view on stuff like abortion, euthanasia, ... The reason that I want to share this with you guys is that I could actually find myself in the reasonning he made to define the point a which life begins.I won't be able to give a total summary of the book, but a rough summary is that he says that life is the total sum of communication activity by the organism. That means that there is a quantatative dimension to "life" (the sum of all communications) and a qualitative dimension (the fact that something communicates) that defines life. On the cellular level that would be the fact that there is communication with the environment by the means of ion-transporting channels and enzymes.He also states that there are 16 hierarchical levels of compartimentalisation (a compartment being a biological compartment able to communicate with it's environment), e.g. the prokaryotic compartment (a prokaryotic cell that has a membrane that is partially permeable to certain ions) , the aggregate compartment (cells that form aggregates and thus are able to communicate in an intenser way than cells that are not in an aggregate), the syncytium compartment (cells that form a syncytium and are thus able to communicate in an intenser way than cells that don't form a syncytium with other cells), the social compartment (animals like bees and ants that communicate better with eachother than animals that don't have a strict social structure), ... (I understand that this is quite difficult for someone that didn't take a biology course or so, but it's my best shot. If you want it explained good, read the book ;) )I'll explain his reasonning for the beginning of the "humanness" more thoroughly. He first tries to explain when the "life" of the embryo begins. He says that life begins in a fraction of a second, when the sperm cell touches the plasma membrane of the egg cell. This is because exactly at that moment, the Ca 2+ concentration dramatically increases (called a calcium explosion) and the cell for the first time communicates on a high level with it's environment and because a novel type of compartment is born, the diploïd eucaryotic cell.Then he explains why single somatic cells (body cells, like skin cells etc.) are not full human beings. Why? Because they don't have the ability to do all the following things: form an aggregate, form a syncytium (the gap junction etc. are also included, for simplicity), form a monoepithelium, form a polyepithelium and form a segmented body. Some somatic cells can do some of those 5 things, but only an embryo can do all 5 things. That's why somatic cells are never full human beings and and embryo is.So, to conclude his reasonning he says that the human being comes into existence from the very moment of the fusion of the sperm cell with the egg, at the moment of the calcium explosion, because all genes that make up a human being are present in the cell and because the resulting cell has the ability to grow up to become a full grown human being. (or as he calls it: reach the higher levels of compartimentalisation)I hope I have been able to give an explanation about when life begins. It should be noted that this is just the result of a reasonning by my professor and that it is in no way proven right and should not be seen as a scientific proven fact, but I think the explanation is quite detailed and I believe that it is a good answer to the question when life begins.PS.

This is an excellent example of circular reasoning:1. Identify a set of characteristics that are unique to an embryo2. Declare that that full set of characteristics is required to be a human being3. Observe the "obvious", namely that as no other cell shows all these characteristics, they cannot be human4. Form the conclusion that a human life starts with the embryoIt is meaningless and only stands if you get unanimous agreement that your arbitary characteristics are a valid indicator of a new human. You will only get that from those that already agree that life starts at conception and so you simply preach to the converted.

I have to say that I disagree with you on this one.Perhaps I explained it in a wrong way, but once again, English is my third language so I don't always find the correct words.I indeed identified certain characteristics that differed an embryo (or more correct, a zygote = fertilised egg cell) from other somatic cells and explained why somatic cells can never grow to a full human being on their own. But that's the only thing I did in that paragraph.

Ah, I see, but I believe something can be fully human biologically and yet not a "being" as in person.

If an embryo becomes a "full new human being" it follows that at some point it is not yet a human being. Is an egg a chicken?

I have to say that I disagree with you on this one.Perhaps I explained it in a wrong way, but once again, English is my third language so I don't always find the correct words.I indeed identified certain characteristics that differed an embryo (or more correct, a zygote = fertilised egg cell) from other somatic cells and explained why somatic cells can never grow to a full human being on their own. But that's the only thing I did in that paragraph.

Ok. I'll accept that.The term embryo covers the zygote stage, so I won't worry too much about whether you use embryo or zygote. However you are still not fully making sense. The cells of the embryo remain able to produce all the cells of the body for days after fertilization. This feature is an area of contraversial reaserach at the moment called embryonic stem-cell research. So do you regard every one of those early embyonic cells as a unique person? If not, why not as each can "grow" into a full person. There is nothing different in this regard between the fertilized egg and each of the mass of cells making up the embryo a week later. It also has the capability to "grow to a full human being" though: the capability is simply suppressed. This is a good thing as it stops a skin cell suddenly deciding that it would be fun to start dividing and producing a mass of heart muscle for example. Ever heard of teratomas? The idea of a a tumour growing in an ovary that contains hair, teeth, nervous system, blood vessels etc put most people off their dinner, but if skin cells didn't have their capability to form all the cells of the body, then such gross tumours would be a far more visible sight.This is disingenuous. The moment the sperm touches the egg cell membrane, the "calcium explosion" is triggered and it prevents further sperm making contact. It does not signal the formation of a diploid cell though. That takes a further 20+ hours to occur. As I have repeatedly stated in this thread: THERE IS NO MOMENT OF CONCEPTION. It is a long process. Also what the hell does "...the first time communicates on a high level with it's environment..." mean? Sounds like mystical XXXX to me.Leaving aside the fact that it isn't the only cell with those capabilities, the formation of the embryo is one of the milestones that can be used to arbitarily declare a new life has begun. It is purely arbitary though.

At what point does the cluster of cells become a valuable, authentic life form? No one knows. I would say that the best possible route would be to determine life or "person" begins at the point when the fetus can survive outside the womb, with or without medical assistance. Currently this seems to be about the beginning of the third Trimester. Abortion laws should affect the third trimester as the fetus has a fair chance at survival outside of the womb. This is the point when the reproductive rights of the mother are outweighed by that of the rights of the fetus. The laws should be flexible and advance along with the advances in medical science. Maybe one day we will be able to save the fetus from conception, and outlaw all abortion, and all starve to death from food shortages.

Fine! The moment of conception takes longer than a microsecond, so call it what you want, but it is still a definite period of time, although it takes longer than a microsecond or a nanosecond, but the fact remains that before it there was no human being and now there is. The problem with trying to evade determining when a new human life has begun is that you can then say that when condom is used in a sexual act and then discarded a crime has been committed, murder perhaps? Or when a woman menstruates she is killing an unfertilized egg, and isn’t that murder as well?

No, a fertilized egg is not a "human being"- although it has the potential to become one. It takes sometime until the foetus has developed enough and grown large enough to stand any chance of survival outside of the womb (this is assuming the best medical treatment is available)- the notion of viability that The Stone refered to in their last post.As usual the choice of terms like "human being" in this context doesn't help as you are muddying the waters with black and white definitions where there are actually shades of grey. I mean, a car manufactuer does not refer to the chassis of an unassembled vehicle as being a complete car do they?

The "potential" to "become" a "human being". This idea that one is a human only if they are large enough or developed enough promotes bigotry and is flat out wrong. The moment of conception is when the genetic material of the sperm and the genetic material of the egg fuse. This is definitely a "moment" in time.

Actually, a person is a very complex biochemical/biomechanical machine, from a certain viewpoint ;)But you fail to read my analogy correctly: an embryo lacks everything it needs to become a person: it has the 23 pairs of chromosomes- the most fundemental components a new life requires, but alone these will fail 100% of the time to develop into a person- it takes time, environment and resources from the mother to do this. Hence the chassis of the car- it is what the vehicle is built on but it requires a factory and the other components to become whole.

Your principle of viablity rooted in the notion that one's humanity is slowly acquired is extremely prejudice. Why? This developmental view (existing only to justify taking a human life) deems humans to be "inferior" on the basis that they are small and not fully developed. Blacks were once deemed partially human because they were viewed by evolutionary science to be "not fully developed". The eugenics movement viewed the Jews to be inhuman, and also viewed the handicapped to be "life unworthy of life". Do you see my point?

I don't think your analogy works. A chassis of a car does not have everything required to be a car. An embryo, however, does. If we use the definition of a human (one belonging to the species homo sapien) then the embryo qualifies and thus is a human (or person).

If you had an embryo sitting on the table, it would not grow into a human, if the embryo is in a starving woman then it still might not grow into a human.Of course the term species does not apply in either of the usual cases to an embryo - it can not breed with what is clearly recognised as a human nor is morphologically similar. But the term isn't a black and white thing, just a vague label to make refering to groups of things easier - there is no strict definition of species that fits what you think it should.Chloe - surely that is the most dubious of slippery slopes, not only did the examples you mention have no real grounding in science and have are considered outdated today, but the case is very different. Exactly how can you draw a parallel between recongising that a developing embryo is not the same as an adult human and discriminating based of a proven false belief? Its no different from saying since you want to consider an early embryo like a fully grown human, bacteria should have the same protections as other animals, which should really be treated like humans too - less we decide that hispanics are also subhuman.

According the strict defintion of a species it has to be able to breed, no exceptions (wihtout bringing the morphological species concept into this). Its just generally assumed that immature offspring and dead ancestors also count, even though if you do this it renders the whole concept of species irrelevant.A car needs a certain envirnoment to change from metal or raw ore, into a car. It clearly isn't a car at every step of the way.

No, capable of interbreeding. Otherwise a 1 day old baby wouldn't be in the human species. You are getting caught up with minut details that aren't relevant. Everyone would say a 1 day old baby is a human and part of the human species. The unborn qualifies as well.but metal and raw ore are not a car, it doesn't have any of the parts to be a car.

The minute details are the defintion, in the real world outside of dictionarys, things that appear to be humans is perfectly good a way to define humans - its just that for a lot of people, they think that 'human' doesn't mean anything else (unlike person) that its just a technical term and in everyday use that embryos do not come under the definition.

You define species as a group of organisms that are capable of reproduction among themselves. This just to to define species and not the individual organism.

The requiring food thing is more to show that the car isn't that bad an analogy, particularly not for the reasons you say. We could alter it slightly to make it fit better - a robot programmed to assemble other robotic arms like itse. Exactly which components are required to make the second robot arm - just the programming in the first, or the full set of components before being assembled.If you include your 90 year old man, and his parents as it is common sense to do then there is no reason not to include parents up to the first slime that crawled out of the primordial soup. Species is a really a meaningless term that is just there to make naming sets of things a little easier, it has a very narrow range in what it can actually be applied to. We just have to use common sense in less obvious cases, hence this whole debate. If you can breed with a set of things then you are the same species as them - if you can't, for whatever the reason, then you are not. Species is not the word you are looking for, if there really is a word rather than just a group of things you think are alike.Because of this, surely its far worse to try to legislate abortion based of a word which really doesn't actually mean what you think it does than to try to find another reason why abortion should or should not be allowed.That the baby is human is a bad reason, especially if you accept euthanaisia, captial punishment, war or even killing in self defense to a degree.

It is worth noting that one supporting abortion based upon the personhood distnction is not simply recognizing that a developing embryo is not exactly the same as an adult human (that is in its size, stage of development, etc.), they are saying the developing embryo is not a human at all, and therefore we are justified in ending it's existence.This is exactly the same as recognizing that a person who is black is not exactly the same as a person who is white (one is white and one is black), but then deciding that because one is black, they are not a human.

I draw parallels because this view descriminates against the embryo (unto death) on the basis of it being smaller than others and because it lives somewhere else. This view supports killing the embryo because has not developed into an elitist arbitrarily set criteria of humanity - set in place only to justify abortions.

Ah but within the general spread of the population a person who is black is pretty much the same as someone who is white, there is a much greater range of diversity between blacks and blacks than blacks and whites. 'Elitist arbitary set criteria of humanity'? Not only do you in the next paragraph tell me animals don't count but 'humanity', 'species' and 'human' are completely arbitary defintions, they just don't exist in the real world. Anyway - I fail to see how embryo descrimination could actually lead to discrimination against someone else, its a completely different issue. Its an insane level of slippery slope argument. No different than saying by protecting the lives of some animals over others it will lead to cats being given the vote. Go on then, since you brought up the statement that the dillusion that an embryo is not a human being is a proven false belief, care to prove it wrong.

Supporters of abortion do not say that the foetus is not a human foetus, what they are saying is that at an early stage of development it may be aborted and the earliest is the less traumatic. For instance inducing abortion or preventing conception with chemical means using “the day after pill” is not the same as ending a 3 months pregnancy.I do not see the parallel between abortion and racism.

It is worth noting that one supporting abortion based upon the personhood distnction is not simply recognizing that a developing embryo is not exactly the same as an adult human (that is in its size, stage of development, etc.), they are saying the developing embryo is not a human at all, and therefore we are justified in ending it's existence.This is exactly the same as recognizing that a person who is black is not exactly the same as a person who is white (one is white and one is black), but then deciding that because one is black, they are not a human.

Would it be safe to say you do not know what a person(human) is?
attacks
Pretty much. There's a reason that good arguments in support of abortion don't trade on whether a fetus is a person or not, as personhood is immaterial to whether we should kill something or not.

Steeeeve, are Iraqis persons?Are Muslims persons?A lot of radical ringwing wingnut religionists don't seem to think so.

I disagree. If the fetus is considered a person under the law, then it's right to life is guaranteed by the fourteenth amandment. That's what justice Blackman said in Roe v. Wade. Of course if we look to the 14th Amendment we see that it says that no one can be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. Now, you seem to believe that a simple law outlining what abortion procedures are acceptable would be considered "due process of law." But, this is not the case. Due process of law, when speaking of removing life from a person, includes a trial by jury. A person must be convicted in a court of law by a jury of his peers before he can be deprived of life. It would not be enough to simply say that a law exists outlining what circumstances would allow us to remove his life.The point is that at one point in history, black people were considered non-persons because they were black. This "fact" was based upon the scientific data "proving" that a person who was black had not (actually could not) reach the point of development where they could be considered a person.The same discriminating factors are in use here to say the embryo is not a person. This "fact" is based upon scientifc data supposedly showing that the embryo is not developed enough to be a person. Descrimination based upon stage of development is nothing shy of prejudice.Why can it be aborted?Why not?They are similar because both arguments are based upon the same descriminating criteria: stage of development.

Ah but within the general spread of the population a person who is black is pretty much the same as someone who is white, there is a much greater range of diversity between blacks and blacks than blacks and whites. 'Elitist arbitary set criteria of humanity'? Not only do you in the next paragraph tell me animals don't count but 'humanity', 'species' and 'human' are completely arbitary defintions, they just don't exist in the real world. Anyway - I fail to see how embryo descrimination could actually lead to discrimination against someone else, its a completely different issue. Its an insane level of slippery slope argument. No different than saying by protecting the lives of some animals over others it will lead to cats being given the vote. Go on then, since you brought up the statement that the dillusion that an embryo is not a human being is a proven false belief, care to prove it wrong. Bear in mind that I know that we would expect it to be human, but strictly speaking it can't yet be classified as any kind of species yet

Then what is a person? Are you now saying there is a set definition for what a person is?

Steeeeve: No, it would not.

Are they right? Can you say they are wrong? Do you know what a person is? If so, what is a person? If we can't define it then why do we feel people have the right to "their own body" when we can't even tell what a person is?

This conservsation has shown that at BEST the pro-choicers can say they do not know how to define a human or person at the beginning (and probably end). However, if it matters (which is should), wouldn't one think that it is best to be on the safe side and assume it is a human because there is some evidence to show this? Afterall, people have been wrong before (recall slavery) and is that really worth being wrong about again? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person This is a good link by the way

Steeeeve: I'm sorry, I thought it was clear from Post #190 what my thoughts were with regard to the bestowal of personhood.But since it wasn't, here's the post again with key words bolded:So where such identities exist, they exist as the result of a political agreement. Personhood, and the legal status of a 'person', is created or legislated by the body politic, much like the Presidency, and the legal status of a 'senator' or a 'minor'.

All I know is that in the US, good arguments in support of abortion DO hinge on whether the fetus is a person or not. Consider the following:

From your link:"Another problem with the simple view is that there are disputes over whether certain humans are persons. For example, in the abortion controversy, although the fetus is clearly of the human species, it is a matter of debate whether it is a person. Or in the case of a victim of severe brain damage who has no mental activity, some may claim that he or she is no longer a person, or that the person has ceased to exist, leaving only an "empty shell."By some accounts, a person is one who, through his or her choices and decisions, has built a personal identity, which is active in further choices. A fetus has not yet had that opportunity (although the same could be said about a newborn child), and a severely brain-damaged person may no longer have the ability to act through further choices"For those who think there is no debate or that a fetus is proven to be a person.

But the scientific method of then was very different from what it is now, do you think there is a problem with the current version and that there is a threat to people (other than the embryos) based on it? I can't really see how the view of things that do not count as people can really spread from looking at the developmental stage of a fetus. The closest you can get is euthanasia for coma patients - but in this case you have a request by a family member to keep them alive. Still if the choice came down to someone in a long term coma and someone who was still concious and needed the life support machine to live I don't think I would hesitate over the choice between the two.

You extend the term human to include ancestors and children that have bred in the past and could do in the future - I just go back several thousand generations using the same logic and you have to include monkeys as human.There is a mass of evidence that would suggest that you could draw an unbroken line of ancestors, each able to breed with the previous generation given the chance, from modern humans to the common ancestor of monkeys/squids/plants. At no point without considering the adult form of a modern human would you be able to say when a new species from several generations ago has appeared (except for some plants).

1) where is your evidence to prove this 2) How is that relevant to today? Assuming you are correct, we have evolved away and we are a different species then a monkey now and thus they wouldn't be persons, now would they?

Hopefully by 1) you are not questioning evolution, if so then you really can't start using the word species at all as its a scientific term and you arn't using science, besides we have an entire forum for this. That aside as soon as you start including people who have had children and now can not then there is no reason not to include their parents etc back to somekind of slime.This is the flaw in the biological species concept, there is no way around it but it serves its purpose for what it is used for in science - generally trying to group organisms into vague groups that appear to be similar. The exact point where the apparent changes occur are considered irrelevant because its outside the scale of what it is normally used for - using species for when a 'human being' comes into being is the same as using classical physics to predict exactly where an electron on certain atom within a rock fired by a catapult is. We have no problem predicting the general area where the atom will probably be (over the past few generations for our human) but specifically where the electron (or human being) appears is impossible using that system. The term is just not relevant at the scale you are looking at here, trying to work out where the human appears out of gametes, zygotes and parents is like cutting up the Mona Lisa in such a way that each piece is at least 28% pure art.

So the methods used now are absolutely fool-proof and infallible?

The dutch policy you have heard of allows for the euthanising of babies with horrific deformaties that are 100% fatal - lacking any digestive system, or functioning lungs, or in some sample cases a body that lacked a brain. Essentially where a corpse has just been maintained off the mothers body. Babies are not randomly killed for no reason whatsoever. There is no way this can be applied to an adult human, or even a child that has not only just been born.I don't think the scientific method can be improved, it was the same as it was then as well, just ignored most of the time to make a political point.

But your version of bigotry and predjudice suddenly looses the same kind of meaning as anti semetic or anti black violence when compared to a newborn who lacks a heart.

check this outThis is nothing more then death by a comittee. A group of brainwashed "doctors", who do not value the dignity of human life but instead place value on the quality of human life, decide for another individual (without their consent) whether their life is worth living. These physicians have been brainwashed to embrace a "quality of life ethic" much like the Nazi doctors were brainwashed to embrace a "quality of the volk ethic". Both are alike in the sense that they have broken their oath of "do no harm". Instead of being healers they have become killers. One can only imagine the damage which will be done to the patient-physician relationship in this society. How can you trust a doctor who may think your life is not worth living? You better watch out cause they may pull the plug when you are not looking - that is if they even let you make it that far. It also allows for euthanizing those who have deformaties which are not 100% fatal as shown above.

It is very different to abort a fertilized egg than to kill a foetus late in the pregnancy. In the first case a human being is mostly potential in the latter it is almost fully realized.Also to equate racism with abortion of a foetus is absurd. A black person is not a white person in progress; and no pro-choicer is proposing the killing of Blacks.

You say the embryo is only a potential human. What criteria establishes this? How does it change from a non-human to a human? Does every embryo make this change at exactly the same point in time as to justify your blanket generalization that a fetus is more of a human than not by the second trimester?No, I'm not equating racism with abortion, I'm equating murder with murder and bigotry with bigotry. The discrimination against blacks in the 1700's and the discrimination against small human beings today are both based upon stage of development. In the 1700s this discrimination led to the enslaving and murder of countless numbers of human beings, and today this discrimination has led to the murder of countless numbers of human beings. They have advocated such examples as I cited in the Netherlands case. The logical conclusion of the pro-choice stance from the personhood argument is bigotry and prejudice, and ultimately leads to the point that born infants, children, and adults can justly be euthanized against their will and without their consent.

Just like the logical conclusion of the pro-life stance is that nothing can be killed ever.Taking either side to extremes will just lead to nonsense positions, anyway your 'stage of development' theory is wrong. They are talking about different things, the old racist position held that they were evoltionaryly not as advanced as whites which has been since prooved wrong. Using the knowledge they had at the time it would have still been proved wrong if it weren't that it was science done backwards - used to justify an existing point of view without any real study done whatsoever. I don't think you would find anyone who would argue that an embryo is not very much less developed than an adult human. There is no predjudice because they are small, nor is the pro-choice position trying to claim they are not human - its because they not wanted and don't have the organs or parts to approach anywhere near what the law and common sense recognises as being a person in everyday life. Its the pro-life side that are saying that they are human and therefore special and deserving of all (or most) the rights and privaliges that an adult one should have. However being human is not enough as there is no definition of what human is.

Oh, I do see a difference between a week old fetus and a new born baby. But, the only difference I perceive is that the one week old fetus is smaller, lives in a different location, and is less developed. Because I am not a bigot, I do not say that these differences warrant a death sentence.Now, are you on these boards to engage in discussion, or are you here to be argumentitive by ignoring hard questions?

Now now Cone lets not resort to your time honored tactic of putting words into my mouth. Read my posts carefully, I said that polls show that the public wants to keep Roe vs. Wade. I just saw on CNN today that figure of 68%, because as you know Bush is going to nominate the replacement for Sandra Day O'Conner today I believe at 9pm eastern time. and the subject of abortion came up.You can take it any way you want but the the polls did not mention anything about abortion on demand or anything like that. Surely common sense should tell you that ! Yes I do agree with you that many people feel there should be more restrictions on partial birth abortions and the like , but that is a separate issue. So focus.. the debate is about whether abortion should be legal or illegal. By the way I have never met any pro-choice person who was in favor of abortion .

When discussing an issue on a forum such as this, I think it is very important to be as clear as possible. I did not think your post was clear enough. So, I clarified it. Saying that 70% of americans support keeping abortion legal is not the same thing as saying 70% of americans support keeping some abortions legal. I hope you see my point.The debate is not just about whether abortion should be legal or not. It is about what abortions should be legal, etc. It is not enough to simply make a generalization that because person A thinks abortion should be legal in B circumstance, and person C thinks abortion should be legal in D circumstance, that both person A and C support abortion. That is not clear enough. We need to know what circumstances A and C support abortion. This gives us the best possible understanding of the issue.

Why do pro-choicers believe it should be restricted as you say they do?
attacks
Most pro-choicers don't beleive in complete unrestricted abortion no matter what, but given the choice between 'abortions on demand' and no abortions at all it seems the majority would chose the former.Its not their first choice, but given the alternative choice offered here its the lesser of two evils.

Because pro-choice covers everything from allowing unrestricted abortion, to abortion up to the stage where it can survive outside the womb, to up to when the brain is properly developed and functioning.Its a very wide selection of beleifs, and there are various reasons for each point (though I can only really give them for the latter, which I personally beleive, once it can think and feel and be aware of pain then you shouldn't do something that will cause this)

Maybe you should look at more specifically targeted questions.http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htmOnly 25% favored unrestricted abortions.

I know nothing about Margaret Sanger and I am not a member of any pro-choice advocacy group....so your logic is insane to put it mildly. As I said 68% of the people want to keep abortion legal in the US....are you saying that two thirds of the people in the US are bigots and murderers ? Come on ....think carefully before you go aroung throwing accusations wildly.And I find your attitude towards women lifes callous and insenstive to say the least if abortion were made illegal .You don't seem to even show 1% of the concern for women that you show for yes .... a clump of cells.

I was demonstrating that the pro=choice movement started in the US, not as a women's right issue, but as a means to keep the population of "undesirables" down through eugenics. Yes, Sanger and her ilk were embraced by Nazis, but that wasn't my point.There was nothing altruistic in the movement's most prominant symbol, Planned Parenthood. Today, PP is being sued by the government for failing to comply with child molestation/rape laws. That's pretty ignomanious IMO.I was attempting to use the pro-choice position that as a man, your opinion doesn't count. I wish there was an emoticon for irony. :)

Wow ! I thought the debate was on "abortion" period, end of story. I was not even aware that there was something called "US" abortions. Are you trying to restrict a person's freedom of expression by saying that only US participants can debate this issue ? Why is there a difference between abortions in the US and in other countries ? Please enlighten us...maybe I missed something.

we are talking severely mentally retarded as in a coma, then yes. Not saying you would have to but if there was no one who would ask for him to be kept alive then I would have no problem with him not being kept alive. I don't want to kill all babies, or all coma patients - I just think that when it comes down to a choice they lose to a concious individual. But here its the same as in the abortion case, I don't think we should go aborting wanted babies, nor should people have their family members killed off because they have fallen into a coma.It is discinimation, just a fairly mild and pointless kind - its discrinimation not to prosecute those who kill rabbits with a car like we would for a human, or not get involved in the investigation of a murder of someone who lives in another country.If it doesn't have a mind, I don't really care what happens to it. In the case of wanted developing embryos its not the embryos life I recognise as being the reason it should be protected but the mother's wish to have a child. Protecting mindless stuff seems absurd to me, its like campaigning to have retirement homes accept old cars. Unwanted potential is not something I think you can legislate around - eventually it would become a 'real person' but it isn't now and whilst preventing it might not always be the option you would choose its not something you can punish. Otherwise people who could have become docters and saved lives but took up art instead are in trouble as well.

I have to agree with you on this one. The vast majority of people fall into the moderate middle (both pro-life and pro-choice) but it is the extremists who get the headlines. Why is it that the moderate middle (pro-life & pro-choice) cannot come together and do something to reduce the number of abortions taking place. Can we (both pro-life & pro-choice ) at least not agree on that. Why don't the pro-life & pro-choice groups spend their considerable cash on reducing the number of abortions instead of fighting battles.

I don't think your analogy works. A chassis of a car does not have everything required to be a car. An embryo, however, does. If we use the definition of a human (one belonging to the species homo sapien) then the embryo qualifies and thus is a human (or person).

Your principle of viablity rooted in the notion that one's humanity is slowly acquired is extremely prejudice. Why? This developmental view (existing only to justify taking a human life) deems humans to be "inferior" on the basis that they are small and not fully developed. Blacks were once deemed partially human because they were viewed by evolutionary science to be "not fully developed". The eugenics movement viewed the Jews to be inhuman, and also viewed the handicapped to be "life unworthy of life". Do you see my point?

Few people are probably going to get an abortion out of hand, most will be due to being unable to support a child properly - and from their point of view seeing as the embryo has never experienced anything, nor will its not so much of a conflict if it is aborted to give a child a better life in the future.[edit] Monica?

Backwoods abortions is nobody's choice. When abortion was illegal in the US, backwoods abortions did take place because women had no choice but to go to quacks and butchers.We don't live in a perfect world, women will abort no matter whether abortion is legal or illegal. So the question is whether to keep it safe and legal or illegal and unsafe.And you sir, are in no position to sit on judgement on women who abort because you will not be the one responsible for the child's welfare if born. ....So unless you are willing to take responsiblilty for all the children that are born unwanted because you will only permit abortion when the mother's life is at stake, I suggest you keep your morals to yourself.

Well, this law was passed some 8 or 9 years ago because some feminist organisations went to court or something like that and demanded the same rights as men .... but just because it is permitted by law does not mean women are doing it. I am only speaking of the norm , of course there are exceptions.As you noticed about the beaches by Summerville, what is permitted by law and what people do are two different things.Though I must say this law might come in handy if one gets caught for speeding by the cops..."excuse me officer , while I exercise my legal right to ..."

Well, this law was passed some 8 or 9 years ago because some feminist organisations went to court or something like that and demanded the same rights as men .... but just because it is permitted by law does not mean women are doing it. I am only speaking of the norm , of course there are exceptions.As you noticed about the beaches by Summerville, what is permitted by law and what people do are two different things.Though I must say this law might come in handy if one gets caught for speeding by the cops..."excuse me officer , while I exercise my legal right to ..."

Backwoods abortions is nobody's choice. When abortion was illegal in the US, backwoods abortions did take place because women had no choice but to go to quacks and butchers.We don't live in a perfect world, women will abort no matter whether abortion is legal or illegal. So the question is whether to keep it safe and legal or illegal and unsafe.And you sir, are in no position to sit on judgement on women who abort because you will not be the one responsible for the child's welfare if born. ....So unless you are willing to take responsiblilty for all the children that are born unwanted because you will only permit abortion when the mother's life is at stake, I suggest you keep your morals to yourself.

Well, did making incest illegal result in women's lifes being put in jeopardy ?Because making abortion illegal sure will !

That seems to be the biggest question in the debate over abortion. The answer is not a single day but rather it is each persons opinion. The pro-life people say that a fetus is a human when the sperm fuses with the egg. The extreme pro-choice people say that it is a fetus until birth. I disagree with both.When a fetus is a one celled organism then it is in no way a human. The supporters of the idea that is it human say that it has the DNA that makes us human. They are right, but so does the skin you shed all the time. So does all the blood you have ever lost. All those cells have the blueprint that makes us human. So it is not DNA that makes us, us.So what makes a human? DNA gives a blueprint but it certainly does not decide when the blueprint has been completed enough to call it human. The answer must be in the make up of the fetus. Organs, a nervious system, a brain, all these are the things that make us human. Those things are not developed until 7-10 weeks after conception though (depending on your source). Many like to show proof that they start to develope earlier but again, unless something is completed and is operating then it cannot be regarded as developed. Based on that information I would have to say that abortion should be legal until 7-10 weeks after conception. Once that time period has passed and the fetus has a functional nervious system and brain then abortion should only be reserved for the rare cases that the mothers life is in danger. That solution seems to be the closest that both sides can get to agreeing though many from both sides reject it because they are to hardheaded to budge. I would like to hear from anyone that has any thoughts on the subject though. What do you think?

A woman's life is also put in jeopardy when they have a Legal abortion.

Legally speaking, generally not. Hence the difference between miscarriage (which I gather you are painfully familiar with) and stillbirth.Your dismissive tone aside, you do not understand viability. Viability says at XX weeks a foetus/child has a chance of survival if it born at that point (assuming advanced medical care is available). Before this time the medical opinion is the foetus has a negilgable chance of surviving if born (through any method) and has very little chance of surviving regardless of what medical treatment can be offered.For example in UK law viability is at 24 weeks- it is at this time of a pregnancy that elective abortion is considered illegal.

Now you're just making a bigger fool of yourself. If you'd have bothered to read the link that I provided, Conklin stated that age could only account for ~20% of the reduction in crime and this included the effects of legalized abortion. Looking at legalized abortion as a factor by itself had little significance.here's some more fodder to demonstrate your plunge into absurdity. emoticonXRolleyes [quote]Crime StatisticsThe crime rate in the United States was lower in the 30s, 40s, and 50s, when abortion was illegal. Crime then started increasing prior to the legalization of abortion, and the minor decrease we have seen recently is a small drop when compared to the initial increase. If abortion prevents crime by reducing the number of potential criminals, as the study suggests, then why was the crime rate lower for many years prior to the legalization of abortion?In addition, statistics show that much of the drop in crime isn't within the "post-Roe" age range. For instance, according to FBI statistics, the murder rate for 14 to 17-year-olds in 1997 was 94 percent higher than it was for 14 to 17-year-olds in 1984. Yet, during that same time period, the murder rate for 25 to 34-year-olds (those born prior to Roe) has dropped 27 percent. (source: http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/homicide/oage.txt)The murder rate for 14 to 17-year-olds during 1993 (born post-Roe between 1975 and 1979) was 3.6 times that of the children who were 14 to 17 years old in 1984 (born pre-Roe 1966 to 1970). In contrast, over the same time span the murder rate for those 25 and over (all born prior to Roe) dropped 6 percent.

Interesting comments... so even though the fact the doctor performed the abortion probably saved the life of the woman because otherwise she would have been forced to go to a quack or a butcher like many did when abortion was illegal in the US.This is really unbelievable you consider Doctors murderers ?

Help me out. I have a really hard time understanding the notion of not making laws because they are going to be broken anyway. "Let's keep abortion legal because otherwise people will get abortions illegally." No mention of whether the procedure is worth banning based on its own merits. It's simply, "well it's going to be done, and in a dangerous way, so we had better keep it legal." I'm stuck in the thinking that if something is worth banning, then it shouldn't matter if people are going to follow the law or not. It it's worth banning, ban it. If not, leave it alone. But don't let behavior dictate what laws you won't make.

Abortion doctors are murderers, just like the Nazi doctors were murderers. No real doctor would trample over their hippocratic oath - DO NO HARM. Abortion is murder unless the life of the mother is at stake due to complications in the pregnancy.I think it is unbelievable you consider murderers doctors.

In reference to the question of whether doctors are murderers or not:It's pretty straightforward. If a fetus is a human being with "personhood" (forget about when that magic transformation takes place for a moment) then anyone who kills the fetus is a murderer, whether it's a doctor, backwoods/backalley surgeon, mother, father, whatever. If we're working with a human being minus the personhood, well, I guess doc is in the clear for now.

Since a Doctor performing an abortion is not harming the mother therefore he is not violating his oath. Remember the foetus has no legal protection, in the eyes of the Doctor a foetus is an ‘it’ not a he or a she.Even a Doctor assisting a person to die with dignity is not violating his/her oath as he/she is only obeying the patient’s wishes. Granting a terminal patient a dignified death is not harmful on the contrary the doctor is helping the patient who otherwise would die in a prolonged agony.

The only difference in "person" and "human" is the spelling. Trying to make a distinction between the two words is just trying to justify something with technicalities. Long before the abortion debate one could easily use human and person interchangably. In fact, they are still considered synomyns in your local thesaurus.

Steeeeve:If you're in the camp that says humans and persons are the same, then abortion is murder. If you're in the camp that draws an arbitrary distinction between humans and human persons, then there's an argument (however subjective it may be) for keeping abortion legal.

They will admit that it is human, yet deny that it has personhood. The true question to be answered is WHEN we have a viable human being. Once we do, all the other peripheral issues that people always focus on (right to privacy, living conditions, rape/incest,) are pretty much irrelevant.I personally believe it is preposterous and hideously irresponsible that abortions are permitted before we know for sure when human life becomes "viable."

chloe, I'm not sure if you mean that you think the subjective notion of "viability" is pretty much ridiculous. If that's what you mean then I think I would have to agree. Where do we get off drawing an arbitrary line somewhere in the life of a human being, and then declaring that everything before the line=human without personhood, and everything after the line=human with personhood. Not only do we subjectively come up with this line, but we also subjectively create this notion of "personhood"! To make matters worse, different people draw the line at different places! It almost sounds like a joke as I write this, but the sad bottom line is that best case scenario, we're playing roulette with human lives. Worst case scenario we've got a lot of human "person" blood on our hands.

Does the oath extend to killing an “it”?They are doing good by assisting people to die with dignity, they are not harming anybody. How can you harm a person who is a terminal patient?
attacks

There seems to be some confusion over the senses of the term 'harm'. Maybe people should talk about what they mean when they say 'harm'. If by 'harm' you mean something like causing physical damage, then doctors do that all the time in order to heal people and prevent harm. Alternatively if by 'harm' you mean something like choosing the worst live option available, then I think that the confusion lies with what people regard as harm. If one person believes that performing an abortion procedure is harmful in the second sense because killing a fetus is worse than letting it live and requiring a woman to bring it to term, and another person believes that performing an abortion procedure is better than preserving the fetus and requiring a woman to bring it to term, then you can imagine why such a such a line of discussion is question begging.If you can't imagine why this is so, then I'll explain: Such a line of discussion is question begging because arguing that abortion is either right or wrong depending on whether it causes harm presumes that the issue of what constitutes harm has been decided when it is the same issue as abortion. It's rather like saying "Such-and-such is bad because such-and-such is wrong." Logically valid, a tautology in fact, and unfortunately question-begging as such.

Steadfast:Unfortunately I don't mean that a child's right to life is limited by its mother's right to life, but that all the rights we accord a child are limited by the rights of all other citizens, including its mother. Certainly I want to preserve that child's right to life where possible, and it would be nice if we could remove it from the mother's body as easily as we can remove it from her care after birth. Until that day however, where push comes to shove and the child's right to life is incidentally violated protecting the woman's right to choice, I will protect her choices about the disposal of her body (much like I oppose slavery, involuntary organ harvesting, murder, assault, and so on). In the meantime I'm going to fight for women to have easy access to chemical birth control, condoms, surgical birth control, and the morning after pill, and work to make women aware of alternatives to abortion.

I guess for me, push has come to shove, and a child's right to life is being infringed upon by the mother's right to privacy in almost all abortion cases. At least until it is proven that a fetus is not a viable human being. I feel I am obligated to assume all human beings produced from other human beings are worthy of protection, regardless of developmental stages. It seems the burden of proof lies with those making a distinction between types of humans to supply the evidence that there is an indisputable distinction. Upon encountering such proof, I would have to reevaluate my position.

Certainly I want to preserve that child's right to life where possible, and it would be nice if we could remove it from the mother's body as easily as we can remove it from her care after birth. Until that day however, where push comes to shove and the child's right to life is incidentally violated protecting the woman's right to choice, I will protect her choices about the disposal of her body (much like I oppose slavery, involuntary organ harvesting, murder, assault, and so on). In the meantime I'm going to fight for women to have easy access to chemical birth control, condoms, surgical birth control, and the morning after pill, and work to make women aware of alternatives to abortion.

I don't think that the child's stage of development or status as a person really changes what is a case of conflict between persons and their rights. As I've tried to explain in other posts, arguments that turn on these things are inherently weak arguments. I agree that foeti are human beings, and that a child's right to life is infringed upon by the exercise of its mother rights - although I'd call it the 'right to choice' or 'right to personal autonomy'.The question to me is what entitles one person to the body of another, and with regard to abortion I find the infringement upon the right of life of the child is well justified by the exercise of the right to personal autonomy of the mother.As I would not enslave another person to save another's life, nor harvest their body for healthy organs in order to save another's life, so I would not demand that a woman support a foetus against her will.

I guess for me, push has come to shove, and a child's right to life is being infringed upon by the mother's right to privacy in almost all abortion cases. At least until it is proven that a fetus is not a viable human being. I feel I am obligated to assume all human beings produced from other human beings are worthy of protection, regardless of developmental stages. It seems the burden of proof lies with those making a distinction between types of humans to supply the evidence that there is an indisputable distinction. Upon encountering such proof, I would have to reevaluate my position.

Chloe:I suppose you're using 'murder' synonymously with 'killing', but like 'harm' such a declaration is question begging because it passes the buck and requires that we explain why murder is wrong.I'm sure that seems odd, but it strikes me that 'murder', killing someone, is permissable depending on the circumstance such as self-defence, execution, euthanasia, accident, or the prevention of more deaths.Steadfast:Actually, I would say that a child's rights end exactly where they infringe on its mother's rights, just like other legal or moral rights. In fact I'd say that any person's right to life is limited by other people's rights.Incidentally the personhood/human distinction exists specifically to address those instances where either humans are not persons, or persons are not humans. In the first case we have dead humans as the paradigm example of human non-persons. In the second case we have corporations as the paradigm example of non-human persons.

Yes, it depends what system of rights you use. If we are using some manner of socialist system of rights, where everyone has the right to live at the expense of everyone else, clearly the child has the right to live at the expense of the mother. If we use some classical liberal conception of rights, where each individual is held to have self-ownership and is not beholden to provide for others, clearly the child does not have the right to live at the expense of the mother.

Technically there are no special rights called "unborn baby rights" but the case might be made that a woman's human rights end where a foetus' human right begin. And as Symbiote points out whether this is the case depends on whose hierarchy of rights you buy into.I'd suggest that this is not the case in any rights-based system, as a system that valued the right to life over the right to self-ownership would be incoherent. Rights-based systems are based on concepts of agency and self-determination, and so these concepts and there values would necessarily form the foundational values of any such system.

Rights are merely one conceptual framework among many. Thus rights are not contingent upon life, just as life is not contingent upon rights. Saying that a right to life is necessary for a life to have rights is, unfortunately, instantiates the fallacy of affirming the consequent.

Correct, but one does not have to have a "right to life" to have free will.One can live without a "right to life", but it means they must either provide for themselves or have others voluntarily provide for them.If you take care of yourself instead of having others be forced to take care of you, a "right to life" in no way assists you in living.The advocates of a "right to life" do not apply it consistently, or appear to understand what it means outside the context of pregnancy.Africans have a right to life as much as fetuses do, and you are violating that right every time one of them dies of starvation.

Correct.This does not follow.If a right to life exists it exists as the only right, since the implications of it are so broad that no other rights are possible. For example, a right to personal autonomy, private property or freedom of association are impossible, when all ones actions must support the lives of everyone else."To each according to their need, from each according to their ability"vs "Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness"The latter does not depend on the former, they are incompatible.

There are no innate rights at all. For a right to exist by itself it has to be a God given and God guaranteed and protected right and no such things exist. There is no right to life, we kill other species on a daily basis and God does not intervene; we kill each other on a daily basis and God does not intervene. Rights are just some of the conditions that we consider necessary to live with dignity, without fear, that’s all.In the context of abortion: The foetus has rights if society gives it rights, the foetus is not conceived wit a "bill of foetus’s rights" in its hand. If society decides that abortion is legal and unrestricted, goodbye foetus and good bye foetus’s rights.Sad but true.

It prevents others from taking your life without grave consequences to them.How are we violating Africans' right to life by not taking any action against them? Or are you claiming that but not acting, we are actively depriving them of their rights? That's a real stretch. I'm not aware of any right that demands others to take an active part in securing it for an individual. The same can't be said of abortion. It takes an action on the doctor's part in order to violate the fetuses right to life.

Chloe:Certainly one does need to exist in order exercise free will, however...One does not need a right to life to continue existing, fortunately. Likewise one does not need to live in order to enjoy rights. But human life is not valuable in itself, and logically such schemes of intrinsic value are always incoherent. Value is necessarily relational in its form. Which is why freedom of will, socially recognized as a right to self-determination, is necessary for a life to have value because agency (having freedom of will) defines the relations of one person to another.Systems of rights are based on the principles of self-determination and the relations between agents, rather than the existence of those agents or any right to existence of those agents. As such a right to life is derivative.Hence the point that supposing a right to life is necessary to have other rights is the fallacy of assuming the consequent, because rights are not the things that they protect.

Chloe:No, one needs their actual life to be secured in order to continue existing. This may be secured on the grounds that there are the conditions for a right to life to take precedence, may also be secured on other grounds and in other ways such as the use of force and so on.As for my claim that systems of rights are necessarily based on the principles of self-determination and the relations between agents, rather than the existence of those agents or any right to existence of those agents, I refer you to the entry on legal rights in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, specifically section #2. The Conceptual Analysis of Legal RightsYour assertion that: "The right to life is most fundamental right, and any comparison of this right with another is unequal." is unfounded as you ignore the fact that rights are derived from systems of rights rather than the things that those rights supervene over. The right to life, as derivative of systems of rights whose foundations are necessarily principles of agency and self-determination, cannot be the foundational right of those systems as that place is taken by a right to self-determination. The security of a right to life is irrelevant to all rights that are not entails by it, and that includes most of them. One may have their right to life infringed upon yet not lose their rights to property, self-determination, freedom of conscience, and so on.

Osama Bin Laden, assuming he had a "right to life" to begin with, has presumably forfeited it, and yet still lives. Rights are moral entities, they are not magic powers that slay you should you not possess them, or protect you from harm. Most people do not have the US military, or any military force, after them, so I would give them an even better chance of living without a right to life than Bin Laden has.The right not-to-be-killed is not to be confused with the right to life. The right of self-ownership / personal autonomy is also inclusive of the right not to be killed. The right to life extends beyond this and demands that not only each person not be killed, but if they are to die, should be kept alive by others', against those other peoples' will.So you believe a mother is not required to actively provide nutrients to the fetus she is carrying in her womb, and if she ceases doing so, perhaps by refusing to eat, until her fetus dies, she is not at fault?It takes action, the cancelling of one's World Vision subscription to cease providing resources to starving Africans. Is someone who does so, if their previous recipient of resources subsequently dies, guilty of murder?So what do you mean exactly by a "right to life", merely a right not-to-be-killed, or a right to be provided with resources so long as they are required to maintain your life, or a right to have no one take any action which would shorten your life?

From this, the hierarchy of rights that is derived is one where the right to life is the cornerstone.Human life is valuable. If there were only one human being on the earth, the value would still be there.are you confusing freedom of will with a supposed right to freedom of will?Agency is derived from life.Systems of rights must first of all based upon the existance of the agent. My imaginary friend, Drop Dead Fred, cannot have rights because he does not exist. Furthermore, one does not need to have agency in order to have rights.I never assumed they were. Therefore, you have assumed a consequent.Becuase life is more fundamental than free will and is necessary for it to exist, the right to life must be and is logically more fundamental.

And abortion is allowed, however if the Right to life was held paramount, and this belief enforced this is a totally different thing.

Chloe:You still seem to be confused about the distinction between the right to life and life itself. They are not the same thing. Life is not required for rights to be respected, although it is required for the existence of free will. You're making a rather classic category mistake. In contrast I'm not confusing the possession of freedom of will with the right to self-determination. Conceptually they're similar, but deal with categorically distinct subjects, so I'm not sure what the problem is. Since systems of rights take as foundational the concept of agency and the right to self-determination, the fact that life is necessary for free will isn't a problem. Systems of rights are systems of social conventions rather than metaphysical facts, and confusing the two is the formal essence of the fallacy known as the category mistake. One is not required to be alive or embodied to have rights, as the personhood of corporations attests, and likewise as you correctly point out one does not need to have agency to have rights. There is no necessary connection between the social conventions of rights and the physical facts of being. Your claim to the contrary, that: "Becuase life is more fundamental than free will and is necessary for it to exist, the right to life must be and is logically more fundamental." is incorrect and ironically illogical in the extreme. Having pointed that out I think it's necessary to explain how the fallacy of assuming the consequent works.

not another "rights" debate....ughHere is what I gotta say to this one-> emoticonXBye
attacks
Chloe:You still seem to be confused about the distinction between the right to life and life itself. They are not the same thing. Life is not required for rights to be respected, although it is required for the existence of free will. You're making a rather classic category mistake. In contrast I'm not confusing the possession of freedom of will with the right to self-determination. Conceptually they're similar, but deal with categorically distinct subjects, so I'm not sure what the problem is. Since systems of rights take as foundational the concept of agency and the right to self-determination, the fact that life is necessary for free will isn't a problem. Systems of rights are systems of social conventions rather than metaphysical facts, and confusing the two is the formal essence of the fallacy known as the category mistake. One is not required to be alive or embodied to have rights, as the personhood of corporations attests, and likewise as you correctly point out one does not need to have agency to have rights. There is no necessary connection between the social conventions of rights and the physical facts of being. Your claim to the contrary, that: "Becuase life is more fundamental than free will and is necessary for it to exist, the right to life must be and is logically more fundamental." is incorrect and ironically illogical in the extreme. Having pointed that out I think it's necessary to explain how the fallacy of assuming the consequent works. Where B follows A, and we have B, the fallacy of assuming the consequent is inferring that we have A. A professor of mine once unkindly called it 'modus XXXXXX'. When you say things like:You're saying that a right to life is necessary to have other rights.

Still have property rights in the case of abortion - the fetus is laying claim to organs that aren't theirs. Unless they were welcomed in, i.e the mother wants a baby and therefore isn't considering abortion isn't this on the same level as a tramp sneaking in through an open window and being recognised as being co-owner of your house.Though I suppose there is the complication that the fetus will die without its borrowed organs - so lets say the tramp situation is taking place in Alaska in winter. In both cases a unwanted person is laying claim to property that is not theirs and will likely die if removed.

Actually, when the ambilical cord is attached, they share all pertinent organs.The same case can't be made for the wino tramp and your liver, for example. :) I could see the argument that throwing a tramp out in the cold in Alaska could be murder.

This is exactly what an intolerant person will say -most pro-lifers (I mean the majority not the tiny minority extremists who target abortion clinics) have a strong belief about the sanctity of life derived from religious beliefs. So a fertilized egg is a living organism and the sanctity of life is paramount which is why abortion is abhorrent to them . It has got nothing to do with controlling women but all to do with the sanctity of life (in this case the fetus).Only someone who is intolerant of other people's religious beliefs can come up with ridiculous ideas like that pro-lifers want to control women. One can be pro-choice without resorting to accusing pro-lifers of having ulterior motives like controlling women. When you live in a intensely secular country like Oztralia sometimes intolerance of religious beliefs is held as a virtue and no doubt you were unaware how intolerant you are .

I have come to the realization that pro-lifers are just a gang of zealots who want to keep women under their control.

I fail to see the cognitive difficulty that you speak of. A fertilized, implanted egg becomes a baby after 6-9 months. If you believe that, prior to its ability to survive outside of the womb, it's still human, then you take action to preserve its life.If you are intellectually dishonest and say that since we don't know precisely when it actually becomes human, it's OK to kill it at will, then you're in favor of abortion.The rest is just smoke and attempts by pro-abortion advocates to justify the unjustifiable. If left where it is, the fetus WILL become a human being capable of living outside of the womb. Yanking it out prematurely will prevent this. Period.

Why does it matter that its human, what specifically is it that makes it more special than dogs or amoebas or an enemy soldier? Why should something as undeveloped as a embryo have any rights over a adult human whatsoever? At least you added implantation which many do not, especially the few who are arguing from the point of view that its when the soul enters thats important.The issue is far more than as black and white as you say it is, if you have considered the other important questions and remain pro-life, then fine. But if you never got past - it will grow into a baby eventually, then you really don't understand the issue.

I guess if you admit that a lot of people are pro-life because of religion, then it plays out that many people will be be pro-choice because of lack of religion, which I guess atheism is then also a result of the LACK of a certain environment that they missed growing up in. I wouldn't go as far as you and say that lack of religion is a lack of brainwashing, almost a pure, unadulterated perfect state of being, where all thoughts are precise.. but this point does have some validity, I suspect. Still, this is a bit harsh and is perhaps a little overblown in it's own pompousness.

Not the philosophy aspect of religion, the ritual side of it - chanting, recitation in large groups are brainwashing techniques. The idea doesn't have to be to brainwash someone, if you just carry out the actions then it will take effect anyway - its why cults cause so many problems and often require the victims to be 'deprogrammed' afterwards.

Not solely though, just its not influencing your position other than to rule out religious reasons. However if you are Catholic then a pro-life position is pretty much part and parcel of the set of beliefs. Atheism on its own does not influence your position.double negatives aside, I think a lot of Atheists probably arrived at their position in reaction to a religious environment - not just because of upbringing.

When the faith based reasoning is used alone outside of a religious context it is often just incorrect or irrelevant.

Anybody who thinks religion plays no role in the abortion issue is deluding themselves. All religions preach the sanctity of life....Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, Islam in theory at least.

You are so right that religion and faith play a role in the abortion issue. The pro-choice movement is propelled by the religion of secular humanism (generally speaking although there might be some exceptions). Secular humanism preaches that there is no god, and even if there were one could not know it (an argument that is rooted in blind faith), and that everything came about by chance. Therefore it would follow that mankind is nothing more then an abnormal wart on the face of a chance universe who has no purpose or dignity whatsoever - everything is meaningless (I still have not figured out why these meaningless people post meaningless words on a meaningless internet forum). This religion and all the sects that branch off from it, has no basis to place any dignity in the human being whatsoever. And since in general people form their beliefs partly from religion, there is no question that religious beliefs is the driving force for the pro-choice argument. It may not be politically correct to say this as it may be taken as one group forcing their religious beliefs on others, hence most pro-choicers wont even touch the religious aspect with a ten foot pole.Now, what I can't for the life of me understand is why anyone would choose to listen to those who have no basis for placing dignity in the human being try to make a call on issues of ethics and morality. It makes sense that those who, due to their chosen faith based religion, can find no basis for the sacredness of human life would have a problem comprehending a view that says that human life is sacred and all people should be treated with dignity and respect.

Sorry, but if we're talking about the extermination of human life, I'm going to need a little more to go on than the generalization "pro choice people use common sense."

Cancer cells, or any cells in a multicellular organism, (whether part of the body, or artificially stabilized in a lab) other than the gametes are unable to become a NEW multicellular life form that passes all of the criteria for life. The only exception would be a stem cell that has been artificially "fooled" into "believing" it is a zygote.If you wish to argue that Cancer cells somehow meet the requirement of reproductivity because of their individual ability to divide... They would still fail because, as a whole, cancer, by it's very nature, is not homeostatic.

Pro-choice people use common sense instead of religious beliefs.

I never said that pro choice people dont have or "lack" any religious beliefs did I? Thats what your assuming and thats incorrect. What many pro-life people fail to see is what will happen if abortion is illegal. Making it illegal isnt going to save all the so called "lifes" that abortion supposably destroys. Making it illegal isnt going to stop abortion. It will just make it even more unsafe and unsanatarity. It will most likley put the mother in danger, because people are still going to abort whether you agree with it or not. When abortion is legal that doesnt Force women to not have the baby does it? Well why is it when abortion is illegal that women are Forced to have a baby.Many women who will suffer from an abortion illegalization are teen mothers. I guess we should just make her raise a kid in poverty. All of this is this "common sense" that pro choicers use.

To add to what Cush has said, this does not make them a separate organism. To continue your line of reasoning any cells could be cultured under artififcal conditions but this does not make them a separate entity. The only reason cancerous ones appear to have a "life of their own" is because the DNA that normally controls their replication to allow healthy repair and replacement is compromised and thus they replicate without control.

Since some people will break a given law is a reason for throwing it out all together?

Absolutely. Because, legal or not, abortion is a choice. Just like skydiving. No one is forcing a woman to get an abortion. NO ONE.With the medical advancements of our era, unlike the previous era... I think that illegalizing abortion will eventually create a whole new branch of birth control that will allow women to safely "turn-off" the ability to get pregnant until they choose to. Currently, the demand for such a product or proceedure exists, but hasn't gathered enough momentum to be developed fully.Of course, this will open a whole new can of ethical worms.

Yes.A law against abortions WILL prevent the killing of innocent children because we will find an alternative. Just like always.Explain how this is possible. I'm assuming that you mean: after anti-abortion legislation is passed (which will probably be at the end of next year after Rehnquist steps down), that illegal abortions will continue at such a feverish rate (in America) that somehow an equal number OR MORE unborn children will be killed.? Doubtful.Unless you had another scenario in mind.

I'm also in favor of legalizing drugs, but my point was that you don't legalize something just because you can't control the abuse of it. I think that Uncle Sam shouldn't be able to decide what I eat drink or smoke because the government has no jurisdiction over my personal decisions as long as they don't infringe on others.The argument that many women will die at the hands of hack abortionists if they are made illegal is a weak argument given the fact that they would be chosing to go to those hacks knowing that abortion was illegal and being performed by hacks. The number of back woods abortions that would occur if abortion was made illegal is no reason to make an immoral act legal, IMO.

You dream up an impossible, absurd scenario and then are surprised that I give an answer that isn't based on pragmatism or moral relativism, but rather principle. Our laws should reflect our values. If we value life, we make laws to reflect those values. Do you find that difficult to comprehend?If I believed that any law that served a practical purpose was "OK", I'd be in favor of prohibition of alcohol, drugs, censorship, and a whole host of things that I am opposed to on constitutional principle. IMO, laws must have two defining characteristics. They must be Constitutional and they must reflect the values of the governed.

Instead there forcing women to have a baby. Why support such a case when it doesnt even lead to the overall goal of preventing "feti" from dying, but instead adds to the problem with unsafe practice. Why should we need that? Since its far from coming why use that as a control for women. Until that time comes, then it can be discussed.

So the definition of a person is very much open to interpretation and debate, but the fact is this: If a man in a coma is not a person, it doesn’t give anyone the right to kill him, just because he is not a person, especially if this is based on someone’s opinion that he is not a person. If it could be proved that with time the man may recover, the possibility of turning off the life support machine that he depends on would be completely immoral, it would constitute murder. A foetus in the womb could be described as being on a life support system too, and we know that the baby may become conscious, if left to recover, hence abortion is murder.

The "right to life" of the coma victim is an extension of rights bestowed at birth so I don't see the situations as comparable. Otherwise killing someone in their sleep would not violate their rights either. An early term fetus has never known consciousness and as such cannot be seen in the same light.

None of us here, including yourself, has any authority to decide anything for anyone else. In these discussion groups, we are simply stating our opinions and the reasons behind them. I define personhood as a human life that includes a mental existence. The reason I define it this way is that, outside of pro-life views on abortion discussions, I've always heard the word "person" used in a way that automatically assumes a mental existence. A mental existence doesn't have to be conscious. It can be subconscious, as in a coma or in sleep. Just because someone is in a state of mind that cannot interact with others doesn't mean that they don't mentally exist.

There is no authority (including both myself and yourself, since we have no such authority) that determines the beginning of personhood and its inherent rights, mainly because our society is struggling to understand what it means by personhood.

I do recognize that this "thing", if given more time to develop will very likely become a person and so the decision should not be taken lightly.

You don't want to push your beliefs on others but you get to decide who those "others" are. That doesn't really seem right. I can't decide who is and isn't a person can I? Is it morally ok or me to kill all white people because I feel they are not persons? I don't think so. During slavery they didn't think blacks were "persons" so does this make it morally right? I honestly don't believe one can set his/her own standard for what a person is because to do this you have to establish what a person is before you can give them the right to decide what a person is. See the circle there? This is why I believe there is one answer to this question just like an apple is an apple no matter what others call it or say it is. If you will excuse me, I am going to go kill some people that I don't believe are persons now emoticonXRolleyes

We simply both present our views and supporting arguements. Any other people reading our exchange will simply make up their own mind.To be honest, your arguements seem to be composed more of attacks on others views than on any justification of your own. Since you seem to view a fetus as a person even before it has a mental existence, then what exactly is your definition of personhood?

In both cases that I'm certain about, yes. I don't know what the language in the pertinent laws say, however. That would be an interesting topic to research.

Were these fetuses late term?

Indeed. I for one would support laws to protect late term fetuses and prosecute their killers. My support of a woman's right to choose abortion wanes as the first trimester comes to an end. I believe as the nervous system develops the ability to sense the external world a person is coming into "being", thus making it a human "being" and therefore protected.

What are you doing if not deciding who those "others" are as well? You are making a decision just as much as I am. Why should your decision be more valid? Do you claim to be an authority? I openly admit that I am not an authority but recognize the fact that no one is in this area since we as a society have not come to an understanding of what we mean by personhood and "other".We all have some idea of what we mean by person. It is generally acknowledged by nearly everyone that a born baby is a person. Unfortunately, before that, the picture becomes much more murky and a decision of when another person exists depends on people's general definition of personhood. It can be set at birth, at conception, at certain stages of development of the brain, etc. I can well imagine a belief system that claims that every unfertilized egg is a person just waiting to be fertilized so it can grow. Does that mean that abstaining from fertilizing that egg is murder? Of course not, at least not according to the great majority of us. However, perhaps you see my point. We do have to set some early limit on when a person exists and forums such as this allow for the discussions that might have a chance of letting us all narrow down our definitions.Meanwhile, you haven't answered my question about your definition of a personhood, with justifying arguements.

You don't want to push your beliefs on others but you get to decide who those "others" are. That doesn't really seem right. I can't decide who is and isn't a person can I? Is it morally ok or me to kill all white people because I feel they are not persons? I don't think so. During slavery they didn't think blacks were "persons" so does this make it morally right? I honestly don't believe one can set his/her own standard for what a person is because to do this you have to establish what a person is before you can give them the right to decide what a person is. See the circle there? This is why I believe there is one answer to this question just like an apple is an apple no matter what others call it or say it is. If you will excuse me, I am going to go kill some people that I don't believe are persons now emoticonXRolleyes

ok, so personhood is "murky"...wouldn't this mean we would resort to the safest bet? You would think people would rather be sure they are not killing someone instead of "might" be killing someone. Seems like an awful big risk to take.As for definition of personhood...To me person and human are the same thing. To try and make a difference is to justify something. When we have a law that says you can't kill someone it is implied to mean person or human fairly interchangably....in fact you probably do it all the time in normal speech. However, getting caught up with definitions leads us no where but trying to justify something with a technicality. A human is a person is someone that deserves to not be murdered for doing nothing. The same reason I would never kill you, an unborn, or anyone for that matter.

To some extent yes, we should err on the safe side. However, it's all a matter of degree and depends on one's understanding of the development of the human fetus. This understanding can be based on some level of scientific analysis, it can be based on religious beliefs, or on philosophical considerations.The first step is for us all to try to decide mutually what we mean by person. What is it inherently in the fetus at a particular stage that would make it important enough to take away a woman's right over her own body? For me, the existence of a new human body is not enough, there has to be someone home. There has to be a minimum level of mental existence. Otherwise, who is it that you are empathizing with? There is no "other" to speak of until a mental existence first starts. As I understand it so far, science tells us that, though our brain develops enough to have certain levels of control over bodily functions quite early, it is not capable of thought or emotion until about the 30th week, when enough neural connections have been made along with other developments. I'm not as sure about the perception of pain since pain receptors develop earlier but they might not register as suffering until later - so this area is still more murky from my limited understanding. This scientific point of view, of course, assumes that we are mentally determined by our physical brains. Religious and philosophical beliefs vary. One can imagine that a "soul" (which seems to usually imply a mental existence) enters at conception. I would personally think that God would be very cruel indeed if that were the case. Imagine having a mind in a body that is not functioning. Either way, religious beliefs vary but our country seems to have been founded on religious freedom in that one group's religious beliefs cannot be imposed on everyone. Therefore, religious arguements cannot be used in legally determining the start of a new human's rights.So where we personally would draw the safety line depends on our beliefs and understanding but society can only go on more secular reasoning in its determination.As you say, "a human is a person is *someone* that deserves to not be murdered for doing nothing". The very word someone implies a mental existence. We might actually be agreeing on the definition but might well only be disagreeing on when that "someone" comes into existence. My guess is that you believe it is at conception or that you acknowledge a strong possibility that it could be at conception so you prefer to err on the side of caution. My view, based mostly on scientific understanding, is that it most likely comes in the third trimester, though the second trimester is murky enough that I might be convinced there with proper scientific arguements (which I have yet to hear). My religious/philosophical beliefs, such as they are, assume that God would not be cruel enough to put a soul into an underprepared body.

I don't see the logical connection between this statement and my stated views. Obviously, Alzeimers patients have a mental existence. It may not be a very high level one and may be deteriorating, but it is most certainly there. According to my definition of person being a human with a mental existence, Alzeimers patients are people and should be treated as such.Existence is a binary thing - either something exists or it doesn't. A genius doesn't mentally exist any more than does an acute Alzeimer's patient who only has rudimentary emotions left. The genius simply has a far more developed mentality. The trick comes in understanding when the mental existence comes into being. When, during the growth of a fetus, does it start having rudimentary feelings or thoughts? Also, when, in the deterioration of the mind through damage to the brain, does one stop mentally existing? How much brain damage is enough to stop all thoughts or feelings so that one is only a self-sustaining body, nothing more? Once again, I'm not saying that these thoughts or emotions need to be at all advanced, nor am I saying that these rudimentary thoughts or emotions have to be conscious.

Whether the little unborn has a mental existence depends on its state of development. My understanding, from what I've read and heard so far of the science, is that humans cannot have thoughts or emotions before roughly the 30th week, when sufficient neural connections have been made. I personally would push for outlawing abortion after that time except for certain rare cases. I haven't heard any rational, informed, non-religious arguements about how thoughts or emotions could exist before that point. However, if someone were to present such an arguement with supporting sources, I would be open to changing my view - I've been waiting for a while now.As for Alzeimer's patients, the ones I've known or heard about all seemed to have at least rudimentary thoughts and emotions soon before their death. It's possible that my understanding of Alzeimer's disease is limited and that, at the latest stages, they no longer have any brain activity in their celebral cortex (or any other part of the brain involved in thought or emotion). If this is your understanding, please site some sources.Science cannot tell us exactly when thoughts or emotions start, but it seems to be able to give us some limits on when the earliest time would be and, as mentioned above, that seems to be about the 30th week.Yes, but your safety line is at conception since you consider there to be a fair chance of a mental existence beginning in the first or second trimester. My safety line is roughly at the beginning of the third trimester (30th week), based on the arguements presented above - with a possible few week subtraction to account for any fetuses that might develop early. I place the safety line there since, judging from the science, I see no chance of a mental existance occuring in the first trimester and most of the second trimester.

2) So you believe that, as long as the body is alive, there is a mental existence - at both ends, fetus side and end of life side. Am I reading that correctly?3) I would agree that there are cases where a doctor, family member, or general authority might want to end the life of someone who is severely brain damaged but still has enough mind and will to live left in him that they would not want to die. In such cases, I agree that we should let them live. However, there are certainly also a lot of cases where continued life is pure torture - through extreme physical or mental suffering that no medicine can cure or even relieve. In such cases, especially after a long period of such suffering, most people would want to die. Would you like to live for decades under extreme physical or mental suffering with no hope for a cure or relief? If you had no means of communicating your desire to end your life, wouldn't you hope that someone would be wise enough to make that decision for you? Granted, we have strayed a bit off-topic here to talk about certain cases of the end of life, as opposed to the beginning, but I disagree with this "life at all cost, under all situations" idea. It's too simplistic and doesn't take into account all scenarios.In your view, what level of knowledge would be good enough for determining an end (or beginning) of mental existence?

For myself, if I were in the situation of living under uncureable and unrelievable terrible physical or mental pain, without any means of communicating my wishes, I would hope that someone would have the wisdom to "pull the plug". So many people feel likewise that Living Wills are gaining popularity.Again, this whole arguement assumes a mental existence of the fetus. We simply seem to disagree as to when we think there is a first possibility of mental exitence in the fetus.

Nope, you are not. I said "I believe mental existence from your body ends"Seems like pain and suffering all are natural parts of life...we all have been in that situation. How can one recommend death as a better option from death when none of us know how it is.My view says that I have no authority to make this determination because it is purely arbitary. At LEAST we can say we all have to make the decision for ourselves and this would reasonably lead to one saying the fetus has to make the decision for itself and default at life until it otherwise can decide.

Why is the male pill too much to handle for your male chauvinistic ego and so you have chosen to ridicule it...too late, the cat is out of the basket so as to speak and there is no putting it back in.

You may think it is cruel but others do not and therein the abortion issue is debated...some people might think it is even more cruel to bring an unwanted child into this world...neglected , abused the list goes on...so your definition of cruelty does not necessarily coincide with other people's definition of cruelty.Does your compassion for the fetus end when the child is born ? Why not spend all that energy (and money) to help children after they are born ?
attacks
I agree that this issue is also about cruelty. I believe that it IS cruel to terminate a fetus at any stage of development.You are using awareness, and the developed ability to think as your deciding point for granting personhood. And then using personhood to define your "cutoff" period for abortion advocation.I am simply using a different ruler. I do not define personhood by some arbitrary brain development level. Thought does not define a human. We are defined as soon as our first cell is created. It is when the pieces come together to create each of our individual living DNA maps. Only time will tell what that map will produce, and it is not for me or anyone else to terminate that person.

At the point that you become human, in other words conception.

That seems to be the biggest question in the debate over abortion. The answer is not a single day but rather it is each persons opinion. The pro-life people say that a fetus is a human when the sperm fuses with the egg. The extreme pro-choice people say that it is a fetus until birth. I disagree with both.When a fetus is a one celled organism then it is in no way a human. The supporters of the idea that is it human say that it has the DNA that makes us human. They are right, but so does the skin you shed all the time. So does all the blood you have ever lost. All those cells have the blueprint that makes us human. So it is not DNA that makes us, us.So what makes a human? DNA gives a blueprint but it certainly does not decide when the blueprint has been completed enough to call it human. The answer must be in the make up of the fetus. Organs, a nervious system, a brain, all these are the things that make us human. Those things are not developed until 7-10 weeks after conception though (depending on your source). Many like to show proof that they start to develope earlier but again, unless something is completed and is operating then it cannot be regarded as developed. Based on that information I would have to say that abortion should be legal until 7-10 weeks after conception. Once that time period has passed and the fetus has a functional nervious system and brain then abortion should only be reserved for the rare cases that the mothers life is in danger. That solution seems to be the closest that both sides can get to agreeing though many from both sides reject it because they are to hardheaded to budge. I would like to hear from anyone that has any thoughts on the subject though. What do you think?

Personally, I am not religious at all. I am a man of logic and reason and tend to steer clear of myths and superstitions. But my gut instinct tells me that abortion = snuffing the life out of a new baby. I don't need any god or religion to tell me what's right. I don't need any "divine scripture" telling me not to kill or steal either. I can figure that out on my own with having it be mandated to me from some book of fairy tales.I'll go with common sense and logic every time. Works for me. emoticonXGood

Hmmm. All people will suffer at some point in their life. So yes, I would say that suffering is God's will. It is through suffering that a person achieves perserverance and perserverance produces character.However, I would not say that the purpose of Christianity is to bring souls into the world to suffer. Christianity is the belief of Christ as your savior.

Thats a fair point, but if we are going to play the grisly body parts card the pro-lifers have to work in a morgue and see women who die through unprofessionally administered abortions.Off course, this is difficult to arrange these days in the West because professional abortion services are available. Turn the clock back 50 years and its a different story though.

You may not know you are human when you are a day old but you are still a conscious human being aware of being a conscious living organism ...

There isn't much of a case to be made that a newborn child is self-aware, so say my developmental psychology studies anyway. An infant doesn't even possess a language, even an internal language, capable of articulating ideas like "conscious" or "living" or "individual", it doesn't understand that it has a body that it controls. I don't know if you've ever lived with a baby, but it goes through a period of self discovery where it learns to use its muscles, it learns in fact it has muscles.

Life begins with the twinkle in the eye.There is a difference between being and becoming.When neural activity starts in a fetus, a human is started. Without this minimum prerequisite, all you have is a mass of cells.I give you this as the current thinking:http://edition.cnn.com/2005/TECH/sci....ap/index.htmlA skin cell as a human? I think not.

You get into trouble when you start to question when is a human a human. I am 18 years old. My brain won't be fully developed until I am 21. Does this make me less human. People really should think about this because if you can say that because certain areas such as the nervous system, heart, and brain are not fully developed you can also say that because a baby cannot walk he cant be completely human because humans can walk. Its sad that we start to question whether or not a baby leaving inside of us is human or not in an effort to be able to do whatever you want with no consequences.

I mean those who never developed a fully functioning nervous system and full functioning organs in the womb.

The fact is that very good, well intentioned and easonable people disagree very strongly about when an embryo becomes a human based on their deeply held religious beliefes. I will never be convinced that a biological blob consisting of 6 cells in a human being to be afforded any protection whatsoever. Nor can I be convinced that it has a soul. I personally believe that vaibility is the point where abortion should be illegal except to save the mothers life (abortion should always be legal to save the mothers life, we all have a right to self defence). I also have a deeply held religious belief that the greatest wrong a person can do is to bring an unwanted child into this world where we can not even properly care for the children we already have. On the other hand folks like Chloe have deeply held religious beliefs that those 6 cells are a soul bearing, fully vested human being. As a society we need to respect both of those beliefs and get on with our lives and act like Americans and find the common ground where the majority of people will be content, which is very likely to turn out to be somewhere between 10 weeks and viability. The radical pro and anti choice groups should stop wasting their time and money on this devisive debate and start showing real respect for LIFE by caring for the kids who have been willingly brought forth onto this planet so they have the self confidence and skills requried to live a happy, meaningful life.

Your principle of viablity rooted in the notion that one's humanity is slowly acquired is extremely prejudice. Why? This developmental view (existing only to justify taking a human life) deems humans to be "inferior" on the basis that they are small and not fully developed. Blacks were once deemed partially human because they were viewed by evolutionary science to be "not fully developed". The eugenics movement viewed the Jews to be inhuman, and also viewed the handicapped to be "life unworthy of life". Do you see my point?
