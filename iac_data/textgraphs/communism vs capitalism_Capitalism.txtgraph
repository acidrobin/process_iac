Capitalism

I read that book quite some time ago. Isn't it funny that Alan Greenspan is working for the 'biggest' monopoly in the world?Although he does reccomend that all major government programs go through a sunset, even the Federal Reserve. Although I don't think this will ever happen. They'll probably collapse and blame 'capitalism', like they did in the past. I merely hope that us 'liberty-minded' folks have some sort of place in this world, even if it's a state or two; so perhaps we can dule the pain of the forced destruction that's imposed on the whole of our economy. Regulations here and there, just continuely resonate the given culture, which would rather use force then reason.

This is a nice debate.You know, I'm not sure if I agree that when there is absolutely no gov. intervention in business there will never be a monopoly. Maybe not a 100% monopoly, but when has there ever been that (outside public utilities)?Usually when you are talking about a monopoly, you are talking about one company or product becoming so widely used that there is eventually no real competition. Or, you could be talking about the malignant monopoly where the big company makes it to where only their product can be sold and only at the price set by them. Then they turn around and buy out or intimidate the competition out of business. I really don't see how that can't arise when there is no gov. involvement. I like to consider myself mostly libertarian. I agree that there should be as little government in business as possible, but in the case of trusts/monopolies, that's where the gov. should be involved. Googling Alan Greenspan and libertarian (because when someone called him a libertarian I said 'huh?') I got this:http://www.lewrockwell.com/latulippe/latulippe12.htmlYou know, I think it may just be that the US economy has been kept afloat merely by the Fed Reserve being run by someone who originally opposed it. Otherwise, it might have been sunk by the national debt a long time ago.(note: i think it's obvious I'm no economist.)

Wow Rick, you said that great. I agree.

How does less regulation increase then number of companies? Without strong regulation, what is stopping a company from simply stomping competitors out of the market and achieving government hands off monopoly? Large corporations are essentially are a antithesistical system to capitalism. Companies such as walmart, Microsoft, Standard Oil and others have all sought to knock out competition by almost any means possible. Walmart practices a nasty form of competition removal by drastically lowering prices to decimate every competitor for 5 miles before jacking the prices up significently. I don't think anyone needs a lesson in how Microsoft operates. SO was notorious for buying out, illegally often, competitors. Lots of regulation is obviously bad for captialism, but so is little regulation, it appears like everything in this world, that moderation must be achieved for a happy existance.

; )I do not believe in copyrights, and I can understand peoples sentiments against them. I do not perceive them to be an individual right. At what point do you deem them a monopoly? When it's a 100% of the market in a town, region or country? I don't believe there's ever been one (devoid of government funds/support) that encompassed the country.Objectivist at one point. Libertarian, I don't know.He's leaving soon. He's been there twenty odd years, and he said to some degree that he doesn't know how to do his job. It's odd that no one wants to faze out this monopoly.

That was great PNAC. In the book Maestro, I read (I think it was that book) that he considers himself a libertarian. Another great libertarian economist is Nobel Prize winner Milton Freedman.You are a better economist than most. I think the reason we can run such huge deficits is because money is being depreciated (we have inflation). The money is worth less because more is printed. How much is that dollar worth if there are only 10 in the world? How much would it be worth if there are 10 billion in the world? It would be worth less in the second example.Greenspan believes the primary cause for inflation is the Federal Debt. He has a meeting with each President that comes into office and tells them this is what he believes. Notice how interest rates became nill under Clinton. He said that Clinton understood what he said, and lowered the deficit. Clinton was rewarded with prosperity created by low interest rates. Great Post BTW.

Most corporations don’t like regulations, so they say. Regulations benefit the larger corporations. How??? Because of scale, compliance takes less resources per revenue dollars. For instance, it is takes more per capita recourses for a 10-person company to comply with a regulation than a 100,000-person company.Example: Every company must comply with Federal Withholding Taxes. The guy that runs a small 3 man shop must pay an accountant to do the statements and whatnot. The large corporation spends less per employee for the same procedure because of scale. It is that way with pretty much every regulation. The little guy must figure out comply with all of them. Does he need to hire accounts, attorneys or specialists? It can become complicated.You mentioned corporate welfare (we both agree there) on another thread. That is a hot topic with me. The large corporations can hire the attorneys and specialists to file and get the “free money” thus freeing up money to help put the little guy out of business. We will end up with just a few large corporations in the end.

Speaking of monopolies:Why can’t a monopoly exist? It can if it is created via the government. Patents create monopolies.It is very difficult for them to exist in a free market. Here is why: Lets say you lower your prices to put the competitor out of business. Lets say you lower them so low that you lose money. You sustain that for some time until you are the only company left doing whatever it is you do.The natural goal of a monopoly is to raise prices. You do so. Soon there is huge profits to be reaped. Others see your profits and want to join in. Capital is shifted into competing with your business. Well, you sold at a loss for years to put your competition out of business. You can’t do this forever. Now you are competing against others that did not carry the years of losses you did in creating your monopoly.Monopolies can be good also. Standard Oil is an example how trust busting can fail the society. It may have set back alternative fuel research. There is no reason to investigate alternative forms of energy if gasoline is so cheap. How can other forms of alternative energy compete? If Rockefeller was allowed to keep his monopoly, and allowed to raise the price of gas, other people would have investigated alternative forms of energy. What do they say “Gasoline is cheaper than bottled water”? Why switch?That is my opinion.

I think there should be some environmental regulations. Companies should not be allowed to just dump poisons into the environment. The states should have some regulation in this regard. If there is a dispute amongst the states, then the Feds should help sort it out.That is about it, I think.

Well, there is a first for everything. I don't have a problem with the idea of a corporation, but many modern corporations have systems that are dubious in the realm of ethics. However, many are very clean, such as Costco. Heck they opened a gas station that was a 5-10 cents cheaper and none of the gas stations around have gone out of business, and that was a 18 months ago! Now, walmart opened up a store in my state and within several months virtually every smaller store that competed with them went out of business because of their activities in a 5 mile radius. The idea of a corporation is not inherently bad, it is their activites in terms of competition that warrant the evil/good labels. Yes, most small businesses fail, but that doesn't mean that small business is a bad idea. For at least half of America's history, the country was dominated by small business. Life is never that simple, but it would be interesting to see most large corporations embrace true capitalism. That is a truer capitalism then big business runs. ahhahaha. That's pretty funny.

Yeah, I like Costco, but I never seem to go.The market dictates this. Yes, it's sad to see the little ones go; especially when the service there seems better at times...but it's the people that choice it. They could always chose to stay with the small shops.Both are nescessary, imo. One is more or less for high production, while the other is innovative, and new. Paradigms do shift. Give technology a little more time, and you might see something special.Ask that from the kids he enslaves. j/k, I don't know how he gets the product as cheap as he does. Trade secret.It's true. China has set-up their economy in a way that over-favors their production to a point.It's just silly. As in the kid does it voluntarily. I don't think kids would have a problem working if the family needed money...if fact some did it to survive. But to put an obligation on a child with out their consent, is almost slavery in my perception.Voluntary funds, not general. Education needs to be free of government, but I don't believe public school shouldn't exist if they're support by individuals. Then again, I don't think that's conceivable if not pooled into the general funds; because I do think private schools (given a bigger market) would find it in their interest to lower their admission fees, and offer a better education. They don't have that choice right now.

Costco. I take the family to Costco at least twice a month. We do most of our shopping at Costco.In cities throughout the US, Costco has gotten prime property via legislation. Let me explain that. Eminent Domain is the Constitution, and is a method for the state to take land and use it for their purposes. I don’t mind that usually, but many times the cities will use this authority to take land (usually from the smaller business person) and give it to Costco.Many cities have taken it a step further. Cities have enacted legislation that permits the creation of Redevelopment Agencies. These agencies typically take land (the pay fair market value or more of course) and sell it to a larger corporation. I have yet to see these agencies take land from a Large Corporation like Costco and give it to the small companies. Eventually, via our do-good legislators, we will only have a few large corporations, I think. I would love to see this change.

I don’t think that mergers are the biggest culprit in the creation of mega-corporations. I would like to see more evidence. I have given several examples on how laws have helped the big guy over the small guy. In this thread or others about capitalism there were some examples of how temporary monopolies can benefit the society. I stated a reason in post 11 that explains why collusion in price fixing does not work forever. I disagree for the same reasons I have been giving all along. There may be some legislation that was passed that has kept corporations small (Anti-trust) but did it really benefit the society?

What is amazing, and incredibly saddening is that price is more important than anything else. Wal-mart has used Chinese prison slave labor, child sweat shops, sexist policies, and other very dubious acts, but people still choose them over more ethical competition because of price. Morals and ethics are chump change when it comes to low prices. We'll see.That would be hard to prove though. A kid could simply lie to you out of fear. It's not. Education, from K-12 and higher is incredibly expensive. Most private schools and universities live on the donations of their alumni. My private highschool was short $2,000 after tuition. $60 million short every year.

Our city just settled an eminent domain lawsuit (in favor of the original land owner) that was seven years old. There are three other lawsuits pending on the same issue, property valuation. Redevelopment agencies actually have the ability to pay assessed value for property condemned under eminent domain legislation, disregarding market prices 'for the good of the community'. When the property owner files a lawsuit to recover the difference between assessed and market value (the assessed valuation can't be accepted by the property owner as it constitues acceptance of the terms), the public agency merely uses its deep pockets to drag it out until the property owner is financially ruined and settles for peanuts. The old adage of 'You can't fight city hall' has become even more of a truism now that they have virtually unlimited empowerment to take private property and ruin the property owner in the process.

I don’t mind that usually, but many times the cities will use this authority to take land (usually from the smaller business person) and give it to Costco.Many cities have taken it a step further. Cities have enacted legislation that permits the creation of Redevelopment Agencies. These agencies typically take land (the pay fair market value or more of course) and sell it to a larger corporation. I have yet to see these agencies take land from a Large Corporation like Costco and give it to the small companies. Eventually, via our do-good legislators, we will only have a few large corporations, I think. I would love to see this change.

If it makes you feel better, I don't shop with them. Probably because I don't have one around, but I guess you can say I'm not much of a consumer...I don't believe it's the 'American way'.Not if it goes directly to an authority. Signed--sealed--and delievered. It's much like abuse, it's really up to the slight courage of a child. Yes, fear can be a factor. Well, your thinking with a given market of a few. Public school is monopoly, and the price is way out of line according to the real demand. I'm quite sure that it would adjust accordingly...hell, if one could afford a computer, then one can afford an education via online.

What is amazing, and incredibly saddening is that price is more important than anything else. Wal-mart has used Chinese prison slave labor, child sweat shops, sexist policies, and other very dubious acts, but people still choose them over more ethical competition because of price. Morals and ethics are chump change when it comes to low prices. We'll see.That would be hard to prove though. A kid could simply lie to you out of fear. It's not. Education, from K-12 and higher is incredibly expensive. Most private schools and universities live on the donations of their alumni. My private highschool was short $2,000 after tuition. $60 million short every year.

I agree. People complain about imports but then buy them. People complain about the little toys in Wal-Mart being made by cheap labor while they drive their imported cars. What a bunch of hypocrites. Don’t they realize that their ONE car is about as valuable as the whole toy department (or close to it). Many of these same people have a Toyota and Honda in the garage and complain about jobs going overseas.< Edited >I think it is a good thing some of our products are made overseas. We don’t need to make our socks. I hope Americans are beyond that. We should be making the satellites, heart-lung machines, pacemakers, and other high-tech stuff. I think it is OK to buy socks made in Thailand or cars with parts made in Asia. That is my opinion. Oh yah, I don’t think it is OK for anyone to be a slave, kids or adults. I do think kids should be allowed to work.

We have a German family car, I drive a Japanese p/u truck and have three much older American hobby trucks. I haven't purchased a US marque vehicle in many, many years, primarily due to low quality and poor resale value. I buy for quality and find few American made products that measure up to imports, as US companies cut quality in attempts to make up the difference in labor/benefits/compliance in cost of goods. As an example, Chinese bearings are now the world standard. If you want a US made bearing, it has to be special ordered and costs double the imported product. I find that typical in most product lines. We now live in a world economy. I wouldn't be quite so harsh on emerging industrial nations. Considering that it hasn't been all that long ago that we used children for manufacturing labor and women had no legal rights added to the fact that it was only 40-years when ago we segregated our public schools, it does sound a little righteous.

Just so you know, the majority of Japanese cars sold in the US are also assembled in the US and thus provide Americans with thousands of jobs at these plants.

Many are and like us, the Japanese are always looking for cheap labor. ;) Labor rates in Japan have become astronomical. They are moving past the manufacturing stage in their development. They now realize (like we will hopefully someday), that it is better to market products than manufacture them. I live near the port of Long Beach and see fields of cars brought in everyday. I actually have no problem with that. I do have a problem with people that complain about imports after one of their major purchases was an import car. Thanks for pointing that out FF.

You are so right. In fact, it was the Japanese Imports that forced American Auto Makers to improve. We have. We would all still be driving 1960’s quality cars if we put massive tariffs on imports or a protectionist policy.I think American Products are typically better than imports. The price is usually higher.I think it my point was misconstrued. My point is made in the post right above this. I will edit the part about a poll. Thanks.

This could be answered depending on whether you think that competition is good for society. But let's look at your post 11Patents don't equat to monopolies. You can use your patent to gain money by selling your idea out.Monopolies can be good also. Standard Oil is an example how trust busting can fail the society. It may have set back alternative fuel research. There is no reason to investigate alternative forms of energy if gasoline is so cheap. How can other forms of alternative energy compete? If Rockefeller was allowed to keep his monopoly, and allowed to raise the price of gas, other people would have investigated alternative forms of energy. What do they say ?Gasoline is cheaper than bottled water?? Why switch?That is my opinion.[/quote]No, Standard Oil is the standard example of bad big business. They used price-fixing with the railways etc to put businesses to the wall. That is what rampant capitalism does - allows hard-working small business to be destroyed by companies using foul play.

I don’t think that mergers are the biggest culprit in the creation of mega-corporations. I would like to see more evidence. I have given several examples on how laws have helped the big guy over the small guy. In this thread or others about capitalism there were some examples of how temporary monopolies can benefit the society. I stated a reason in post 11 that explains why collusion in price fixing does not work forever. I disagree for the same reasons I have been giving all along. There may be some legislation that was passed that has kept corporations small (Anti-trust) but did it really benefit the society?

Yes they do. If you get a patent on something, under the law, I can’t sell your idea unless you give me permission. It is the worse kind of monopoly; It is one created and enforced by law.That is the standard textbook answer, but it does not respond to my post. If you were to ask ronound economists of today like Nobel Prize winner Milton Freedman or Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan (from the book Capitalism) they would disagree with this standard textbook answer. Here is some interesting information concerning anti-trust laws. Remember when IBM was sued under anti-trust laws. Their “monopoly” did not last forever. The same will happen with Microsoft. By the time a anti-trust suit is completed their market share will have fallen because of Linux. http://www.capitalism.org/faq/antitrust.htmWrites Dominick Armentano [professor of economics at the University of Hartford],The little-known truth is that when the government took Standard Oil to court in 1907, Standard Oil's market share had been declining for a decade. Far from being a "monopoly," Standard's share of petroleum refining was approximately 64% at the time of trial. Moreover, there were at least 147 other domestic oil-refining competitors in the market — and some of these were large, vertically integrated firms such as Texaco, Gulf Oil, and Sun. Kerosene outputs had expanded enormously (contrary to usual monopolistic conduct); and prices for kerosene had fallen from more than $2 per gallon in the early 1860s to approximately six cents per gallon at the time of the trial. So much for the myth of the Standard Oil "monopoly."…Don't the antitrust laws stop monopolistic practices?Absolutely not. Harmful monopolies from the old AT&T monopoly (created by government regulations), to the U.S. Post Office monopoly were created by the state. The U.S. Post Office, for example, maintains its monopoly on the lucrative first class mail market by having the state outlaw its competition.Take for example Judge Learned Hand's indictment of ALCOA. What 'crimes' was ALCOA punished for? To quote Hand:"It was not inevitable that it should always anticipate increases in the demand for ingot and be prepared to supply them. Nothing compelled it to keep doubling and redoubling its capacity before others entered the field. It insists that it never excluded competitors; but we can think of no more effective exclusion than progressively to embrace each new opportunity as it opened, and to face every new- comer with new capacity already geared into a great organization, having the advantage of experience, trade connections and the elite of personnel." [Alan Greenspan, "Antitrust" published in Ayn Rand's Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal] In other words ALCOA was being punished for being too good a company, too competent in its management, in other words Alcoa's crime is that it is too competitive.HERE IS ANOTHER GREAT ARTICLE:http://www.nathanielbranden.net/ess/ton01.htmlA reader asks: In a society of laissez-faire capitalism, what would prevent the formation of powerful monopolies able to gain control over the entire economy?

Consumerism is quite disturbing. Ethics and morals all go out the window when the right price comes around. Public school isn't a real monopoly. You don't HAVE to go to public school, you can be homeschooled as well as private. Education online? For elementary students? Is that such a good idea?

Standard continued to lose market share even before the suit was settled.I am against the post offices monopoly on first class mail. What do you suggest, to not be competitive? Monopolies do not last forever, unless created by government action.It is easier for a large corporation to comply with regulations. For instance: if a company of three people must pay someone to withhold income tax - would they pay more or less per employee for compliance than a large company of 50,000 employees? Various companies offer compliance services (ADP – Automatic Data Processing is one). They give a discount for companies (on a per capita basis) with more employees. If you are a really big company you will handle this compliance in house, cutting the per capita cost even more.Because of compliance burdens, the smaller companies will fail.

No. Your belief that intellectual property is real property has failed. The paper the screenplay was written on was real, but nobody can prove that what was written was original.We have been contacted by patent attorneys before. The latest was by Black and Decker. They told us we violated their trademark by selling orange colored drills (like DeWalt). Amazon has patented the one click check out but they really didn’t invent it. They just made it to the patent office first.The first article spoke of refining and this one speaks of market share (maybe share of the final product, with some purchased from other refiners – maybe because Standards marketing was better for other refiners – they could get more money using Standard). Evidently, other companies refined petroleum. This does not prove a monopoly will last forever.What would compel a monopoly to have lower prices? Competition. Like I said before, when a monopoly raises its price others jump in. As per Greenspan, this is what he said:The Sherman Act may be understandable when viewed as a projection of the nineteenth century's fear and economic ignorance. But it is utter nonsense in the context of today's economic knowledge. The seventy additional years of observing industrial development should have taught us something. If the attempts to justify our antitrust statutes on historical grounds are erroneous and rest on a misinterpretation of history, the attempts to justify them on theoretical grounds come from a still more fundamental misconception.Actually they did have a monopoly. The point is that monopolies don’t last forever.LOL, no. I am against Anti-trust laws. Monopolies for an extended time are not natural. The monopolies you describe are created by the government. As per your example of the toilet, I agree. On the other had I would allow multiple cable TV companies to compete.

Hang on. I never said intellectual property was real property. If we're dealing with legal definitions then real property doesn't refer to things that are 'really' property, but property that is 'real' in the sense that it is material, and in general refers to land, buildings etc. as opposed to property that is an 'idea', which is intellectual property. PropertyAny thing that is possessed or owned.http://www.legal-dictionary.org/ld.asp?q=propertyThis includes...real propertyn. 1) all land, structures, firmly attached and integrated equipment (such as light fixtures or a well pump), anything growing on the land, and all "interests" in the property, which may include the right to future ownership (remainder), right to occupy for a period of time (tenancy or life estate), the right to drill for oil, the right to get the property back (a reversion) if it is no longer used for its current purpose (such as use for a hospital, school or city hall), use of airspace (condominium) or an easement across another's property. Real property should be thought of as a group of rights like a bundle of sticks which can be divided. It is distinguished from personal property which is made up of movable items. 2) one of the principal areas of law like contracts, negligence, probate, family law and criminal law.See also: condominium easement life estate personal property real estate reversionhttp://dictionary.law.com/definition2.asp?selected=1727&bold=||||You said a patent is like a monopoly. That is the analogy you made. A patent is to protect intellectual property. I said that other forms of property are protected and gave examples of real and other intellectual property. You had no problem with that. THEREFORE you analogy has failed.As to proving if something is original - it can be done to the satisfaction of the courts - there is a whole line of law on intellectual property. Your assertion that it can't be done is wrong.You can do this athttp://www.mediaregister.com/examples/And this is relevant, why? Are you now saying that you don't support the protection of intellectual property?If I own a product and I produce it with a distinctive shape, colour and name, and I build up trust for that product, and you come along and market your product under very similar packaging, name etc, then you are trading off my property... in this case the trust that I have earn.Here is a suit made over 'decor'In 1987, Taco Cabana, a chain of Mexican restaurants in Houston, Texas, brought suit against Two Pesos, a rival chain, claiming that Two Pesos had deliberately copied Taco Cabana's décor. http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/property99/history.htmlFor someone who doesn't like government I see that you would also reject protection for property too.It is your assertion that a monopoly will not last forever, except with government control. It is your assertion that Standard Oil was not a monopoly, and with 90% of the market, I fail to see then what you would in fact call a monopoly.Your kidding! How can you have a monopoly, and real competition?A monopoly would, by virtue of its market share be able to under-cut any new competitor, and can more easily off-set losses. This is what Standard Oil did. They had a large market share over a large area. If a competitor arose in one area Standard would use their over-all profits to re-structure prices in the area where the competition was, to under-cut them. That competitor would go bust, and Standard Oil would raise their prices in that area again, to match those of their over-all products.Sure, and as your article said that his ideas are rejected because it's easier to stop a monopoly from forming, than to disband it after it has formed.What stopped it lasting?Really, so you'd welcome laws against monopolies in other forms, other than anti-trust laws?It is easier to lay down new cables, than sewerage and water pipes... at least at present levels of technology. I can't imagine that the bathrooms of the future would have multiple taps from different companies.

No. Your belief that intellectual property is real property has failed. The paper the screenplay was written on was real, but nobody can prove that what was written was original.We have been contacted by patent attorneys before. The latest was by Black and Decker. They told us we violated their trademark by selling orange colored drills (like DeWalt). Amazon has patented the one click check out but they really didn’t invent it. They just made it to the patent office first.The first article spoke of refining and this one speaks of market share (maybe share of the final product, with some purchased from other refiners – maybe because Standards marketing was better for other refiners – they could get more money using Standard). Evidently, other companies refined petroleum. This does not prove a monopoly will last forever.What would compel a monopoly to have lower prices? Competition. Like I said before, when a monopoly raises its price others jump in. As per Greenspan, this is what he said:The Sherman Act may be understandable when viewed as a projection of the nineteenth century's fear and economic ignorance. But it is utter nonsense in the context of today's economic knowledge. The seventy additional years of observing industrial development should have taught us something. If the attempts to justify our antitrust statutes on historical grounds are erroneous and rest on a misinterpretation of history, the attempts to justify them on theoretical grounds come from a still more fundamental misconception.Actually they did have a monopoly. The point is that monopolies don’t last forever.LOL, no. I am against Anti-trust laws. Monopolies for an extended time are not natural. The monopolies you describe are created by the government. As per your example of the toilet, I agree. On the other had I would allow multiple cable TV companies to compete.

First off, I didn’t say a patent is like a monopoly, I said it creates a monopoly. Therefore my analogy did not fail. You brought up real property in one of your posts and I agree it is not real property. Your analogy failed because the ownership of a property DOES give the owner a monopoly for the use of THAT property. No one else can build on it or even walk on it without the owner’s permission. If there is a such thing, why does the protection stop after a time? This “intellectual property” is not the same as property, real or otherwise.Are you an attorney? Attorneys just love this stuff. I can see these two taco companies in court suing the other. The one with the most money will likely win.I do respect property, I just don’t define it as you do. I don’t consider words on a paper or a color as being property. Again, attorneys just love it.I would call the Postal First Class Mail a monopoly. Standard Oil had a monopoly, but again I say, it would not last forever. In fact, if Standard would have been allowed to continue and raise the price of gas, we may be using alternative forms of fuel today. In other words, I believe that Standard Oil may still be around today, but they would not have a monopoly on energy.Let me say it one more time: If a company raises it’s price other competitors will compete. I stated this in a post prior to this.Dell Computer and Microsoft. I didn’t say that. Just because I don’t like something does not mean I think it should be outlawed. Besides, monopolies don’t last forever and sometimes they can benefit society (see my other posts). Monopolies are part of the natural capitalist cycle that benefits everyone. I know the last statement is shocking, and I would not have said this 15 years ago. LOL, that was a good one. Hey, we agree on something here. Note: These are local city or county regulations unlike national patent or copyright laws.Monte, it has been fun. I feel like I am beginning to repeat myself.

Hang on. I never said intellectual property was real property. If we're dealing with legal definitions then real property doesn't refer to things that are 'really' property, but property that is 'real' in the sense that it is material, and in general refers to land, buildings etc. as opposed to property that is an 'idea', which is intellectual property. PropertyAny thing that is possessed or owned.http://www.legal-dictionary.org/ld.asp?q=propertyThis includes...real propertyn. 1) all land, structures, firmly attached and integrated equipment (such as light fixtures or a well pump), anything growing on the land, and all "interests" in the property, which may include the right to future ownership (remainder), right to occupy for a period of time (tenancy or life estate), the right to drill for oil, the right to get the property back (a reversion) if it is no longer used for its current purpose (such as use for a hospital, school or city hall), use of airspace (condominium) or an easement across another's property. Real property should be thought of as a group of rights like a bundle of sticks which can be divided. It is distinguished from personal property which is made up of movable items. 2) one of the principal areas of law like contracts, negligence, probate, family law and criminal law.See also: condominium easement life estate personal property real estate reversionhttp://dictionary.law.com/definition2.asp?selected=1727&bold=||||You said a patent is like a monopoly. That is the analogy you made. A patent is to protect intellectual property. I said that other forms of property are protected and gave examples of real and other intellectual property. You had no problem with that. THEREFORE you analogy has failed.As to proving if something is original - it can be done to the satisfaction of the courts - there is a whole line of law on intellectual property. Your assertion that it can't be done is wrong.You can do this athttp://www.mediaregister.com/examples/And this is relevant, why? Are you now saying that you don't support the protection of intellectual property?If I own a product and I produce it with a distinctive shape, colour and name, and I build up trust for that product, and you come along and market your product under very similar packaging, name etc, then you are trading off my property... in this case the trust that I have earn.Here is a suit made over 'decor'In 1987, Taco Cabana, a chain of Mexican restaurants in Houston, Texas, brought suit against Two Pesos, a rival chain, claiming that Two Pesos had deliberately copied Taco Cabana's décor. http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/property99/history.htmlFor someone who doesn't like government I see that you would also reject protection for property too.It is your assertion that a monopoly will not last forever, except with government control. It is your assertion that Standard Oil was not a monopoly, and with 90% of the market, I fail to see then what you would in fact call a monopoly.Your kidding! How can you have a monopoly, and real competition?A monopoly would, by virtue of its market share be able to under-cut any new competitor, and can more easily off-set losses. This is what Standard Oil did. They had a large market share over a large area. If a competitor arose in one area Standard would use their over-all profits to re-structure prices in the area where the competition was, to under-cut them. That competitor would go bust, and Standard Oil would raise their prices in that area again, to match those of their over-all products.Sure, and as your article said that his ideas are rejected because it's easier to stop a monopoly from forming, than to disband it after it has formed.What stopped it lasting?Really, so you'd welcome laws against monopolies in other forms, other than anti-trust laws?It is easier to lay down new cables, than sewerage and water pipes... at least at present levels of technology. I can't imagine that the bathrooms of the future would have multiple taps from different companies. Or, you change your contract from Fox Sewerage to Bell, and someone comes out and installs a new toilet, with a pay-by-use application.

Saying something is alike something else is to make it an analogy. You said that a patent (a form of protection over property) creates a monopoly. I stated that other forms of property protection would also therefore be 'monopolies' as with an example from real property where-by regardless of how much I might like the view from your land I can't use it without your permission.Hence an extension of your analogy - equating patents with monopolies, shows the flaw in your logic. It remains your analogy. I simply extended it to show other forms of property - including other forms of intellectual property - such as a screen-play. And you disputed that a screen-play could be shown to be original. This interpretation would have fundamental consequences (were it to be adapted) to property law.Your argument is all over the place. You asked why can't monopolies exist because patents are alike monopolies. You said 'patents create monopolies. It is not about creating a 'monopoly' it is about protecting property.They are different things. If I own something, I have exclusive rights to it. That is not a monopoly. A monopoly is where we are in competition and you drive me and competitors out of business.[quote=Montalban]And this is relevant, why? Are you now saying that you don't support the protection of intellectual property?If I own a product and I produce it with a distinctive shape, colour and name, and I build up trust for that product, and you come along and market your product under very similar packaging, name etc, then you are trading off my property... in this case the trust that I have earn.

I studied law very briefly in a formal sense(I have a habit of this - not completing studies; having attended at least six different universities), and for much longer in an informal sense (I have lots of time on my hands). However, it would suggest that if solicitors, barristers and other legal practitioners are all dealing with it, and you don't think it exists, this would seem that one of you is wrong.I don't define property. I give you definitions found in law. You define things not according to law, but your sense of injustice towards money-grubbing legal workers.Regardless, your assertion that it can't be defined as being original is wrong. It is fortunate too, because if not for this many hard working artists; screen-writers, musicians etc would have their efforts come to nothing, because people who don't believe their work is original would feel free to take it for themselves.It is one thing to argue that what they are doing is self-serving, money grubbing etc, and a totally different argument that the rights of intellectual property don't exist.Yes but this is not a natural monopoly. It is helped into existence by government. It is your assertion that a monopoly without government control would not last long/forever or some lengthy time-frame. I mean if you want to deal in absolutes, I agree as nothing but God lasts forever.How do you prove this? It's not like saying "If not for settlers, the Dodo would still be around".Yes, I know you said this. But, as shown with Standard Oil the larger company was easily able to destroy the competition (recall they had 90% share), by shifting costs around their company.I'm not sure that Microsoft is a competitor of IBM.That's why I posed this as a question. You said you aren't anti-monopoly, but anti-trust laws.But you don't like intellectual property and consign it to non-existence.I agree that monopolies are a product of unrestrained capitalism, which is why I'm not in favour of unrestrained capitalism. It is a system that defeats itself, by destroying competition.I have retained my left-leaning feelings (at least as far as economics go)The only difference is which tier of government these laws live in.

Yes they do. If you get a patent on something, under the law, I can’t sell your idea unless you give me permission. It is the worse kind of monopoly; It is one created and enforced by law.That is the standard textbook answer, but it does not respond to my post. If you were to ask ronound economists of today like Nobel Prize winner Milton Freedman or Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan (from the book Capitalism) they would disagree with this standard textbook answer. Here is some interesting information concerning anti-trust laws. Remember when IBM was sued under anti-trust laws. Their “monopoly” did not last forever. The same will happen with Microsoft. By the time a anti-trust suit is completed their market share will have fallen because of Linux. http://www.capitalism.org/faq/antitrust.htmWrites Dominick Armentano [professor of economics at the University of Hartford],The little-known truth is that when the government took Standard Oil to court in 1907, Standard Oil's market share had been declining for a decade. Far from being a "monopoly," Standard's share of petroleum refining was approximately 64% at the time of trial. Moreover, there were at least 147 other domestic oil-refining competitors in the market — and some of these were large, vertically integrated firms such as Texaco, Gulf Oil, and Sun. Kerosene outputs had expanded enormously (contrary to usual monopolistic conduct); and prices for kerosene had fallen from more than $2 per gallon in the early 1860s to approximately six cents per gallon at the time of the trial. So much for the myth of the Standard Oil "monopoly."…Don't the antitrust laws stop monopolistic practices?Absolutely not. Harmful monopolies from the old AT&T monopoly (created by government regulations), to the U.S. Post Office monopoly were created by the state. The U.S. Post Office, for example, maintains its monopoly on the lucrative first class mail market by having the state outlaw its competition.Take for example Judge Learned Hand's indictment of ALCOA. What 'crimes' was ALCOA punished for? To quote Hand:"It was not inevitable that it should always anticipate increases in the demand for ingot and be prepared to supply them. Nothing compelled it to keep doubling and redoubling its capacity before others entered the field. It insists that it never excluded competitors; but we can think of no more effective exclusion than progressively to embrace each new opportunity as it opened, and to face every new- comer with new capacity already geared into a great organization, having the advantage of experience, trade connections and the elite of personnel." [Alan Greenspan, "Antitrust" published in Ayn Rand's Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal] In other words ALCOA was being punished for being too good a company, too competent in its management, in other words Alcoa's crime is that it is too competitive.HERE IS ANOTHER GREAT ARTICLE:http://www.nathanielbranden.net/ess/ton01.htmlA reader asks: In a society of laissez-faire capitalism, what would prevent the formation of powerful monopolies able to gain control over the entire economy? Nathaniel Branden responds: One of the worst fallacies in the field of economics — propagated by Karl Marx and accepted by almost everyone today, including many businessmen — is that the development of monopolies is an inescapable and intrinsic result of the operation of a free, unregulated economy. In fact, the exact opposite is true. It is a free market that makes monopolies impossible….

Here is where you are wrong: I don’t believe patents should be protected because I don’t consider ideas property. This nullifies the rest of the first paragraph. If you are against monopolies, then why should some one be able to monopolize their property? Shouldn’t anyone be able to build on it? This does not seem consistent.Here is where I am consistent: I believe the government should protect our property rights, but I don’t consider words on paper property.That is your opinion. Why is it not protected like property forever?Just because someone drives someone out of business does not make that person a monopoly. Even if a person were to drive EVERYONE out of that business, does not mean the monopoly will be permanent. I agree that is what the law says. The whole point to this discussion is that I don’t believe the law should say this.The people that may be wrong are the ones with a vested interest in it. I have taken some Business Law Classes. I have also taken some RE Law classes.Again, it is the law I question.Monty, that is the best argument for patents, copyrights and trademarks. I was wondering when you would bring that up. Let me ask you a question: Recently pharmaceutical companies have been wanting to extend the length of a patent from 17 to 20 years. They claim that it would bring down the price of drugs. What do you think? I would rather see a five year patent that raising it to 20 or 50 years.This is what can be proved: Some hundred years or so after the breakup of Standard Oil, we are still driving to the supermarket using petroleum products. It would be likely that if gas prices were higher, alternative forms of energy would be used.IBM basically had sales people that helped train employees how to use their equipment. It was quite an operation. With Windows you could train a monkey to use a computer. You missed my point: Sometimes innovation can ONLY occur only if prices are increased because of a monopoly. If you try to keep prices permanently down with laws and regulation, we may not see the INOVATION. Why innovate?I am far to the left with regards to personal freedom. We have something in common.I prefer the local level.We will never know because they are broken apart. That is why I brought the IBM example up: Before the suit was settled it became apparent they did not have a monopoly. The suit was just dropped.Thanks for the discussion Monty. I am afraid this could go on forever. If you want to cut the discussion shorter just answer this one question: If copyrights ect are property, then why shouldn’t people be allowed to keep them forever, or do you advocate that?Also, thanks for keeping the discussion civil. It is a plessure.

I am not wrong. Just because you offer an opinion that ideas aren't property doesn't negate the consensus of law-making bodies the world over that such things are property, and therefore should be protected. It is odd way to say 'no it isn't' and insist then that that rebuttal has destroyed my argument. I cited many a law sites that deal with it. If you want to actually offer why you feel it should not be protected, please do so. You've had several days to offer this, but the best offered is your repeating of a previously stated opinion.Yes, I know you don't. I don't know 'why' you don't other than 'just because'.Why? That is because it has been legislated like that. Even property has protection that is not absolute. Property can be acquired by the government for the 'national interest'. There are rules that allow police to enter your property, even should you not want them there - such as when they have probable cause.What rights are defined, or rather, how they defined is really a matter for government. That they are defined in different ways still does not negate that they offer protection.These are two different statements.If someone drove every competitor out of business, and their own business continued, that is a monopoly, because it is so defined.That a monopoly, un-hampered by government regulations (including regulations towards would-be competitors) would or would not last forever is the heart of your argument. You assume that it wouldn't based on an as yet ill-defined reason. It's not been tested - as far as I know. You've certainly offered no evidence of known cases. But then it's a very difficult proposition for you to prove.Yes, again I know you don't. Why?If I write a book, why should I not be able to prevent you making a movie from it without proper compensation to me? I would equally be intrigued to learn if you pirate movies and music - why, or why not? You certainly argue a case that can be construed as being pro-product piracy.Yes, the people who's rights are protected have a vested interest. You have a vested interest in your own property being protected.Cool. You probably have more formal qualifications than I do; in regards to law.Good. But why? Also, you would need to tie this back into your 'monopolies' argument as we're both guilty of being side-trackedI have no opinion on the actual length of a patent. I have stated that property should be protected, but have also given examples where this is not an absolute right. A case in South Africa was finished recently where people sought to have vital AIDS-fighting drugs manufactured without recourse to patented laws - because the drugs were deemed to be needed right away. I can certainly see that this justifies a waiving of patent protection. Does this mean I want all patent laws removed? No.(see http://www.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/africa...safrica.drugs/)This argument makes no sense. Of course we are still using oil. But how does that relate to your idea about a monopoly not lasting? Dependence on a product distributed by several organisations doesn't seem to prove anything about your case.In fact, it's just reminded me of a near-monopoly that has lasted some time; OPEC. Though I don't know how to work this into an argument, yet :) as I've got to research their status.Sure, but IBM use Microsoft. They aren't in competition. It's like saying that every Ford car gets Goodyear tyres (that's spelled tires in the USA :)). This doesn't make them competitors. It would if Ford made tyres, or Goodyear made cars.Why? To increase profits.Cool. I am, however exceptionally conservative on moral issues -though too often breaking my own rules.In Australia we are more a centralised government. For instance police aren't at local level, but state and federal. I believe you have local school boards, we don't. In fact, all local governments could be swept out of existence at the whim of a state government. State governments can change local council borders, suspend councils etc. The only reason that they don't do so all the time is because people like their councils (in general) and would tend to punish such a government at the electoral box.I think in general the concentration of power is a bad thing - even for a short while (perhaps in times of war, it might be necessary), and economic power is no exception.You've caught me on the hop! I believe in property protection, but I've not ever thought about how long it should be protected for - it's something I've never thought about. That's what I'll do. If I remember, I'll ask some people at work. A lady I worked with has actually specialised in intellectual property, but she's not responded to my e-mails for some months. I guess I'll see what happens.Most people wouldn't think so, but it is what I aim to do - exchange ideas. I tend though to fight fire with fire, and you've not been insulting. Your post has now prompted me into thinking about something I've never really considered.

Just because there is a law, does not mean I support it. You ask why I don’t think there should not be patent laws: This law has the effect raising the cost of goods. Why drop Anti-trust cases then (Like IBM)?That right is only as good as the money you have to protect it.I didn’t say MS was a competitor. That is why I like power given to local authorities. One sweeping law for the whole state or country is not always best.You are an incredibly nice person. I do have an analogy for the length of property rights. I guess you could consider it a lease. People lease a right to a patent etc.Let me explain my position of patents etc.:Right now many people in the US are complaining about the high cost of prescription drugs. The drug companies have a patent on their products, and can charge whatever they want. Of course, the best argument for patents is the reason you gave: Why research new drugs if someone can just copy it? I contend these researchers would continue to work, but make less money (I doubt they would all become greeters at Wal-Mart). They would have to change the way they distribute drugs. The same goes for movies. The movie stars would be paid far less and distribution may change.Going back to pharmaceutical drugs: In the US many advocate the government picking up the cost of the drugs. That is the last thing I want to see happen. Others advocate price controls. If you advocate price controls, why even offer a patent on the product? What is happening here? IMHO, we tinkered with the free market by allowing patents. Now we blame the free market for the high cost of goods. IMHO, all laws hurt poor people. The patent laws drive up the price of goods, because those with the patent can charge what they want. The free market is not functioning.We discussed two items here Monty: One was Anti-Trust Laws, and the other was Patent Laws. Can you tell I don’t favor many laws?

I have stated that property should be protected, but have also given examples where this is not an absolute right. A case in South Africa was finished recently where people sought to have vital AIDS-fighting drugs manufactured without recourse to patented laws - because the drugs were deemed to be needed right away. I can certainly see that this justifies a waiving of patent protection. Does this mean I want all patent laws removed? No.(see http://www.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/africa...safrica.drugs/)This argument makes no sense. Of course we are still using oil. But how does that relate to your idea about a monopoly not lasting? Dependence on a product distributed by several organisations doesn't seem to prove anything about your case.In fact, it's just reminded me of a near-monopoly that has lasted some time; OPEC. Though I don't know how to work this into an argument, yet :) as I've got to research their status.Sure, but IBM use Microsoft. They aren't in competition. It's like saying that every Ford car gets Goodyear tyres (that's spelled tires in the USA :)). This doesn't make them competitors. It would if Ford made tyres, or Goodyear made cars.Why? To increase profits.Cool. I am, however exceptionally conservative on moral issues -though too often breaking my own rules.In Australia we are more a centralised government. For instance police aren't at local level, but state and federal. I believe you have local school boards, we don't. In fact, all local governments could be swept out of existence at the whim of a state government. State governments can change local council borders, suspend councils etc. The only reason that they don't do so all the time is because people like their councils (in general) and would tend to punish such a government at the electoral box.I think in general the concentration of power is a bad thing - even for a short while (perhaps in times of war, it might be necessary), and economic power is no exception.You've caught me on the hop! I believe in property protection, but I've not ever thought about how long it should be protected for - it's something I've never thought about. That's what I'll do. If I remember, I'll ask some people at work. A lady I worked with has actually specialised in intellectual property, but she's not responded to my e-mails for some months. I guess I'll see what happens.Most people wouldn't think so, but it is what I aim to do - exchange ideas. I tend though to fight fire with fire, and you've not been insulting. Your post has now prompted me into thinking about something I've never really considered.

No one says you must. But I would like to know why you support one lot of property laws, and not another, and the following doesn't answer it...This then would be across the board, regardless of the property in question. But you're not against laws of real and personal property.I don't know why your government did. It is not uncommon in the application of laws that prosecutors drop cases - this doesn't mean that they believe the parties are innocent - often they do so for reasons of resources.This statement is rather troubling. Does this mean that you don't support laws that protect real property?I'm sorry, you have me confused. You say that the monopoly of IBM was stopped by a non-competitor?All systems made by man have faults.[quote=Montalban]You've caught me on the hop!

Just because there is a law, does not mean I support it. You ask why I don’t think there should not be patent laws: This law has the effect raising the cost of goods. Why drop Anti-trust cases then (Like IBM)?That right is only as good as the money you have to protect it.I didn’t say MS was a competitor. That is why I like power given to local authorities. One sweeping law for the whole state or country is not always best.You are an incredibly nice person. I do have an analogy for the length of property rights. I guess you could consider it a lease. People lease a right to a patent etc.Let me explain my position of patents etc.:Right now many people in the US are complaining about the high cost of prescription drugs. The drug companies have a patent on their products, and can charge whatever they want. Of course, the best argument for patents is the reason you gave: Why research new drugs if someone can just copy it? I contend these researchers would continue to work, but make less money (I doubt they would all become greeters at Wal-Mart). They would have to change the way they distribute drugs. The same goes for movies. The movie stars would be paid far less and distribution may change.Going back to pharmaceutical drugs: In the US many advocate the government picking up the cost of the drugs. That is the last thing I want to see happen. Others advocate price controls. If you advocate price controls, why even offer a patent on the product? What is happening here? IMHO, we tinkered with the free market by allowing patents. Now we blame the free market for the high cost of goods. IMHO, all laws hurt poor people. The patent laws drive up the price of goods, because those with the patent can charge what they want. The free market is not functioning.We discussed two items here Monty: One was Anti-Trust Laws, and the other was Patent Laws. Can you tell I don’t favor many laws?

http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/95psa.htmlI thought this essay was fairly interesting.*But there are quite a few cases in which patents have been used to suppress innovation (Dunford 1987). Companies may take out a patent, or buy someone else's patent, in order to inhibit others from applying the ideas. For example, from its beginning in 1875, the US company AT&T collected patents in order to ensure its monopoly on telephones. It slowed down the introduction of radio for some 20 years. In a similar fashion, General Electric used control of patents to retard the introduction of fluorescent lights, which were a threat to its market of incandescent lights.*One of the newest areas to be classified as intellectual property is biological information. US courts have ruled that genetic sequences can be patented, even when the sequences are found "in nature," so long as some artificial means are involved in isolating them. This has led companies to race to take out patents on numerous genetic codes. In some cases, patents have been granted covering all transgenic forms of an entire species, such as soybeans or cotton (Mestel 1994). One consequence is a severe inhibition on research by non-patent holders. Another consequence is that transnational corporations are patenting genetic materials found in Third World plants and animals, so that some Third World peoples actually have to pay to use seeds and other genetic materials that have been freely available to them for centuries (Shiva and Holla-Bhar 1993).*The potential financial returns from intellectual property are said to provide an incentive for individuals to create. In practice, though, most creators do not actually gain much benefit from intellectual property. Independent inventors are frequently ignored or exploited (Lancaster 1992). When employees of corporations and governments have an idea worth protecting, it is usually copyrighted or patented by the organisation, not the employee. Since intellectual property can be sold, it is usually the rich and powerful who benefit. The rich and powerful, it should be noted, seldom contribute much intellectual labour to the creation of new ideas. Note: Look at Telsa, and Edison...you'll understand.*A second major argument for intellectual property is that people deserve property rights because of their labour. This brings up the general issue of what people deserve, a topic that has been analysed by philosophers. Their usual conclusions go against what many people think is "common sense." Hettinger says that a fitting reward for labour should be proportionate to the person's effort, the risk taken and moral considerations. This sounds all right--but it is not proportionate to the value of the results of the labour, whether assessed through markets or by other criteria. This is because the value of intellectual work is affected by things not controlled by the worker, including luck and natural talent. Hettinger says "A person who is born with extraordinary natural talents, or who is extremely lucky, deserves nothing on the basis of these characteristics" (p. 42).*Another example is scientific knowledge. Scientists do research and then publish their results. A large fraction of scientific knowledge is public knowledge (Ziman 1968). There are some areas of science that are not public, such as classified military research. It is generally argued that the most dynamic parts of science are those with the least secrecy. Open ideas can be examined, challenged, modified and improved. To turn scientific knowledge into a commodity on the market, as is happening with genetic engineering (Mackenzie et al. 1990; Weiner 1986), arguably inhibits science.*The case of science shows that vigorous intellectual activity is quite possible without intellectual property, and in fact that it may be vigorous precisely because information is not owned. But there are lots of areas that, unlike science, have long operated with intellectual property as a fact of life. What would happen without ownership of information? Many objections spring to mind. Here I'll deal with a few of them.Plagiarism is a great fear in the minds of many intellectual workers. It is often thought that intellectual property provides a protection against plagiarism. After all, without copyright, why couldn't someone put their name on your essay and publish it? Actually, copyright provides very little protection against plagiarism and is not a good way to deal with it (Stearns 1992).Plagiarism means using the ideas of others without adequate acknowledgement. There are several types of plagiarism. One is plagiarism of ideas: someone takes your original idea and, using different expression, presents it as their own. Copyright provides no protection at all against this form of plagiarism. Another type of plagiarism is word-for-word plagiarism, where someone takes the words you've written--a book, an essay, a few paragraphs or even just a sentence--and, with or without minor modifications, presents them as their own. This sort of plagiarism is covered by copyright--assuming that you hold the copyright. In many cases, copyright is held by the publisher, not the author. In practice, plagiarism goes on all the time, in various ways and degrees (Broad and Wade 1982; Mallon 1989; Posner 1988), and copyright law is hardly ever used against it. The most effective challenge to plagiarism is not legal action but publicity. At least among authors, plagiarism is widely condemned. To be exposed as a plagiarist is more than sufficient motivation for most writers to take care to avoid it.*What about all the writers, inventors and others who depend for their livelihood on royalties? First, it should be mentioned that only a very few individuals make enough money from royalties to live on. Most of the rewards from intellectual property go to a few big companies. But the question is still a serious one for those intellectual workers who depend on royalties and other payments related to intellectual property.The alternative in this case is some reorganisation of the economic system. Intellectual workers could receive a salary, just like most scientists do.But what about the incentive to create? Without the possibility of wealth and fame, what would stimulate creative individuals to produce works of genius? Actually, most creators and innovators are motivated by their own intrinsic interest, not by rewards. There is a large body of evidence showing, contrary to popular opinion, that rewards actually reduce the quality of work (Kohn 1993). If the goal is better and more creative work, paying creators on a piecework basis, such as through royalties, is counterproductive.

Not nescessarily. Whether or not the publication company has rights to his writing, is perhaps in question. Many companies require that they acquire some/most rights to a writer efforts, as I'm assuming in those cases. Regardless, the ideas aren't invalid in face of any actions committed by it's author (even though I would assume there are none). So in the effort to retain some focus, let's stay to the point, and not fixate on it's creator.Are his points invalid, that is the question? Generally speaking, I think intellectual rights are taken to an extreme. Given they were limited to a short-term of time, I wouldn't have many or any objections. That isn't the case, and it's undenialable that certain technologies/inventions have been swept under the rug because of it.

Monty, I do think that Real Property and Personal Property should be protected.But: Intellectual Property is usually protected by civil lawsuits. For instance the RIAA is going after Pirates civilly. Some trademarks are protected using government force, but most are in investigated at first privately. Can you imagine the government bureaucracy that would be required to go after every music pirate criminally, investigators, prosecutors and such? This is why I say that patents, trademarks and copyrights are only as good as the money you have to protect them.

HUH? Copywrites and patents are pretty much the same thing, a protection of intellectual property. I would hate it if I invented something that everyone could use, put my time and money into it, only to have everyone copy it, and I would never see a dime.

; )I do not believe in copyrights, and I can understand peoples sentiments against them. I do not perceive them to be an individual right. At what point do you deem them a monopoly? When it's a 100% of the market in a town, region or country? I don't believe there's ever been one (devoid of government funds/support) that encompassed the country.Objectivist at one point. Libertarian, I don't know.He's leaving soon. He's been there twenty odd years, and he said to some degree that he doesn't know how to do his job. It's odd that no one wants to faze out this monopoly.

PNAC, that is the best argument IMHO in favor of these "protections".I saw this in Ricks Post, I thought it may address your question.

Even libertarians must keep in mind the existence of natural monopolies, that is, monopolies such as power plants, roads, etc. that can not be efficient and competitive at the same time. I personally believe that these monopolies should be state-owned, and these should be the only state-owned businesses, and the private sector should encompass all that is competitive.

That's not the case. The less laws, the more large combinations will combine reducing competition - and even if they don't combine in a real sense - such as a merger, they will collude to price fix.Unrestrained capitalism is a beast that will eat itself.

I don't consider them natural, and I don't want them owned by the state. BUT, I don't want multiple power lines run all around the county for seperate carriers. I will accept a few monopolies (utilities). That is my opinion.
