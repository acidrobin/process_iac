He's made a step in the right direction..going from believing there is none to believing there is a supreme being.I'm not sure what your think my God is, but I will say that I do not hold all the beliefs of a staunch Baptist. I suppose the closest quick descriptor would be that of a clockmaker God..one who started all this mess and sits back to watch it happen...allows evolution to take its course, even though He does already know what the course will be. He doesn't control my every move. I suppose I'm not really that far away from Mr Slew. It's simply refreshing to hear that a relatively intelligent man has changed his mind...and come closer to what I believe. That's all....and I don't consider it a victory because I haven't put forth any effort to change his mind. It affects me very little what he thinks.

He has also admitted his 'conversion' came because of a lack of knowledge when it comes to certain biological concepts, and that he was mislead about the current state of knowledge about it. He also admits he is does not have the energy to investicate it further himself.

Agreed. There's no way around it; Flew is no longer an atheist. What is most interesting however, is that he came to the belief in God because of scientific evidence. Christian scientists have been saying the same thing for years, but are often ridiculed for it by atheists in the scientific community.

http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/09/op...09gumucio.htmlDecember 9, 2005Op-Ed ContributorSeñora Presidente? By RAFAEL GUMUCIOSantiago, ChileCHILE is one of the more conservative countries on a continent that is not especially renowned as tolerant, forward thinking or democratically minded. Divorce was legalized here just last year, and abortion continues to be a taboo subject even for the most progressive of politicians. Our social codes and racial prejudices are deeply engrained. We are an overwhelmingly Catholic country with a history that has been marked - and continues to be marked - by the power of its military.Given this context, it is nothing short of extraordinary - even revolutionary - that the clear front-runner in the presidential vote being held on Sunday is Michelle Bachelet, a divorced mother of three who is an atheist and a member of the Socialist Party. Polls show Ms. Bachelet, a former defense minister, far ahead of her rivals, Sebastián Piñera, one of Chile's wealthiest businessmen; Joaquín Lavín, the ultraconservative former mayor of Santiago; and Tomás Hirsch of the Communist Party. Although a runoff is likely, the prevailing opinion here is that Ms. Bachelet will be the ultimate winner. If she is, she will be the first woman in the Americas to be elected president not because she was a wife of a famous politician, but because of her own record. That this is a probability is even more astonishing when one considers that nothing like it has occurred in countries like the United States or France, where the democratic tradition is far more stable and feminism's impact presumably far greater. Curiously, American television is now running a series that revolves around the "novel" idea of a female president. What is fiction in the United States may well become reality in Chile. The twist is that the Chilean candidate is a far more interesting character than the female president portrayed on American TV: as defense minister, Ms. Bachelet oversaw the successors and subordinates of the men who killed her father and tortured her and her mother during the darkest moments of the dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet. How has this happened? Chile, more than ever, is proving itself to be the polar opposite of Lampedusa's Sicily: in order for things to change, they have to stay the same - or rather, they have to look as if they are staying the same. That is the best way I can describe the spirit with which the country seems to be anticipating the elections: people are aware that no matter what the outcome an unprecedented cultural, political and social revolution is taking place. And at the same time, they seem surprisingly unfazed by it all, observing these sweeping changes with ease, aplomb, even delight.Perhaps this is because Chileans have by now grown accustomed to wild fluctuations in the country's political fortunes. This past year, the Chilean people saw rightist leaders - until recently General Pinochet's staunchest allies - renouncing all ties to him. General Pinochet is now under house arrest, held not only on human rights charges but also for his alleged role in a financial scandal involving millions of stolen dollars.In countless other ways, the Pandora's box of Chilean politics has been flung wide open: nowadays it isn't at all strange to see an ultraconservative Catholic candidate signing his name on a transvestite's legs as a publicity stunt, nor is it odd to hear Ms. Bachelet talk about how hard it is to find Mr. Right.For decades, even centuries, Chilean politics have largely been of the old-boy's-network variety, in which an all-male group of power brokers have run things on their own terms, within a select inner circle, forging alliances with one another and making deals with the press behind closed doors, far removed from the citizenry they represent. Change in Chile has come at a breakneck pace in recent years, as justice is finally being delivered to dozens of dictatorship-era cronies, and the pillars of the church and the political elite have been shaken to their foundations by a wave of pedophilia scandals involving both.The changes are abrupt and the contradictions are evident. Thanks to the country's growing economy, Chileans have access to more creature comforts than ever before, and yet prosperity somehow hasn't dulled their sensibilities: the populace that benefits from free-market economics also turned out in droves to pay tribute to Gladys Marín, the president of the Communist Party, when her coffin was carried through the streets of Santiago in March. People may be gulping down Starbucks and coveting iPods, but they are also devouring highly irreverent political magazines like The Clinic (for which I write) and flocking to politically oriented movies like "Machuca," which is about the 1973 coup led by General Pinochet. Some analysts think that the free-market economy is responsible for this unprecedented change in Chile's political and social landscape. But other countries that follow that economic model (Indonesia, Malaysia and the United States), seem to be slouching in the opposite direction toward a retrograde, hard-line conservatism. Economics, then, clearly do not tell the entire story.Other analysts attribute the change to the current president, Ricardo Lagos, who has concentrated on reconciling Chile with its tortured past. Even so the general consensus is that nobody - not Mr. Lagos, not the Chilean intelligentsia, and certainly not the power elite - was prepared for the seismic social and political shift represented by Ms. Bachelet's thriving candidacy. I don't think anyone would have predicted 10 years ago that we would ever arrive at this moment, but it seems that Chile is eager to usher it in. For us, political and economic stability - despite being so recent and so precious - is not enough.Just as in 1970, when they went to the polls and elected a Socialist president, and again in 1988, when they rejected their dictator, Chileans have proved themselves to be far more daring with their vote than their lifestyles.Perhaps this is because when they vote - in secret, where nobody can judge or criticize them - they reveal their truest colors, their passion for change, for improvisation and for leadership in a world that seems hell-bent on moving in the opposite direction.

The funny thing, Trebor, is that you have no idea what it is based on. You've read an atheist's article on it saying he hasn't kept up with recent theories in science. In that case, do you and other atheists concede that, up until a few years ago (maximum), it appeared that, by all logical accounts, theists had been right all along? I'm sure you don't. But why? Well, basically because you don't really know anything about any of the theories you are discussing. This is the problem with caring about "big minds" and their theoretical swervings: unless you read the books and do the research, you have no grounds to make informed judgments. This is why I posted a major philosopher who became a theist's book, so that people on this forum can make their own decisions. Will anyone read it? Almost certainly not. Why? Because most people here are lazy and aren't really here to experience new ideas.

You are too easily refreshed. Flew is not a biologist, and his assertion that "biologists' investigation of DNA has shown, by the almost unbelievable complexity of the arrangements which are needed to produce (life), that intelligence must have been involved" is one that many biologists would challenge. Essentially, all Flew has concluded is that some Great Unknown Thing is responsible for the existence of life and the universe; and in common with most cultures throughout history he has named that Great Unknown Thing god.Even if we were to accept this reasoning, the GUT that Flew envisages is a million light years from the anthropomorphic and anthropocentric tyrant-father invoked by the Middle Eastern monotheisms. He has conspicuously omitted from his statements any notion that it is interested in (or even aware of) humankind, let alone that it requires our worship. He does not, you will note, believe in an afterlife.Professor Flew is entitled to his opinions, as are we all; and his assertion that the level of complexity observed in living organisms requires a non-naturalistic explanation is just that - his opinion. That said, any christian crowing over Flew's 'conversion' is clutching at a pretty slender straw.

This is a refreshing note. Another one bites the dust!http://www.ajc.com/news/content/news...nid=amn120905eRenowned atheist says he believes in GodAssociated PressPublished on: 12/09/05 NEW YORK — A British philosophy professor who has been a leading champion of atheism for more than a half-century has changed his mind. He now believes in God based on scientific evidence, and says so on a video released Thursday. At age 81, after decades of insisting belief is a mistake, Antony Flew has concluded that some sort of intelligence or first cause must have created the universe. A super-intelligence is the only good explanation for the origin of life and the complexity of nature, Flew said in a telephone interview from England.Flew said he's best labeled a deist like Thomas Jefferson, whose God was not actively involved in people's lives."I'm thinking of a God very different from the God of the Christian and far and away from the God of Islam, because both are depicted as omnipotent Oriental despots, cosmic Saddam Husseins," he said. "It could be a person in the sense of a being that has intelligence and a purpose, I suppose."Flew first made his mark with the 1950 article "Theology and Falsification," based on a paper for the Socratic Club, a weekly Oxford religious forum led by writer and Christian thinker C.S. Lewis.Over the years, Flew proclaimed the lack of evidence for God while teaching at Oxford, Aberdeen, Keele, and Reading universities in Britain, in visits to numerous U.S. and Canadian campuses and in books, articles, lectures and debates.There was no one moment of change but a gradual conclusion over recent months for Flew, a spry man who still does not believe in an afterlife.Yet biologists' investigation of DNA "has shown, by the almost unbelievable complexity of the arrangements which are needed to produce (life), that intelligence must have been involved," Flew says in the new video, "Has Science Discovered God?"The video draws from a New York discussion last May organized by author Roy Abraham Varghese's Institute for Metascientific Research in Garland, Texas. Participants were Flew; Varghese; Israeli physicist Gerald Schroeder, an Orthodox Jew; and Roman Catholic philosopher John Haldane of Scotland's University of St. Andrews.The first hint of Flew's turn was a letter to the August-September issue of Britain's Philosophy Now magazine. "It has become inordinately difficult even to begin to think about constructing a naturalistic theory of the evolution of that first reproducing organism," he wrote.The letter commended arguments in Schroeder's "The Hidden Face of God" and "The Wonder of the World" by Varghese, an Eastern Rite Catholic layman.This week, Flew finished writing the first formal account of his new outlook for the introduction to a new edition of his "God and Philosophy," scheduled for release next year by Prometheus Press.Prometheus specializes in skeptical thought, but if his belief upsets people, well "that's too bad," Flew said. "My whole life has been guided by the principle of Plato's Socrates: Follow the evidence, wherever it leads."Last week, Richard Carrier, a writer and Columbia University graduate student, posted new material based on correspondence with Flew on the atheistic www.infidels.org Web page. Carrier assured atheists that Flew accepts only a "minimal God" and believes in no afterlife.Flew's "name and stature are big. Whenever you hear people talk about atheists, Flew always comes up," Carrier said. Still, when it comes to Flew's reversal, "apart from curiosity, I don't think it's like a big deal."Flew told The Associated Press his current ideas have some similarity with American "intelligent design" theorists, who see evidence for a guiding force in the construction of the universe. He accepts Darwinian evolution but doubts it can explain the ultimate origins of life.A Methodist minister's son, Flew became an atheist at 15.Early in his career, he argued that no conceivable events could constitute proof against God for believers, so skeptics were right to wonder whether the concept of God meant anything at all.Another landmark was his 1984 "The Presumption of Atheism," playing off the presumption of innocence in criminal law. Flew said the debate over God must begin by presuming atheism, putting the burden of proof on those arguing that God exists.

I'm not clutching or crowing. I'm simply pleased everytime I hear that another atheist has changed his/her mind about the existence of a supreme being. He did that...I posted it...a discussion followed.I read that he didn't believe in the afterlife, Jesus, worship etc...but that does not change the fact that he no longer believes there is no god.

He has conspicuously omitted from his statements any notion that it is interested in (or even aware of) humankind, let alone that it requires our worship. He does not, you will note, believe in an afterlife.Professor Flew is entitled to his opinions, as are we all; and his assertion that the level of complexity observed in living organisms requires a non-naturalistic explanation is just that - his opinion. That said, any christian crowing over Flew's 'conversion' is clutching at a pretty slender straw.

I got through the first three chapters. He appears to hide behind vagueness, profoundness and impossible scenarios rather than present a substantial argument. I think he is pseudo-intellectual rather than the real thing.It's good to hear he has become a theist though.

The funny thing, Trebor, is that you have no idea what it is based on. You've read an atheist's article on it saying he hasn't kept up with recent theories in science. In that case, do you and other atheists concede that, up until a few years ago (maximum), it appeared that, by all logical accounts, theists had been right all along? I'm sure you don't. But why? Well, basically because you don't really know anything about any of the theories you are discussing. This is the problem with caring about "big minds" and their theoretical swervings: unless you read the books and do the research, you have no grounds to make informed judgments. This is why I posted a major philosopher who became a theist's book, so that people on this forum can make their own decisions. Will anyone read it? Almost certainly not. Why? Because most people here are lazy and aren't really here to experience new ideas.

You were crowing a bit. What I don't understand is why. How could you possibly be pleased by some strangers religious views. Would you have been pleased if he switched to liking broccoli? (Or disliking as the case may be)

I'm not clutching or crowing. I'm simply pleased everytime I hear that another atheist has changed his/her mind about the existence of a supreme being. He did that...I posted it...a discussion followed.I read that he didn't believe in the afterlife, Jesus, worship etc...but that does not change the fact that he no longer believes there is no god.

Well, I applaud your attempt nevertheless; I'm not sure how readily I would be to read such a recommendation. I have no special claim to power, and thus there is no reason for a person to read my recommendations particularly. For that I thank you.However, I have to say that your description of Chesterton is far off of the truth. He doesn't hide behind vagueness at all, but illustrates his thoughts to the best of his ability (which, if understood, are quite brilliant). Vagueness is one of the attributes which he rightly ascribes to many of the philosophers of his age (and other ages). I have my doubts as to how carefully you engaged yourself in the reading if you believe he “hides” behind anything. The work really needs to be read and engaged in slowly and thoughtfully to be properly understood and appreciated. I have to recommend getting through the first four or five chapters, slowly – but again, your efforts are more than most, if not all, on this forum.

Except, of course, it isn't based on reasoning and science. It is based on misinformation, and personal incredibility.

If you want to call it crowing, go right ahead. I do not agree. There is a difference between crowing and attempting to start a revealing dialogue...and naturally, I am, as most likely are, pleased to find when others agree philosophically. His turning to believe is only slightly more significant to me than whether he likes broccoli or not. I really don't care that much about either and would crow about neither. I just thought it would make an interesting thread....and it has.

This is a refreshing note. Another one bites the dust!http://www.ajc.com/news/content/news...nid=amn120905eRenowned atheist says he believes in GodAssociated PressPublished on: 12/09/05 NEW YORK — A British philosophy professor who has been a leading champion of atheism for more than a half-century has changed his mind. He now believes in God based on scientific evidence, and says so on a video released Thursday. At age 81, after decades of insisting belief is a mistake, Antony Flew has concluded that some sort of intelligence or first cause must have created the universe. A super-intelligence is the only good explanation for the origin of life and the complexity of nature, Flew said in a telephone interview from England.Flew said he's best labeled a deist like Thomas Jefferson, whose God was not actively involved in people's lives."I'm thinking of a God very different from the God of the Christian and far and away from the God of Islam, because both are depicted as omnipotent Oriental despots, cosmic Saddam Husseins," he said. "It could be a person in the sense of a being that has intelligence and a purpose, I suppose."Flew first made his mark with the 1950 article "Theology and Falsification," based on a paper for the Socratic Club, a weekly Oxford religious forum led by writer and Christian thinker C.S. Lewis.Over the years, Flew proclaimed the lack of evidence for God while teaching at Oxford, Aberdeen, Keele, and Reading universities in Britain, in visits to numerous U.S. and Canadian campuses and in books, articles, lectures and debates.There was no one moment of change but a gradual conclusion over recent months for Flew, a spry man who still does not believe in an afterlife.Yet biologists' investigation of DNA "has shown, by the almost unbelievable complexity of the arrangements which are needed to produce (life), that intelligence must have been involved," Flew says in the new video, "Has Science Discovered God?"The video draws from a New York discussion last May organized by author Roy Abraham Varghese's Institute for Metascientific Research in Garland, Texas. Participants were Flew; Varghese; Israeli physicist Gerald Schroeder, an Orthodox Jew; and Roman Catholic philosopher John Haldane of Scotland's University of St. Andrews.The first hint of Flew's turn was a letter to the August-September issue of Britain's Philosophy Now magazine. "It has become inordinately difficult even to begin to think about constructing a naturalistic theory of the evolution of that first reproducing organism," he wrote.The letter commended arguments in Schroeder's "The Hidden Face of God" and "The Wonder of the World" by Varghese, an Eastern Rite Catholic layman.This week, Flew finished writing the first formal account of his new outlook for the introduction to a new edition of his "God and Philosophy," scheduled for release next year by Prometheus Press.Prometheus specializes in skeptical thought, but if his belief upsets people, well "that's too bad," Flew said. "My whole life has been guided by the principle of Plato's Socrates: Follow the evidence, wherever it leads."Last week, Richard Carrier, a writer and Columbia University graduate student, posted new material based on correspondence with Flew on the atheistic www.infidels.org Web page. Carrier assured atheists that Flew accepts only a "minimal God" and believes in no afterlife.Flew's "name and stature are big. Whenever you hear people talk about atheists, Flew always comes up," Carrier said. Still, when it comes to Flew's reversal, "apart from curiosity, I don't think it's like a big deal."Flew told The Associated Press his current ideas have some similarity with American "intelligent design" theorists, who see evidence for a guiding force in the construction of the universe. He accepts Darwinian evolution but doubts it can explain the ultimate origins of life.A Methodist minister's son, Flew became an atheist at 15.Early in his career, he argued that no conceivable events could constitute proof against God for believers, so skeptics were right to wonder whether the concept of God meant anything at all.Another landmark was his 1984 "The Presumption of Atheism," playing off the presumption of innocence in criminal law. Flew said the debate over God must begin by presuming atheism, putting the burden of proof on those arguing that God exists.

1. Christianity and the Bible have nothing to do with this. The fact that they have been brought up is a result of snarling atheists that feel threatened by one of their champions turning to theism.2. The trillion sided dice argument is not the same argument. The point is that only one side of the dice would have produced life, hence if any of the other sides had landed, this debate would not be possible.I don't particularly care about Flew or what he thinks. But the reaction that atheists have had to his changing of heart is quite interesting, if not downright humorous.

From this thread:If you are referring to the "trillion sided dice" argument as posited by Adept, then you are correct: it was a straw man and I tore it down rather easily.What Flew believes is irrelevant, agreed. However, the fact that you know what Flew's argument is because you "read several articles where it was discussed" is like claiming to comprehend Christianity after skimming a few pages of the Bible, or quantum physics after reading a physics book's table of contents. But, instead of ignoring the clearly bolded question in that post, how about you answer it, thereby proving you do understand Flew's argument. Because if your answer is anything but yes, then clearly you do not, because the scientific "proofs" that refute it did not exist up until a few years ago.

Anthony Flew now admits that he was misled about the origin of life, by Gerald Shroeder, who isn’t even a biologist. Flew himself is largely to blame for being misled because he uncritically listened to only one side of the story, accepting it at face value.Further, Flew’s conception of ‘God’ would not be that of Christianity, Islam, or any such religion, but rather the God of the deists.

A few patients actually flew over that cuckoo's nest and went on to lead active and productive lives. Not many achieved that through psycho analysis or medication. For reasons I cannot explain, most of the sucessful cases were attributed to "Jesus" or "God." They found religion.

On the contrary, it is testable. You take the number of people who have come out of an alcoholic rehab , and attribute their getting over their addiction to religion. You then do follow up and see how many stay off the addiction compared to the ones that went strictly through the rehabilitation program.I know several people who were alcoholics, and drug addicts that traded the addiction of a physical substance to the addiction of religion. They are still in an addictive life style, but frankly, from a physical/emotional point of view, a religious addiction is healthier for the most part than one to meth or alcohol. It all depends on the degree they indulge in the religious addiction of course.

However, I now have to admit that I thought Trebor was talking about something even more different. When I read Truthsayer’s original paragraphs the first time, I noted several key words/phrases such as “psyche minor”, “ward”, “flew over the cuckoo’s nest”, and “psycho analysis or medication” and the shear weight of them led me to think that he was talking about mental patients in a mental ward. Trebor, on the other hand, was clearly talking about alcoholics. It wasn’t until I just reread the two people's posts back to back that I saw the term "rehab" in both, and figured out that Truthsayer could have meant something other than a mental patients in a mental ward.So now I admit that Trebor's proposal could test the general nature of Truthsayer's rehab claims, but it still could not test his claimed personal experiences, which is what I was actually addressing.

I also don't know if the ones I knew were able to keep off their previous addiction.

No, it couldn't. Tests by different people, after the fact, of different but related phenomena could only show that the claimed personal experiences were reasonable, not that they actually occurred.I could say that I saw my cat claw my mother's couch to shreds. You can do all kinds of observations of cats, their tendency to claw, and so on, but all that would do is show that my claimed personal experience is reasonable, not that it actually occurred. Because, in fact, I don’t have a cat. You couldn’t know that until I told you, so you couldn’t know whether or not my claimed personal experience was true or not.Tell you what. Here are four claims of personal experience for me, concerning yesterday. For each one, tell me whether it actually happened or not, and how you can be sure.A) I claim to have driven my green Honda Civic to the karate dojo to see my two sons earn their orange belts.B) I claim to have eaten a bowl of Coca Crispies cereal, with skim milk, for dinner.C) I claim to have washed a load of cold clothes, using Tide detergent.D) I claim to have watched lecture 12, "When Did the Canon Get Finalized", from "The History of the Bible: The Making of the New Testament Canon" video lecture series I own.Well?Face it, for all practical purposes, no test you can perform on other events - that aren't the events that make up my claimed personal experiences - can confirm or disconfirm any of these claimed personal experiences of mine. Essentially all that such tests could do is determine whether or not the claims are reasonable.And? It's not really testable, in general. I don't know if you are blind: you could be. I don't know if it is raining where you live. I don't know if you didn't wake up until Saturday afternoon. I don't know if there is a vast forest fire around where you live, with the smoke blocking out the sky. Let me turn it around on you.I claim to see a wonderful blue sky this morning. So is that claim of personal experience true or false? Well?Further, the claim you offer is very different from the one Truthsayer put forth. We can assume that all of us have actually seen a wonderful blue morning at some point in our lives, but we can’t safely assume that all of us have worked in rehab center and seen religion cure people.

Well, I didn't work at a rehabilitation center, but I know many people who were addicted that claimed their 'faith' helped them.

Here are four claims of personal experience for me, concerning yesterday. For each one, tell me whether it actually happened or not, and how you can be sure.A) I claim to have driven my green Honda Civic to the karate dojo to see my two sons earn their orange belts.B) I claim to have eaten a bowl of Coca Crispies cereal, with skim milk, for dinner.C) I claim to have washed a load of cold clothes, using Tide detergent.D) I claim to have watched lecture 12, "When Did the Canon Get Finalized", from "The History of the Bible: The Making of the New Testament Canon" video lecture series I own.Well?Face it, for all practical purposes, no test you can perform on other events - that aren't the events that make up my claimed personal experiences - can confirm or disconfirm any of these claimed personal experiences of mine. Essentially all that such tests could do is determine whether or not the claims are reasonable.And? It's not really testable, in general. I don't know if you are blind: you could be. I don't know if it is raining where you live. I don't know if you didn't wake up until Saturday afternoon. I don't know if there is a vast forest fire around where you live, with the smoke blocking out the sky. Let me turn it around on you.I claim to see a wonderful blue sky this morning. So is that claim of personal experience true or false? Well?Further, the claim you offer is very different from the one Truthsayer put forth. We can assume that all of us have actually seen a wonderful blue morning at some point in our lives, but we can’t safely assume that all of us have worked in rehab center and seen religion cure people.

Nope. You didn't understand my original statements, which were directed directly at Truthsayer's past personal experiences. What you proposed wouldn't test that. It's really simple. I am sorry that I am right and you are wrong, but you'll just have to learn to live with it.Even on your own "blue sky" counter, you've as much as admitted defeat. You know you can't test the personal experience claims I stated. That shows me to be right and you to be wrong ... again.Belief in God is needed as a psychological crutch by some; those who aren't mentally strong enough to face reality on its own terms. Even I, at one time, felt I needed God, to get me through my roughest time: now I realize I could have done just as well on my own, without belief in God whatsoever, if I had just been strong enough back then. God did nothing for me; my own psychological state did.

Well, I didn't work at a rehabilitation center, but I know many people who were addicted that claimed their 'faith' helped them. You don't have to beas up close and personal to be able to see the claims.Obviously, you have an axe to grind, because on this subject, you have gone overboard in denial. You are tying to make the observation into something it is not. I hope you are able to get over your problem when it comes to looking at how religion can affect people. (That of course, does not say that any religion is true, but only that religious belief can effect people, and sometimes not negatively).

Thank you. Now I understand the confusion.

Here's some background.Trebor’s proposal doesn’t test Truthsayer’s personal experiences, which is what Truthsayer conveyed. He even said so himself, more than once:andIt is Truthsayer's personal experiences that I and he were referring to. And Trebor’s proposal would neither confirm nor disconfirm Truthsayer’s claimed past personal experiences: all Trebor’s proposal could do, essentially, would be help us decide whether or not Truthsayer’s claims are reasonable: not if they actually happened.Which is why I pointed out that Trebor would be testing something completely different: that is, not the same personal experiences that Truthsayer claims to have had. And why I asked if Trebor claims Truthsayer's past personal experiences are testable, then why does he go on to talk about testing something completely different?******************************PS: That is what I originally meant throughout: I was addressing Truthsayer’s personal experiences, which Trebor’s proposal doesn’t test. However, I now have to admit that I thought Trebor was talking about something even more different. When I read Truthsayer’s original paragraphs the first time, I noted several key words/phrases such as “psyche minor”, “ward”, “flew over the cuckoo’s nest”, and “psycho analysis or medication” and the shear weight of them led me to think that he was talking about mental patients in a mental ward. Trebor, on the other hand, was clearly talking about alcoholics. It wasn’t until I just reread the two people's posts back to back that I saw the term "rehab" in both, and figured out that Truthsayer could have meant something other than a mental patients in a mental ward.So now I admit that Trebor's proposal could test the general nature of Truthsayer's rehab claims, but it still could not test his claimed personal experiences, which is what I was actually addressing.

I understand what DamEtel is saying and I concur. The fact is, nobody knows for sure what any one of us say they have witnessed is a fact or not.No argument there. But, I too, am rather confused why he took that simple fact and made a mountain out of it. But that is what makes the internet forum a unique method of communication I suppose. It takes all types.There are all types of forum posters. The kind that submit controversial articles and endless editorials, yet rarely comment. These people usually are considered instigators and divders, in my opinion.Some posters are just downright raunchy and uncredible.Then there's the lazy ones, like me. I just come and posts thoughts, feeling, and opinions I have accumulated in the course of a lifetime.Certainly, nobody likes to be indirectly be called a liar as DamEtel is doing but the fact does remain that some of us guys just call 'em like we see's 'em. I have no interesting in proving or disproving anything I choose to share with the board. It is what it is. Take it or leave it. I don't care.DamE. Is it your position that there is no room on this forum for unsubstantiated opinion or experiences to be shared by the individual posters and any one doing so has to face your "Heresay! heresay! You could be lying," prove it" rant? Geeze, I hope not.<PS....my work experience was in a state mental hospital and the particular ward I was working on was, in fact, the drug/alcohol rehab unit. Or not...... (hehehehehe)

Thank you. Now I understand the confusion.

That's fine with me. My original point was - and my point still is - simply that what you presented was claimed past personal experience - hearsay, from our point of view, which makes it unreliable and untestable. And you seem to be fine with that: so am I.That Trebor misunderstood me, or wanted to argue against me past the point of reason (as he has done before), and therefore spawned a whole series of unnecessary exchanges, claiming I was wrong when I wasn’t, is his doing, not mine.Nope. Just that such needs to recognized for what it is to us: claimed past personal experiences - hearsay – unreliable and untestable.Switching now to general claim that came up: that religion cures alcoholism. I’ll point out that neither you nor Trebor has yet provided any valid support for such. Where are the controlled experiments published in peer reviewed journals that demonstrate that religion cures alcoholism in a statistically significant way? And from your comment above, you don’t intend to present any, which leaves it to Trebor to do so, if he intends to.

I cannot produce any evidence to support such a claim as I have nothing scientific to offer. Just an observation. The same for the blue sky.The reason I found the higher recovery rate of religion vs. pshchological counciling/medication so strange is because I am not a person who puts much weight into religion. I'm more of a scientific/realist kinda guy. That is why it strikes me as strange. It's all a mental crutch in my opinion. But hey, any port in a storm. Right? Whatever works.emoticonXGoodJust for the heck of it I decided to Google this up to see if there was any other folks out there that had made similar observations as I. Perhaps someone with some credibility. But it dawned on me that I don't know who any of these yahoos are and I haven't a clue as to their credibility. But just for the sake of interest, I'll provide a few links. I am not endorsing any of these sites whatsoever so let's get that straight up front.These people here do not approve of religious indoctrination in drug and alcohol treatment it seems. So much for my "any port in a storm" theory.emoticonXDonno http://casaa.unm.edu/fetz_desc.htmlNo Jesus Juice for these guys either. http://www.positiveatheism.org/rw/alcohol.htmI wonder what could be worse. Being a #### soaked drunk or having to attend this place? http://www.soberliving.com/celebrate-recovery.htmlFAITH AND SOCIAL LIVES"In the Dartmouth heart-surgery study... patients were asked two separate sets of questions about their participation in social groups and the comfort they drew from faith. The two factors appeared to have distinct benefits that made for a powerful combination. Those who were both religious and socially involved had a 14-fold advantage over those who were isolated or lacked faith." (Claudia Wallis, "Faith and Healing," Time Magazine. June 24, 1996.) http://www.foreversober.com/appendix4.cfmPLACEBO EFFECT AND BELIEF"Decades of research show that if a patient truly believes a therapy is useful--even if it is a sugar pill or snake oil--that belief has the power to heal."

Says that port is closed. http://www.aclu.org/religion/govtfun...s20030227.html40 patients admitted to a public substance abuse treatment facility for treatment of alcohol problems who consented to participate were randomized to receive or not receive intercessory prayer (double-blind) by outside volunteers.
