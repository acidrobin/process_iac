Greetings, all. It's been quite some time since I've posted on this forum and it may have been another long while if it weren't for some interesting circumstances in my family. To state it briefly, my sister recently "came out" as a christian in an otherwise atheist family. She did so in letter form and stated her feelings and reasons for her decision. We've all looked at it as an opportunity to open a dialogue about beliefs and reason and what follows is my first response to one of the specific "problems" she assigned to atheism. We've all heard it before: atheism is not a logically defensible position since you must be omnipotent to prove there is no god anywhere in the universe. I know, in the end, that it won't matter what I write to her since reason is typically hopeless if the face of belief, but I thought it would be an interesting exercise to get a little more mileage out of these thoughts on this forum. There's been some editing to protect the innocent, but it's otherwise as I first wrote it...I'll be adding some more to this in the coming couple weeks on the nature of morality and the Meaning of Life (that one should be easy). In the meantime, I hope it's useful to anyone here and I certainly welcome any debate on the topic. Thanks!

Logic of atheism

I'm repeatedly surprised by how many people equate weak atheism with agnosticism. Here's how it works:Strong atheism: "I positively believe that there is no god."Weak atheism: "I lack the belief in a god," or sometimes, "I don't think there is a god."Weak agnosticism: "I don't know if there is a god."Strong agnosticism: "There is no way to know if there is a god." (This one led to the bumper sticker: MILITANT AGNOSTICISM; I don't know, and you don't either.)And liquor. emoticonXHohoThis is indeed the correct rebuttal. You can prove that your sister uses the logic behind the assumption of atheism all the time, be it with leprechauns, invisible pink unicorns (mhhhnbs), Greek gods and godesses, Ahuramazda, and the big head from Star Trek V. She doesn't claim to need omnipotence to reject belief in those entities, so she is committing the fallacy so special pleading with her argument.Those things being said, you must realize: you sister, as well as anyone else, is entitled to her own religious beliefs regardless of how silly they are or how much you object. It's one thing to defend your beliefs, but it's quite another to go on the offensive without an invitation or provocation. While I would love to say at will to Bible-thumpers, "Your beliefs are silly and -- more importantly -- your actions are sometimes detrimental to society," that would reduce me to acting at their level of blind proselytization in violation of one's civil rights. I choose not to stoop that low, and I encourage you to choose the same.

electrolyte:Thanks for the clarification on "weak atheism/agnosticism". I'll make note of it for future explanations.Of course you're right that my sister is entitled to her belief, and I've made every effort to make it clear that I don't wish to criticize her personally for the path she's chosen. What I can comfortably do, though, is to politely address any fallacies she's picked up along her way, without directly challenging her beliefs. For instance, she has also listed the "tornado in a hangar assembling a 747" argument against abiogenesis, which I know was fed to her and to which not one atheist here could resist replying at least, "Umm, not quite..."

Of course, you could also point out that all the pieces of evidence she has 'for' her god, really isn't evidence at all. Most of the evidences I have seen for god either were subjective experiances (I felt the holy spirit .. take your lithum kid).. )< or most often the logal fallacy of personal incredibilty , followed by a statement of iognorance about something.

Despite Trebor's caustic language, he does have a point. The assertion of the religious, if believed by an individual, would be evidence of mental illness. To quote Sam Harris:There are no other circumstances of human belief systems in which we allow such departures from reason, other than religious belief. This is not to say that the religious are mentally ill, but why is it that is exactly how we would label an individual who believes a similar, if unique collection of ideas?? If I told you that Zeus spoke to me after I prayed to him, what would you think of that?

That's a mighty bold statement, thelmoose. Are you sure you want to stick with it?For example: Serial killers have a belief system that requires them to kill, and rapists to do their deeds. Not all these are linked to religion.

Political beliefs also permit a departure from reason. You only have to talk to a BNP member to see that, or watch an Marxist-Leninist (Read: Stalinist) contort themselves while explaining why what Stalin did was ok.

That is quite different. Those belief systems are not sanctioned, they are considered pathological. First, I find it interesting that you use, as examples that are supposed to be comparable to religion, the perverted beliefs of criminals. Those belief systems would be considered a psychiatric pathology, which is exactly the point I was making.

Those may be opinions that are ethically suspect, but they still are confined to the tenets of the rules of the physical world. If they are logically perverse, that can be refuted, and it sounds like you believe they are.

A belief system is just that - a system. It doesn't matter where they come from. That was my point. Besides anything that compares to religion is a religion, imo. Religion in and of itself has nothing to do with Christ. Your statement said, specifically: Religion.I have stated many times here that if a person, be he good or bad or indifferent, lives by a set of beliefs, then that person is religious. Wouldn't you agree?If Zeus talked to you and guided you to a better life, whereby all those you came in contact with profited from it, then I would have to say, "Zeus must be a good god."And if I told you that Christ speaks to me everytime I pray to Him, what would you say?

I wouldn't. You're using two definitions of "religion" interchangeably. Religion (capital R) is inexorably linked to a belief in the supernatural. A religion (small r) is simply what we call a pursuit of something with with very strict, unquestioning adherence - i.e., consumerism or dieting could be considered the "religions" of those who follow them as if they were Religions. They are not the same thing.If I believed Zeus was talking to me, I'd probably be in an institution.

Not particularly, I was just trying to cite examples most people could agree on. I could have pointed to Thatcherite monetarist dogma that left millions unemployed, but too many on the right are still convinced it was "necessary", which would rather have obscured the point I was making.

No, you just don't want to accept the fact that religion has mutated to the point that is only a shadow of what it once was. What is "socially acceptable" now is a system of luxurious values aimed to please the crowd. It's a ploy by those who can't feel God's presence and don't think anyone really does anyway.You would be wrong...but I can't prove it.God was, is, and will always be illogical.

Not necessarily God(s), but very defintinely at least the supernatural. I am using the primary definition found in at least three dictionary sources. Your definition seems unique to yourself. We all make up our own defintions from time to time, which is fine, but your particular version won't have much meaning if you want to get into debates where we all need a level semantic playing field.

It looks like we are struggling to connect on our points, at least I am not quite understanding you. So, I appreciate your interaction and lets leave it at that. Sounds like we agree. Sorta, kinda. I agree that logical proof of God's existence will never be possible and should not be attempted.

Religion was once an honorable system of beliefs based on God and His teachings. It made its way through horrible times, taking root in the foundation of society - the home. It was taught as a direct link to God's plan for mankind, a road map, using the Bible as the sole guide. Then came along those that would distort it, putting to death all those that opposed its teachings, branching off several different ways into denominations or divisions, blantantly ignoring the Gospels. Soon a Christian wasn't a Christian unless he/she followed a certain set of rules, which were established by man, not God.Religion has become similar to what Democrats and Republicans have become - you can't tell what it stands for and when you finally discover it, it changes. To me, at least, it has become a political platform, nothing more.

Sorry, I missed this as your reason why religion has changed. I think you're probably right about how American materialism has corrupted how religion is percieved and propagated in this country. But there are many religions that time and change haven't gotten their grubby mits on. I don't think this is reason enough to decry mutation of "Religion", only enough to say that old time values (whatever those are) don't always survive in tact in modern societies.

I suppose so, thelmoose. I have to admit that I'm old-fashioned and hate to see the name of God taken in vain so much these days...and people choose to ignore it. I will say that there are some people who have also seen its downfall and are trying to establish a means to overcome it through clarification of God's Word. I see it as a slow process and not many willing to put up with it for some reason or other. What seems mundane and less wonderful to me is the fact that because of this twisted view of religion, a child can't get the help he/she needs from stem cell research. If you've ever had to deal with the severely retarded and with all the excuses why they can't be helped, you'd know what I mean. Or better yet have a severely retarded family member that suffers because someone's silly belief system don't allow a certain kind of research. It'll sour your milk.

If you insist, but I'd still like an explanation as to why we shouldn't exact stony retribution for all manner of minor offenses. A number of reasons, I'm sure. I'll go with the first one that comes to mind: religion = easy answers and the majority of people don't like working for their answers. I'll list a few more if you like. The Native Americans prayed to their lie to help with the hunt. The Greeks sought advice from oracles for their lies. Muslims make a pilgrimige to their lie. Yup, they're all lies, alright.

[QUOTE=greg 79 f150]A little straw man creeps in here, I think. Has any atheist on this board described atheism as 'provable'?That aside, why does your rhetorical question privilege christianity? Aztec penitants had to pull strings of thorns through holes in their tongues in the name of their religion; Hindu ascetics live on the brink of starvation in the name of theirs.Throughout history and ethnography, religions of all stripes have exercised powerful control over the lives of their adherents. In Darwinian terms, something that costs so much (whether it's a tithe, a hole in your tongue or a virgin sacrifice) will persist only if it delivers an even greater pay-off; and for most of history religion has done just that, cementing societies together in a common cause, providing rationalisation and sanctification of codes of behaviour, and legitimising leadership.Since the Enlightenment, we have begun to see that these things are possible without an underpinning of irrational belief in supernatural agencies. However, a strong disposition in human brains to look for causes, and to invent supernatural ones where no natural cause is obvious, means that religion will be with us for some generations yet.

This is probably the most defensible explanation of an atheistic worldview I've heard on this site.You are absolutely right. The biggest problem in the discussion is using a diverse term generally. The trouble is, in my experience, I have personally clearly laid out definitions of "atheist," "agnostic," and the like for the purposes of discussion (and seen others do it) only to have atheists turn the discussion into a debate about those clearly laid out definitions. What's my point? That believers aren't the only ones muddying the discussion.I couldn't help but chuckle when I read this :)What is so bad about being unsure?

[QUOTE=greg 79 f150]A little straw man creeps in here, I think. Has any atheist on this board described atheism as 'provable'?That aside, why does your rhetorical question privilege christianity? Aztec penitants had to pull strings of thorns through holes in their tongues in the name of their religion; Hindu ascetics live on the brink of starvation in the name of theirs.Throughout history and ethnography, religions of all stripes have exercised powerful control over the lives of their adherents. In Darwinian terms, something that costs so much (whether it's a tithe, a hole in your tongue or a virgin sacrifice) will persist only if it delivers an even greater pay-off; and for most of history religion has done just that, cementing societies together in a common cause, providing rationalisation and sanctification of codes of behaviour, and legitimising leadership.Since the Enlightenment, we have begun to see that these things are possible without an underpinning of irrational belief in supernatural agencies. However, a strong disposition in human brains to look for causes, and to invent supernatural ones where no natural cause is obvious, means that religion will be with us for some generations yet.

Christian beliefs are the same no matter where you go, fishpower. It's the mutated "christian" that I'm referring to - those who abuse the name of God and all that was once considered holy/sacred. Like Greg said, there are still those who want nothing to do with what religion has become. These are the ones that put aside their selfishness and worship God for who God is and not what "His Name" can do to further their cause.I think we've beaten the hair off both sides of that dead horse, fishpower. Can't remember if you were part of those discussions, but I think the jury's still out whether those dishonorable values were the result of God or of mankind.Sure there were and still are positive elements of the Lord's teachings. It's when man decides that we have a better idea that it begins to unravel.

Again, we've found out that by "Religion" you really mean "Christian Beliefs." Certainly those have changed, but Religion is still what it is. You could even say that modern Christianity is a completely different religion than what it used to be, but that still doesn't change the nature of religion.As for being an "honorable system of beliefs" I would beg to differ. The Old Testament by itself has some of the most disonorable values ever written. Yeah, there were some pretty silly things established in the name of God and the Bible. But maybe there was some positive change as well? Or perhaps we should go back to doing exactly what the Bible says and stone people to death for working on Sunday.

Because people are stupid, easily indoctrinated, and wilfully ignorant.

A belief system is just that - a system. It doesn't matter where they come from. That was my point. Besides anything that compares to religion is a religion, imo. Religion in and of itself has nothing to do with Christ. Your statement said, specifically: Religion.I have stated many times here that if a person, be he good or bad or indifferent, lives by a set of beliefs, then that person is religious. Wouldn't you agree?If Zeus talked to you and guided you to a better life, whereby all those you came in contact with profited from it, then I would have to say, "Zeus must be a good god."And if I told you that Christ speaks to me everytime I pray to Him, what would you say?

That's a good point. "I don't know" shouldn't be considered a bad phrase to use. Many things (okay, most things) in the universe are currently beyond our understanding and the rational person should be fine with admitting that. What we see instead is most people just inserting "goddidit" into anyting they don't understand and not taking the time to investigate it properly.In the case of "what caused the Big Bang" there's still lots to be learned and "I don't know" is a perfectly reasonable response for the layperson. In the case of "is there a god" we have all the reasons I gave a the start of this thread to consider, so we can be comfortable enough to answer "I'm as sure as I can be that there isn't."

Not even close. Try being a Muslim, or an atheist (if you count atheism as a religion).Master_Shake and fishpower:I agree: "I don't know" is a powerful, valid answer.Strangely, some theists use the "I don't know" phrase to mean "Goddidit." This of course is the God of the Gaps (argument from ignorance) fallacy, but there's a really fun way to make fun of this argument:Whenever "I don't know" means "Goddidit," then it can be stated as "I don't know, therefore I know." This is an obvious logical impossibility. Now when we consider that fishpower's sister was claiming that "atheism requires one to be omniscient," but we show that this explanation leads one to know absolutely everything, whose argument is the one that breaks down?

Alright, so we've narrowed it down to this country. Fair enough. You say Christianity is abused. This isn't so much a discussion for an atheist to get into as it is between different sects of Christianity battling for who has the "correct interpretation." Maybe the "correct" version of Christianity only existed between Jesus and his immediate followers. Maybe the "correct" version entails handling snakes and speaking in tongues. When you start interpreting the Bible, as you obviously have to do to discount some of its crazier teachings, then you lose the ability to be able to say definitively which interpretation is correct. If the catholics interpret it to say we can't wear rubbers, you can't correct them except to say "I think my interpretation is better." And if you don't want to interpret it at all, then by god, let's stone us some adulterers.Personally, I think the correct interpretaton of the Bible is as a document of the beliefs of some ancient people looking for answers.If it's not wrong, what is it?

Other than the obvious population explosion - there are many people today that are finding these "feel good" religions fall far too short to have much of a lasting impact. They have tried to live according to Brother John and Sister Jane, who have millions of dollars to prove the existance of God, and have realized that it just don't work. They have heard politicans "preaching" on what God has told them. They've had enough and want to break away from that division of religion and get back to the basics. Like I said, it will be a slow process and many will jump ship, but I really believe Christianity will shake it off and be much better than ever.Once again, the abuse comes from religionists, who use it for personal gain. It's abused in schools, in sports, in jail, and in public office. It's abused at home to keep a wife barefoot and pregnant, or a husband to change his ways. Just about anything that you can slap a name on can be done in the name of God, through Christianity.

Big Orn, I don't think there can ever be a "back to basics" christian religion becuase I don't believe you'll ever get a univeral consensus on what the "basics" really are. If there is such a thing, it was probably known only to Jesus and his immediate followers, and since none of those people likely existed anyway, it's a lost cause.

The OP is Logic of Atheism, which is why we are discussing the need for religion in the first place. Interpretation of God’s Word is not the problem. The problem lies in the blatant misinterpretation of His Word. I believe those that do this aren’t quite sure there’s a God or gods, either. That’s where my point comes to focus…or at least I would have thought so. There’s going to be honest mistakes made in interpretation no matter what division of religion to which one belongs. It’s sort of hard to make that claim if a preacher screams about drinking a beer late of an evening, yet he takes the church’s money to make a political contribution, or to further the cause of some joint venture into the oil business.Despite popular belief, we can all be His direct followers. If you trust in Him and believe you can and will shuck all the unnecessary things of religion. Some find it hard to attend church without the usual condiments. God’s Word needs no spicing-up…it’s perfect the way it is. That’s not really how Christ wanted us to handle Him. He instructs us to allow Him to work through us, not for us to work through Him. If it takes the handling of snakes to prove His existence, then there would have been no need for Him to bear the Cross. Material things are and will always be material things – whether it be snakes or diamonds.That’s your opinion and I shouldn’t condemn you for it. I would like to ask what brought you to that conclusion, though.Righteousness…imho.Like I said above, fish, we can be His immediate followers if we so choose. And yes there is such a thing as going back and getting the real message. It takes letting go of our silly human pride and seeing religion for what it really is, however.

Ron, please excuse the butting in. The fact is the bible is an arbitrary compendium (many documents, not 'a document' ) of an ancient people's writings. Not all of the documents were 'looking for answers': some, like the Book of Esther, were just re-tellings of folk tales. Whatever their provenance, their selection and incorporation into the present-day bible suited the purely temporal agendas of the human beings who did the selecting in the 4th century. Live with it.

Whoah! lots of stuff colliding here.Islam is being discriminated against, often in strange ways fuelled by ignorance, in the US as per the 30 Days documentary.Atheists are being discriminated against, not sure it's a religion but if they insist it is, it maybe worthwhile finding out how it stands legally. (Anti-discrimination laws)Christianity in the US has gone down a route to insanity and back, it's far more a mess of cults than anything else. Mormons, AiG, FES, Southern Baptists...

For all the mistakes in interpretation you may point out that someone else has made, they'll levy just as many against you based on their own framework of understanding.

It is only different in the sense that it touches a person differently. In some other life I might have chosen the others.

Why count Christians who bash Christians? If I bash my own beliefs nonstop, why should I get status as "abused"?Ratio? If you're referring to the ratio of Muslims to Christians, the ratio is irrelevant to the question. Otherwise, think back a couple years to all the talk about how Islam is a violent, avenging religion...One of my favorites is Bush Sr.'s statement that atheists shouldn't even be citizens since this is "one nation under God."Any time any religion is endorsed, superficially or not, by the government, be it by displaying the Ten Commandments in a courthouse or approving the teaching of creationism, all religious views to which those things don't apply are being abused. In the above examples, all non-Abrahamic views are discriminated against when the Ten Commandments are displayed (and some might even say some Abrahamic views are as well, depending on which version is used), and when creationism is taught for religious reasons, all other religions are tread upon. Guess which view gets hit every time any religion is endorsed?

In the above examples, all non-Abrahamic views are discriminated against when the Ten Commandments are displayed (and some might even say some Abrahamic views are as well, depending on which version is used), and when creationism is taught for religious reasons, all other religions are tread upon. Guess which view gets hit every time any religion is endorsed?

Thanks for your kind words, John and Master Shake.Feels good to join you folks again. Hope to post again soon.Despite some folks on here bent on causing trouble - I've missed it.

I'm not talking about bashing. I'm referring to those who draw others near through deception, purposely misguiding...with "love". Nothing about bashing in the deal.Should have said, "The most popular religion", maybe.You are very close to understanding my point."Render unto Caesar what is his and unto the Lord what belongs to him..."

"Bashing" is not encompassed by "being abused"?If a religion has to be "the most popular religion" in order to be abused, then you are defining which religion is being abused regardless of actual abuse. This is absurd.As I said, since you're referring to numbers, your "rebuttal" has no logical foundation. Just because there's only one me doesn't mean I can't be abused.Oh, see, I understand your point, but that doesn't mean that I think your point is correct.I've never denied Caesar or the Lord that which is rightfully theirs. Of course, that doesn't mean I've given anything to either...

In other words, religion is like the blues. If you have to have it explained to you, you're just not going get it. Kinda poetic, in a way, if frustrating to those who wish to better understand it. Your brand of christianity seems uniquely tolerant and open, and I guess that's to be commended, but I don't think that makes it any more true than any of the variations you bemoan in your posts. The most liberal, loving, open interpretation of the Bible is still just a liberal, loving, open interpretation of a piece of ancient fiction.

One cannot explain the faith of God in a logical manner. In order to make myself clear, then you would need some measure of faith. I doubt that will happen.I could explain the Gospels, but that's where the problems start. Right? Let's just say that I can't explain ideal Christianity and be done with it.

Let's say it is. If someone lives what is in your mind a good life as a result of its inspiration, does it really make any difference?

It depends on the reason for the belief system in the first place. If it's the social style of religion, then it's no more than a game or political ploy. If it's a system of beliefs where the believer is searching for God, then it has nothing to do with emotions or material gain.In an ideal situation you would welcome it explained to you because you have prayed for that help and it was delivered.My "brand" is not unique or new...and your opinion of the Bible is just that.

Okay, Big Orn, it appears that I actually was misunderstanding, because you're using "abuse" in a different (albeit interesting) way:In other words, you're using the word abuse as it is used in the phrase "drug abuse" (i.e. using drugs incorrectly) as opposed to as it is used in "child abuse" (treating a child inappropriately).In this case, I agree with you: it's ridiculous when people "abuse" (I would say "exploit") religion to further their agenda. I wish I'd understood your point originally, because it's a valid one.

Good question (even though I didn't really make that implication). I think the difference is in the nature and absolutness of those beliefs. Extreme example: If an otherwise sane atheist believes that he must kill all people who don't believe as he does, he does so because that's what his internal logic tells him to do. Anything based on logic can be reasoned with (in my perfect world). If he doesn't listen, we say he's unreasonable and lock him up.If an otherwise sane Muslim believes it's his duty to kill as many infidels as possible, he does so because his holy book commands it. If his faith is strong and unquestioning, no amount of logic will prevail. We can't stop people from having bad ideas and forming erroneous beliefs, but if we take away the idea of absolute infalability that's at the core of religions, then we at least have room for real communication and problem resolution.

The problem is that logic is necessarily based on assumptions. The assumptions of an atheist who reaches the logical conclusion that people who disagree with him have to die, will do so on certain basic assumptions, which will be as fundamental to him as religious beliefs.

Logic is only a tool, and as such it's not really based on anything except the assumption that 1 + 1 = 2. If our homicidal atheist is truly reasonable, he will be able to be recognize that even his core assumptions should be subject to logical analysis. Our religious zealot, on the other hand, gaurds his core assumptions from the same analysis.

evidence has little to do with actual logic. One can reach a perfectly logical conclusion that has no basis in reality depending on the assumptions one start's with. To say that atheism or theism is illogical is simply missing the point. Atheism and theism are assumptions. One must first assume one or the other to test the theory.One might conclude the existence or non existence of god both equally logically based on a different set of beginning assumptions.EF

I don't think this is right. I would say that atheism and theism aren't assumptions. They are the results that logic gives us from other, more basic assumptions. Assumption 1: the universe operates on a purely natural, material basis. Its rules are learnable and allow us to make predictions on how it will behave. Assumption 2: the universe as we see it is mostly natural, but contains much that is supernatural. That which is natural is knowable and predictable, but the supernatural, by its very nature, will defy natural rules. The first assumption, if its supported by what we observe in the universe, will lead one to atheism. Or put in another way, it will not lead one to theism.The second assmption opens room to believe in God, who does not fit into the completely natural framework. Or to believe in Thor. Or gremlins. Or oompa loompas. Or whatever thing you want to make up or "intuitively feel" into that supernatural space.So how do we determine which assumption is correct? We look for evidence of the supernatural. We look to see if things happen which defy natural explanation. Lo and behold, they do not. We have not one single, clinching piece of evidence which can't be otherwise explained in natural terms.I fear I might be opening some floodgates with this one, but there ya go.

The irony here is that virtually all theists adhere to the assumption of atheism, except for a single case of special pleading. Along the lines of what fishpower said, most theists do not believe in Thor, or Zeus, or Ahuramazda, or gremlins, or invisible pink unicorns, or flying spaghetti monsters. They don't believe in glognorks, shizaris, flinders, charghats, or any other concepts that I make up on the spot. Given no good reason to believe in entity x, it is illogical to believe in entity x. Monotheists, however, pick one entity in which to believe. Unless they can explain this exception with sound logical reasoning, their belief is illogical.

Am I? I'm saying that all religions have an absolute-don't-mess-with-this-"truth" at their heart which is 2 parts: a) that there's a central macguffin (to adapt a movie term, a thing about which the religion revolves), the existence of which isn't to be questioned and b) that anything that the macguffin teaches is to be accepted, again without question. If a religion doesn't abide by this, it's not a religion. This isn't about good people vs bad people. It's about being able to question that which informs you. I don't think I said that either of the people in my example were explicitly good or bad. Neither of them have actually killed anyone. I just posited that one has option, if he chooses it, to question what makes him think about harming others.

Now let's examine your examination. This is fun. :) Remember, we're looking at assumptions that can lead one to believe in or not believe in the Christian God. So what you're saying is that your belief in God is based on the assumption that there is a God. This doesn't make sense.You did not start your life with a belief or non belief on God. What you started with were assumptions about the nature of the universe that laid the foundation for whether you were willing to accept the idea of God. Strictly speaking, they were assumptions passed to you by your parents, but we'll ignore that for now. You assumption allowed for that which defies our understanding of nature. When you were told that there's a God, that didn't conflict with your assumption so you accepted it. That same assumption would have made plenty of room for Shiva or Zeus too, had you been raised in those environments.I think I made an error with the "as we see it" statement. I should have just said "the universe is mostly natural...". No need to complicate things here. Perception is a whole other thread, imo. For the sake of this argument, I'll just assert that we have to be able to trust that our perception, though not perfect, is a good-enough link between reality and our brains to allow us to make and check our assumptions and not worry that we're way off the mark. On this I agree. They are not logical processes, but logical consequences of certain starting assumptions.

Actually, I think where we differ is this. You see God as the conclusion people come to. I see God as the assumption people start with. It is not about someone's belief. I could care less. What is real is real. What is not is not.

Well, no one is born with knowledge of god. Therefore, at some stage, the idea of god must be presented to a person.If, at that stage, the idea of god and the stories in the bible do not contradict their world view, then they accept those ideas and stories. This usually happens at a young age.

If you insist that any view requires an assumption, then a monotheistic view requires two assumptions: That no gods/gremlins/unicorns exist, and that God exists.

I do understand what you are saying Adept, but I don't find that to be a good analogy, and this is why: If God exists, and if God exists in all things (in other words if God is omnipresent) than it follows pretty naturally that people could feel God's presence before the "idea" of God was presented to them by others. It is different because computer hard drives are not omnipresent. :) (If this didn't make any sense, I apologize, I wrote it at almost 4 AM. :) I'll explain more fully if need be)

I should point out that just because you say you felt God before you learned of him, this is not good evidence against our arguments (belief in God came after willingness to believe in God). This is primarily because memories, especially old ones, are volatile things that are heavily tinged with our present opinions are worldviews. Even eyewitness testimony of recent events is largely regarded to be the worst kind of evidence in trial cases. So the fact that you recall "feeling" God as a young Master_Shake isn't a reliable argument. Additionally, by the time you were old enough to start forming lasting memories, your family had no doubt already brought you into the religious fold, so you had certain expectations of how the world should be and feel.

Logically, if what we know scientifically about the moon conflicts with my belief, it's that belief that we'd say is illogical. So if what we know about the universe, history and human nature tells us that there's a) no evidence for God and b) no real need to think there's one there then logically your belief in God is unfounded.

We really don't even need to perform a test on moon rocks to dismiss my green cheese claim, given what we know about astral bodies and fermented milk. With the God claim I think we both agree you cannot prove the negative here by any kind of test. But we can use deduction and inference, both logical tools, to argue against his existence.

This is a little beside the point (pun intended), but I don't think anyone's arguments hinge on the definition of a point here. If you look at an abtract math problem that makes use of a point, it is irrelevant to whether the point exists in a real sense, so long as it works in the logic of the problem.On the other hand, if you're talking about the point in space that exists halfway between two people (for instance), that point does exist.

I addressed the issue of proof, testing and logic in post 116 (edited this morning to clear up a misleading concept). Please read. Sorry to jibe you, but what you say is evidence isn't evidence. The fact that you and I are here says nothing about how we got here. Pretend I wipe my mind clean of all knowledge about human and animal reproduction. I am here, so I must have come about somehow. Perhaps I popped into existence at the whim of that great bright thing in the sky. Or maybe I was delivered in a bag to by a long-beaked bird to those who raised me. Or I could pick any number of fanciful explanations which are grounded in nothing except my desire to have easy answers without doing the research. Or... I could actually look around, study human and animal growth and development, notice pregnant bellies and the fact that they've gone away when the mommy comes out of the hospital with her child... I don't even need to see the birth itself to form a pretty good theory of how I got here.Now you want to say that because we can't see the birth of the universe we can't make logical inferences about how it got here (the "it just happened" explanation). Granted, it may take a fantasic volume of knowledge before we can get close to a detailed explanation, but even now we know enough about how the universe works to make one claim: we didn't need a cosmic stork to deliver us.

All of the points that you bring up have been addressed and countered by myself and others here numerous times and in numerous ways. Discussions can only proceed if you answer arguments and bring up new ones instead of just saying "nah-ah" to everything that's presented.One more time, briefly: to reach a logical conclusion, one must have starting assumptions, but logic can also be turned on those assumptions to find out if they're valid. Testing is useful, but not cruicial because inference is also a valid logical tool. If an assumption does not hold up to logical analysis, as the existence of God does not, then it is not a logical assumption.

At this point, I'm pretty much reduced to echoing myself and others...fishpower makes the assumption, "the universe exists."EF makes the assumption, "God exists."EF insists that these are equally logical. I merely note that EF has no universe. He has to make an additional assumption, "the universe also exists." Ockham's razor comes in really handy here.EF's new approach is a slightly modified assumption: "God created the universe." But this is really two assumptions: "God exists," and "God created the universe" (from which follows that the universe exists.) Now EF has his universe and an extra assumption. Again, we're in need of an Ockham-style shave.Lacking the assumption that God exists is simply that: lacking an assumption. It is not the assumption that God doesn't exist.There is no difference between EF's two assumptions (God exists, and the universe exists) and my two parody assumptions, "Gremlins exist," and "The universe exists" (or, alternatively, "Gremlins created the universe").Regarding applying logic to said assumptions:EF disbelieves in gremlins because certain criteria for belief are not met. However, those same criteria conclude that disbelief in God is logical. He has a logical contradiction: G • ~G. This is precisely how proof by contradiction works: If the logic behind the nonexistence of gremlins is sound, the assumption must be false.Because EF holds beliefs that are contrary to logic, his beliefs are by definition illogical.

Discussions can only proceed if you answer arguments and bring up new ones instead of just saying "nah-ah" to everything that's presented.One more time, briefly: to reach a logical conclusion, one must have starting assumptions, but logic can also be turned on those assumptions to find out if they're valid. Testing is useful, but not cruicial because inference is also a valid logical tool. If an assumption does not hold up to logical analysis, as the existence of God does not, then it is not a logical assumption.

I've enjoyed this exchange.It's like a lesson in practical logic. Well done by all. However, I agree that there is no progress being made at this point. EF - I think the point has been made pretty darn clearly, I have no idea how to present it to you in a different/better manner. I understand your position, and I think the others do as well, but it's been proven wrong IMHO, rather comprehensively. It is of course your perogative as to how to deal with the info you've been given.Waxy

At this point, I'm pretty much reduced to echoing myself and others...fishpower makes the assumption, "the universe exists."EF makes the assumption, "God exists."EF insists that these are equally logical. I merely note that EF has no universe. He has to make an additional assumption, "the universe also exists." Ockham's razor comes in really handy here.EF's new approach is a slightly modified assumption: "God created the universe." But this is really two assumptions: "God exists," and "God created the universe" (from which follows that the universe exists.) Now EF has his universe and an extra assumption. Again, we're in need of an Ockham-style shave.Lacking the assumption that God exists is simply that: lacking an assumption. It is not the assumption that God doesn't exist.There is no difference between EF's two assumptions (God exists, and the universe exists) and my two parody assumptions, "Gremlins exist," and "The universe exists" (or, alternatively, "Gremlins created the universe").Regarding applying logic to said assumptions:EF disbelieves in gremlins because certain criteria for belief are not met. However, those same criteria conclude that disbelief in God is logical. He has a logical contradiction: G • ~G. This is precisely how proof by contradiction works: If the logic behind the nonexistence of gremlins is sound, the assumption must be false.Because EF holds beliefs that are contrary to logic, his beliefs are by definition illogical.

Points = No dimensionsErgo, an electron, I presume has a physical existence, thence dimension, an electron cannot function as a point.Quarks, other bits of whatever, do they have a physical existence, thence dimension? Points are imaginary? They do not truly exist? Perhaps, they are irrational? Do irrational numbers exist? Pi is an irrational number but the dimensions of circles, globes are real.Oh, woe! What is real and what is unreal?

Treating an electron as a point raises serious problems in electrodynamics as its field strength zooms off to infinity as you approach it. It has to be treated as 'smeared out' in space.Calling pi an irrational number doesn't mean it's outside reason. 'Irrational' in this sense just means 'can't be expressed as the ratio of two natural numbers'. 1.25 is a rational number (the ratio of 5:4). The square root of two is an irrational number - a perfectly real magnitude, but there are no two natural numbers whose ratio to one another yields it.

Irrational numbers bothered some of the ancient Greek philosophers because it seemed so wrong that straightedge geometry could produce a number that couldn't be calculated, such as a square producing the square root of two.We call the square root of -1 an "imaginary" number, but they're used by electrical engineers (usually down-to-earth types) in calculations involving three-phase current. So how imaginary is imaginary?My beer is real. I just drank some of it...or at least my fallible senses of taste, smell, and touch apparently reported that I did...

Especially so since the square seemed the very cornerstone of rational geometry. To the Greek geometers it must have seemed like encountering a snake in your cornflakes.We owe that adjective (and the expression i) to Descartes, who intended it as ridicule. Perhaps 'unimaginable' would have been better.

Rarely, and the "feeling" is distinct from the feeling of my keyboard right now. My dreams tend toward the purely visual. Vision is probably the easiest sense to fool in a serious manner. We can fool our tastebuds without much effort, but barring the occasional poisoning nothing much happens as a result.

The problem with 'logic' is that the result is only as good as the premise. Garbage in , garbage out.
