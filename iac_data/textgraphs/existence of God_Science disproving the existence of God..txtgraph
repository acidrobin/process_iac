Science disproving the existence of God.

God and science have nothing at all to do with each other.God is a matter of belief. Science is a matter of sorting out facts and reality, of proof.There is no way of proving God does or does not exist. Believe what you will as your beliefs do no harm to yourself or others. Belief and faith are not the same thing as the scientific method.

Depends on your definition of God. If you're talking about an omnipotent, omniscient being that works in mysterious ways, you can never prove he doesn't exist. If, on the other hand, you think God is responsible for making the sun rise, and that he won't do it if the proper ceremonies aren't carried out each day, than proving that wrong is quite doable.

God the watchmaker? Even if we could explain everything that exists now as having come from natural causes there would be no way to prove that God didn't tweak things prior to the Big Bang to ensure that things could come out the way they did. At least, I know of no theories that might allow us to predict what happened before the big bang in any reasonable way.

There are other factors that can account for this: maybe He doesn't want to (assuming he's real) or maybe He has done so in the past and modern people refuse to accept earlier accounts as any sort of evidence. Certainly those accounts are there. I don't see how any of this changes that His existence can't be proven/disproven.

I'm not sure what you're thanking Kronus for (or simone in post #3). All either has done is confirm that no, you can't prove god's non-existence.

true, but I would not put the general idea of the existence of a deified "Other" (God) in the same catagory as those things either, based on the fact that there are not billions of people who believe in their existence, and significant portions claiming to have experienced them, as is the case with God.

I fail to see how your "majority rules" argument is a basis for evidence of anything. Many people experience something perhaps, although we have no idea how to verify how identical these subjective experiences are, but there is no evidence that the explanation for this experience is due to an unseen god. Are we proving things by consensus now? Great numbers of people have believed all kinds of superstitious things over the years. Lots of people think Britney Spears has talent; does that make it so?

Glad that you have changed your debating style and have chosen to take the high road. You're a class act.Others on this forum can speak to this better, but you asked me.1. Species are not discrete entities. Organisms (like humans) beget other organisms and depending upon external pressure, some naturally occurring unique traits of some individuals have a survival advantage. These traits remain in the gene pool. With time enough change occurs in a population that it may be different enough to call a new species. (I don't know what the exact definition of species is these days.) This change has been gradual and it's hard to say what the "immediate ancestor" would be. As I alluded to, a distant ancestor of yours is a hominid ancestor and his descendents are "intermediate" forms until you came along. So please define what you mean by "immediate, direct line ancestor."2. I guess you are asking what the species is that would be considered Homo sapiens sapiens closest older species.

I really don't even know which of the Homo spp. is the closest genetically, so I couldn't answer you. Even if that is known, that doesn't preclude another intermediate species.4.

What makes their religious experience any more important that the religious experiences of non-Christians? Why are religious experiences more meaningful than other experiences, or than a lack of (religious) experience(s)?I don't think they're making it up. Nor do I think that the every one of the billions of non-Christians are fabricating their experiences. That doesn't mean that the experiences are based in reality.Take deja vu. In several instances, I've had the feeling that I'd previously done an activity extremely similar to the one I was doing at the time of the inkling; however, upon analysis of my prior experiences, I could unquestionably rule out that I had indeed earlier experienced what I momentarily thought I was re-experiencing. Did I consciously make up the notion that I'd done that activity before? Not at all; I felt it, yet I knew that the feeling could not be representative of reality. (I'd like to note that in my "experience" (no pun intended) with deja vu, it is often a rather powerful feeling.)It doesn't matter. 4+ billion people reject Christianity. 4+ billion people believe that Christianity is false. If "consensus" works the way you seem to think it does, that's twice as much "weight" against Christianity than for it.By everyone? By two-thirds of the people involved? By a majority? By one-third? By two people?On something? An agreement on every single individual aspect of a larger issue? On two-thirds of the aspects of a single issue? A majority of the aspects? Any one aspect? Only the larger issue regardless of aspects?I'll try it again: Why have you not defined consensus in a clear manner?

Some of you might want to think about breaking "christians" up. Instead of a broad category of 2 Billion, it might be better to look at some of the differences between them. Catholics have the Apocrypha in their version of the Bible. Pentacostals do not. Pentacostals "speak in tongues", believing the "the Holy Spirit" is communicating through them. Catholics think they're freakin' nutjobs for doing that. "Christians" cannot agree with each other, and so strike me as a rather insubstantial basis for an argument of this sort.Muslims come in lotsa flavors too. So do Buddhists, and Hindus. Mahayana Buddhists don't have alotta respect for Hinayana Buddhists and neither of them thinks much of Zen.Science, at least as I define and understand it, is a set of agreed-upon parameters with which to examine the Universe we observe. The fact that Einstein's Relativity cannot be used to determine the behavior of Quantam particles show that Science, also, is fallible, and not absolute. Unless and until they come up with a Grand Unified Theory of Everything that works, Science will remain, for me, something that seems to work most of the time, but has exceptions to every known rule.Not to be nihilistic about it, but there is nothing that is proveable 100% of the time, if only because we're unable to observe things from an "all-time" perspective. Take the 2nd law of Thermodynamics, which states that "entropy tends to increase over time." The usual example of this that's given in most textbooks is a box with a partition down the middle. In one compartment a number of marbles are confined. The other compartment is empty. "Remove the partition, and the marbles spread out into the rest of the box." This is defined as "entropy", disorder, chaos; and we're told it increases with the forward arrow of time.My problem, at least with the analogy since I'm no "scientist" or expert, is that the rules change halfway through. When the marbles are confined in one half of the box, that half of the box comprises the total awareness of Space of those marbles. When the partition is removed, a new Space is created, and so the marbles will tend to distribute themselves evenly in it.This strikes me as an increase in order, via the magnitude of the new Space versus the old one. It can only be described as disorder if one is piling marbles up in a stack, in one half of half the box.

Quite right. As others have pointed out, only the data matter.

'Tis true. Chemistry is chemisty the world over. THere are disgreements over some cutting edge topics, but none over the basics.There is no Catholic physics or Muslim astronomy or Buddhist parasitology.

Some of you might want to think about breaking "christians" up. Instead of a broad category of 2 Billion, it might be better to look at some of the differences between them. Catholics have the Apocrypha in their version of the Bible. Pentacostals do not. Pentacostals "speak in tongues", believing the "the Holy Spirit" is communicating through them. Catholics think they're freakin' nutjobs for doing that. "Christians" cannot agree with each other, and so strike me as a rather insubstantial basis for an argument of this sort.Muslims come in lotsa flavors too. So do Buddhists, and Hindus. Mahayana Buddhists don't have alotta respect for Hinayana Buddhists and neither of them thinks much of Zen.Science, at least as I define and understand it, is a set of agreed-upon parameters with which to examine the Universe we observe. The fact that Einstein's Relativity cannot be used to determine the behavior of Quantam particles show that Science, also, is fallible, and not absolute. Unless and until they come up with a Grand Unified Theory of Everything that works, Science will remain, for me, something that seems to work most of the time, but has exceptions to every known rule.Not to be nihilistic about it, but there is nothing that is proveable 100% of the time, if only because we're unable to observe things from an "all-time" perspective. Take the 2nd law of Thermodynamics, which states that "entropy tends to increase over time." The usual example of this that's given in most textbooks is a box with a partition down the middle. In one compartment a number of marbles are confined. The other compartment is empty. "Remove the partition, and the marbles spread out into the rest of the box." This is defined as "entropy", disorder, chaos; and we're told it increases with the forward arrow of time.My problem, at least with the analogy since I'm no "scientist" or expert, is that the rules change halfway through. When the marbles are confined in one half of the box, that half of the box comprises the total awareness of Space of those marbles. When the partition is removed, a new Space is created, and so the marbles will tend to distribute themselves evenly in it.This strikes me as an increase in order, via the magnitude of the new Space versus the old one. It can only be described as disorder if one is piling marbles up in a stack, in one half of half the box. Then, eventually they'll collapse and spread about that original space, due to some outside influence (shaking of the box, etc.).Sorry if that's off topic, but I don't think it is.For what it's worth, I don't believe/disbelieve in any god, God, gods or Gods. I don't see where the idea has any bearing on my daily life.

I think you're making a handful of small mistakes here.First, I'd like to point out that while "disorder" can sometimes be adequate for illustrating entropy, "disorder" is too simplistic (and subject to .. well, personal opinion) to be useful in some cases.Second, the second law of thermodynamics applies only in certain conditions. For example, it doesn't apply to systems far from thermal equilibrium, to nanoscale or microscale systems, or to open systems (although if a boundary is defined and "bookkeeping" is done, the law can be applied to open macroscopic systems).Third, you are ignoring the empty half of the box for your initial state. It is not as if this half does not exist merely because no marbles are contained therein.If you were to take the viewpoint of the marbles, as you seem to want to be doing, then in the initial state, all the marbles have "distributed themselves evenly" and have reached a maximum entropy possible for a system with infinite potential energy boundaries (a.k.a. impermeable barriers and box walls). When you remove the middle barrier, the marbles then "redistribute themselves evenly" and have reached a maximum entropy possible for a system with infinite potential energy boundaries. In other words, if you insist on (wrongly) using only the point of view of the marbles, there is no change in entropy (save for the average altitude of the marbles being halved (which, frankly, would be an increase in entropy, not a decrease)), not a decrease in entropy.pandion very well may throw in his two cents here, and I suspect he's more qualified than I am on this topic.

I guess that answers it. You are unable to identify which specific hominid / species immediately preceeded modern man. Yet you basically believe there was one. With such great faith as that, how are you able to cast stones at the Biblical creation account?

I didn't say it was more important. But your stance seems to be that reliigous experience as claimed by religious people has NO importance. That's what I'm arguing against. It's not an issue of which is "more."True but since we can't know for sure, and people the world over are claiming it, I'd prefer to give them the benefit of the doubt, particularly since it's their business anyway.

What makes their religious experience any more important that the religious experiences of non-Christians? Why are religious experiences more meaningful than other experiences, or than a lack of (religious) experience(s)?I don't think they're making it up. Nor do I think that the every one of the billions of non-Christians are fabricating their experiences. That doesn't mean that the experiences are based in reality.Take deja vu. In several instances, I've had the feeling that I'd previously done an activity extremely similar to the one I was doing at the time of the inkling; however, upon analysis of my prior experiences, I could unquestionably rule out that I had indeed earlier experienced what I momentarily thought I was re-experiencing. Did I consciously make up the notion that I'd done that activity before? Not at all; I felt it, yet I knew that the feeling could not be representative of reality. (I'd like to note that in my "experience" (no pun intended) with deja vu, it is often a rather powerful feeling.)It doesn't matter. 4+ billion people reject Christianity. 4+ billion people believe that Christianity is false. If "consensus" works the way you seem to think it does, that's twice as much "weight" against Christianity than for it.By everyone? By two-thirds of the people involved? By a majority? By one-third? By two people?On something? An agreement on every single individual aspect of a larger issue? On two-thirds of the aspects of a single issue? A majority of the aspects? Any one aspect? Only the larger issue regardless of aspects?I'll try it again: Why have you not defined consensus in a clear manner?

Actually, that's not my stance for the purposes of this argument, although I think my deja vu example shows one good reason why we shan't be putting much weight on "religious experiences." However, I need not rely on this stance in order to satisfactorily counter your main claim, so I won't bother elaborating on it here.This is my main stance for the purposes of this argument: You say that we should give these people the benefit of the doubt, but you don't give the other four billion people any benefit of the doubt. That's special pleading. You're ignoring four billion people for the purposes of forwarding your "consensus" argument. If you were being honest, the "consensus" (supported by two-thirds of over six billion people) would be that Christianity is false.

Anyone seen the goalposts recently? They seem to have sprouted warp drive and left the planet. The issue is not whether people of any persuasion have the right or ability to make up their own minds, it's whether the existence of two billion Christians somehow lends support to Chrisitianity.What benefit? I just told you that I don't even believe me when it comes to that sort of thing (deja vu), because when the claim is testable, it fails. That's no reason to assume that untestable claims are likely true.So it's "intolerant" not to accept reasoning based on logical fallacies? I'm not attacking your religion, I'm countering the alleged logic you're using in trying to support your view, regardless of the fact that you can give no reason for giving significant weight to said experiences at all. And it's not religion on the defensive in this conversation, it's your misapplication of logic that's on the defensive here. (If you want to put "religious experiences" on the defensive, we could do that elsewhere, and the deja vu example would make a reappearance.)There are still many problems with this, jyoshu.First, it is fallacious to exclude the non-religious from your consideration. This in effect is circular: "In trying to show that Christianity is a popular belief, I'll ignore huge blocks of people who do not accept Christianity." Remember above where you said that everyone can make up their own minds? Why do you get to say that people who come to a particular kind of conclusion can be excluded from consideration?Second, the body of "believers" has contrasting beliefs. Even if one billion people were non-believers and wrongfully ignored, this would leave about three billion non-Christians to two billion Christians. "Consensus" works against you here.Third, the body of "Christians" has contrasting beliefs, as Yossarian pointed out. If you're so intent on breaking down "non-Christian" beliefs, why are you not breaking down Christian beliefs?Fourth, if you were to break down all beliefs completely and tally the most common beliefs, you'd get very impotent claims, such as: "A deity or deities exist." You would end up with several conflicting competitive doctrines and no meaningful or complete doctrine.Fifth, it's still a fallacy: when the "consensus" was that the sun goes around the earth, was the sun really going around the earth?

Yes, people are welcome to believe silly, unfounded things, and many choose to do so. For example, people can believe that the earth is flat because we'd be thrown off of it were it spherical and rotating. Whether we'd actually be thrown off of it were it spherical and rotating (based on the laws of physics) is a pertinent part of the issue but is ignored by flat-earthers. Here, these people are ignoring that the reasoning behind this "support" is fallacious.I'll question their views in another thread, if I must; here I'm only debunking the claim that "consensus" (as you've used but not defined it) logically lends support to any religious view.Again, I believe that they believe they have experienced certain things, but I believe they are mistaken (and I have reasons to believe they are mistaken). You brought up consensus as a "supporting" argument. I responded. Are you supposed to be allowed to present arguments while everyone else is forbidden to analyze them?If an Amish person comes up to me and explains a "reason" for wearing 19th century clothing and for driving carriages, and I can explain why this "reason" is comparable to the steaming piles his carriage power leaves behind, then I have every right to do so. Notice that I haven't attacked you for being religious, I've been focusing on rebutting the "consensus" argument.If you claim that reason isn't behind your religious decisions, then why did you feel the need to present an argument for them, and why are you objecting to my critique of it?

I guarantee you that if a 1/3 of the world's population started emphatically claiming they were being abducted by aliens, people would start taking those claims a lot more seriously. THAT'S the point of my whole "consensus" issue. I never said it was definitive proof of anything. And I again point out that I don't see that it matters whether or not you are convinced. You are free to disbelieve all you want. I sometimes get the impression that skeptics want religious people to try and convince them. Religious people, from what I've seen, are quite content in their beliefs whether you believe them or not.

Then you don't look hard. I'll use math for a simple example.Say person A has a religious experience that two plus two is x.Say person B has a religious experience that two plus two is y.Let reality dictate that x is not equal to y.We can conclude that at least one of the experiences is false. This is basic logic. When two experiences are contradictory, at least one is necessarily wrong.First, neither person A nor person B has any basis for thinking that his or her experience is more correct than the other's. We get two factions claiming to be right when no more than one is right.More importantly, if these "religious experiences" came from a God, then God lied to (at least) one of the experiencers.No, basic logic tells me that at least one is untrue. Considering the sheer multitude of experiences that clash, why does any one brand of experiences get favorable treatment? Clearly, "religious experiences" aren't reliable representations of reality because so many are thrown out.

A flawed analogy. It is not the case that the christian 1/3 of the world population have all had an identical preternatural life-changing experience that made them christians. As others have pointed out, most adopt their religion because it is their cultural milieu: like most Muslims, Jews, Hindus etc. they merely carry on what their parents practised.Even were the analogy closer, however, it would still fail. Sceptics have 'taken christianity's claims seriously' for centuries, in the sense that they have subjected them to rigorous critical analysis; as a result, many have come to the conclusion that those claims do not in fact stand up to close scrutiny and should be rejected. The same would happen, I suspect, if 33% of the population started claiming experience of alien abduction. The claims would stand or fall on their own merits - not on the basis of the number making them.According to a Gallup poll done about ten years ago, about one-third of Americans do in fact believe aliens have visited Earth.

I guarantee you that if a 1/3 of the world's population started emphatically claiming they were being abducted by aliens, people would start taking those claims a lot more seriously. THAT'S the point of my whole "consensus" issue. I never said it was definitive proof of anything. And I again point out that I don't see that it matters whether or not you are convinced. You are free to disbelieve all you want. I sometimes get the impression that skeptics want religious people to try and convince them. Religious people, from what I've seen, are quite content in their beliefs whether you believe them or not.

You've tossed a lot of variables out there in order for it to "work" or "apply" in all conditions. In that case, it doesn't deserve the term "law". I like Theory better.I'm not ignoring the empty half of the box. What other viewpoint would you suggest if not the marble's? Mine? Yours? But that's subjective, and that's my point. All of science is. We observe, and come up with theories that work most, but never all, of the time. The half of the box they're contained in is a state. As far as they're concerned, it's the only possible state. It isn't as if they know there's a barrier present, and that just on the other side is a new, equal space. What word would you use, if you don't like disorder?And given that this "law" isn't a law anyway, but a theory, what makes my interpretation of it invalid?The barrier is not natural, it's man-made, part of the experiment.

Anyone seen the goalposts recently? They seem to have sprouted warp drive and left the planet. The issue is not whether people of any persuasion have the right or ability to make up their own minds, it's whether the existence of two billion Christians somehow lends support to Chrisitianity.What benefit? I just told you that I don't even believe me when it comes to that sort of thing (deja vu), because when the claim is testable, it fails. That's no reason to assume that untestable claims are likely true.So it's "intolerant" not to accept reasoning based on logical fallacies? I'm not attacking your religion, I'm countering the alleged logic you're using in trying to support your view, regardless of the fact that you can give no reason for giving significant weight to said experiences at all. And it's not religion on the defensive in this conversation, it's your misapplication of logic that's on the defensive here. (If you want to put "religious experiences" on the defensive, we could do that elsewhere, and the deja vu example would make a reappearance.)There are still many problems with this, jyoshu.First, it is fallacious to exclude the non-religious from your consideration. This in effect is circular: "In trying to show that Christianity is a popular belief, I'll ignore huge blocks of people who do not accept Christianity." Remember above where you said that everyone can make up their own minds? Why do you get to say that people who come to a particular kind of conclusion can be excluded from consideration?Second, the body of "believers" has contrasting beliefs. Even if one billion people were non-believers and wrongfully ignored, this would leave about three billion non-Christians to two billion Christians. "Consensus" works against you here.Third, the body of "Christians" has contrasting beliefs, as Yossarian pointed out. If you're so intent on breaking down "non-Christian" beliefs, why are you not breaking down Christian beliefs?Fourth, if you were to break down all beliefs completely and tally the most common beliefs, you'd get very impotent claims, such as: "A deity or deities exist." You would end up with several conflicting competitive doctrines and no meaningful or complete doctrine.Fifth, it's still a fallacy: when the "consensus" was that the sun goes around the earth, was the sun really going around the earth?

Well you pretty much proved that only ONE can be shown to be untrue. I'd also point out that religious experience being different is not noecessarily the same as being contradictory. You're stance on this presupposes that God wouldn't allow multiple ways of religious experience.Please explain how logic renders the religious experiences of others untrue. The only thing you're pointing to here is the fact not all the experiences are the same. That doesn't prove they are untrue at all.
attacks
Then you don't look hard. I'll use math for a simple example.Say person A has a religious experience that two plus two is x.Say person B has a religious experience that two plus two is y.Let reality dictate that x is not equal to y.We can conclude that at least one of the experiences is false. This is basic logic. When two experiences are contradictory, at least one is necessarily wrong.First, neither person A nor person B has any basis for thinking that his or her experience is more correct than the other's. We get two factions claiming to be right when no more than one is right.More importantly, if these "religious experiences" came from a God, then God lied to (at least) one of the experiencers.No, basic logic tells me that at least one is untrue. Considering the sheer multitude of experiences that clash, why does any one brand of experiences get favorable treatment? Clearly, "religious experiences" aren't reliable representations of reality because so many are thrown out.

I'm not making it up, and it's not confined to the second law of thermodynamics, either. The problem with calling it a theory is that it's not a set of well-supported hypotheses that describe a phenomenon.That means you're doing it wrong. You consider the whole system. But like I said, even if you do take the marbles' point of view, you still get an increase in entropy.No, it's not; "the half of the box in which they're contained" is a location. The state the marbles are in could be described as "at rest within one half of the box."They could be outside the box. They could be bouncing around the box. They could actually be "evenly distributed" among the entire volume of the box.Tell that to tunneling electrons.Can I use multiple words? I choose "unuseable energy."Only what I've said above. Well, perhaps more, but we'll start with that.A barrier is a barrier is a barrier. The marbles are man-made and part of the experiment, too, but you're not ignoring them...So pushing you up against a wall at the edge of the top of a cliff and pushing you in the same manner with the wall removed won't result in an increase in entropy? Again, it has more to do with final and initial states than how the final state was acheived from the initial state.Don't worry, even very intelligent people have trouble with thermodynamics.I don't think it's misleading at all...I said at least one is wrong, not only one is wrong. emoticonXGood

The very fact you're bringing that up shows it's taken more seriously due to the percentage making the claim than it would be otherwise.

No, it doesn't, by itself, prove anything though--you are correct on that. But it matters.

A flawed analogy. It is not the case that the christian 1/3 of the world population have all had an identical preternatural life-changing experience that made them christians. As others have pointed out, most adopt their religion because it is their cultural milieu: like most Muslims, Jews, Hindus etc. they merely carry on what their parents practised.Even were the analogy closer, however, it would still fail. Sceptics have 'taken christianity's claims seriously' for centuries, in the sense that they have subjected them to rigorous critical analysis; as a result, many have come to the conclusion that those claims do not in fact stand up to close scrutiny and should be rejected. The same would happen, I suspect, if 33% of the population started claiming experience of alien abduction. The claims would stand or fall on their own merits - not on the basis of the number making them.According to a Gallup poll done about ten years ago, about one-third of Americans do in fact believe aliens have visited Earth. Should the other two-thirds of Americans be swayed by that impressive statistic, and start to believe it too?

Time for a basic arithmetic review. When x experiences are contradictory, then x-1 experiences must be untrue. It is perfectly possible, as Yossarian pointed out, that all x experiences are untrue.I agree, but are you saying that no experiences are contradictory?No it doesn't; it presupposes God isn't a liar.Not of others. It renders no more than one of multiple contradictory stories untrue. (Law of excluded middle.) From the information of the experiences alone, one cannot tell which one if any is true.Nope, I'm not talking about mere differences, I'm talking about contradiction and mutual exclusivity.

Sorry, electrolyte, that I'm just not very intelligent. Forgive me for questioning the holy laws of physics. I guess after all I am a nihilist, or at the least pseudo-Buddhist. This......I don't believe is true. Seems as if that's exactly what it is since you yourself admitted it doesn't apply under all conditions, and especially since "all" is a very big term that could never be proven anyway. That was my whole point, unintelligent as it was, that Science in general is simply a set of hypotheses based on observations that can't ever be proven true in "all" circumstances. Maybe I'm being to metaphysical, maybe I've bounded off into the realm of fantasy but I can't help it. To me, this whole freakin' world is a fantasy. Just when you think you understand it something else comes along and forces you to rethink things.We can talk about that box of marbles all day long and you're never gonna convince me that the idea of entropy increasing is a universal truth. It's in the eye of the beholder. IMO the barrier in that box represents a flaw in the experiment. You can correct my grammar and syntax, too, if it makes ya feel better. It's my fault, since at times I type so fast I don't pay enough attention to exactly how I'm wording things. So this......would've been the correct description; but was likely unecessary as I get the idea you understood what I meant. Thanx for correcting it tho.You can't tell tunnelling electrons a thing, since they have no ears that we can see, and are moving so fast we'd prob'ly sound like turtles on quaaludes to 'em. But if your idea was to compare them to marbles sitting in a box it sounds just silly. Marbles can't move of their own volition. I don't think that was your idea, but who knows? For what it's worth, I think the example you used to was misleading, since it was in response to this comment......by jyoshu.It seemed as if (and forgive, j, if I'm putting words in your mouth; or text under your hand :P ) he was saying that you can't discredit the existence of God, or the possibility that a particular religion has validity compared to "science", just because they don't all agree with each other. But since a religious person isn't ever going to be convinced that any form of science has precedence over God, or that God had nothing to do with setting it all up; and since no atheist will ever be convinced that a Supreme Dude floating on a cloud put him on earth for some obscure reasons of his own, the whole thing is rather pointless. I read your posts here and I think you're very condescending and patronizing, but that's just my opinion.You're probably a very nice guy, but you're coming off in print just a wee bit pompous. I'm probably only saying that cuz I don't want any more arithmetic lessons, lol. I do enough math every day, thnx. I don't wanna do it in the evening too. emoticonXHoho ...to jyoshu.Here's the explanation: Each and every individual on this planet is uniquely qualified to interpret his/her religious experience, bar none. No one is qualifed to interpret another's religious experience validity. God can and maybe should be capable of every- and anything. That's what makes It God. God can lie. It's God, who's gonna stop It?So again, sorry if I'm coming off pompous, arrogant, condescending or patronizing. I think I'm gonna leave the room, cuz this conversation's not gonna go anwyhere once we start comparing religion and science and debating the validity of each one, or how much weight their respective followers grant the truth of their ideas.

By all means, ask questions. That's how science progresses. But the questions can't be based on falsehoods or demonstrably mistaken logic.That's just the standard definition of theory. Perhaps you should try to familiarize yourself with the concepts of hypothesis, theory, and law.Don't worry, I'll chalk up at least part of this to the hard-to-understand nature of thermodynamics. However, I insist that before you overthink the details, try to wrap your brain around the concept of entropy without relying on "disorder"; having an objective definition removes the "eye of the beholder" problem.Why? Why is the barrier any different than the walls of the remainder of the box? What is wrong with any of these boundaries?Sorry, you have to remember that thermo is a tough subject, so mistakes are common. It was my impression that you were mistaken about what a "state" is, not that you misspoke.Well, gee, if you're talking about marbles knowing or not knowing about empty space...My idea was to dispel the validity of your "matter (here, in the form of marbles) doesn't 'know'" line of argumentation.With that information, you're right: I can't "discredit the existence of God," but I'm not trying to. I'm simply pointing out that mutually exclusive experiences cannot all be caused by a God that isn't a trickster God. This is logic, not science.And you're welcome to your opinion, regardless of how correct you might be.I actually am a very nice guy, but being wishy-washy about someone else's errors isn't as effective as shredding them with no mercy. Sometimes I'm having fun roasting someone who's incredibly wrong, and sometimes I'm trying to teach anyone who will listen. Every now and again, I get both, but I wouldn't consider my last post to you a roasting. Nor would I consider this one such.Baloney. Logic is universal; even should I not be entitled to interpret another's religious experience, I can analyze his or her interpretations. If Alice says that God told her to kill Bob, and Bob says that God told him that nobody should ever kill, how are we to know which person is correct? We have no objective basis for comparison. Every contradictory experience leads to another version of God, such that there are surely hundreds if not thousands or more Gods sending messages... That is, unless experiencers of all but one version are simply mistaken. But then, how are we to know which version is the special version that is representative of reality? Sure, we can't figure which one (if any), but that means that all the others are XXXX. That means that jyoshu's original argument of "consensus" goes out the window.Your only resolution is that God lies (1 Kings 22:23 (also 2 Chron. 18:22), Jer 20:7, 2 Thess. 2:11). Fine, let that be your personal resolution. Most believers feel that God either cannot or does not lie (Num 23:19, Titus 1:1-2). If God lies, once again we are left with no reason to believe any one version of experiences.You see, Yossarian, my points to jyoshu refute his assertion that "consensus" leads us to the conclusion that God exists; they in themselves do not explicitly turn his argument into an argument against the existence of God.

What does this have to do with the definition of entropy?The evidence seems to be that all "real" (i.e. non-quantum) interactions result in a net increase in entropy, so it would seem that the universe's level of entropy is increasing. However, as far as I know, we have no verification that the universe as a whole is either a closed system or appropriately close to thermal equilibrium.I can imagine a scenario in which entropy will asymptotically tend toward a maximum yet never reach a maximium. [ex: Σ(1/2^n)]I have also seen speculation that this tendency could reverse should the universe begin contracting. It is an interesting thought.

That's the way I see it too. Which would tend to mean the universe had a "beginning." Otherwise, total entropy would have already occurred, if the universe were infinitely old.Theoretically, the universe as a whole should be considered a closed system, unless there's some evidence that new matter / energy is being pumped into it from somewhere else.

Even were I to analyze and eventually agree with your argument, all it would show is that the universe had a beginning, which really isn't very disputed. Most scientists think the universe is about 14.7 billion years old.Absolutely correct. In hindsight, I realize that my previous post appeared to include that claim as a counterargument when it was meant more as a technical note.

I think perhaps you're confused.1. I know of no meaningful definion of the term "god' as it pertains to reality.2. When you mention science and history, that implies you are interested in reality.3. There is no evidence to support mythological deities, god or God or Odin or the easter bunny.* So, yes THERE IS NO EVIDENCE of the existence of any mytholgoical gods.** Yes, there is no evidence that the universe was created, or if that statement even has meaning if the universe always was, and always will be.p.s. There is easter bunny.-Mach

Do sufficient science and history in its total amount to enough evidence to conclusively disprove the existence of God? :)

I'm glad someone here understood my point!Contradictions only mean one thing: that there are contradictions. It doesn't show there is no God, and it doesn't devalue or make the religious experiences of billions of people any less valid. (And again, differences and contradictions are not the same thing.) The biggest problem I have with skeptics who use things like the idea that God lies or that he allows contradictions in His Bible or in religious experiences among people is that it tries to make God into the image they think he should be from their moral standpoint. If there is an all-powerful and all-knowing entity that is God, then the moral standards we are under do not necessarily apply to it. It's not that God is bad or hypocritical that he does things he might tell people not to do; it's that he is above and not beholden to any standards of morality at all. The closest analogy there is that I know of to that phenomenon is the way parents have their children bound to rules that they themselves don't have to abide by. Not a perfect analogy, but the best I can come up with for it. That God placed different experiences with people doesn't prove those experiences aren't real, it only says that they are different. Big deal.

Sorry, electrolyte, that I'm just not very intelligent. Forgive me for questioning the holy laws of physics. I guess after all I am a nihilist, or at the least pseudo-Buddhist. This......I don't believe is true. Seems as if that's exactly what it is since you yourself admitted it doesn't apply under all conditions, and especially since "all" is a very big term that could never be proven anyway. That was my whole point, unintelligent as it was, that Science in general is simply a set of hypotheses based on observations that can't ever be proven true in "all" circumstances. Maybe I'm being to metaphysical, maybe I've bounded off into the realm of fantasy but I can't help it. To me, this whole freakin' world is a fantasy. Just when you think you understand it something else comes along and forces you to rethink things.We can talk about that box of marbles all day long and you're never gonna convince me that the idea of entropy increasing is a universal truth. It's in the eye of the beholder. IMO the barrier in that box represents a flaw in the experiment. You can correct my grammar and syntax, too, if it makes ya feel better. It's my fault, since at times I type so fast I don't pay enough attention to exactly how I'm wording things. So this......would've been the correct description; but was likely unecessary as I get the idea you understood what I meant. Thanx for correcting it tho.You can't tell tunnelling electrons a thing, since they have no ears that we can see, and are moving so fast we'd prob'ly sound like turtles on quaaludes to 'em. But if your idea was to compare them to marbles sitting in a box it sounds just silly. Marbles can't move of their own volition. I don't think that was your idea, but who knows? For what it's worth, I think the example you used to was misleading, since it was in response to this comment......by jyoshu.It seemed as if (and forgive, j, if I'm putting words in your mouth; or text under your hand :P ) he was saying that you can't discredit the existence of God, or the possibility that a particular religion has validity compared to "science", just because they don't all agree with each other. But since a religious person isn't ever going to be convinced that any form of science has precedence over God, or that God had nothing to do with setting it all up; and since no atheist will ever be convinced that a Supreme Dude floating on a cloud put him on earth for some obscure reasons of his own, the whole thing is rather pointless. I read your posts here and I think you're very condescending and patronizing, but that's just my opinion.You're probably a very nice guy, but you're coming off in print just a wee bit pompous. I'm probably only saying that cuz I don't want any more arithmetic lessons, lol. I do enough math every day, thnx. I don't wanna do it in the evening too. emoticonXHoho ...to jyoshu.Here's the explanation: Each and every individual on this planet is uniquely qualified to interpret his/her religious experience, bar none. No one is qualifed to interpret another's religious experience validity. God can and maybe should be capable of every- and anything. That's what makes It God. God can lie. It's God, who's gonna stop It?So again, sorry if I'm coming off pompous, arrogant, condescending or patronizing. I think I'm gonna leave the room, cuz this conversation's not gonna go anwyhere once we start comparing religion and science and debating the validity of each one, or how much weight their respective followers grant the truth of their ideas. I'm gonna go get a drink and some fresh air. Good luck, tho, to all.:)

As I said, it doesn't explicitly show that there is no God. But it most certainly devalues religious experiences as reliable representations of reality, unless we institute qualifiers that most experiencers deny (e.g. a trickster God). It's bad enough when stories are inconsistent, but when they are absolutely contrary, why is it any more reasonable to believe that the stories were placed by some supernatural entity rather than by imagination or interesting neurochemistry? (You have yet to satisfactorily respond to my deja vu observation.)Fine, if you'd like to believe that God lies to people all the time, be my guest. Why worship a liar? More importantly, why trust what an admittedly lying God tells you? Why insist that God chose to tell you the truth and lie to others?It is interesting to note that here we get the opposite of the typical fundie claim, because jyoshu is not a fundie. He's saying that skeptics have rational morality systems. Thanks jyoshu.Maybe you'd like to take me up on the thread that marc abandoned? You justify God's misbehavior by decreeing Him to be exempt from misbehavior? How in the hell do you rationalize that? If someone says not to kill and kills, that is the epitome of hypocrisy, and no redefinition of morality will change that.If God decides that it's morally correct to kill a person for, say, working on a Sunday, should you? (Oh wait, He already did.) If God decides to kill people because someone did what God told him to do (David taking the census), that's okay too? If God tells you to kill me, it's okay to kill me? If God says it's okay to kill for fun, it's really okay to kill anyone?

I'm glad someone here understood my point!Contradictions only mean one thing: that there are contradictions. It doesn't show there is no God, and it doesn't devalue or make the religious experiences of billions of people any less valid. (And again, differences and contradictions are not the same thing.) The biggest problem I have with skeptics who use things like the idea that God lies or that he allows contradictions in His Bible or in religious experiences among people is that it tries to make God into the image they think he should be from their moral standpoint. If there is an all-powerful and all-knowing entity that is God, then the moral standards we are under do not necessarily apply to it. It's not that God is bad or hypocritical that he does things he might tell people not to do; it's that he is above and not beholden to any standards of morality at all.

Big deal.

What the contradictions DO show is that the different writers had different viewpoints and theologies, and therefore were not getting their beliefs via an infallible pipeline to "GOD". That fallsifies certain of the fundamentalist claims.

Your welcome.Don't misunderstand; I DO believe there is a very real single way to God. Differences in understanding that are not because God has failed or lied, but because people (who have the autonomy of freedom of choice) have failed in accepting or seeking out the correct message. It seems that skeptics want there to be a God that gives people freedom, but then they criticize Him for letting people pick or misunderstand the wrong paths. The same way a parent sometimes does things that his/her kids don't understand and don't get to do.You're the kid who's whining because his parent is doing things that you've been told not to do. Maybe there's a really valid reason (one that you just can't understand) for Dad to have the family dog killed. You're inability or refusal to understand that possibility does not dictate what the higher power gets to do. You view it as misbehavior because it looks that way from your vantage point--a VERY limited one compared to an omniscient God. If God were limited to the moral standards of mankind, He would not be God.Are you a parent? If so, would you let your young child play with a firearm to kill the rabid dog or not? YOU certainly can, but it would be unreasonable to allow your 4-year old to do that. (The dog may not look rabid to the 4-year old, who has no understanding that dad is protecting the kid from a future event where the dog bites.) What I'm saying is that you aren't allowing for the understanding that God is all-knowing and there are issues and knowledge about things He does that we aren't necessarily privy to. That's not to say you can't criticize him, but at least know that you're doing so from your limited vantage point. Your criticisms mean nothing because He is God and there is nothing you can do about that. Do you really think it damages or reduces God in some way for you to pass moral judgement on it? Do you really think He's any less because you don't believe in him or choose not to follow Him?

But Christianity is based on the principles that are unified throughout scripture. There are certain priniciples in Christianity that are consistent throughout ALL the Christian books. For instance, Paul is in agreement with the gospel writers from the gospels AND Acts about the validity of the ressurection and from Matthew through Revelation, the ressurection is a theme at various points. That is not a contradiction, it is an agreement. You're focusing on contradictions as if that matters to the validity of Christianity (which isn't based on the contradictions!). The main matters that all Christians believe are matters that scripture mostly (if not all) is in harmony on. You're arguing the exceptions over the rule here, a problem I see a lot among skeptics.But more to you point, "Infallible" by the way, means a lot of different things to different people. Some view that term as meaning the scriptures cannot contain any error whatsoever. Others view it as a spiritual and thematic infallibility, that the Bible truly is infallible in terms of getting it's message across and serving as the Word of God. That's the view I hold to and I think it's more mainstream than the fundamentalism you criticize.

On the other hand, the fact that everyone on the planet is susceptible to certain optical illusions does not make those phenomena real, or imbue our misperception with validity. Rather, it demonstrates an interesting discrepancy between perception and reality, which can itself be scientifically investigated. Or consider our once-universal belief that illnesses were the result of 'evil spirits'. All the microscopes in the world can't prove that spirits don't exist, but through them we have observed far better candidates for the cause of our ailments. Any informed individual who persists in clinging to the wholly unnecessary contrivance of evil spirits to explain disease is rightly regarded as an idiot.Similarly, religion's prevalence in a world which, whenever it is tested, behaves just as you would expect a world with no deity to behave, can be interpreted in two ways. Either there really is a god, telling different groups of people to behave in different ways and cleverly misleading our most penetrating scientific investigations for reasons we cannot presently fathom, or we all have something in common which can plausibly and reliably give rise to deism and religion, even if individual faiths superficially differ.So, do we? Well, yes, we do. To put it crudely, all you need to start a religion is a whole bunch of scared, ignorant people and one guy pretending he isn't, both of which the history of humanity has suffered in abundance. Or if you prefer a value-neutral description, there are a number of demonstrable, success-selected traits within human nature which - together with our conscious ability to perceive and exploit those traits - make human society fertile soil for persistent superstition.None of these facts prove god doesn't exist, but they are the bacteria that science's microscope exposes to the unprejudiced eye.As a footnote, it's worth observing that as science has improved our ability to model reality, so the nature of god has evolved to accommodate it. Once upon a time gods were people or entities you could meet, and who had a direct and tangible effect on our day-to-day lives. The gods who survive today cling to the possibility of existence in the vaporous, fatuous realm of the merely undisprovable, alongside the Flying Spaghetti Monster and the sentient aubergine at the centre of the earth, long may his purple majesty endure.

Again you're interpreting it from a fundamentally deist perspective. We're not saying god's wrong or inconsistent; we're saying he doesn't exist and you're wrong.You're sort of missing the whole point of not believing in something. I don't think god is damaged by me passing moral judgement upon him, mostly because he doesn't exist but also because that's not what I'm doing. I'm passing moral judgement on your acceptance of the kind of god you describe. There's a monstrous inconsistency at the heart of your arguments here, jyoshu. On the one hand you defend your branch of christianity as a selective, moderate interpretation of the bible, taking only the good and consistent from its teachings and eschewing the rest. That is the root of its virtue. Yet you immediately turn upon electrolyte and demand who he is to question the morality of god! God makes the rules, according to you; his morality supercedes ours. On what basis, then, have you chosen to reinterpret his holy word?Do you really think the god of the fundamentalists is damaged or reduced in some way by you passing moral judgement on it? Do you really think he's any less because you don't believe in him or choose not to follow him? And this time it's not a silly question, because you're not an unbeliever.

Belief in the biblical creation account comes with a set of rules and regulations on how you and everyone else around you should be living their lives. Also believing in the biblical account stops the thought process and halts the ability to learn. You and those who share your beliefs are not condemned by those who think differently, unless of course you go out of your way to tell them that they are condemned for not thinking like you. Which is quite common. Praise Jesus and let those who choose to think differently alone.

I guess that answers it. You are unable to identify which specific hominid / species immediately preceeded modern man. Yet you basically believe there was one. With such great faith as that, how are you able to cast stones at the Biblical creation account?

Nope, but your apparent tunnel-vision dedication to the suspect formulations of evolution obviously halt your learning about God and his ways. No one's stopping you. This is the religious forum, though, so if you choose to stick around you will be hearing more about all this. Your call.

I think that view (Jesus as being true) is more of a literalist view than necessarily a fundamentalist one. Fundamentalism and literalism isn't necessarily the same thing, because fundamentalism contains views that aren't even in the Bible (emphasis of total abstinence from alcohol, for example). Very few people these days use "fundamentalism" in the sense of 'the fundamentals' of Christianity. What they really mean with the term is the far right extreme of the religion. The term is usually defined by the stigma, not the root of the word. Fred Phelps, IMO, epitomizes fundamentalism in it's most nasty form.That's the way I see it. If you believe that Jesus was true (in the sense that he lived, died, and rose again) you are clearly in the mainstream of Christianity on that because that's a mainstream Christian view.

But this results in any experience being "evidence" for the existence of God. If I inexplicably get a strong inkling that there's no God, your logic writes it off as God trying to tell me something and that I'm just misinterpreting it. So I'll come back to one of my original questions: Why are "religious" experiences any more meaningful that any other experiences? Your explanation for this is unfalsifiable ad hoccery.From your above response, I'm now contemplating whether your argument is circular. You attribute these experiences, whatever they might be, to fallible human-influenced interpretation of influences ultimately caused by God. Then you say that these experiences prove God's existence. How can you justify either of these propositions?Well, I can't speak for all skeptics, but the only thing I want is to know the truth. But your statement is contradictory anyway: why would an atheist "want" God to have certain characteristics? The atheist doesn't believe in God at all!This isn't analogous, because no parent claims to be exempt from all misbehavior. Your scenario relieves God of any standards whatsoever.If I choose to shoot a rabid dog instead of letting someone else do it, it would be because I'm a better shot, or because I'm less likely to be injured by the gun, or somesuch. However, this is beside the point; the issue is whether it is morally right to shoot the rabid dog. If it's morally right for me to shoot a rabid dog, then it's morally right for someone else to shoot the rabid dog. It's not as if I'm saying it's morally right for me to kill someone without cause but it's not morally right for you to do the same.This is just a rewording of the "God works in mysterious ways" argument. It's absolutely unfounded and completely unfalsifiable (by design, mind you).

Differences in understanding that are not because God has failed or lied, but because people (who have the autonomy of freedom of choice) have failed in accepting or seeking out the correct message. It seems that skeptics want there to be a God that gives people freedom, but then they criticize Him for letting people pick or misunderstand the wrong paths. The same way a parent sometimes does things that his/her kids don't understand and don't get to do.You're the kid who's whining because his parent is doing things that you've been told not to do. Maybe there's a really valid reason (one that you just can't understand) for Dad to have the family dog killed. You're inability or refusal to understand that possibility does not dictate what the higher power gets to do. You view it as misbehavior because it looks that way from your vantage point--a VERY limited one compared to an omniscient God. If God were limited to the moral standards of mankind, He would not be God.Are you a parent? If so, would you let your young child play with a firearm to kill the rabid dog or not? YOU certainly can, but it would be unreasonable to allow your 4-year old to do that. (The dog may not look rabid to the 4-year old, who has no understanding that dad is protecting the kid from a future event where the dog bites.) What I'm saying is that you aren't allowing for the understanding that God is all-knowing and there are issues and knowledge about things He does that we aren't necessarily privy to. That's not to say you can't criticize him, but at least know that you're doing so from your limited vantage point. Your criticisms mean nothing because He is God and there is nothing you can do about that. Do you really think it damages or reduces God in some way for you to pass moral judgement on it? Do you really think He's any less because you don't believe in him or choose not to follow Him?

Or rejecting it.Again, the only thing we have to go on regarding this is that the people who have them claim them to be more meaningful. If that alone is not enough regarding their experiences in your thinking, then there's nothing more I can show you on the matter. However, since religion is something experienced on an individual level, I tend to lean toward giving people the benefit of the doubt, myself. I don't find the need to see people prove their religious experiences beyond what they tell me, simply because it really can't be proven or disproven either way. See, the bottom-line problem I have with your view on this is that, ultimately, it's you trying to tell people that you know better about their experiences than they themselves do, even though you've never had the experience.No, not exactly. I attribute them to God, and we as humans sometimes mess things up in a.) understanding them or b.) missing the message. The equation changes to a huge degree because people have to have freedom. That's the 800 lb elephant here. If God didn't allow for people the freedom to reject a message, or to not follow it to its conclusions, then it would just be like humanity running a step-by-step computer program. Your response avoids the heart of what I said. Let me reprhase it then, in a way that doesn't allow you to appeal to a broader atheist stance to avoid the issue: It seems that skeptics use the possibility of a God that does not give people freedom to criticize religion, but then they criticize religion for the idea of a God letting people pick or misunderstand the wrong paths. A God who gives people freedom has to allow them to screw up.No, it may NOT be morally right for someone else (your KIDS) to shoot the dog, because they may not have the maturity to safely handle the firearm. What I'm trying to get you to see here is that in dealing with an omniscient God, there are going to be factors we aren't privy to regarding what look to us like atrocities committed by God. Parents have freedoms, moral freedoms, that kids don't have. That's just the way it works. Now I realize this isn't a perfect analogy, but hopefully it will at least show you where I'm coming from here.Absolutely! And because God, according to religion, is omniscient, the fact He "works in mysteroius ways" is an unavoidable matter. I'm simply showing you WHY religious people hold to this view of God that He is not necessarily bound by the moral standards He sets for humanity.

But this results in any experience being "evidence" for the existence of God. If I inexplicably get a strong inkling that there's no God, your logic writes it off as God trying to tell me something and that I'm just misinterpreting it. So I'll come back to one of my original questions: Why are "religious" experiences any more meaningful that any other experiences? Your explanation for this is unfalsifiable ad hoccery.From your above response, I'm now contemplating whether your argument is circular. You attribute these experiences, whatever they might be, to fallible human-influenced interpretation of influences ultimately caused by God. Then you say that these experiences prove God's existence. How can you justify either of these propositions?Well, I can't speak for all skeptics, but the only thing I want is to know the truth. But your statement is contradictory anyway: why would an atheist "want" God to have certain characteristics? The atheist doesn't believe in God at all!This isn't analogous, because no parent claims to be exempt from all misbehavior. Your scenario relieves God of any standards whatsoever.If I choose to shoot a rabid dog instead of letting someone else do it, it would be because I'm a better shot, or because I'm less likely to be injured by the gun, or somesuch. However, this is beside the point; the issue is whether it is morally right to shoot the rabid dog. If it's morally right for me to shoot a rabid dog, then it's morally right for someone else to shoot the rabid dog. It's not as if I'm saying it's morally right for me to kill someone without cause but it's not morally right for you to do the same.This is just a rewording of the "God works in mysterious ways" argument. It's absolutely unfounded and completely unfalsifiable (by design, mind you).

Only to you it can't, because of the god-wall in your head. We demonstrate illusion and misperception by measuring reality and allowing what we discover to overrule our subjective perception. We allow the possibility that our senses are decieving us. The same kind of research can and has been carried out in the religious domain.I apologise profoundly for making such a thoughtless statement. I was using the 'idiot believing in evil spirits' example to illustrate how thoroughly some once-universal beliefs have been debunked without ever actually proving them untrue. People back then were not XXXXXX for believing in evil spirits; such ideas made sense in a world without microscopes. Similarly I would not today describe someone as an idiot for being religious - but that does not mean there will never come a day when the last few adherents deserve to be.Since you bring it up, the 'effectiveness of prayer' example is particularly apt. Everyone 'knows' it works, based on anecdote and doctrine, yet its power mysteriously melts away when measured. The largest, best-controlled and best-funded study, supported by the pro-religion Templeton foundation, found that prayer had no statistical effect if the recipient was unaware of it, and actually made matters worse if they knew (possibly because of anxiety caused by thinking they needed praying for).Were we discussing the effectiveness of a drug treatment, or a surgical operation, you would not hesitate to accept the results of such a study. Yet because this is prayer, you will apply some evasive reasoning to explain why your beliefs are still right, ignoring the fact you would be trumpeting that same study from the rooftops if it had supported your position.Nevertheless, the world as it appears to operate does not require a sentient, omnipotent overmind, and nor does any appeal to any deity appear to have the slightest effect on it. You can redefine god to make the universe require one if you like, but a god of quarks and quanta and relativity and physical constants does not imply a god of salvation and redemption and concern for human affairs, and it is that kind of god for which there is no evidence or requirement in the operation of the universe.My premise is solid: you believe in a sentient god interested in the affairs of man, for which there is not the slightest evidence in the day-to-day operation of reality. Would you care to address the rest of my point now?I agree I don't always get the tone exactly right. I'll try to do better :)It isn't me missing the point. And I think if you do a headcount you'll find that the 'mainstream' interpretation of the bible is that it's just an old book. Remember to include everyone.You're happy to tell me, as a non-christian, that my opinion of god - my judgement of his behaviour and teachings - doesn't impact on the 'reality' of him, but when I observe that your own faith is also based upon your opinion of what the 'right' interpretation of the bible should be, that's somehow different. Thus I ask again: Do you think your belief that you are interpreting the bible correctly makes that interpretation more likely to be correct than the fundamentalist one?And if so, why? I firmly believe my interpretation of the bible is correct. EZ does the same. How shall we compare 'firmness'? Because I should warn you: I have weight of numbers.

Optical illusions CAN be proven as unreal, measuring light, showing differences, similiarities, etc. Religious experience can't.Well that's your smugly (and slightly offensive) scientific opinion. On the other hand, billions of people believe in the effectiveness of prayer in helping ailments, so perhaps by your standards there are a lot more "XXXXXX" in the world than you realize.How could you possibly know whether or not this is the case? I don't agree with this premise of yours to begin with and so I will not proceed with addressing the rest of this point of yours. in dealing with this premise, you have no way of knowing if the world behaves the same way with or without a deity, because you don't even know whether there is a deity or not.Wow, more condescending offensiveness on your part. Really, you're above this sort of thing and I think you'd find (as well as the scientific community in general) that this sort of rhetoric only hurts your attempts to convince religious people that they are wrong. It may be the way you feel about religion, but all I can say to the tactic is that you are dealing with things that people hold deeply sacred and dear. You might as well, for instance, be insulting people by making light of their feelings about their deceased relatives in terms of how people take this sort of things sacredly. That's what frustrates me the most by your movement--it simply tends to be, well, mean. Not in it's content and points, but in the way those points are made because it makes light of and makes fun of things that people take very dearly. I have no problems with what you're saying (other than I disagree, but that's normal debate and discourse). I DO have a problem with tactics like that and the lack of sensitivity. There's just no need to do that. With that out of the way, let me now deal with your point . . .This is is only true in part because some gods and spirits were considered such long ago as well, and some gods today are still viewed as human (christ is one such example). They just don't view the human-god 'as being among us.' However I agree with you to some extent, at least in your observations. I don't see that as demonstrating any weakness in religion however; I don't see that it devalues religion in any way that greek thinking ("spiritual existence") and the enlightenment effected religion. In fact there is a vein of thinking in religion that would say such reasoning is a gift of God in and of itself to help us understand things better. Seems reasonable to me.That's not the basis of the argument I was responding to, which is why I didn't respond based on what you're saying. In fact, the comment you're referring to wasn't a response to you at all, but someone else's post.Wow, you've really missed the point here. The point isn't that the 'god of the fundamentalists' is immoral--the point is that it's innaccurate. It's out of the mainstream of Christianity in terms of interpretation. You'd like to hold the fundie perspective up as a standard because it suits your desire to emphasize inconsistencies out-of-balance, but it's simply not. Again, it's arguing the exception over the rule.

Ah yes. This study has been dealt with here in the forums before at length by myself and others. The problem with your intepretation of the results is this. It measures prayer in the sense of working like a drug. But prayer is nothing more than asking God to intervene. It is NOT the prayer itself that does the healing. If there are 100 people, and 1 person out of that group is affected by prayer and the other 99 are not, then prayer has worked because there is more healing than has taken place than would be otherwise. In other words, even healing, to ANY degree by prayer, means that it has been effective. So if person A is prayed for but doesn't get better, and person B is prayed for and does, then we might as well assume that prayer works even though person A didn't get better. See what I mean? In other words the fact that person A didn't get better doesn't mean that prayer doesn't work. It's a glass half empty/half full issue. So once again, skeptics are stuck with the same problem that they can't truly prove prayer doesn't work. There's really no way to truly disprove it. I'd also say there's no way to prove it's effectiveness as well, but I believe it is your side that seeks for definitive proof on this issue given that for some reason the study is often held up as proof prayer doesn't work by people such as yourself.You're right that I would not hesitate to agree on a study of a drug treatment; but that sort of system can't work on prayer for the reasons I just gave. Prayer is something that is hoped will work to ANY degree, so if 1 out of 99 get better in a test after being prayed for, then prayer has worked. Now you will probably come back and say that such standards of thinking 1 out of 99 being good results is absurd, and it would be if it were a drug. But we're talking about prayer where ANY degree of divine intervention would be welcome. Again, you are making claims that you cannot possibly know for sure. From the cohesive force within atoms to the unknown of exactly how gravity works (normally called "a property of matter"), there is plenty you can't account for. And even with what IS there to account for, what's to say you aren't looking at the mechanism rather than the root? I'm quite comfortable with the idea that the laws of physics are means by which God maintains the universe. No, this can't be proven, but so what? Religion is not, nor ever has been about proof. The problem is that you view it as inferior or a weaker state of thinking as a result of that difference in emphasis. And therein really lies the root of problems between the scientific and religious communities, IMO. Of coruse, but I wasn't talking about mainstream in the sense of all 6 billion of the world's population. I said specifically "out of the mainstream of Christianity."Look; you keep holding up differences of interpretation like it's an issue here. What I don't think you must realize is that what I view as standard interpretation cannot possibly be questioned reasonably with any reasonable reading of the NT. There really does come a point where when someone interprets differently what is read, that it is rather obvious the interpretation is erroneous. It's not like the Bible doesn't say, for instance that Christ ressurrected. It's there, plain as day. Someone cannot reasonably read the New testament for what it says and come away thinking that the Bible doesn't mean to say Christ ressurrected. As I pointed out to Trebor recently, Christianity has been built on the unifying factors of the Bible, so it's odd to me that someone would hold up discrepancies as a sign of weakness in the religion. Like it or not, there really is sound reason to think that some things are more correctly intepreted a certain way. And these are the consistent matters of the Christian faith.Fundamentalist views are the less accurate IMO, because they deviate from what is written. For instance, a common Christian fundamentalist understanding of scripture is that a Christian should not drink alcohol. However, that's not what the scriptures say; they say one should avoid drunkenness and excess. So yes, I believe my interpretations are more correct, and I believe the reason is that mine (more the mainstream Christian one, IMO) is truer to what the Bible actually says in the New Testament.

Are you saying:If you pray the same for two people and only one gets better we conclude1. The person who got better did so because of prayer and prayer works2. The person who didn't get better prayer just didn't happen to work this time, but still conclude that prayer works.Can you at least see from a point of view of someone who has never heard of prayer that this is ludicrous?Can you see why this line of "thinking" is criticized?I am struggling to see any way that anyone, even a devout person who believes in God, could come to this conclusion.You are asserting that "prayer has worked"? Not prayer might have worked or I like to believe that prayer worked even if it doesn't make any sense.You see how it is impossible to view this from a stance of reason without calling that assertion quite simply illogical and unreasonable?

This wholly ignores my point. Any experience then qualifies as "evidence" for God. I find a dollar bill on the ground: God silently directed me to find it. I'm hungry: God's sending me a message that I should eat. I stub my toe: God loves me. I think God's telling me that there is no God: God is hungry and has stubbed His toe picking up a dollar bill on His way to the refrigerator....Again, you've built your case to be unfalsifiable: x was (believed to be, mistaken or not,) experienced, therefore God exists.If, as you insist, "religious experiences" are often misinterpreted, why should we assume that they're related to religion at all? Why can we conclude that my hunger means that God wants me to eat? In fact, why don't we assume that that eerie feeling I got at church wasn't my brain remembering that time I stubbed my toe? If humans' interpretation of these inklings is so lousy, how can you justify explaining them by using rose-tinted glasses?And this could mean any number of things, many of which are more logical than believing in a supernatural idea-implanter. Natural human overemphasis due to rarity comes quickly to mind. Logical extension of preexisting indoctrination is a close second.I'm not surprised.That's your prerogative, but you'll notice that your reasoning is based on that which you assume: that "religious experiences" exist and are personal.Perhaps not prove or disprove, but I can toss in a monkey wrench that you will find terribly hard to explain. Neuroscientists have found that stimulation of a certain region of the brain induces the subject to undergo what the subject describes as a religious experience. I don't have a source handy, but I know it was mentioned on this forum, if you'd like me to locate it. Does God watch these experimenters and decide to work his mojo at the precise times that they stimulate the brain, then stop upon their cessation? That is the necessary logical consequence of your position.It could be that, or it could be that I'm better at interpreting "experiences" than they are. After all, you say most are lousy at it...Or I could just whip out the deja vu thing that you seem to keep avoiding, then -- depending on your response -- say the same thing.But seriously, I'm telling people no such thing. Instead, I'm saying that there is no logical reason to believe that God is the source of these experiences, for reasons explained at length above. I don't have to know a thing about their actual experiences. Irrelevant to this particular conversation; your point here is consistent with your previous points but does nothing to further your position. It does raise other curious questions, however, such as: Why does God send messages that He knows will be misinterpreted? Why not send different messages that He knows will be misinterpreted in a way that results in the correct interpretation? If God doesn't want program-running humanity, why does He provide programs? Worse, why does He provide programs that He knows will not work properly?If you would like to address these questions, feel free, but I suggest doig so in another thread. (Not that I can make you do so or would even loudly object if you did otherwise.) They're included here just as examples of things you'd need to resolve in order to maintain the consistency of your position.Not at all. If we can attribute any trait to God and show that that trait results in contradiction, we have shown that there cannot be a God who has that trait. It does not show that absolutely no God exists. However, logical arguments deny God so many of the basic claims of Christianity; if the "God of Christianity" has traits a, b, c, etc., and we show that no God can have trait a (or, say, no God can have both trait a and trait c), then we've ruled out the existence of the "God of Christianity." If you want to change the traits your God possesses in order to resolve the logical inconsistencies, feel free, but you'll end up with an awfully impotent God.Whether it is safe for "my KIDS" to handle a firearm is not a question of morality. Do not confuse questions of safety or wisdom with questions of morality. The question is whether shooting the rabid dog is moral. It is completely independent of the shooter.I hope that was the extent of your intent, because you certainly haven't shown it to be logical to hold to this view of God... The "God works in mysterious ways" argument is, of course, unfalsifiable.

I've read about it already. By that logic, then you might as well be questioning whether drugs really work as well and that perhaps drugs are being pumped into the brain at those precise times as well. See, just because one form of external stimulation is taking place (the experimenters) doesn't mean other forms of stimulation (drug hallucinations, supernatural visions from God) don't also take place. The stimulation of the brain speaks to the stimulation of the brain, and that's all!I'm sorry, but I just haven't seen you do this. All you've done is take examples of "good" and say they are inconsistent with examples of "evil" that you also read in the scriptures, but there are so many problems with that method on your part that it loses it's teeth and doesn't even work. From the disregard of context, to ignoring what I've been telling you that an omniscient God would have reasons to do things we aren't privy to, you've neglected very key points. And then there's the whole issue of assuming God should be beholden to a higher standard of morality than He is to begin with. Logic is useful, but only if you consider ALL the factors.Of course it is! Because it would be immoral for you to let them take that action if they can't handle a firearm--they might hurt themselves! But the point is that God . . . er, the parent doesn't let the kid shoot the dog but does so himself is because he/she has good reasons for doing so that the kids don't understand. Heck, the kids don't even WANT the dog killed. To them it seems downright vindictive and evil of God . . . er, the parent, to shoot an innocent dog. What kind of parent would do that sort of thing? Why, those kids might even decide they'd rather not even follow such a mean parent. And it's certainly inconsistent with all the good things the parent supposedly does! An absolute logical inconsistency to the kids.

I don't have a source handy, but I know it was mentioned on this forum, if you'd like me to locate it. Does God watch these experimenters and decide to work his mojo at the precise times that they stimulate the brain, then stop upon their cessation? That is the necessary logical consequence of your position.It could be that, or it could be that I'm better at interpreting "experiences" than they are. After all, you say most are lousy at it...Or I could just whip out the deja vu thing that you seem to keep avoiding, then -- depending on your response -- say the same thing.But seriously, I'm telling people no such thing. Instead, I'm saying that there is no logical reason to believe that God is the source of these experiences, for reasons explained at length above. I don't have to know a thing about their actual experiences. Irrelevant to this particular conversation; your point here is consistent with your previous points but does nothing to further your position. It does raise other curious questions, however, such as: Why does God send messages that He knows will be misinterpreted? Why not send different messages that He knows will be misinterpreted in a way that results in the correct interpretation? If God doesn't want program-running humanity, why does He provide programs? Worse, why does He provide programs that He knows will not work properly?If you would like to address these questions, feel free, but I suggest doig so in another thread. (Not that I can make you do so or would even loudly object if you did otherwise.) They're included here just as examples of things you'd need to resolve in order to maintain the consistency of your position.Not at all. If we can attribute any trait to God and show that that trait results in contradiction, we have shown that there cannot be a God who has that trait. It does not show that absolutely no God exists. However, logical arguments deny God so many of the basic claims of Christianity; if the "God of Christianity" has traits a, b, c, etc., and we show that no God can have trait a (or, say, no God can have both trait a and trait c), then we've ruled out the existence of the "God of Christianity." If you want to change the traits your God possesses in order to resolve the logical inconsistencies, feel free, but you'll end up with an awfully impotent God.Whether it is safe for "my KIDS" to handle a firearm is not a question of morality. Do not confuse questions of safety or wisdom with questions of morality. The question is whether shooting the rabid dog is moral. It is completely independent of the shooter.I hope that was the extent of your intent, because you certainly haven't shown it to be logical to hold to this view of God... The "God works in mysterious ways" argument is, of course, unfalsifiable.

You can't. How is that relevant? I never said you can truly know in the sense of measuring it. In fact, I'd say that the fact you can't know it invalidates the study mentioned about that tried to "know" whether prayer works or not. The point here is that the study mentioned above doesn't prove or disprove anything about prayer. Whether we can know for sure that prayer heals to ANY degree is a separate debate.It might be. Again, we can't know for sure, but so what? If there's the remotest possibility of any degree of healing as a result of it, why not pray? What are you going to do, tell a parent of a terminally ill child to not bother praying when there's nothing else the doctors can do?No, I'm saying it hasn't been proven NOT to work. It hasn't been disproven. I'm not out to prove prayer works. The premise set forth here by Peeling was that the study DISPROVES prayer. I'm saying that it does not. That's ALL I'm saying. You're confusing the idea of showing something about prayer is not disproven with the idea of proving prayer.

I hesitate to go here again, but this is intriguing.How can you possibly know this?How do you know if anyone has been affected by prayer? "there is more healing than has taken place than would be otherwise" How can you know that?Are you assuming any healing that takes place in a person who was prayed for is due to the prayer?How do you know that healing did not take place in spite of the prayer?I truly am not trying to be insulting, and I really want to understand this, but this is mind-boggling to me. Are you saying:If you pray the same for two people and only one gets better we conclude1. The person who got better did so because of prayer and prayer works2. The person who didn't get better prayer just didn't happen to work this time, but still conclude that prayer works.Can you at least see from a point of view of someone who has never heard of prayer that this is ludicrous?Can you see why this line of "thinking" is criticized?I am struggling to see any way that anyone, even a devout person who believes in God, could come to this conclusion.You are asserting that "prayer has worked"? Not prayer might have worked or I like to believe that prayer worked even if it doesn't make any sense.You see how it is impossible to view this from a stance of reason without calling that assertion quite simply illogical and unreasonable?

This is not what I'm arguing. You are claiming that all religious experiences are caused by God. I have given an example of "religious experiences" being caused by humans that subjects can't tell apart from "the real thing." Unless you posit that God worked in tandem with the experimenters as a resolution, why are we to assume that God is responsible for every experience? Any number of things could stimulate the brain, from drugs to food to existing neurochemistry.Realizing that there are chemical mechanisms for the effects of drugs in no way denies that drugs have effects. People can hallucinate without drugs, but we don't deny that some drugs cause hallucinations. Or take my deja vu example: Does the feeling of deja vu show that I can't experience anything twice? Does my experiencing anything twice show that I must not experience deja vu? Why is this different than the God/experience relationship? Because we have scientific evidence for the effect of drugs, and because we can compare our past actions with our feeling of deja vu. You have no evidence that God causes even some experiences, let alone all of them, so why can you argue that God causes all of them?a = God has absolute foreknowledge of eventsb = God gives us free willThere's a discussion essentially like this one going on right now...Contradiction is damning. You're defining God as being immune to contradiction, and your rationale for doing so is flawed. See below.You've gone off your rocker here, jyoshu. If the question is whether it is moral for my kids instead of me to shoot the dog, then the dog has nothing to do with it. The question would become whether it is moral for my kids to shoot a gun, be it at a firing range or a charging bear.This is a completely separate issue, namely whether it is moral to subject people to danger. In this case, it has nothing at all to do with the gun, or even the dog, does it?Then the parent has done a lousy job of instilling his or her kids with common sense. The parent apparently has also done a lousy job of explaining that the kid is not allowed to shoot the dog for safety reasons, not because it's morally wrong to kill the dog.

I've read about it already. By that logic, then you might as well be questioning whether drugs really work as well and that perhaps drugs are being pumped into the brain at those precise times as well. See, just because one form of external stimulation is taking place (the experimenters) doesn't mean other forms of stimulation (drug hallucinations, supernatural visions from God) don't also take place. The stimulation of the brain speaks to the stimulation of the brain, and that's all!I'm sorry, but I just haven't seen you do this. All you've done is take examples of "good" and say they are inconsistent with examples of "evil" that you also read in the scriptures, but there are so many problems with that method on your part that it loses it's teeth and doesn't even work. From the disregard of context, to ignoring what I've been telling you that an omniscient God would have reasons to do things we aren't privy to, you've neglected very key points. And then there's the whole issue of assuming God should be beholden to a higher standard of morality than He is to begin with. Logic is useful, but only if you consider ALL the factors.Of course it is! Because it would be immoral for you to let them take that action if they can't handle a firearm--they might hurt themselves! But the point is that God . . . er, the parent doesn't let the kid shoot the dog but does so himself is because he/she has good reasons for doing so that the kids don't understand. Heck, the kids don't even WANT the dog killed. To them it seems downright vindictive and evil of God . . . er, the parent, to shoot an innocent dog. What kind of parent would do that sort of thing? Why, those kids might even decide they'd rather not even follow such a mean parent. And it's certainly inconsistent with all the good things the parent supposedly does! An absolute logical inconsistency to the kids.

Well, if a given experience wasn't caused by God, then it's not truly a religious experience, now is it? I never suggested there aren't cases where some think they have a religious experience and they might be in fact having something else. Nevertheless, that doesn't disprove that real religious experiences happen. But IMO God DOES cause all the truly religious experiences. If it's anything else, then it's not really a religious experience. Well, I think if your interest is truly to disprove religious experience (and that does seem to be your goal here), you'd need to find other causes on a case-by-case basis. If someone claims a religious experience soon after drinking peyote, then I'd say there's a very good chance it wasn't a truly religious experience. But if someone claims to have had a religious experience, and no other cause can be found, then I see no problem with giving them the benefit of the doubt. But I don't see any way to make any sort of sweeping conclusive judgement that all religious experience all over the world in every case is invalid. But you aren't taking into account human perceptions. You aren't taking into account what I've been telling you now for several posts that what we see as a contradiction there may be a good reason for from God's perspective. (the God-looks-evil-sometimes-argument). So in essense, you're arguing this from the perspective that God isn't omniscient at all, and that's not what religious people generally believe.But it IS morally wrong for the KID to kill the dog. Sigh. Never mind. This is getting no where because you're now quibbling over details in the analogy. I'm going to assume that, like any normal person that you would not give a shotgun to a 4-year-old (who can't possibly really understand the situation of a rabid dog and sees it as a pet) and so I think you probably understand my point here completely, and are at this point just being beligerent. I can't imagine that you do not understand the point I'm making here.Have a good day.

And finally you have acknowledged the problem. You have defined "religious experience" as an experience caused by God. In other words, you're saying that those experiences caused by God are experiences caused by God, and those that aren't caused by God aren't caused by God. Yet you have no criterion for determining which experiences were caused by God and which were caused by other factors. See also below.This is the classic fallacy of argument from ignorance. We don't know, therefore Goddidit. There is a logical problem with this, even if you don't see it.'Twasn't my argument. You can't show that a single "religious experience" is valid. If I can't show that gremlins exist, and you can't show that gremlins don't exist, should I believe in gremlins? Even if there was a "consensus" about gremlins existing, shall we conclude that gremlins exist?I don't have to; strictly by basic principles of logic your argument is flawed.No, I recognize fully well that this is your argument. My point is that the universality of this argument is its downfall: you can claim that any and every action that God takes is justified, even were it bad. Presume there were some action x that would be wrong (by His standards) for God to perform. If God did perform action x, your justification would still hold that God's action was not wrong. Your justification is therefore an unreliable assessment of whether God's actions are right or wrong.No, this is getting nowhere because you refuse to recognize the difference between shooting a dog and endangering a child.No, you are viewing things using only a single factor: absolute morality/immorality. You are ignoring why the action is moral or immoral.Let's use another scenario to expose the flaw: Say a six-year old has been taught how to recognize a dangerous, rabid dog. He has not been trained to use a gun properly. He sees a dangerous, rabid dog while his parents are not around. He grabs a gun and shoots the dog, killing it. Was the boy's action immoral?No, the boy's action, however dangerous, was not immoral.Is an experienced marskman shooting a harmless, healthy dog immoral? (Yes.)Is an experienced marskman shooting a dangerous dog immoral? (No.)Is an inexperienced child firing a gun immoral? (No.)Is giving an inexperienced child a gun to fire immoral? (Yes.)And appropriately,Is an inexperienced child shooting a dangerous dog immoral? (No.)Is giving an inexperienced child a gun with which to shoot a dangerous dog immoral? (Yes.)I do understand your point. I just understand that (and why) your point is flawed, and you don't.

No, no, no.I wasn’t talking about the study (but I will in a sec), I was talking about how you view the world. How you observe something and what information you take from that. You said something to the effect that if you prayed for 100 people, and only 1 got better, then that could mean that prayer had an effect.Well it could. But so could an infinite number of things, and they would be no more or less likely. Anything could have had an effect, but I would have no way to know that. And I wouldn’t hang my hat on it. As such I could make no statement about the effect of any of those things, including prayer. Therefore, I should have no belief in my mind and heart about what had an effect on that one person getting better. I could say, I like to believe that prayer had an effect, or it makes me feel good to believe that prayer had an effect, but there is no way I could know with any degree of certainty that prayer had anything to do with it. And if that is the case and that is how you feel, why would you put any reliance in the value of prayer over anything else?Now, about the study. You made a distinction between a study that uses prayer to heal versus one that would use a drug. When you study something scientifically, the world doesn’t change. The scientific experiment is only a structured way of observing the world, because when we look at the world the way we do every day, there is a whole lot going on to confuse us into thinking something may be happening that in truth is not. When you pray for someone or if you give them a drug, the universe still behaves the same in both circumstances. You mentioned something about the study disproving something. Science never does disprove anything, nor can it. It can’t prove anything for that matter. The basic premise of an interventional study such as this is that the world behaves the same with or without an intervention. The intervention may affect the outcome, but it didn’t alter the way the world behaves day in and day out. So the given, or null hypothesis, is that there will be no difference between people who get prayed for and people who don’t. To believe that there is a difference (which you say you do), the outcome after the intervention should be statistically different than the group for which there was no intervention. The difference is one of likelihood. With a statistical degree of certainty, a difference will or will not be seen. In the case of the study in question, no difference was seen; the null hypothesis was not rejected. If this is done with a p value of less than 0.05, which means that what we saw may have happened by chance, less than 5% of the time. The average number of healings in one group was no different than the average number of healings in the other, statistically speaking. Anyway, your concept that somehow things are not comparable because we were using prayer as an intervention makes no sense. If indeed prayer makes a difference, shouldn’t it be observable at least sometime? If there is no way to observe a difference, there is no way to have any degree of confidence there really is a difference.You can’t have it both ways. Belief and certainty.If you say faith-based beliefs can never be empirically demonstrated to have validity, you are saying that faith is not based on reason or logic. Believing in something for which there is no evidence or for which there never could be any observable evidence that suggests that belief is false, is admitting irrationality.So, I can accept someone saying there is no rational reason to believe that prayer makes a difference in the way the world works, it just makes me feel better. But please at least admit the rejection of rationality. You have to admit therefore, that praying to the Christian God is as effective animist incantations, crystals and pyramids or my magic wand. All that matters is believing in it.

This has to be the most appalling flight from reasoned argument that I have ever encountered on this forum. Thelmoose has already asked, I think, how you could possibly know that 'more healing has taken place than would be otherwise'. Your response was a desperate dive for the bolt-hole: 'Ah, well, neither side can know, so that makes both positions just as invalid. Phew.'Sadly, we do know from the Templeton study that complications in prayed-for heart patients arise at the same rate as non-prayed-for patients: in other words your one in 99 'responding to prayer' is at least matched by those 'responding to absence of prayer'. Given the added finding that patients who knew they were being prayed for suffered more complications, I have to ask what you would want your relatives to do were you (heaven forfend) to be struck down with heart disease: pray for you secretly, and have no discernable effect on your recovery; or tell you up-front they were interceding with god on your behalf, and risk tipping the scales against you.

Ah yes. This study has been dealt with here in the forums before at length by myself and others. The problem with your intepretation of the results is this. It measures prayer in the sense of working like a drug. But prayer is nothing more than asking God to intervene. It is NOT the prayer itself that does the healing. If there are 100 people, and 1 person out of that group is affected by prayer and the other 99 are not, then prayer has worked because there is more healing than has taken place than would be otherwise. In other words, even healing, to ANY degree by prayer, means that it has been effective. So if person A is prayed for but doesn't get better, and person B is prayed for and does, then we might as well assume that prayer works even though person A didn't get better. See what I mean? In other words the fact that person A didn't get better doesn't mean that prayer doesn't work. It's a glass half empty/half full issue. So once again, skeptics are stuck with the same problem that they can't truly prove prayer doesn't work. There's really no way to truly disprove it. I'd also say there's no way to prove it's effectiveness as well, but I believe it is your side that seeks for definitive proof on this issue given that for some reason the study is often held up as proof prayer doesn't work by people such as yourself.You're right that I would not hesitate to agree on a study of a drug treatment; but that sort of system can't work on prayer for the reasons I just gave. Prayer is something that is hoped will work to ANY degree, so if 1 out of 99 get better in a test after being prayed for, then prayer has worked. Now you will probably come back and say that such standards of thinking 1 out of 99 being good results is absurd, and it would be if it were a drug. But we're talking about prayer where ANY degree of divine intervention would be welcome. Again, you are making claims that you cannot possibly know for sure. From the cohesive force within atoms to the unknown of exactly how gravity works (normally called "a property of matter"), there is plenty you can't account for. And even with what IS there to account for, what's to say you aren't looking at the mechanism rather than the root? I'm quite comfortable with the idea that the laws of physics are means by which God maintains the universe. No, this can't be proven, but so what? Religion is not, nor ever has been about proof. The problem is that you view it as inferior or a weaker state of thinking as a result of that difference in emphasis. And therein really lies the root of problems between the scientific and religious communities, IMO. Of coruse, but I wasn't talking about mainstream in the sense of all 6 billion of the world's population. I said specifically "out of the mainstream of Christianity."Look; you keep holding up differences of interpretation like it's an issue here. What I don't think you must realize is that what I view as standard interpretation cannot possibly be questioned reasonably with any reasonable reading of the NT. There really does come a point where when someone interprets differently what is read, that it is rather obvious the interpretation is erroneous. It's not like the Bible doesn't say, for instance that Christ ressurrected. It's there, plain as day. Someone cannot reasonably read the New testament for what it says and come away thinking that the Bible doesn't mean to say Christ ressurrected. As I pointed out to Trebor recently, Christianity has been built on the unifying factors of the Bible, so it's odd to me that someone would hold up discrepancies as a sign of weakness in the religion. Like it or not, there really is sound reason to think that some things are more correctly intepreted a certain way. And these are the consistent matters of the Christian faith.Fundamentalist views are the less accurate IMO, because they deviate from what is written. For instance, a common Christian fundamentalist understanding of scripture is that a Christian should not drink alcohol. However, that's not what the scriptures say; they say one should avoid drunkenness and excess. So yes, I believe my interpretations are more correct, and I believe the reason is that mine (more the mainstream Christian one, IMO) is truer to what the Bible actually says in the New Testament.

I think you guys misunderstood me somewhat, as you seem to be responding like Thelmoose. I wasn't trying to claim that as proof that prayer works. I was saying that the study in no way disproves prayer, because for people that pray, ANY amount of improvement post-prayer is more than there would be otherwise. I'm not saying that the 1 in 99 is definitely from being prayed for, but either way that's beside the point of how the study is being used here. This isn't about whether the 1 in 99 is because of prayer, it's about whether or not the study proves that prayer doesn't work, and it doesn't prove that.First, I definitely question those findings. I highly doubt them, and would prefer to see how the study was conducted and the specifics of what all it entailed. But again, even if one group did get worse after being prayed for as the study supposedly claims, how does that prove that prayer doesn't work? How do we know, for instance, that the people in that group wouldn't have gotten worse regardless? Frankly, I'm surprised you guys are treating this study like it disproves prayer because I honestly thought you guys knew better than this.For anyone who believes in prayer, they know it doesn't work like a drug. It's not a medicene. It's asking a deity to intervene--that's ALL it is. The act of prayer--asking--doesn't mean someone will be healed, and religious people generally realize this. You can't accurately measure prayer. It just doens't work that way.

I think we might be at impasse here. To a rationalist this statement is self-defeating and plainly flawed: we can never know how much improvement there would have been otherwise, and the probability that prayer has lowered it is, in the absence of contrary evidence, as great as the probability that it has raised it. (Both will centre on zero.) But a believer of jyoshu's conviction is never going to see that.In other words, any slight indicator in its favour (1 in 99 recovering, for example) is to be tallied as evidence for its efficacy. Any indicator against it is to be discounted because 'it just doesn't work that way'. Tell me, does the phrase 'special pleading' have any resonance with you? You've raised it to an art-form.

Well, I was going to include the special pleading bit, too, but johnhanks beat me to it. Regardless...Put these two ideas together in the way you don't want to: The study in no way disproves prayer, because ANY amount of increased difficulty post-prayer is more than there would be otherwise. How do we know, for instance, that the people in the group that got worse wouldn't have gotten better without prayer?It is equally "logical" based on your reasoning to come to this conclusion as it is to come to yours. Do you therefore conclude that prayer harms people? No, you've decided -- completely without justification -- that the effect of prayer must be improvement. But this assumption is that which is being tested. In other words, in order to rationalize that prayer helps, you're assuming that prayer helps. Not much of an argument.

I'm not saying that the 1 in 99 is definitely from being prayed for, but either way that's beside the point of how the study is being used here. This isn't about whether the 1 in 99 is because of prayer, it's about whether or not the study proves that prayer doesn't work, and it doesn't prove that.First, I definitely question those findings. I highly doubt them, and would prefer to see how the study was conducted and the specifics of what all it entailed. But again, even if one group did get worse after being prayed for as the study supposedly claims, how does that prove that prayer doesn't work? How do we know, for instance, that the people in that group wouldn't have gotten worse regardless? Frankly, I'm surprised you guys are treating this study like it disproves prayer because I honestly thought you guys knew better than this.For anyone who believes in prayer, they know it doesn't work like a drug. It's not a medicene. It's asking a deity to intervene--that's ALL it is. The act of prayer--asking--doesn't mean someone will be healed, and religious people generally realize this. You can't accurately measure prayer. It just doens't work that way.

yes, I've already told you now very clearly that I'm not out to prove that prayer works. my post was in response to you thinking that the study DISPROVES prayer. It doesn't. you have no way of knowing if it did or didn't. If I recover from a terminal disease for unknown reasons, and it just so happens I was prayed for, there's no way you can know for sure that the world, in that way, would have behaved the same way without the prayer (OR with it). See, you can't measure that. You'll never be able to show me conclusively that the world behaves the same regardless of prayer because you've got no way to know if it would have turned out differently had I not prayed. But again, because you have no way of knowing how things would have turned out for the group that WAS prayed for had they not been, those stats don't really mean anything here.I agree, it could go either way (or neither). But I'm not the one out to prove/disprove anything here.

No, no, no.I wasn’t talking about the study (but I will in a sec), I was talking about how you view the world. How you observe something and what information you take from that. You said something to the effect that if you prayed for 100 people, and only 1 got better, then that could mean that prayer had an effect.Well it could. But so could an infinite number of things, and they would be no more or less likely. Anything could have had an effect, but I would have no way to know that. And I wouldn’t hang my hat on it. As such I could make no statement about the effect of any of those things, including prayer. Therefore, I should have no belief in my mind and heart about what had an effect on that one person getting better. I could say, I like to believe that prayer had an effect, or it makes me feel good to believe that prayer had an effect, but there is no way I could know with any degree of certainty that prayer had anything to do with it. And if that is the case and that is how you feel, why would you put any reliance in the value of prayer over anything else?Now, about the study. You made a distinction between a study that uses prayer to heal versus one that would use a drug. When you study something scientifically, the world doesn’t change. The scientific experiment is only a structured way of observing the world, because when we look at the world the way we do every day, there is a whole lot going on to confuse us into thinking something may be happening that in truth is not. When you pray for someone or if you give them a drug, the universe still behaves the same in both circumstances. You mentioned something about the study disproving something. Science never does disprove anything, nor can it. It can’t prove anything for that matter. The basic premise of an interventional study such as this is that the world behaves the same with or without an intervention. The intervention may affect the outcome, but it didn’t alter the way the world behaves day in and day out. So the given, or null hypothesis, is that there will be no difference between people who get prayed for and people who don’t. To believe that there is a difference (which you say you do), the outcome after the intervention should be statistically different than the group for which there was no intervention. The difference is one of likelihood. With a statistical degree of certainty, a difference will or will not be seen. In the case of the study in question, no difference was seen; the null hypothesis was not rejected. If this is done with a p value of less than 0.05, which means that what we saw may have happened by chance, less than 5% of the time. The average number of healings in one group was no different than the average number of healings in the other, statistically speaking. Anyway, your concept that somehow things are not comparable because we were using prayer as an intervention makes no sense. If indeed prayer makes a difference, shouldn’t it be observable at least sometime? If there is no way to observe a difference, there is no way to have any degree of confidence there really is a difference.You can’t have it both ways. Belief and certainty.If you say faith-based beliefs can never be empirically demonstrated to have validity, you are saying that faith is not based on reason or logic. Believing in something for which there is no evidence or for which there never could be any observable evidence that suggests that belief is false, is admitting irrationality.So, I can accept someone saying there is no rational reason to believe that prayer makes a difference in the way the world works, it just makes me feel better. But please at least admit the rejection of rationality. You have to admit therefore, that praying to the Christian God is as effective animist incantations, crystals and pyramids or my magic wand. All that matters is believing in it.

Actually, that's exactly what I'm saying you can't disprove prayer. "we can never know how much improvement there would have been otherwise" is dead on.

I think we might be at impasse here. To a rationalist this statement is self-defeating and plainly flawed: we can never know how much improvement there would have been otherwise, and the probability that prayer has lowered it is, in the absence of contrary evidence, as great as the probability that it has raised it. (Both will centre on zero.) But a believer of jyoshu's conviction is never going to see that.In other words, any slight indicator in its favour (1 in 99 recovering, for example) is to be tallied as evidence for its efficacy. Any indicator against it is to be discounted because 'it just doesn't work that way'. Tell me, does the phrase 'special pleading' have any resonance with you? You've raised it to an art-form.

I still cannot fathom how you can maintain this statement. Please explain. It seems so obviously false, I must be missing something.1. On what basis do you doubt the findings? It was sponsored by a religious organization. What specifics would you like to see? Perhaps I can provide them for you.2. Why do you care of the specifics when you maintain that the results are irrelevant anyway?I recognize that this was only one study. The more such data could be replicated, the more powerful the conclusions can be. Nonetheless, it was well designed and should count for something.We know that because of a matched control group. Indeed we know better. We never said that.But thanks for the snotty condescension.How does it work then? And more importantly, how would you ever know?No one was measuring prayer anyway, they were measuring outcomes with and without prayer. Anyway, who says you can't measure prayer?

Stop it. Stop it.You can't disprove anything. No one has asserted that. You deleted the part of my post that said that. I saidwhy did you ignore that.Neither are we, you &$*$^&*&%You don't listen. Are you saying we can draw no conclusions from paired interventional stuides such as this?

Hehe. This has got to be the most ridiculous coversation I've read in a long time. "Black!""White!'"Black!""White!""Black!!!""White!!!"and on and on and on...... emoticonXBanghead Starting from the Topic Heading: It can't. And also vice-versa.Here is how one person measures prayer. After that, I recommend bong-hits for all of you.

I'm glad someone here understood my point!Contradictions only mean one thing: that there are contradictions. It doesn't show there is no God, and it doesn't devalue or make the religious experiences of billions of people any less valid. (And again, differences and contradictions are not the same thing.) The biggest problem I have with skeptics who use things like the idea that God lies or that he allows contradictions in His Bible or in religious experiences among people is that it tries to make God into the image they think he should be from their moral standpoint. If there is an all-powerful and all-knowing entity that is God, then the moral standards we are under do not necessarily apply to it. It's not that God is bad or hypocritical that he does things he might tell people not to do; it's that he is above and not beholden to any standards of morality at all. The closest analogy there is that I know of to that phenomenon is the way parents have their children bound to rules that they themselves don't have to abide by. Not a perfect analogy, but the best I can come up with for it. That God placed different experiences with people doesn't prove those experiences aren't real, it only says that they are different. Big deal.
