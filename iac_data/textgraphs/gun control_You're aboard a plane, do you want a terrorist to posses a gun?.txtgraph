Ok, so you are aboard an airplane full of people heading to New York or any major city in the United States. Would you be comfortable knowing that someone who wants to crash the plane can legally bring a gun on board, thus making it easier for him to follow through with his plan? Or would you rather make it more difficult for him to hijack the plane? Your choice.

You're aboard a plane, do you want a terrorist to posses a gun?

I have faith in my fellow man. I believe in the ability of good citizens to control their own destiny. I believe that good and free citizens can and will stand up and do what is right, even at great sacrifice to themselves. I believe that good citzens can take care of themselves just fine without the government. If all that sounds right to you, then you have no other option then to allow good citzens to arm themselves on planes. No matter how crazy it sounds. If you believe in good and freemen doing the right thing and changing your ideas just for a special case; then you lack moral integrity. Moral integrity means you do the right thing, there are no special cases that allow people with moral integrity to change. You can revise your ideas when you realize they are wrong, but there are no special cases that allow you to change and still keep your moral integrity.100 people on a plane. There is going to be at least one good citizen in hiding waiting for the right time to put 2 shots to the body and 1 to the head of a terrorist. In typical concealed firearm states, typical licensing is 1 in 5 citizens, up to 50% depending on geography, and of course much less elsewhere. Citizens who carry religiously are 1 in 20. Citizens who carry religiously typicaly train a lot. Many of the good citizens I meet at the range train harder and more than street cops. Yes we are few in number. You can bet that those who carry religiously are out there.

Are you willing to take that chance though? I would rather not take the chance and have a terrorist with a boxcutter than one with a gun.

As I have said. I believe in free and good citizens to be able to take care of themselves in the street and at home. I do not change that opinion for a special case, to do so would be lack of moral fortitude.Do you or do you not believe in free and good citizens to be able and should be able to take care of themselves.

Let me clarify your misunderstanding. I do not believe good citizens should carry firearms for protection. They should be ALLOWED if they want to. That is the purest form of freedom, being allowed to decide for yourself.Again, to clarify your misunderstanding. I do not believe the government sould prohibt the behavior. Again the most purest form of freedom, being not prohibited. The airlines can decide for themselves if they want customers to have a firearm on thier PRIVATE property. The airlines are not public, they are private. You can not force another person or corporation to do something they do not want to do. Forcing someone to do something against thier will is textbook slavery. I would not want pro-gun owners to force airlines to accept passengers with guns.When an airline decides not to have passengers carry firearms, then I will find another airline, or take another option. We do not need to government to step in. The airlines know what is good for themselves. If they start to loose passengers because they gun bans, then that is too bad. It is thier choice. If airlines get more passengers with banned guns, then so be it. If all the others airlines follow suit, so be it. That is the purest form of freedom. Everyone decides what is best for themselves. If a gun owner wants to carry a gun and all the airlines ban them. So be it, the gun owner is out of luck. That is the purest form of freedom. In my case there is no moral dilemma, there is no special case, there is no violation of anyones rights.The last posts do not even come close to an argument. All you have is "your and idiot" and "that is retarded".Please convince me I am wrong without a moral delimma, a special case, or a violation of anyones rights.

I used to live in Utah which is a very pro-gun state and according to statistics only about 2% of residents of Utah have a license to carry a concealed weapon so I find your statistics quite hard to believe. There is no good reason to believe that guns makes us safer on the ground so why do you think guns will make us safer on an airplane?

I hope you respond to this. I know you have kissed this group good bye. Thus you base your opinion on emotions rather than reason. Even if you don't respond, other anti-gunners are reading this and will learn that gun control is all about emotion of feeling right not the reason of being right.

Man oh man, there are two threads spewing this idiotic idea of bringing guns onto planes? Do you guys even realize that if the terrorists really are suicidal that they would be fine with simply crashing the plane? Lets say you have only 3 terrorists on board and they are just casually walking around with their guns like everyone else on the plane. Suddenly one makes a run for it into the cockpit, shoots the pilots, shoots the controls, while the other two are shooting into the crowd. Now the plane is doomed. Or how about if they opened fire into the windows and walls of the plane? That won't be easy to fix. Or what if they simply put a homemade bomb inside one of their guns and blew that up on the plane?Out numbered 100 to 1 it is my opinion that the terrorist will have the upper hand because he will have planned what he is doing and no one else will be aware of what is happening until it is already done. On a plane, it is especially volatile and everyone seems to be assuming that there will be people everywhere willing to stop a terrorist. My guess is that the terrorist would act when half of them are sleeping and the other half or working or eating. I also would guess that almost none of them would want to have a gun anyways. There are families there who would refuse guns and there would be business people who are content working on laptops, not handling a gun. Lets say that maybe 10% of the people have guns. How hard would it be to assume that half of those would be terrorists and it would basically be a 1 on 1 against people who are unprepared? And how many of those people with guns who are not terrorist will accidentally fire a shot per year? Can you picture it now, a man accidentally shoots a child on board a plane. The child’s father shoots the man and other not knowing what is happening shoot the father while others shoot back at the guy who just shot the father. Wow, now that would be exciting! I can't wait to see guns on board a plane.Now come back to reality people. This idea makes zero sense on a plane. I know for sure there would be a no gun section that would be very extensive to accommodate those who refuse to be anywhere near guns which will be maybe 90% of all people who fly. The only realistic idea that there is would be to give pilots guns and guards on the plane guns. Giving the average person a gun on a freaking plane is absolutely insane.

What is so simple about it? How does terrorist having guns make it simple for them to shoot someone who has one too? How is simple that when a terrorist has a gun that they can suddenly see through clothing to see which passenger is carrying a gun? It is no simple matter to watch your back aboard a plane even if you have a gun. I assure you the good citizen is not going to play fair when they are dealing with terrorist. They are going to attack from concealment and from behind.It is not about your trust. It is about freemen allowed to control thier own destiny. Lack of trust is not a good enough reason to restrict someones rights. You must be able to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt before you start to take rights away from a person."Crazy" is not a good enough reason to restrict a persons rights. Only 1 group of people have thier rights automatically taken away: convicted criminals.The legally insane and spouse batters also get their rights taken away. The insane after a judge declares them insane. Wife abusers only after a judge says so. NEVER before.

First off lets assume that if you are allowed to bring guns on board, then the terrorist will be wearing bullet proof vests just for protection. Also they will have the additional help from being organized and having a plan. They will likely have more ammo, they will likely have better guns, they will likely be better trained, they will likely be more willing to use them, and they will be more willing to die than the common person on the plane. All this will work towards their advantage. Plus they may not even want to know who has a gun. Maybe they will take the policy of shoot first and ask questions later. If they want to 9/11 the plane into a building, what do they care if everyone on board is dead already? So your theory that average citizens will defeat the terrorists is a hope. Maybe a 50/50 chance?Even if it is a 90/10 chance of victory the risks are still too great. Right now if terrorists took another plane, do you think they would have any better odds than this? I think at this time people would be willing to go hand to hand with terrorists or hand to knife or hand to gun. The terrorists won't have a huge supply of ammo if they were to get a gun on board, they would likely have weak guns compared to what they would have with your idea, they would be lightly armored if at all, they would maybe have knives but the average person will have an ink pen that is a good substitute for one in that sort of situation, and I don't think any terrorist is going to even want to risk going up against 30 or 40 angry passengers as long as they are basically unarmed. I'd say we have a system in place right now and passengers on board planes right now that will solve the terrorist threat for the most part.For you its about that. Are you more important than anyone else who will be on the plane? How many people on the plane will have their family with them including kids? Will they be able to be as care free about guns being on the plane as you seemingly are? I bet your thinking that every single person feels comfortable around guns, right? I bet you think that guns are everyone’s passion and they would all love to bring one on board a plane because it truly makes them feel safe. I'd love to see a study done on this because the numbers would be against you in a bad way. But I'm sure you don't care. You just have this insane idea that makes no sense and since you consider yourself and people like you more important than the vast majority, you feel your ideas are perfect and without flaws. Fine, you go tell some Joe XXXX business man to get on a plane with 30 guys stroking guns. Tell a few elderly people to bring guns with them when they get on the plane. Ask children to bring Gun Bingo along with them as they name the guns they see being carried freely around the plane. Does this all sound reasonable to you? I'm sure it does!Convicted criminals only? Hey lets assume your on a plane with your family, assuming you have one. Lets say a person with a clean criminal record is sitting behind you with his gun aimed squarely at your kid or father or whatever. What will you do about this? How about if he starts acting a little crazy and starts waving it around as his eyes roll back in his head and you hear him chant something about being Satan’s chosen one? You still alright? He starts sweating and gripping the gun tighter and fingers the trigger. His eyes are getting wider and wider as his pupils dilate. I bet your thinking ah, the sweet feeling of complete safety. *Bang*Oh, but this won't happen to you though, right? It will happen to someone else, so why should you be concerned? Let the crazy and suicidal bring guns on board as well.You want to debate that this could happen without guns on a plane? Fine, be my guest. I doubt you will be able to find one case of it.Sweet.

remember that well trained terrorist that are willing to die are an expensive and limited resource. The terrorists don't have the time or money to waste on 10% chances. If the terrorists DID fight all their battles with only 10% chance of winning, then they will exhaust their resources very quickly.From a strategic point of view, they would be better suited to committing their resources to more successful.Oh, and a group of Muslims in full battle gear won't get on a plane either way. Terrorists have to blend in until the moment they strike. If their attack is detected before they spring into action, its chances of success are minimized. Likewise, John Q “gun toting” Public gets to conceal the fact that he’s packing heat on the airplane until the right moment (assuming he maintains presence of mind), so a conspicuous set of attackers is an advantage to the Good-Doers

Also remember that Americans are a limited and valued resource. If the terrorists succeeded 10% of the time, they would kill a whole lot more of us than we did them. Do you debate this?Would you debate that terrorist could easily be more successful than this? If we allow people to walk onto planes with guns, how will we check for explosives? How about checking for any chemicals? The terrorist could be very resourceful when giving such as wide range of things to work.You have to look to Kelvin’s debate if you wish to argue whether fully armed terrorists could get on a plane. He doesn't want to discriminate against crazy people and those certainly qualify as crazy. Also you claim that they would have limited chance of success if detected. I would debate that John Q won't be on that plane after he sees the apparent terrorists boarding it and calmly taking their seats without anyone stopping them. I would say those terrorist will be the most successful rather than the least. Please debate Kelvin if you don't like the idea of this happening.

Nor is the terroist going to play fair. Would you like a strategic layout of how a terrorist would do it. Ten prepared and trained terrorists are going to be able to hijack a plane vs. three or four civilians.Would you feel secure knowing people around you had guns.

ok, so if American's have a 90% chance of coming out on top on a Hijacking senerio (assuming all hijackings are suicidial to begin with) once it's began, you'd have to honestly beleive that hijacking attmpts would rise by 900% as a result of letting peopel bring guns on airliners.i contend that the terrorist hijackers who want us all dead CAN NOT muster 900% more terrorists trained well enough to pull off another set of 9-11 attacks.and even if they COULD bring 170 terrorists to bear instead of just 17, 300 million americans will survve over 170 terrorists. most exspecially if 153 of them wind up dead in the middle of their attempt. that's 153 WASTED terrorists. terrorists that were trained, that infiltrated the US, evaded detection and capture, and got on a plane and initiated their plan.the terrorists do NOT have those kind of resources to waste. It would be a better use of their resources to shoot up schools, burn down orphanages, XXXX up pizza parlors, and poison water supplies.or, actually, it would be a better use of their resources to do something CONSTRUCTIVE with their time, but thats getting off point.also remember that the 9-11 hijackers only had a 75% success rate because some of the passengers FOUGHT BACK.
attacks
Also remember that Americans are a limited and valued resource. If the terrorists succeeded 10% of the time, they would kill a whole lot more of us than we did them. Do you debate this?Would you debate that terrorist could easily be more successful than this? If we allow people to walk onto planes with guns, how will we check for explosives? How about checking for any chemicals? The terrorist could be very resourceful when giving such as wide range of things to work.You have to look to Kelvin’s debate if you wish to argue whether fully armed terrorists could get on a plane. He doesn't want to discriminate against crazy people and those certainly qualify as crazy. Also you claim that they would have limited chance of success if detected. I would debate that John Q won't be on that plane after he sees the apparent terrorists boarding it and calmly taking their seats without anyone stopping them. I would say those terrorist will be the most successful rather than the least. Please debate Kelvin if you don't like the idea of this happening.

How many planes were crashed on 9/11 with only box cutters?Since gun haters like to play the what if game. What if a law abiding citizen had a ccw and took out the terrorist before they crashed the planes into the WTC?It is interesting how gun haters do not like what if games unless the game plays out the way the gun haters want it to.
attacks
Ok, so you are aboard an airplane full of people heading to New York or any major city in the United States. Would you be comfortable knowing that someone who wants to crash the plane can legally bring a gun on board, thus making it easier for him to follow through with his plan? Or would you rather make it more difficult for him to hijack the plane? Your choice.

Nor is the terroist going to play fair. Would you like a strategic layout of how a terrorist would do it. Ten prepared and trained terrorists are going to be able to hijack a plane vs. three or four civilians.Would you feel secure knowing people around you had guns. I wouldn't if I was in a store much less an airplane.The planes are buisness and their regulations for security of its customers are good.For what reason does one have to carry a gun on a plane??Thanks for reading thisAlways Stay Open Minded

I am not sure I agree with this. (gasp!). Listen up... We have a choice. If an Airline refuses to allow me to bring my hammer er I mean my gun on the plane it is MY CHOICE as to wether I get on or not. <- Period. That does not preclude the Airlines culpability if it is hijacked and sent into a building as they would be partially negligent for the deaths of the people in the building had they not provided the airplane with adequate security (armed pilots and stewardesses, etc) This of course should not be translated into aboslute security as even if every pilot, stewardess, and other employee were all packing MP5s and yet the terrorists succseed it would be reasonable to say in that case the private industry did all it could and they should start the lessons learned proccess perhaps with voluntary government help (military trainers etc) the key being voluntary. It is the same for guns themselves... If my brand new Kimber Ultra Eclipse II blows up in my hand because of shoddy workmanship (not likley with a Kimber) then I should be able to sue.

I CAN REMAIN SILENT NO LONGER. Let me start by saying that I am an airline pilot. There are people right now that are allowed to carry firearms aboard commercial aircraft, if they have the proper documentation. HOWEVER, as pilots...we have veto power. If i don't like the way you look at me when you hand me your FS508 form, I will ask you to leave my airplane. It ultimately is the captains decision, but if I as the first officer object, you will get off my airplane. Let me also state, I am a gun lover! I own 3 rifles, a shotgun, and revolver, and a pistol. I value my rights as an American to carry my gun, but please don't tell me you stand behind the constitution to win this arguement for you. Yes, it does give us the right to bear arms, but times have changed, and the wording has not. Should the government be able to take my guns? NO! Should I have to register my guns into a government database? NO! Should I have the right to get a permit and carry it in MOST places. YES! Should i be allowed to cary a gun on a plane, in a school, in a government building, in your home if you object? NOT ONLY NO, BUT NO! Think on this. The FAA (in their infinate wisdom...gee I hope the FSDO is looking!) decides to let everyone with a weapons permit to carry on a gun. So I have 37 armed people sitting behind me. The bulkhead doors within an aircraft are not bulletproof. Suppose while you are duking it out with Mr. Hijacker you put a round through me and one through my captain? Now your screwed, the aircraft will crash, you all die. A weapons permit does not make you a "good shot", and it is unthinkable to say that everyone who starts blasting away will only hit Mr. Hijacker. Ok, second. I am sure many of you have flown before. You guys remember the little safety lecture? "In the event of a sudden loss of cabin pressure an oxygen mask will deploy from the ceiling...secure the mask over your nose and mouth...blah blah blah." What do you think the loss of cabin pressure comes from. A HOLE IN THE FREAKING AIRCRAFT XXXXX. Aircraft are pressurized inside, meaning that the pressure inside the aircraft is greater than the pressure outside the aircraft. If it was not, we would take off with live people and land (or crash) with a plane full of dead people. A bullet, creating a hole in a window, or the skin (pressure vessel), will cause something known as rapid decompression. Does anyone remember the United flight that had to make an emergency landing in Hawaii? A small crack in the fuselage was present, caused a large section of the aircraft to structurally fail, and several people were sucked out. This flight was extremely lucky to even have the chance to land. Many times, when an aircraft rapidly depressurizes, it becomes structurally damaged to the point it is no longer aerodynamic (does not fly) or is no longer able to be controlled (cannot be flown). Either case...now your screwed, the aircraft will crash, you all die. Suppose someone accidently shoots into the wing or through the floor of the aircraft while slugging it out with Mr. Hijacker. Assuming that the aircraft does not depressurize...what about the 1000's of gallons of jet fuel in the tanks.

I am not sure I agree with this. (gasp!). Listen up... We have a choice. If an Airline refuses to allow me to bring my hammer er I mean my gun on the plane it is MY CHOICE as to wether I get on or not. <- Period. That does not preclude the Airlines culpability if it is hijacked and sent into a building as they would be partially negligent for the deaths of the people in the building had they not provided the airplane with adequate security (armed pilots and stewardesses, etc) This of course should not be translated into aboslute security as even if every pilot, stewardess, and other employee were all packing MP5s and yet the terrorists succseed it would be reasonable to say in that case the private industry did all it could and they should start the lessons learned proccess perhaps with voluntary government help (military trainers etc) the key being voluntary. It is the same for guns themselves... If my brand new Kimber Ultra Eclipse II blows up in my hand because of shoddy workmanship (not likley with a Kimber) then I should be able to sue. If Eminem steals my "gat" or uses a "straw man" to purchase his own and kills 7+1 school girls it is Eminems fault NOT Kimbers and he should be put down like a dog (after a fair trial of course).

Once again we get the gun hater what if game. Hey gun hater! What if a terrorist or airline pilot that has gone postal hijacks a plane and is threatening to kill all on the plane. What if a person with a gun drops the terrorist or airline pilot that has gone postal with one bullet and saves the airplane. If the gun haters are going to play what if games please have the backbone to play what if in all scenarios! By the way his is why I do not play the what if game. To be fair a person using the what if bs must do it to come out in favor of both sides of the issue. Oh and since you what if the negative side I do not need to repeat that for you.Would guns have prevented 9/11. You said you guess not because the terrorist would have had them. Just which state is issuing ccw's to terrorist? Oh and yes I was waiting for the gun hater to claim they had guns. This can be compared to the racist that would claim they are not racist because they have black friends, but they still want them there racist laws!By the way gun hater I defended the airlines right to deny people to carry guns on the planes. It is called private property. I just stated once a business or person(such as an airline pilot)denies you the ability to defend yourself that business or person is responsible for your safety. The courts have ruled the airlines and port authority can be held responsible for the people killed on 9/11 Once more gun hater did the gun free zones at schools prevent the columbine killings? How many laws did the criminals at columbine violate? In closing since the gun haters like to ask why do you need bs. Why do gun haters need to ask why do you need something? I bet it is because it is their right to do so!

I CAN REMAIN SILENT NO LONGER. Let me start by saying that I am an airline pilot. There are people right now that are allowed to carry firearms aboard commercial aircraft, if they have the proper documentation. HOWEVER, as pilots...we have veto power. If i don't like the way you look at me when you hand me your FS508 form, I will ask you to leave my airplane. It ultimately is the captains decision, but if I as the first officer object, you will get off my airplane. Let me also state, I am a gun lover! I own 3 rifles, a shotgun, and revolver, and a pistol. I value my rights as an American to carry my gun, but please don't tell me you stand behind the constitution to win this arguement for you. Yes, it does give us the right to bear arms, but times have changed, and the wording has not. Should the government be able to take my guns? NO! Should I have to register my guns into a government database? NO! Should I have the right to get a permit and carry it in MOST places. YES! Should i be allowed to cary a gun on a plane, in a school, in a government building, in your home if you object? NOT ONLY NO, BUT NO! Think on this. The FAA (in their infinate wisdom...gee I hope the FSDO is looking!) decides to let everyone with a weapons permit to carry on a gun. So I have 37 armed people sitting behind me. The bulkhead doors within an aircraft are not bulletproof. Suppose while you are duking it out with Mr. Hijacker you put a round through me and one through my captain? Now your screwed, the aircraft will crash, you all die. A weapons permit does not make you a "good shot", and it is unthinkable to say that everyone who starts blasting away will only hit Mr. Hijacker. Ok, second. I am sure many of you have flown before. You guys remember the little safety lecture? "In the event of a sudden loss of cabin pressure an oxygen mask will deploy from the ceiling...secure the mask over your nose and mouth...blah blah blah." What do you think the loss of cabin pressure comes from. A HOLE IN THE FREAKING AIRCRAFT XXXXX. Aircraft are pressurized inside, meaning that the pressure inside the aircraft is greater than the pressure outside the aircraft. If it was not, we would take off with live people and land (or crash) with a plane full of dead people. A bullet, creating a hole in a window, or the skin (pressure vessel), will cause something known as rapid decompression. Does anyone remember the United flight that had to make an emergency landing in Hawaii? A small crack in the fuselage was present, caused a large section of the aircraft to structurally fail, and several people were sucked out. This flight was extremely lucky to even have the chance to land. Many times, when an aircraft rapidly depressurizes, it becomes structurally damaged to the point it is no longer aerodynamic (does not fly) or is no longer able to be controlled (cannot be flown). Either case...now your screwed, the aircraft will crash, you all die. Suppose someone accidently shoots into the wing or through the floor of the aircraft while slugging it out with Mr. Hijacker. Assuming that the aircraft does not depressurize...what about the 1000's of gallons of jet fuel in the tanks. (most fuel thanks are in the wings and some aircraft have fuselage tanks) So now the plane blows up...now your screwed, the aircraft will crash, you all die.

He is a self proclaimed gun lover. He even lists the guns he owns. How can he possibly be a gun hater?I think the response to your what if scenario has already been listed. What if a bullet hits the pilots? What if a bullet goes through the floor or a window? What if a bullet hits the jet fuel? This are legitimate concerns wouldn't you agree? Isn't it hypocritical that you haven't listed the concerns of the 'gun haters' in any of your posts yet you demand that those opposing you list your concerns?I think the best solution for the topic of having guns on a plane is to let the pilots and trained guards have guns on board to defend against a terrorist attack. This way the terrorist would still have the task of trying to sneak a gun on board just to have a chance at all and of course he would have to face off against trained professionals in order to take the plane. I think this would stop a vast majority of all hijackings as well as prevent any dangerous criminals from taking a gun onto a plane.Like we debated earlier, you don't know who is and who isn't dangerous until they reveal themselves. How will the state know if it is issuing a CCW to a terrorist or a model citizen?Do you support guns in schools? What age limits should there be?

Gun hater like amd4 just like to point out the bad bs. Gun haters like amd4 must do this to push the gun hater agenda of banning the right to bear arms!Gun haters like amd4 will never what if a good ending with guns. Why is this? Simple gun haters like amd4 want to ban the right to bear arms. So gun hater amd4 must do everything gun hater amd4 can to make guns out to be bad. Gun hater amd4 stated gun hater amd4 could tell who was angry, not I! I have no crystal ball to tell me who is going to commit a crime unlike gun hater amd4 does!Did the gun haters gun free zones keep guns away from colubine? No!How many gun control laws did the criminals at columbine break?When I was in school there were shooting clubs at school. Guns could be brought to school for show and tell. Kids also went hunting after school. No one complained about guns on school grounds.And no times have not changed!

Debating an ***** is never as much fun as debating an intelligent person...but here goes. If you feel the need to call me a gun hater...hmmm...what can i call you?Hey *****...i like guns, i own guns, i believe in my right to carry a gun...nuff said.[IMG]What if a terrorist or airline pilot that has gone postal hijacks a plane and is threatening to kill all on the plane.[/IMG] Hey *****...he would still be easier to deal with if he has a sharpened pen rather than a 40 cal.Hey *****...we will never truely know the answer to this, but I doubt that they would have prevented it. And it is completely feasable to believe that if the terrorists were able to apply for pilots licenses and get them, why could they not get a weapons permit. A pilots license requires application to the Federal Aviation Administration and The Department of Transportation. I know that they did this just like everyone else. (the examiner that flight tested me for my private pilots license and my instrument rating gave flight tests to several of the terrorists) How hard is it to get a weapons permit? Not very hard, a little money, fill out a form, send it in, wait for your permit. Even if they were not issued a permit, I could make you one on my computer in about 5 minutes.Hey *****...I am neither a gun hater nor a racist. Your argument is irrational and invalid. I believe very strongly in my right to own a gun, and I also believe in the equality of man...even ******.Hey *****...good for you. But think about one thing my little *****, If a terrorist were to carry a gun on a plane because the airline allows guns on board and did not know he was a terrorist; he takes it over, and crashes it...are the airlines not then responsible for that too? If citizens carry guns on board an aircraft because the airline says it is ok, and they kill someone accidentaly while shooting it out with a terrorist, the airline would still be responsible for the death because they allowed the gun to be carried aboard the aircraft. What if they accidentally bring the plane down while shooting at a terrorist like I said, then the airline that allowed that gun on board is still responsible. It is a catch .22 (little joke there). You cannot have it both ways. Asking any rational, non-***** will yeild you the same result, there is far more danger with guns on board than if they are not on board. Are you saying that you and six friends (or strangers sitting around you on the plane) would not fight or wrestle with a terrorist? It has been done since 9/11, and it worked. Oh yeah *****...you have the right to not get on my plane in the first place if I deny you your right to carry a gun on board. So if you get on board without your gun, YOU are responsible. There are other means of transportation...like you own car. In your case, I would recommend the car, even if going to Europe.Hey *****...no, they did not. But is the answer to take down the gun free zones...and just allow kids to carry guns to school? Sure, both Columbine and 9/11 caught us with our pants around our ankles, but we need to learn from these lessons...and in many respects we have. We have improved security, better bomb detection, better screeners, and more security on the aircraft itself. Hey *****...grow up. I am not trying to infringe upon your right to carry a firearm, just not on my plane. And unless you are a Federal Air Marshall or a criminal, you will NEVER do so on any commercial flight originating or entering the United States.

WOW, a couple minutes of inconvenience...woe is me. This is not the 1950's anymore.

One more thought...you little *****...Is your gun going to stop a "terrorist" who legally purchases a gun, gets a weapons permit legally, and carries it aboard a plane legally from pulling it out quietly in his seat and shooting a hole in the aircraft and bringing it down before you even see him. NO! Your gun would be just another useless piece of metal found on the ground by the NTSB. Even if you know everyone who has a gun on a plane, do you know their intentions? NO. A terrorist is not just some Arab who is here illegally, they can be your neighbor, friend, or even family members. John Q. terrorist. I am a US citizen, I have a weapons permit, and if the government allowed me to carry a gun on board, I COULD do so legally. (not that i would) This makes your "what if" about you shooting me with one shot and killing me before I can do any harm a moot point. I could happen, are you willing to take the risk? YES or NO? If you answer yes, you are a bigger ***** than i thought. If you answer no, you admit that it is safer to not allow ANYONE to carry a gun on board. If you don't answer, you prove that I have made a valid point and you don't have the ***** to admit you might have actually learned something. Maybe you should take the train or the bus.

Once again gun hater if you insist on playing what if games please what if to both scenario good ending and bad ending. What if quick draw games on a airplane by gun hater pilot. Ok now gun hater pilot if you are going to play what if games you must use both scenarios. You know this way people on the fence on gun control can see that every thing is possible in what if games!But you will not gun hater. Would you like to know why you will not do that gun hater? Because you want to ban the right to bear arms. So basically gun hater pilot what you are saying is terrorist will do whatever it takes to get guns. So gun hater pilot to try and stop terrorist from getting guns, which you just said was impossible. You want to limit or ban the right of law abiding citizens to bear arms. So gun hater pilot in your so called perfect world only the terrorist or dangerous criminals will have guns. Just how safe is the law abiding citizen then? Oh wait you will use the line dial 911 and wait for the police to come. And while you wait for the police to come to your rescue the armed terrorist or dangerous criminals will be doing what?It is interesting how gun hater pilot calls any one a XXXXX that speaks out against gun hater pilot. Remember gun hater pilot’s last post said terrorist would apply for and get ccw permits. Gun hater pilot never did mention which states would issue ccw permits to terrorist.Here you go gun hater pilot give us one example of a dangerous criminal or terrorist obeying gun control laws. Show us one time of a dangerous criminal or terrorist applying for and was issued a ccw?I would have to say gun hater pilot I would not want you to fly any plane I was on. Here are the reason. 1. Gun hater pilot racially profiles people!2. Gun hater pilot wants to quick draw against people.3. Gun hater pilot would not allow a police officer or any law enforcement officer with a gun on gun hater pilots airplane even if they had all of the proper paperwork if gun hater pilot did not like their appearance.Once again I need to point out I defended the airlines right to not allow guns. But I do say if the airlines do this, the airline are responsible for the passengers safety! And it appears the courts feel that way also!

Were you a military pilot.... You seem to have that god complex thing that only a trained proffesional can fly a plane... Not the truth that a monkey with headphones could land that bus if the computer systems didn't help him 80%+ of the times. makes me smile....A little hint..... Pull stick back trees get smaller.... Push stick foward trees get bigger :p As a former AF loadmaster and later HALO certified. I have been in many so called "rapid decompressions" scenarios. Mostly drills but some others. Your myths of "rapid decompression" is laughable.... At 40,000 feet what is the outside air pressure? Inside cabin pressure? What sucks people out of the backs, sides of planes, and what conditions are required for this phenomena, "Jr. Pilot"?Look if all your points were right on then the AIRLINE YOU WORK for should make its rules NOT THE GOVERNMENT!

I think we all now know that terrorists don't hijack planes to cuba anymore, and I think that the public is going to be much more empowered to act in the face of a threat to an aircraft.

Last, and most important, almost all of the other pilots that I know feel the same way I do about this, and not one of them will fly an aircraft with armed passengers other than Federal Air Marshalls or Law Enforcement officials authorized to carry them FOR A REASON. If the general public is ever allowed to carry guns on board a commercial aircraft, they will do so. However, it would be quicker to take the bus, because there will be no pilots willing to fly them. WE PILOTS DEAL WITH ENOUGH DANGERS UP THERE, WE DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT AN AIRCRAFT OF ARMED HILLBILLIES WITH GLOCKS KILLING US BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THE MAN WHO STOOD UP TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF HIS CARRY-ON WAS ACTUALLY HABIB Q. TERRORIST.

yeah but using that logic remember that pilot who was screaming ALLAH AKBAR! as he (THE PILOT) crashed the plane full of people... Or the muslim gi who lobbed a grenade into his gi buddies tent... OR this chaplain in gitmo who was caught with secret documents.... fedgov agents are not the answer to your personal saftey..... Or that ranger who killed his family after he got back from the og gulf war? pesky non-pilot civilians don't have a monopoly of being out of control...

He is a self proclaimed gun lover. He even lists the guns he owns. How can he possibly be a gun hater?I think the response to your what if scenario has already been listed. What if a bullet hits the pilots? What if a bullet goes through the floor or a window? What if a bullet hits the jet fuel? This are legitimate concerns wouldn't you agree? Isn't it hypocritical that you haven't listed the concerns of the 'gun haters' in any of your posts yet you demand that those opposing you list your concerns?I think the best solution for the topic of having guns on a plane is to let the pilots and trained guards have guns on board to defend against a terrorist attack. This way the terrorist would still have the task of trying to sneak a gun on board just to have a chance at all and of course he would have to face off against trained professionals in order to take the plane. I think this would stop a vast majority of all hijackings as well as prevent any dangerous criminals from taking a gun onto a plane.Like we debated earlier, you don't know who is and who isn't dangerous until they reveal themselves. How will the state know if it is issuing a CCW to a terrorist or a model citizen?Do you support guns in schools? What age limits should there be?

Even if everyone had a gun the pilot could still do this.Everyone did have a gun here and it still happened.This is US stupidity. We allowed Muslims to have a say in that person being there. Guns will not prevent stupidity.In certain situations they can be. I can't say that I would feel safer if red necks with guns were on a plane with me. I actually would find it unlikely that we would be safer if people were able to bring guns onto a plane. It does open up more security issues and if I were a pilot I would have to demand that all aircraft that I fly have protected areas for myself if guns are onboard. This would cost a great deal of money to change and I don't think that the common person would even support this. However, having 'fedgov agents' onboard is more acceptable for everyone involved.Guns will not prevent nervous breakdowns either.Even you agree that airlines should have a right to choose whether people can bring guns on board so obviously the airlines do have the civilians in this monopoly if you believe it as such. Still I wouldn’t say that civilians are completely helpless on planes. It isn’t like they are chained down on planes, although that would solve the terrorist threat :)

You miss my point. I was making the point that civilians do not have the monopoly on horrendeous behavior and that our exalted leaders and thier agents are not immune from such behavior. They are no different than you or me.Rednecks? Do you mean poor country people? I am more comfortable around so called rednecks who have had guns ALL THIER LIVES and VIEW THEM AS TOOLS than I am around some cherry trooper looking for his first "collar"..... look at the shooting statistics... It is rare in so called redneck areas to be a victim of a shooting while it is almost 100% more likley that you would be a victim of a shooting in a cosmopolitan area such as D.C.Point is is that homicidal maniacs do not need a gun to do their dirty work.... it is the maniac not the tool you should conentrate on.. I will give you a litte MA advice... someone points a gun at you don't stare at the gun it is inanimate... look at the criminals hand elbow shoulder and his whole self. If he is going to pull that trigger this is your only hope for (unlikley but must be tried) evasion. Do understand what I am saying?Yes its the airlines choice and my choice on whether I fly it. They failed before do I CHOOSE to let them fail me again or do I choose an airline that would allow me to defend myself...

My point was to show that even if everyone had guns they still would have been completely helpless in all those situations.My brother is a redneck by his own definition. Along with other 'redneck' traits, he is so comfortable around a gun that he sometimes forgets that other people are not comfortable around a gun. He actually points it at people as a joke while it is loaded. That is insane but he doesn't understand that. I don't feel safe or comfortable around people like that and I'm sure you will find people like that who are more than willing to take guns onto planes if allowed to do so.Would you be comfortable around my brother? He really isn't that experienced with guns and he isn't a real thinking person when it comes to what the consequences of certain actions are. Even if you would feel comfortable around him, would you feel comfortable on a plane with your family around him?I'm really not as worried about being shot as I am worried that my brother will accidentally shoot someone. On a crowded plane I can see people accidentally bumping into each other and someone who was joking around with their gun will pull the trigger and kill someone. I worry about that more than someone using a gun in violence on a plane.I'm afraid I don't understand what your saying here. I was saying how a crazy person with a gun isn't likely to be stopped when he catches people by surprise, especially his own family. Repealing gun control laws isn't going to prevent this from happening.What your asking here is that people be trained to understand how to tell when a person is going to pull the trigger. That may be beneficial to know if confronted with a gun, but how many people will actually understand this at the time a gun is in their face and how likely is evasion assuming you are dealing with someone who just came back from fighting in a war?They will fail again regardless as to whether guns are on board or not. Eventually someone will bring a bomb onboard a plane and use that or maybe a chemical gas. Guns will not prevent failure. The best way to prevent failure would be to take away all the rights of the passengers and make them sit naked and tied down. Even then you have the risk of pilot error. You will not be able to prevent failure no matter what is done. You only wish to have the illusion of safety because you have gun. My illusion of safety is that we live in America and because of that we are safer on an airplane than anywhere else you could possibly be at the time.I might be coming around to your idea that gun control doesn't work but I don't like the idea of guns on planes at all. I really cannot see a real advantage while the risks are everywhere. Just not a good risk-reward scenario.

No offense but your brother is an XXX. I understand now a little you fear of guns as any normal human being would be. But the problem is not the gun. The problem is your brother. YOU DO NOT POINT A WEAPON LOADED OR OTHERWISE AT ANYONE. He needs a good beatdown or at least a menacing arrest. He is atypical of most gun owners and most gun owners would come down much harder on your brother than apparently you have. Zero tolerance for such dangerous behavior... Remember that YOU are in control not this fool... I am sure however he would only misbehave like that once... There are laws against "menacing".His behavior is from ignorance and like I said before he has already broken laws that YOU could do something about.Nor is a full on gun ban going to prevent him from finding another tool for the same purpose.You can chose preparedness of laziness that is your choice. Do not get me wrong evasion is all but impossible no matter what every yahoo in blackbelt magazine tells you. But at the moment of impending doom you have the choice of victim or resitor. The point is is the XXXXX that is threatening you with a weapon would do so no matter what tool he had in his hands and his intent is not to ask you for directions. What tool would you prefer in this situation? a cell phone to call 911 or a 13 round H&K USP 40. If you have just your hands then wouldn't you have wished you had trained yourself to respond to this situation..Musashi"the way is in training"Your illusion of saftey is just that an illusion. ONLY YOU CAN DETERMINE YOUR OWN SAFTEY. An illusion is a lie. And a lie will get you killed.I understand that and may agree with you to an extent. Just as if I had a bar I would have a no gun policy as alcohol+XXXXXX like your brother=no good. But it is the private companies choice to make NOT the governments.

Once again we see how gun hater pilot responds to people that speak out against gun hater pilot. Would anybody want to fly with gun hater pilot? I mean gun hater pilot uses racial profiling to keep law enforcement that gun hater pilot does not like simply because of their looks off of gun hater pilots plane!Now gun hater pilot I have compared gun haters such as you to the other hate groups that are blinded by their hatred of other peoples rights.As seen on 9/11 and at columbine people are not safer because of gun free zones. The dangerous criminals gun haters like gun hater pilot are trying to unarm will simply not obey these laws. Actually the terrorist did obey the gun free zones on the airplanes on 9/11. It made it easier to take the airplanes over using box cutters! Gun haters must think being killed in a gun free zone with anything other then a gun is a kinder gentler death. I guess the people on the airplane that decided to fight before they were killed on the gun free airplane saved some people because the airplane did not reach it's target! I guess keeping these terrorist from killing even more people then what were on the airplane is not the kind common sense gun haters like!Hey gun hater pilot try negotiating with terrorist that plans on dying and taking their hostages with them.I know what gun hater pilot will say, the US Air Force will send up F16's to save the airplane. Got news for you gun hater pilot them there F16 ‘s are there to shoot down any airplane that does not land where they want them to. You know gun hater pilot to keep the airplanes full of people from killing even more innocent law abiding people!So gun hater continue your attack on peoples rights. Hey gun hater pilot the only thing I have said that gun hater pilot does not like is, if the airlines or even gun hater pilot denies a person the right to self defense that airline or gun hater pilot is responsible for that persons safety. I guess a person is a XXXXX for wanting to be safe in gun hater pilots mind!Gun haters says guns are the problem. Well gun hater pilot there were no guns on the airplanes on 9/11! At columbine there were no guns except for the ones the criminals had! Gun hater logic is unarmed victims die a kinder gentler death!The gun haters attack a book called more guns less crime because they hate guns. I guess no guns on the airplanes on 9/11 and gun freee zones proved that gun hater logic wrong.Law abiding citizens bearing arms is not the propblem. But this is the only group of people that obey gun control laws! We see even more of what gun haters call common sense!

Debating an ***** is never as much fun as debating an intelligent person...but here goes. If you feel the need to call me a gun hater...hmmm...what can i call you?Hey *****...i like guns, i own guns, i believe in my right to carry a gun...nuff said.[IMG]What if a terrorist or airline pilot that has gone postal hijacks a plane and is threatening to kill all on the plane.[/IMG] Hey *****...he would still be easier to deal with if he has a sharpened pen rather than a 40 cal.Hey *****...we will never truely know the answer to this, but I doubt that they would have prevented it. And it is completely feasable to believe that if the terrorists were able to apply for pilots licenses and get them, why could they not get a weapons permit. A pilots license requires application to the Federal Aviation Administration and The Department of Transportation. I know that they did this just like everyone else. (the examiner that flight tested me for my private pilots license and my instrument rating gave flight tests to several of the terrorists) How hard is it to get a weapons permit? Not very hard, a little money, fill out a form, send it in, wait for your permit. Even if they were not issued a permit, I could make you one on my computer in about 5 minutes.Hey *****...I am neither a gun hater nor a racist. Your argument is irrational and invalid. I believe very strongly in my right to own a gun, and I also believe in the equality of man...even ******.Hey *****...good for you. But think about one thing my little *****, If a terrorist were to carry a gun on a plane because the airline allows guns on board and did not know he was a terrorist; he takes it over, and crashes it...are the airlines not then responsible for that too? If citizens carry guns on board an aircraft because the airline says it is ok, and they kill someone accidentaly while shooting it out with a terrorist, the airline would still be responsible for the death because they allowed the gun to be carried aboard the aircraft. What if they accidentally bring the plane down while shooting at a terrorist like I said, then the airline that allowed that gun on board is still responsible. It is a catch .22 (little joke there). You cannot have it both ways. Asking any rational, non-***** will yeild you the same result, there is far more danger with guns on board than if they are not on board. Are you saying that you and six friends (or strangers sitting around you on the plane) would not fight or wrestle with a terrorist? It has been done since 9/11, and it worked. Oh yeah *****...you have the right to not get on my plane in the first place if I deny you your right to carry a gun on board. So if you get on board without your gun, YOU are responsible. There are other means of transportation...like you own car. In your case, I would recommend the car, even if going to Europe.Hey *****...no, they did not. But is the answer to take down the gun free zones...and just allow kids to carry guns to school? Sure, both Columbine and 9/11 caught us with our pants around our ankles, but we need to learn from these lessons...and in many respects we have. We have improved security, better bomb detection, better screeners, and more security on the aircraft itself. Hey *****...grow up. I am not trying to infringe upon your right to carry a firearm, just not on my plane. And unless you are a Federal Air Marshall or a criminal, you will NEVER do so on any commercial flight originating or entering the United States.

I suspect that there are laws against what he does with that gun and he probably is atypical, but seeing him make me question whether the average person can simply be trusted to have a gun.Heh, well its a political problem then. I don't think I would hear the end of it if I was to turn in my own brother for breaking this law. But that is my problem to deal with.As for the plane, don't you think that the fact that it is crowded could on occasion cause a gun to go off when it isn't supposed to? I think this would be especially true if large enough guns were allowed on the plane as they are clumsier.So basically there is no solution for it. It cannot be used to bolster either sides point. I just seen that you seemed to be using it as a defense for why gun control should be eliminated and I didn't understand how that could be.A gun of course but I would also rather the other person have a knife than a gun. I would also rather they have a hand gun than a silenced sniper rifle. I would also like for the police to have records of that person owning that gun so that if he did succeed he would be hunted down. Also I do suspect that if a person wants to kill you he will do so when your guard is down so although a gun would be nice to have this isn't always going to be an option.The illusion of safety is the same with a gun. You can feel safer although you may not actually be any safer. It is just a matter of your mindset.Do you think that any airlines would actually allow people to bring guns on their planes? My suspicion would be that few, if any would even consider this much less allow it. There are just too many risks and too many lives at stake. Planes are already so safe that they are the safest form of transportation in our country. I don't think they would want to risk this by adding guns to the mix when there is already a system in place that is extremely effective.

That is the most unconvincing thing I've heard you say yet. The what ifs are useless? Lives are at stake and you don't want to hear about what ifs? Are you saying that you would just implement something like this without asking what if? Frankly, that is just insane and I have a feeling that you know it doesn't make sense not to ask what if. You would at least want to do a test with people walking around a crowded area with loaded paintball guns just to see what would happen. If the probability of a gun going off accidently on a plane is likely enough that it will occur more than once per year, then I would debate that it has already become more of a threat than hijacking it today.You already made the argument against this by showing what things happen even when there are guns.As long as neither sides have safety then this cannot support either side of the argument either.Just wanted to see what you thought about that possibility. Here we are arguing it and I really don't know if anyone would even consider such an idea. It sounds way too risky to me especially if gun control laws are dropped.

how many people do you know act like your brother? He is far from "average"No it is an "I choose to be a victim" problem. You are telling me your life is not worth a little upheaval in your family? I would sign him up for an NRA saftey course and tell him that he must take this course and if he ever points a gun at you or anyone again in your presence again you will get a RESTRAINING ORDER (which thanks to scumbag lautenberg is all you need to get his guns taken away... guilty until proven innocent) or file menacing charges against him. EZ enough. The officer who shot scumbag James davis's killer in NYC fired up into a crowded balcony of panicked sheeple at 50 feet... 5 shots fired 5 shots center mass... These what ifs are useless... What if a herd of charging rhinos flew out my but and trampled a schoolbus full of nuns? Look at dhards posts... His brash style aside he is right on when you look at it logically.. 9/11 no guns look what happened.. Columbine... Gun free school zone... bo guns allowed... What happened..... and on and on and on.. When will you say ENOUGH! and start determining your own destiny?SILENCED SNIPER RIFLE! Hah thats funny... I guess bludgening someone with the but of a remmington 700 would constitute a "siclenced sniper rifle" Your starting to get it now... May I suggest that same gun saftey course and a pistol course from the NRA at your local gun range? Learn about these tools then you will be much better informed as to what is truth or fiction (most have guns you can use). Let me know I willl hook you up with a link.The Gun is a tool, I am the weapon. That is the mantra. I have no illusions of saftey with a gun. I know what I can and can not do with this tool and would deploy it as I see neccessary. I don't know, nor is it really an issue at hand. Airlone owners may agree with you that is thier choice and it is my choice if I want to utilize thier services.

Your using extremist logic. I am not sayin all what ifs in all cases are bad. I am saying here the what if game is pointless her. For every doom and gloom scenario you can imagine I can come up with an equally ridiculous puppies and wildflowers scenarion for the same topic.More importantly what are you going to do about your ignorant brother?

Get the info on the saftey course and make the ultimatum... This response is a beaten wife response..... He only thinks you don't like it not that the action is inherently dangerous. Use the family support structure if possible to make him see your seriousness.I have been in combat in the first gulf war I have seen first hand what these tools are capable of in the hands of skilled and not so skilled humans. (remember the tool requires a human to work!) I also know it is almost an illusion a "it can't happen to me or its not that dangerous mentality" until you see it first hand. I have a great respect for the rifle and the pistol. I am 100% pro constitution INCLUDING THE SECOND AMENMENDT and as a responsible gun owner saftey is my main concern. YOU ARE IN GRAVE DANGER! The choices you make now will be the choices you have to live with the REST OF YOUR LIFE!

Gun haters can only insult the people speaking out against them. Like all hate groups gun haters need to vilify the people the gun haters want to take rights away from. This is what makes gun haters a hate group!It is interesting that gun haters feel people defending their rights are “stupid, illogical, not a team player, not constructive to society, not being civilized, not being progressive .” Gun haters feel that taking rights away is good, while defending your rights makes you “stupid, illogical, not a team player, not constructive to society, not being civilized, not being progressive .” Let us not forget that another hate group called racist said the very same thing about the people they wanted to take rights away from. Is this is more gun hater common sense or logic?Also remember gun haters claim gun owners are paranoid. Gun hater pilot stated that we must suspect all people of being a criminal. That is called being paranoid! So gun hater pilot wants to disarm all law abiding citizens in a world where gun hater pilot stated we must consider all people suspicious. I guess gun hater pilot like all gun haters is thinking that dangerous criminals will obey gun control laws.

Your brother is commiting a crime called brandishing a firearm. I don't do it. Responsible gun owners do not beak laws. If he is unstable, then you are being irresponsible for not turning him in. I would not have any problem with turning in my own mother for firearm violations. Especially if her sanity is in question. Your behavior is irresponsible and is re-inforcing the myth that current legislation is insufficient to stop criminal acts with a firearm.
attacks
My point was to show that even if everyone had guns they still would have been completely helpless in all those situations.My brother is a redneck by his own definition. Along with other 'redneck' traits, he is so comfortable around a gun that he sometimes forgets that other people are not comfortable around a gun. He actually points it at people as a joke while it is loaded. That is insane but he doesn't understand that. I don't feel safe or comfortable around people like that and I'm sure you will find people like that who are more than willing to take guns onto planes if allowed to do so.Would you be comfortable around my brother? He really isn't that experienced with guns and he isn't a real thinking person when it comes to what the consequences of certain actions are. Even if you would feel comfortable around him, would you feel comfortable on a plane with your family around him?I'm really not as worried about being shot as I am worried that my brother will accidentally shoot someone. On a crowded plane I can see people accidentally bumping into each other and someone who was joking around with their gun will pull the trigger and kill someone. I worry about that more than someone using a gun in violence on a plane.I'm afraid I don't understand what your saying here. I was saying how a crazy person with a gun isn't likely to be stopped when he catches people by surprise, especially his own family. Repealing gun control laws isn't going to prevent this from happening.What your asking here is that people be trained to understand how to tell when a person is going to pull the trigger. That may be beneficial to know if confronted with a gun, but how many people will actually understand this at the time a gun is in their face and how likely is evasion assuming you are dealing with someone who just came back from fighting in a war?They will fail again regardless as to whether guns are on board or not. Eventually someone will bring a bomb onboard a plane and use that or maybe a chemical gas. Guns will not prevent failure. The best way to prevent failure would be to take away all the rights of the passengers and make them sit naked and tied down. Even then you have the risk of pilot error. You will not be able to prevent failure no matter what is done. You only wish to have the illusion of safety because you have gun. My illusion of safety is that we live in America and because of that we are safer on an airplane than anywhere else you could possibly be at the time.I might be coming around to your idea that gun control doesn't work but I don't like the idea of guns on planes at all. I really cannot see a real advantage while the risks are everywhere. Just not a good risk-reward scenario.

Just like a typical liberal, your waiting for someone else to step in and fix your problem for you. The laws already exist for stopping people who brandish a firearm or whose sanity is in question. What are you waiting for? The correct government official to step in and take care of your problems so your hands don't get dirty?You have no right to complain or fear for your saftey. You already have the tools in hand to protect yourslef. The Constitution and law is on your side, you just need a spine.

I said: Everyone has the POTENTIAL (again...note the word potential) to be a felon. The point I was making was that we cannot tell who is law abiding and who is not. Therefore, we should not allow anyone to carry a gun on a plane, because these people may either be law abiding or not. If restricting all people from carrying a gun on an airplane is treating people as criminals to you, too bad. I consider it making everyone on the plane safer. And apparently, so does the TSA, FAA, FBI, CIA, etc... I never said to treat everyone as a criminal. You again have put words in my mouth. I am sent through a metal detector, my bags go through x-ray, and if in any question, I am hand searched. It is the same for everyone flying. Again, if this is what you consider threating people like criminals. Anyone could be a terrorist. Remember, the 9/11 terrorists got on the planes lawfully. If the big point still eludes you , then perhaps you should give up on this debate.

How about shopping malls and petty theft? Should people be searched before the leave a shopping mall, because we can not tell who is a thief and who is not? How about rapist? Should we arrest all men because they have the potential to be rapist? Both actions will make the community safer. "And apparently, so does the TSA, FAA, FBI, CIA, etc... " CIA?

CIA: Central Intelligence Agency.Malls have security. Those little things attached to packages that make alarms go off when you take something from the store without paying for it. Perhaps you have heard of this. I never said arrest someone for having the potential to commit a crime. I said that since everyone has the potential to commit a crime, and we cannot distinguish between those who will and those who will not, we should not allow anyone to carry a gun on an airplane for this reason. This has nothing to do with letting John Q. Terrorist get on a plane. He might get on a plane, who cares...however he will do so without a gun. The arguement here kelvin is that DHARD thinks anyone with a CCW should be able to carry a gun on a plane. It has nothing to do with arresting someone because we think they are a terrorist or they might commit a crime. It is simply, should people be allowed to take a gun on a plane. I do not think guns are a problem in this country. But a terrorist on a plane with a gun could very well be a problem. So my answer, and apparently the way the majority of people see it, is to not allow ANY guns on planes (suprisingly: the way it is currently). If you want to chime in, understand the arguement first.

The CIA gathers intel from around the world in order to affect our policy both at home and abroad. Their intel filters down to influence policy made by others. Perhaps I should have used DHS or NSA, but again, you people always focus on the wrong thing and avoid the real issue. arrest: v. 1. To stop; check. 2. To seize and hold by legal authority. 3. To capture; engage: ie. arrested my attention ---n. 1. The act of detaining in legal custody. 2. The state of being so detained: under arrest . and come to think of it, when you get arrested they read you your rights! :) Gun Ban = a bad idea proposed by extremists who think illegalization will stop all or most gun related crimes. This will never happen, and is unconstitutional. Common sense gun CONTROL laws = Laws desired by the majority of Americans calling for common sense measures (ie. background checks for firearms purchase, the prohibition of guns in certain areas; such as airports and planes, schools, federal buildings, some workplaces, bars, etc.) Total repeal of all gun laws = a bad idea proposed by extremists who think having no gun laws will help reduce crime and protect people. This will never happen either, and would be unconstitutional.

Keeping prisoners in jail is not gun control, it is prisoner control. One more time: At the airport they have no choice. Nobody can carry a gun onto a plane.

As you have stated as common sense, guns are already baned. In some places as guise of public saftey. There are some places that guns are not allowed as a matter of preservation of civil rights such as courthouses, polling places, and private property. A law prohibiting carrying weapons on any of those places you mentioned where there is no civil rights violation for carrying a firearm, is a violation of the 2nd Amendment.CIA? I do not believe everything I read on the internet, especially here. So, were did you hear that the CIA recommends not allowing passengers to carry weapons on commercial airlines? It is important to the issue in trying to establish your credibility.Where did you read that the NSA recommends not allowing passengers to carry weapons on commericial arlines?I agree with instant background checks. With no waiting period. No cool off time. No limit on quantity of purchases. No central database of owners.

Which will help solve the "problem with criminals getting guns" oh so much more than the 20,000 laws on guns we have today. Which one protected the kids at colimbine? which ones?It has been shown that even today in screener tests that the screeners KNEW were coming that agents posing as terrorists smuggled.... guns, grenades, bombs etc RIGHT PAST THE SCREENERS! (all where deactivated obviously)STOP RELYING ON THE GOVERNMENT TO PROTECT YOU!You can't make the connection? Plane gets hijacked.. tangos have guns (which were smuggled past that holy grail called the TSA... Air Force comes up and shoots you down....GAME OVER.... STANDING ORDERS. Second scenario... Some (3) passengers have guns Kills tangos... 1 civillian not involved killed in crossfire 10 are injured. 200+ saved on plane countless on ground....Which is the better scenario?BTW: YOU ARE A TARGET!

I have no problem with that as long as there are no Constitutional objects to longer prison terms.Gun restrictions as practiced in this country is ineffective an unconstutional.Longer prison terms if Constitutional is just ineffective.The common arguement against gun restrictions is not the guns, it is the restriction of rights.

The early release of prisoners is not the root cause why felons commit crimes with firearms.Early release of prisoners is one of the causes of why CRIME is commited.So your right. Keeping prisoners in jail is not gun control. It is crime control.

Keeping prisoners in jail is not gun control, it is prisoner control. One more time: At the airport they have no choice. Nobody can carry a gun onto a plane. You do know that there are ways of screening for guns, don't you?That makes no sense. Am I familiar with intercept procedure and reason...yes. What does this have to do with taking guns on a plane or gun control?

True. Keeping prisoners in jail does prevent them from getting guns and using them to rob the local 7-11. This much is obvious. But agsin, it is not a measure of gun control. This is prisoner control resulting in crime prevention. The "gun free school zone" laws obviously did not help anyone at Columbine. Proper enforcement of these laws probably would have though, and this is what we need. Enforcement of the laws. Yes, in tests they have gotten guns, knives, explosives past the screeners, this is very true. But if you just simply allow everyone to carry a gun, then you allow the terrorists to be armed as well. I would rather that we find 99% of the weapons before they go on the plane, than to know that anyone intent on doing harm can carry a weapon on with the proper credentials. Wouldn't you?Then who am I to rely on, I sit in the cockpit remember? Am I to just assume you will be there? Am I to assume that every flight I take there are law abiding citizens on board who are porperly trained in the use of a firearm, willing to shoot it out with a terrorist? Suppose the only one that gets on my flight with a gun that day is the terrorist. That would make it fairly one sided in my opinion. That is very dangerous assumption. Could happen.Could happen.Third scenario...Some (3) "tangos" have guns...kill armed law abiding citizen passenger. Lose 1 tango in the process. By my math, 2 tangos left. 0 armed law abiding citizen passengers. 1 hijacked aircraft now on approach at JFK veers off coarse, and takes out the next big landmark, 200 on plane dead, thousands killed on ground. Could happen. The fact here is that we could argue scenarios to death with the same result. Could happen. Of coarse the best is your scenario (#2), the worst is mine. But look at the probabilty factor. If we screen all passengers, the probability is very low that any of these will happen. If we allow firearms to be carried on, the probability of these scenarios increases exponentially. It is a simple matter of risk assessment. The idea is to make it as risk free as possible. It will never be 100% risk free. And does anyone see the irony that the policies I am defending are the current policies in place? Someone other than me must have thought them up, and some group of people must have reviewed all the options and decided that this was the safest course of action. Until we have a safer policy, these are the ones that we will use. I am more than willing to give up my civil right to carry a gun on an airplane if it makes it safer for my family, myself, and those around me. I am sure the majority of Americans are willing to do the same.

I have no problem with that as long as there are no Constitutional objects to longer prison terms.Gun restrictions as practiced in this country is ineffective an unconstutional.Longer prison terms if Constitutional is just ineffective.The common arguement against gun restrictions is not the guns, it is the restriction of rights.

I haven't heard of anyone smuggling a gun on a plane. Anyway according to your logic, prisons should be abolished because some criminals have managed to escape from prison. What good are prisons if criminals can escape from them? Let's just let all the criminals run free. Screeners do a great deal of good just like prisons. You don't just trash something because it's not 100% effective.

Which will help solve the "problem with criminals getting guns" oh so much more than the 20,000 laws on guns we have today. Which one protected the kids at colimbine? which ones?It has been shown that even today in screener tests that the screeners KNEW were coming that agents posing as terrorists smuggled.... guns, grenades, bombs etc RIGHT PAST THE SCREENERS! (all where deactivated obviously)STOP RELYING ON THE GOVERNMENT TO PROTECT YOU!You can't make the connection? Plane gets hijacked.. tangos have guns (which were smuggled past that holy grail called the TSA... Air Force comes up and shoots you down....GAME OVER.... STANDING ORDERS. Second scenario... Some (3) passengers have guns Kills tangos... 1 civillian not involved killed in crossfire 10 are injured. 200+ saved on plane countless on ground....Which is the better scenario?BTW: YOU ARE A TARGET!

I agree. Gun laws that are no 100% effective or even down right poor are no concern to me. It is the gun laws that violate my rights are a concern to me.

You as a gun advocate SHOULD be concerned with the gun laws that are poor and make no sense. These are the laws that need to be changed, adjusted, or more importantly just enforced. And what gun laws violate your rights? If there is a law preventing you from taking a gun into a school, then you do not have the right to take a gun into the school. You cannot have violated what you do not have. Laws are written to support, defend, modify, or even supress elements of the constitution in order to apply it to modern day america.

Let me get this straight. You don't trust something that isn't 100% effective to keep you alive? Isn't it strange then that you trust a gun to keep you alive if it isn't 100% effective? Guns can jam and fail to fire, they can run out of bullets, they can be off on their target, and of course they cannot protect you from other guns. They are far from 100% effective. Mix the reality of guns with people and you lower their effectiveness even more because people can be ineffective in their use of the weapon and may use them at the wrong time or with the wrong intention. This will lower the effectiveness of your method well below the effectiveness of the current screener method. So why do you trust your method to keep you alive if it is not 100% effective?

Gun control laws demanded by the gun haters are only obeyed by the law abiding citizens!The only people the gun haters want to disarm are the law abiding citizens. Gun hater pilot has stated gun hater piloted would disarm law enforcement officers based on how they looked at gun hater pilot! Not one demand from the gun haters to solve the problem of crimes by criminals and terrorist is to deal withe the criminals or terrorist!Every demand from the gun haters is to attack the right of the law abiding citizens to bear arms!So when the gun haters deny a person the right to defend themselves they should be responsible for the person safety. When the gun haters fail to protect the unarmed law abiding citizens they should be held accountable! Criminally and financially!

Are you actually able to keep a straight face when screaming "EXTREMIST LOGIC"? In case you are wondering, the people you are yelling that at are the ones who are sticking to conventional logic and conventional methods. You are the one who is looking to make radical changes and because of that you are going to have to use extremist logic to help justify your reasoning which of course you have. Just the basic idea that guns on planes will make it safer is very extreme logic.You are not in control of your own destiny even with a gun. As I showed in my last post, guns fail and I'll add to that by saying people are unpredictable. Because people are unpredictable and guns fail, you are probably less in control of your own destiny on a plane with guns than you are on a plane that doesn't allow guns and has screeners.No low paid government agent controls your destiny either. They are simply going to play a small part in making sure no weapons are on board a plane. They are not literally in charge of anyones destiny! So I don't follow your logic here at all.Gun rights can protect you from other guns. They can make sure those guns are in the hands of responsible people and help to ensure that guns only get into certain places. So far it has been 100% effective in my case :)Once again, a gun doesn't make you the master of your own destiny. You may even be fighting on the side of what is right and true but that doesn't mean that guns are right and true. As you stated earlier, guns are a tool, you are the one who controls that tool. Would you proclaim that total gun freedom is right and true and that gun control is not right or true? Remember now, guns are just a tool :)Your gun firing ability does not make you master of your destiny. If you were to be shot from behind, you would already be dead. Your ability wouldn't save you. So to claim that you are master of your own destiny just shows how far out there you are in your beliefs that guns are the answer to problems.

Hey DHARD, could you please make a logical arguement if you want to continue your posting on this thread. You spout off the same illogical banter in every post, and it is getting to the point where I just want to avoid even reading them...because i know what they say already. A debate is a fluid thing...we make a point, argue/defend, and move on. Your gun hater slogans may make sense to you, but to logical people on this thread they are really nothing more than illogical rantings. Calling me a gun hater shows your level of ignorance in this world. I have said that I am a gun owner. I have said that I shoot these guns. I have said that I carry my pistol with me (concealed with a ccw) quite often. You may chose to think I am making this up in some grand gesture to win your hearts so I can change your minds. Well, you are entitled to your belief, I really don't care. Just do me a favor, COME UP WITH A VALID ARGUEMENT FOR YOUR POSITION. Don't just keep spouting off your pointless XXXX telling everyone else what I, your so called gun hater pilot, want to do. If you think I just want to disarm law abiding citizens then you need to go back and reread the posts I have put up. If you think I don't want to address criminals and terrorists, you are an *****. You never did understand what I was saying about a pilots authority to kick someone off an airplane. It was not about me being prejudice about someone bringing a gun on my plane. Maybe you need to go back and reread some more. It was an example, but you continue to shout that with just about every post. The whole point pretty much is that as a pilot, I can tell someone to get off my plane. I would probably never do that to a law enforcement officer with the proper paperwork, I would however do this to ordinary citizens with guns if the law was ever changed to accomodate you. Almost every pilot I know has said they would do the same thing. Either that, or we would all walk off the airplanes, and you would not be able to fly anyway. I really find it quite funny that I am defending the current policy and you are trying (although not logically) to agrue for the opposite. I may not agree with kelvin and rev either, but they actually argue with some degree of intelligence. They know how to present an opinion, argue it, back it up with facts, and most importantly the listen and respond to other peoples opinions. If you want to debate...then debate. If you want to continue to call people gun haters and tell other people our so called agenda, you might as well stop posting. As of now, you have no credibility with me, and I bet that a lot of logical people, no matter what side of the debate they are on, would feel the same way.

Even if I am irrational I am still part of the conventional logic. You should realize that you are the extremist here and not everyone who is arguing you.Show me an example where allowing guns on planes will save lives. It is just theoretical. I could prove to you that the elimination of all guns will save lives by simply subtracting all gun deaths from our national total of deaths per year. That would theoretically work except the fact that more knife murders may occur then and perhaps guns will be brought in illegally to murder people. I can answer the question you are asking but you will simply be able to show how my answer is just theoretical just as your response would be. This would be pointless.Your teeth can fail and my belly can succeed, it just depends on the situation. There are situations where I'll be more in control of my destiny without a gun and you corner yourself and lost complete control of your destiny because of your gun. It is situational. You could just as easily die on your knees while I walk away. You can't just assume that a gun puts you in a better position as you seem to be doing. I'll admit that it will often come in handy although I doubt you will ever admit that it could work against you.Who is they? The low paid government workers control you destiny because they won't allow you to look dirty at pilots? The pilots control your destiny more by flying the plane than they do by not allowing guns on it! I suppose in the case of disaster you will push the pilot out of the way and fly the plane? Oops, your logic just failed.Of course you are and so is everyone else. This doesn't give you any advantage as long as everyone else is armed. It could even put you at more of a disadvantage if the group opposing you is coordinated against you and you do not know it.Gun rights work just fine as they stand today. You call it complete gun control but there are gun rights as well. They work well hand in hand as it stands. I see no problem right now.My brother is the proof that gun control is necessary. I don't see how you think that he is evidence that there should be no gun control at all.Once again, you are not the master of your own destiny. If you were then you would be in complete control which of course you are not regardless as to whether you have a gun or not. Your actions may even prove to be responsible for something that isn't righteous or true.Guns are a tool that can fail. You have to realize that. You are also possible of failure because of a gun. This again shows that you are not the master of your own destiny.I'd debate that if the criminal wants to kill you then you are already dead. My friend is a black belt and awesome in karate. I could beat him in a hand to hand fight if he was unsuspecting enough. If he doesn't anticipate my criminal intentions then he would lose. The same would go for you if a criminal was to attack you while you were unaware of his intentions. Again, proof that you are not the masters of your own destiny.A gun being aimed at you may not even give you time to draw your own gun before you are dead especially if you don't see it coming or you are outnumbered. A gun can get you killed just as it can save you. Guess what this shows?You believe guns are the key to controlling your destiny and this is of course false, you just don't realize it. I never suspected that you were this blinded by the power of a gun until now and I have to begin to question some of the stuff you have said in previous posts. If you believe a gun is the ultimate answer to controlling your destiny then you are blinded by your love of guns and cannot rationally debate them. I can see why you also think that conventional logic is extremist logic. You don't think like a conventional person would and you therefore see everyone who disagrees with you as using logic that doesn't seem realistic and therefore is extreme. To each his own I guess as I cannot even begin to believe that I can show you my point of view if you believe that I am an extremist and you believe that guns are the controller of destiny.

Yes, at an airport they do disarm the law abiding citizen. They also prevent criminals from carry dangerous weapons aboard an aircraft. I think that the majority of law abiding citizens (which most law abiding citizens do not carry guns by the way) understand that this is a measure enacted for safety. I wonder if people would feel safe knowing anyone is able to carry a gun onto a plane (law abiding citizen and criminal), or that we are screening for weapons and attemting to ensure that none pass through. And as far as that machine gun ban saving lives, that is a pointless question. If it has saved lives, we would really never know, think about that.The dirty look thing is really getting old, I have explained that several times and I will not do so again. I would not refuse the law abiding citizen with a gun based on how he looks at me, I would simply refuse the law abiding citizen with a gun. There is a difference. Again, most other pilots that I know have said they would do the same thing. If a law was enacted allowing citizens to carry guns on board planes, the majority of pilots would be on strike so fast, the airline industry would grind to a halt. And if you feel so strongly about you convictions, why would you go against them and fly on a plane unarmed? Seems you would be better off not flying at all.Then why would you need a gun on a plane? This is the point. You can defend yourself without one, and 100 unarmed passengers against 3 unarmed terrorists kinda puts the odds in your favor. Gun laws do not prevent stupidity. They do however provide a penalty for stupidity with guns. Seems like common sense would handle this problem. Take his guns and lock them up if he cannot handle them responsibly. He is the kind of person that would accidentally kill someone with a gun and thereby make some flower toting liberal say "oh my god, guns are so dangerous...let's get rid of them all!" Don't be part of the problem by allowing him to be an idiot. Take them, hide them, lock them up. You said above that your destiny is in your hands even if you fail, you said that you are a weapon even without your gun. That is what they are trying to do by verifying that nobody carries a gun on board. They may be disarming the law abiding citizens, but they disarm the criminals as well.

Almost every pilot I know has said they would do the same thing. Either that, or we would all walk off the airplanes, and you would not be able to fly anyway. I really find it quite funny that I am defending the current policy and you are trying (although not logically) to agrue for the opposite. I may not agree with kelvin and rev either, but they actually argue with some degree of intelligence. They know how to present an opinion, argue it, back it up with facts, and most importantly the listen and respond to other peoples opinions. If you want to debate...then debate. If you want to continue to call people gun haters and tell other people our so called agenda, you might as well stop posting. As of now, you have no credibility with me, and I bet that a lot of logical people, no matter what side of the debate they are on, would feel the same way.

Interesting how gun hater pilots logic is to ban the right of law abiding Americans to bear arms!Typical gun hater logic.Criminals kill people so gun haters like gun hater pilot want to pass gun control laws that only law abiding citizens obey!I guess gun hater pilot would call this common sense gun control!Ban the right of law abiding American to bear arms while allowing dangerous criminal to remain free!Oh and yes gun hater pilot you did state you would ban a law enforcement officer the right to carry their gun onto your airplane even if they had the proper paperwork. Gun hater piloted stated that this would be based solely on how the law enforcement officer looked at gun hater pilot!

Hey DHARD, could you please make a logical arguement if you want to continue your posting on this thread. You spout off the same illogical banter in every post, and it is getting to the point where I just want to avoid even reading them...because i know what they say already. A debate is a fluid thing...we make a point, argue/defend, and move on. Your gun hater slogans may make sense to you, but to logical people on this thread they are really nothing more than illogical rantings. Calling me a gun hater shows your level of ignorance in this world. I have said that I am a gun owner. I have said that I shoot these guns. I have said that I carry my pistol with me (concealed with a ccw) quite often. You may chose to think I am making this up in some grand gesture to win your hearts so I can change your minds. Well, you are entitled to your belief, I really don't care. Just do me a favor, COME UP WITH A VALID ARGUEMENT FOR YOUR POSITION. Don't just keep spouting off your pointless XXXX telling everyone else what I, your so called gun hater pilot, want to do. If you think I just want to disarm law abiding citizens then you need to go back and reread the posts I have put up. If you think I don't want to address criminals and terrorists, you are an *****. You never did understand what I was saying about a pilots authority to kick someone off an airplane. It was not about me being prejudice about someone bringing a gun on my plane. Maybe you need to go back and reread some more. It was an example, but you continue to shout that with just about every post. The whole point pretty much is that as a pilot, I can tell someone to get off my plane. I would probably never do that to a law enforcement officer with the proper paperwork, I would however do this to ordinary citizens with guns if the law was ever changed to accomodate you.

Thanks, I think you just proved my previous post.

Gun hater logic.Terrorist use guns to hijack airplanes. Gun hater solution ban anybody from carrying guns onto a airplane.Result terrorist used the next available item allowed (box cutters) on the airplanes to hijack the airplanes and fly them into the WTC. Gun hater logic, more searches and check points and add box cutters to the list of not allowed items on a airplane. Results a business brought to it’s knees and the next time terrorist want to hijack a airplane they will simply use the next available items allowed on airplane to hijack all of the unarmed law abiding citizens.Once again when gun haters and the government deny people the right to defend themselves the gun haters and government should be held responsible if the unarmed people are killed!

Thanks, I think you just proved my previous post.

Why not instead of posting gun hater arguement, why don't you present YOUR arguement. Do you have one, or do you just want to call people gun hater all day? And what next available items? Pencils? Pens? What? Remember, if the terrorists can carry it, so can we. The 9/11 terrorists were able to legally carry boxcutters on board. They have a what, 1 inch blade? Are you aware that the law abiding citizen was allowed to carry up to a 4 inch blade on a plane on the morning of 9/11? This did not prevent anything, but the laws did allow weapons to be brought aboard the planes, the planes were taken over, and the terrorist used them to kill 3000+. I would think that any rational American learned a lesson against allowing obviously dangerous weapons on a plane. You said this before, it made no sense then, it still makes no sense. It is an invalid arguement.

What?!?!? The Nazis were irrational and were the "conevtional logic" of the time!All through the 70's pilots were permited to carry guns on planes... in the 40's anyone could.... how many deaths? 0your extermist slim view is most frustrating. Did you even read my last post? I am the weapon, My gun, my rifle, my fists and my boots are tools How would I ever corner myself and "loose control" simply because I would carry a gun? This is extremist logic.. You seem to think I would go nuts and get myself killed simply for carrying a gun... Well I turn this around on you.. You are a phsycopathic civil rights violator who is willing to put me in harms way for your ideology. You are essentially violating the 14th amendment by denying me my civil rights. You have shown your propesnity for the absurd and it is YOU who should be regulated.They is the federal government and civil right vilolator extremists like yourself who are more worried about me and my 2nd amendment rights than his VERY OWN LIFE when it comes to the scenarios you have put YOURSELF in.In case of disaster a monkey with headphones on could land a plane... Don't believe the pilot hype that planes are hard to fly.... XXXX I could talk you down by reading the instructions on the internet.....Even more extreme. I am not for a 100% armed society I am for the choice... most likley (number pulled out of air) 15% will carry... But it will deter the criminal element from violent crimes as they have a 15 in 100 chance of being shot if they attack somebody. Besides I train in 3 man tactical scenarios all the time...How many crimes did the 1994 assault weapons ban stop? How many gangstas attacked people by bayonet charge? (one of the things the AWB made illegal) WHY DO POLICE AND THE FEDGOV get these very weapons that are supposed to be "bad"? How many legal gun owners have killed innocents? How many cops and fedgov agents killed? look at Waco.... 75 percent of ATF casualties were from "friendly fire" they killed all those people all over a $200 tax? And don't give me that "he thought he was jeezus and he has sec with lots of women"... So did clinton. And WTF were tax agents doin there if that was what it was about?Remember 170 million killed by governments this last century alone....No you brother is proof that you are a sheep... Made to lick the bootheels of your fedgov masters... While you hope and pray for them to save you from the one day your brother kills you or someone you love...Don't legislate YOUR stupidity on law abiding citizens like myself. Comparing me to your brother is an insult and your bigotry is now well noted. If your predjuces (based on one case) can't allow you to see the whole picture I can no longer say I care. Your attempts at making me a criminal by violating the constitution all for the sake of your personal well being is selfish and narrow sighted. You are whats wrong with this country... Would you make these same arguments at an NRA meeting?You as a sheep simply do not understand.Round and round... Of course guns can fail... people can fail.... hammers can fail... But I am willing to die trying. YOU won't even stand up for yourself... You have rolled onto your back and shown your belly already! And when that day your brother kills your sister/mother/family member what will you say at the funeral... what will the eulogy be?

If you are looking for an excuse to "bow out" with your belly shown just go as this display of victimhood turns my stomache and makes me want to weep for my countrymen.I will leave you with the words of Patriot Samuel Adams:"If ye love wealth better than liberty, the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom, go home from us in peace.

Even if I am irrational I am still part of the conventional logic. You should realize that you are the extremist here and not everyone who is arguing you.Show me an example where allowing guns on planes will save lives. It is just theoretical. I could prove to you that the elimination of all guns will save lives by simply subtracting all gun deaths from our national total of deaths per year. That would theoretically work except the fact that more knife murders may occur then and perhaps guns will be brought in illegally to murder people. I can answer the question you are asking but you will simply be able to show how my answer is just theoretical just as your response would be. This would be pointless.Your teeth can fail and my belly can succeed, it just depends on the situation. There are situations where I'll be more in control of my destiny without a gun and you corner yourself and lost complete control of your destiny because of your gun. It is situational. You could just as easily die on your knees while I walk away. You can't just assume that a gun puts you in a better position as you seem to be doing. I'll admit that it will often come in handy although I doubt you will ever admit that it could work against you.Who is they? The low paid government workers control you destiny because they won't allow you to look dirty at pilots? The pilots control your destiny more by flying the plane than they do by not allowing guns on it! I suppose in the case of disaster you will push the pilot out of the way and fly the plane? Oops, your logic just failed.Of course you are and so is everyone else. This doesn't give you any advantage as long as everyone else is armed. It could even put you at more of a disadvantage if the group opposing you is coordinated against you and you do not know it.Gun rights work just fine as they stand today. You call it complete gun control but there are gun rights as well. They work well hand in hand as it stands. I see no problem right now.My brother is the proof that gun control is necessary. I don't see how you think that he is evidence that there should be no gun control at all.Once again, you are not the master of your own destiny. If you were then you would be in complete control which of course you are not regardless as to whether you have a gun or not. Your actions may even prove to be responsible for something that isn't righteous or true.Guns are a tool that can fail. You have to realize that. You are also possible of failure because of a gun. This again shows that you are not the master of your own destiny.I'd debate that if the criminal wants to kill you then you are already dead. My friend is a black belt and awesome in karate. I could beat him in a hand to hand fight if he was unsuspecting enough. If he doesn't anticipate my criminal intentions then he would lose. The same would go for you if a criminal was to attack you while you were unaware of his intentions. Again, proof that you are not the masters of your own destiny.A gun being aimed at you may not even give you time to draw your own gun before you are dead especially if you don't see it coming or you are outnumbered. A gun can get you killed just as it can save you. Guess what this shows?You believe guns are the key to controlling your destiny and this is of course false, you just don't realize it. I never suspected that you were this blinded by the power of a gun until now and I have to begin to question some of the stuff you have said in previous posts. If you believe a gun is the ultimate answer to controlling your destiny then you are blinded by your love of guns and cannot rationally debate them. I can see why you also think that conventional logic is extremist logic. You don't think like a conventional person would and you therefore see everyone who disagrees with you as using logic that doesn't seem realistic and therefore is extreme. To each his own I guess as I cannot even begin to believe that I can show you my point of view if you believe that I am an extremist and you believe that guns are the controller of destiny.

Conventional to their small group. I'm sure you have a small group of people who also believe your logic is what is conventional. The Nazi logic ended up affecting the world therefore you have to judge their sense of logic against that of the world in which case they were extremists.This is out of the context of today. How many terrorists were using planes as weapons back then? How many people are getting killed on planes today? The situation has changed therefore what worked in the past will not necessarily work today.Of course I read your last post. I'm not under the assumption that every life threatening event will end in death although you seem to be. The majority of the time you will be just fine if you cooperate with the criminal although resisting him may result in death. You could easily lose control of your fate simply by pulling your gun at the wrong time or having it be seen by the wrong person. That is conventional logic. You seem to think that I will simply get killed because I don't have a gun. I don't know why you assume this but you do so have at it. I'd rather have a gun than be unarmed but I'm not going to be so blind as to believe that without a gun I will die and with a gun I am in control. I cannot see why you think this way and it is most frustrating to me.The federal government is now an extremist as well? This went from a single person being an extremist to the entire government in a matter of moments? Shesh, no wonder you want anarchy.I didn't ask who could land the plane. You said that "But I will not stand down and sit idle and hope others will come to my rescue in the event of a disaster" and I asked if in the case of a plane disaster if you would begin to pilot the plane. I wanted to know if you are willing to depend on the pilot or not in the case of a disaster as this would defeat your stated opinion.It may deter but it still doesn't mean that you are in total charge just because you have a gun.You train for this but you have to admit that even a single person could defeat you if they wanted to and there is really nothing you could do about it. The extremist government would actually have the best chance of protecting you if someone was out to get you.lol, if you want to debate statistics I have to do no more than point out how many gun deaths the US has per year already to debate that guns are not going to save lives. If you want to end gun deaths you can eliminate the guns and in the US that saves a lot of lives on paper.Wow, that whole statement there makes you look really intelligent. Good job trying to stay on target here instead of using ad hominem arguments.lol, to follow up your last paragraph you now show that you are unwilling to read before responding. I never compared you to my brother so I hope you will do the right thing and retract this entire paragraph.Oh I am? I thought criminals were what was wrong with this country :)Why, would you?I don't understand? Are you sure that you believe that having a gun means you have complete control over your destiny? lol, talk about not understanding :)There you go again. You love the idea that guns kill and you are so sure that they will kill. I can't believe you support guns at all with how much killing you say that they do.Nah karate is beneficial in my opinion. You do improve your strength and stamina as well as becoming more disciplined and confident in yourself. Plus you get the added ability of being able to protect yourself in a hand to hand combat and even help prevent injury in a major fall. I think the benefits of karate are almost endless but your right, this is another topic.My theme is that you are wrong in your assumption that you are in complete control as long as you have a gun. If someone wanted to kill you then you are already dead. So yes you will always be open for defeat even if you have a gun. The knowledge and weapon doesn't hurt to have but it doesn't make you in complete control of your destiny. I hope you realize that.lol, my solution is your solution, not to pull a gun if one were close to my head. At least we agree on something :) But again my point was that you are not going to be in complete control of your destiny just because you have a gun. If someone gets the jump on you then it doesn't matter if you have a gun or not. Your destiny will be in their hands. I just want to make you see this.Well I still fail to understand what you mean by you are the master of your own destiny. Do you really know what destiny even is? Of course your stance is as I've stated and I only am quoting what you have stated in your posts. If your stance is otherwise then why do you keep repeating it the same way?lol victimhood? I'd rather be a victim than a corpse. I have a feeling that in the case of an actual crime you would be more likely to be a corpse than I would be. You would create a problem without the need to do so by bringing guns into a tense situation while I would try to diffuse the situation. So who is more likely to walk away, you or me? You just sound like you're out to cause trouble.I'm proud of this country and am glad to see that the majority is sensible in their wants. I don't believe that you are trying to be sensible and nor do you seem to be asking for something that is in the interest of this nation. You just seem to want to have your way and I don't know what your intentions are if you were to get your way but I for one would be suspicious of them.

Ya think so? Boy, think of it, all that training and I could have just had someone read me the instructions! All the money I could have saved, all the time! I would give you about a 1 in 50 chance if getting it on the ground (note I said ground, not even runway) without killing someone. I would give you about a 1 in 100 chance of getting it on the ground without bending it. Man, I wish I could take you up in a 76, let you sit in my seat, and try to talk you through a landing. That is one of the dumbest things I ever heard. There is a little more to it than push forward, trees get bigger, pull back they get smaller! Pull back too much, they get bigger in a hurry! I would also love to see you fly just a simulator in IMC (in the clouds, no outside visual reference). I would try to talk you down, but as you came spinning out of the sky I don't think I would have time. What's the weather like over in fantasy land today?

I am going to condense this as its getting too longShow me the statistics on your first point. Of the disproportionate number of rape victims I have had come through one of my unarmed combat classes the majority were told to not to resist. You know what... They were raped 100% of the time. These women sought out a way to protect themselves so that it would never happen again. To them some things are much worse than death. If your brother killed someone you loved and shot you within an inch of your life I would bet my arsenal your opinion to be "a good doggie" and roll to show your tummy and XXXX yourself would change... Either that or you would break down. That my friend is reality.knowing I may be killed, Knowing that I may be killed no matter what I do. I choose to say no to being the victim. I refuse to die on my knees. I refuse to let this criminal be 100% in control. This is how I am (or my students) are the masters of my/thier destiny. Most of these women when they joined have told me they would kill themselves before they would let it happen again. Now they make a similar comment but the killing part is on a slightly different "subject". Which of these women are you? NO I DONT! How many times do I have to say this. Please quote me so I can see where I failed to convey this message to you!Was waco an extreme response to a suposed tax violation? was shooting randy weaver's son in the back and his wife thhrough the head and extreme reaction for supposedly selling a shotgun with a stock 3/8 too short?I don't want anarchy. Please read the link at the bottom of my tagline to see what I want.Never said I did. You applied this reasoning to me. I keep telling you its just another toolDidn't I already cover this? Show me where I ever said a gun was an absolute?Eliminating guns? OK eliminate guns.... Will you do this before or after you eliminate drugs and prostitution... oh oh what about gambling.... then I guess you better eliminate knives too... don't forget cars! That was not ad hominen.. Actually its an observation. You said that "people like my brother are why we need gun control" Now while I did not respond with happy words my point was made. You want to restrict MY rights because you allow your brother to point a gun at you and refuse to diffuse a life threatening situation because you don't want to get your mommy mad."people like my brother are why we need gun control" Either you think that I am like your brother and need to be regulated or your willing to assume I am guilty before innocent simply because I have a gun. You want to regulate my lawful activities based on your pshycopath of a brother. My feeling that you compared me to your brother is so much less of a stretch than this mis information you keep using stating that a gun is an absolute. ***YAWN***Yet for the gazillionth time you are attributing points to me that I do not hold.heh heh heh.. (laughing at this notion..) moving on....***YAWN***Yet for the gazillionth time you are attributing points to me that I do not hold.(I will be using this line everytime you bring up this wrong assumption)***YAWN***Yet for the gazillionth time you are attributing points to me that I do not hold.But I will say this.. Having a gun potentialy increases your odds of survival in some circumstances[/b] in which you would otherwise be killed..Lets just leave this as you don't get it. This is why you are sheep. You are leaving the choice of being a victim or a corpse up to your assailiant. I am moving it to myself. You assume I would not try to "diffuse" the situation but rather come out swinging, shooting, whatever. You are so one sided that you wouldn't even consider that I might. 1. Play victim to a point  that the scumbag thinks he is in control. 2. try to talk the guy out of it. 3. run The difference is that I am choosing what my response would be to the point that best suits my life. I do not leave it up to the criminal. He does not have my interests in heart.Answer these:A mugger approaches you with a knife which ones would you allow him to do?1. take your wallet?2. take your girlfriends wallet.3. fondle your girlfriend4. fondle you.5. put you in the back of his van6. handcuff you7. blindfold you8. rape your girlfriend9. rape you10. Kill your girlfriend11. Kill you?Now answer the same question if this guy had a gunI am not trying to trap you here. I use a questionare very similar to this at my CQB school. You suspicious of me? I don't want ANYTHING from you... You however want something from me.Are you sure you are in the majority?(ok so I didn't really condense this yet)

Conventional to their small group. I'm sure you have a small group of people who also believe your logic is what is conventional. The Nazi logic ended up affecting the world therefore you have to judge their sense of logic against that of the world in which case they were extremists.This is out of the context of today. How many terrorists were using planes as weapons back then? How many people are getting killed on planes today? The situation has changed therefore what worked in the past will not necessarily work today.Of course I read your last post. I'm not under the assumption that every life threatening event will end in death although you seem to be. The majority of the time you will be just fine if you cooperate with the criminal although resisting him may result in death. You could easily lose control of your fate simply by pulling your gun at the wrong time or having it be seen by the wrong person. That is conventional logic. You seem to think that I will simply get killed because I don't have a gun. I don't know why you assume this but you do so have at it. I'd rather have a gun than be unarmed but I'm not going to be so blind as to believe that without a gun I will die and with a gun I am in control. I cannot see why you think this way and it is most frustrating to me.The federal government is now an extremist as well? This went from a single person being an extremist to the entire government in a matter of moments? Shesh, no wonder you want anarchy.I didn't ask who could land the plane. You said that "But I will not stand down and sit idle and hope others will come to my rescue in the event of a disaster" and I asked if in the case of a plane disaster if you would begin to pilot the plane. I wanted to know if you are willing to depend on the pilot or not in the case of a disaster as this would defeat your stated opinion.It may deter but it still doesn't mean that you are in total charge just because you have a gun.You train for this but you have to admit that even a single person could defeat you if they wanted to and there is really nothing you could do about it. The extremist government would actually have the best chance of protecting you if someone was out to get you.lol, if you want to debate statistics I have to do no more than point out how many gun deaths the US has per year already to debate that guns are not going to save lives. If you want to end gun deaths you can eliminate the guns and in the US that saves a lot of lives on paper.Wow, that whole statement there makes you look really intelligent. Good job trying to stay on target here instead of using ad hominem arguments.lol, to follow up your last paragraph you now show that you are unwilling to read before responding. I never compared you to my brother so I hope you will do the right thing and retract this entire paragraph.Oh I am? I thought criminals were what was wrong with this country :)Why, would you?I don't understand? Are you sure that you believe that having a gun means you have complete control over your destiny? lol, talk about not understanding :)There you go again. You love the idea that guns kill and you are so sure that they will kill. I can't believe you support guns at all with how much killing you say that they do.Nah karate is beneficial in my opinion. You do improve your strength and stamina as well as becoming more disciplined and confident in yourself. Plus you get the added ability of being able to protect yourself in a hand to hand combat and even help prevent injury in a major fall. I think the benefits of karate are almost endless but your right, this is another topic.My theme is that you are wrong in your assumption that you are in complete control as long as you have a gun. If someone wanted to kill you then you are already dead. So yes you will always be open for defeat even if you have a gun. The knowledge and weapon doesn't hurt to have but it doesn't make you in complete control of your destiny. I hope you realize that.lol, my solution is your solution, not to pull a gun if one were close to my head. At least we agree on something :) But again my point was that you are not going to be in complete control of your destiny just because you have a gun. If someone gets the jump on you then it doesn't matter if you have a gun or not. Your destiny will be in their hands. I just want to make you see this.Well I still fail to understand what you mean by you are the master of your own destiny. Do you really know what destiny even is? Of course your stance is as I've stated and I only am quoting what you have stated in your posts. If your stance is otherwise then why do you keep repeating it the same way?lol victimhood? I'd rather be a victim than a corpse. I have a feeling that in the case of an actual crime you would be more likely to be a corpse than I would be. You would create a problem without the need to do so by bringing guns into a tense situation while I would try to diffuse the situation. So who is more likely to walk away, you or me? You just sound like you're out to cause trouble.I'm proud of this country and am glad to see that the majority is sensible in their wants. I don't believe that you are trying to be sensible and nor do you seem to be asking for something that is in the interest of this nation. You just seem to want to have your way and I don't know what your intentions are if you were to get your way but I for one would be suspicious of them.

Yes absolutley. Any thirteen year old with "flight simulator" could do as good a job as you. How to land a plane Why are you pilots so arrogant... This explains your snobbish attitude towards those who you suppsedly agree with you. I was a loadmaster in the Air-force for a while and practiced emergency drills with the pilot so I could (in an emergency) be guided (which became obviously unneccesarry) to land both 130s and 141s. So I know the drill. Besides... don't most commercial airlines have planes that all but land themselves? Those guys aren't even bus drives anymore... More like subway drivers.... get off yourself!What is the ideal cockpit crew? A pilot and a dog...the pilot is there to feed the dog, and the dog is there to bite the pilot in case he tries to touch anything.How many pilots does it take to change a light bulb? Just one. He holds the bulb and the world revolves around him.How do you know if a pilot is at your party? He'll tell you.How do you know when you are half way through a date with a pilot?Because he says: "That's enough about flying, let's talk about me"!Little boy to airline pilot: "You're a pilot?!?!? That must be exciting."Pilot: "Not if I do it right."

Ya think so? Boy, think of it, all that training and I could have just had someone read me the instructions! All the money I could have saved, all the time! I would give you about a 1 in 50 chance if getting it on the ground (note I said ground, not even runway) without killing someone. I would give you about a 1 in 100 chance of getting it on the ground without bending it. Man, I wish I could take you up in a 76, let you sit in my seat, and try to talk you through a landing. That is one of the dumbest things I ever heard. There is a little more to it than push forward, trees get bigger, pull back they get smaller! Pull back too much, they get bigger in a hurry! I would also love to see you fly just a simulator in IMC (in the clouds, no outside visual reference). I would try to talk you down, but as you came spinning out of the sky I don't think I would have time. What's the weather like over in fantasy land today?

lol, if you have to ask then the point is already lost on you.What percent of those who resisted are now dead? That is exactly the point. You encourage resistance but won't admit that resistance has its disadvantages! Also you must be assuming that your arsenal would be an option at all if you were attacked. Reality would be that the criminal is looking to accomplish something with minimal difficulty and making as clean of a get away as possible. You would make both impossible and therefore people would of course get hurt. That is reality.That still doesn't make you master of your destiny. If you have no control then you are not master of your destiny. You can refuse to die on your knees but that doesn't prevent death from coming to you. Therefore the criminal would be 100% in control. You can try and convince yourself that you are in control just because you refuse to get on your knees but that doesn't mean that you are in control at all.I congratulate them for their willingness to die to protect themselves. That takes a lot of guts to do but that still doesn't make them master of their destiny. I’d also encourage them to learn some karate to go along with weapons skills as it will improve their hand to hand combat which will be most beneficial in that situation.I'm the pretty blonde I think. Watch it, I practice the open hand :)lol, need I remind you that you said you are master of your destiny. This would mean that you are in control. You also preach resistance and use of force. This would indicate violence will occur anyways so be pre-emptive. I just get the feeling that you are obsessed with the idea that violence will occur and you need a gun to save your life. But if you don't think that this is the case then at least I can see you have not lost complete touch with reality. Still I cannot understand your obsession with being in control of your reality based on having a gun.I'm not sure what your saying here. We were discussing how a screener at the airport was an extremist government agent and suddenly you then jumped to accusing the entire government of being extremists. Now I'm not really sure how you got on the topic of Waco but alright, sure they are government extremists as well I guess.You don't want anarchy, you just don't want any more gun laws and it doesn't go beyond that correct? I'm guessing your views are libertarian based on pieces of your posts?Sure you did. You said you were in master of your destiny.You said you were master of your destiny.I gave an example, I never suggested that it was a good idea to eliminate guns. I wanted to show that statistics could show whatever you want them to show on paper. But just to answer your question, I would eliminate drugs first of course. Gambling is perfectly fine with me although it has to be controlled. Knives are too easy to make to eliminate so why even try? Cars cannot be eliminated unless teleportation is developed. At that time cars can be eliminated. Which order would you eliminate them in anyways?Hey as long as it was not ad hominem and was instead not happy words :) hehe, well I'll forgive you for it, just be a little more careful in the future.Why would that mean that you are like my brother? I singled out my brother as an unusual case. How does that mean that everyone is like him including yourself? I realize you are not my brother and probably no one else in the world is, unless he has a twin!!!! (DAAAAH)I want to regulate you because I cannot trust you. I think you want too many freedoms and that will open up security risks for those who truly are good citizens. I think that you and people like you are asking for way too much to be doing it just for the good of mankind. You are out to accomplish something other than what you are stating therefore I cannot say that I trust you. So although you are not my brother, I cannot trust you more than I trust my brother. You are too fanatical about your belief.You have yet to clarify what you mean then. Let me help you. You are master of your destiny.Destiny - an event (or course of events) that will inevitably happen in the future.Therefore you are the master of what will happen to you in the future or what is currently happening to you. Do you realize type of mindset you would have to have in order to believe this? That is why I question your ability to understand a lot about this debate. I'm not sure whether or not you believe that you truly are master of your destiny or not. If you actually believe that you are then you are a few bricks short of a building.hehe, yeah I think it is pretty cool too. You stated that you wouldn't pull your gun if someone had one by your head. You are obsessed with being master of your destiny and if you knew karate you would have quick enough reflexes to have a chance at taking any gun that was put near your head. Yet interestingly you think this is a joke. lol :)You still don't understand what you are really saying, do you?

You are stating something that is absolutely insane and I’m going to call you on it as it will pertain to this debate.This is particularly confusing as you believe a gun potentially increases your odds of survival yet you are still master of your destiny. That is really a strange point of view to take. Wouldn't you admit this is a strange statement?As far as I can tell I am making the logical statement here. You don't seem to know what destiny actually is and even if you do know what it is then you are crazy to believe a gun or anything else will make you master of it.lol you are the sheep. You believe that a gun makes you master of your destiny. I'm sure someone told you this and now you follow it to the letter like a sheep. I make my own decisions as the situation changes. I don't depend on a gun making me master of my destiny. I believe I can help my cause by making decisions that make sense in a particular situation.The criminal will often has is own interests in heart which will be to get what he wants and make a clean getaway. He isn't going to want a fight or to murder anyone as it will lower his risk-reward ratio.lol, well I could ask you the same questions and you would probably have the same answers. You would eventually fall back on pulling your gun which would probably get you and your girlfriend killed. I'm sure you think you become master of your own destiny just because you pull your gun but in actuality you don't. Think this way is only going to get you in trouble!Well if I can only answer yes or no then number 3 is where it becomes no. Number 3 is where the criminal is going to be focused on something other than what his intent is and will allow me to have a chance to strike at him and with good cause. Karate is valuable in this sort of situation although you may not believe that it is. The only time that karate becomes useless is when you are in gun sites from a distance and since this case has a knife then I have the option of force with me at all times. I'd also be willing to guess that step 3 is where you would take a stand as well since it would be your best opportunity and best risk-reward. Wallets mean nothing compared to the life of you and your girl so there is no reason to risk them over such a simple thing.I'm suspicious because I think you may actually believe that you are master of your destiny. You are a little crazy in the assumption and to have someone like you on the streets with a gun cannot be a positive thing. You are going to hurt someone or get hurt yourself so of course I'm suspicious of you. I don't know how far you have gone already but I know I wouldn't want to be there when you go further. You sound like the type of person that makes the case for gun control seem like a perfect idea.Also I hope the majority believes that no one can be master of their own destiny simply because they have a weapon.

I am going to condense this as its getting too longShow me the statistics on your first point. Of the disproportionate number of rape victims I have had come through one of my unarmed combat classes the majority were told to not to resist. You know what... They were raped 100% of the time. These women sought out a way to protect themselves so that it would never happen again. To them some things are much worse than death. If your brother killed someone you loved and shot you within an inch of your life I would bet my arsenal your opinion to be "a good doggie" and roll to show your tummy and XXXX yourself would change... Either that or you would break down. That my friend is reality.knowing I may be killed, Knowing that I may be killed no matter what I do. I choose to say no to being the victim. I refuse to die on my knees. I refuse to let this criminal be 100% in control. This is how I am (or my students) are the masters of my/thier destiny. Most of these women when they joined have told me they would kill themselves before they would let it happen again. Now they make a similar comment but the killing part is on a slightly different "subject". Which of these women are you? NO I DONT! How many times do I have to say this. Please quote me so I can see where I failed to convey this message to you!Was waco an extreme response to a suposed tax violation? was shooting randy weaver's son in the back and his wife thhrough the head and extreme reaction for supposedly selling a shotgun with a stock 3/8 too short?I don't want anarchy.

I only brought this up again because I wanted to be sure that you were in the mindset that you would be able to admit that you had made an inaccurate statement. You hadn't done this yet so I just wanted to see if you were going to stick by what you said regardless of what information followed. Sorry but I've had people like DHard that will do exactly this. Thanks for responding to this.Also I did answer your knife/gun quiz already. You will find the response in an above post.

"Liberty in our Life Time!The Free State Project."Oh snap. I didn't even put two and two together here until now. I heard about the Free State Project on the radio the other day and it is run by a bunch of Libertarians. So I guess that does mean you are one of them.

I only brought this up again because I wanted to be sure that you were in the mindset that you would be able to admit that you had made an inaccurate statement. You hadn't done this yet so I just wanted to see if you were going to stick by what you said regardless of what information followed. Sorry but I've had people like DHard that will do exactly this. Thanks for responding to this.Also I did answer your knife/gun quiz already. You will find the response in an above post.

This is a non answerYou don't GET IT. You don't know me. I explained in the previous post that these women would rather DIE than be a victim again. That possibillity is a reality, Just as I said if you are staring down a barrel of a gun your chances are slim to none. However there comes a point when you must decide if you are a sheep or a goat. You put that choice of life and death in the criminal gun or no gun. We got to move back on topic... We can just leave it as you don't get it.By choosing not to die on my knees yes I died standing/fighting but I chose to say NO you will have no dominion over me! again you don't get it so lets cut all this out and stick to gunsI suggest they apply for a ccw and take martial arts such as Brazillian jiu-jitsu as Karate does not work on bigger stronger men BJJ at least works the positions that a young women might find herself in.Again I remind you I do not carry a gun on me. I do not teach violence I teach self defense. I teach marksmanship, I teach Close Quarter Combat techniques (both armed and unarmed). I am obsessed with training the body and mind for a myriad of purposes.. Not that in the UNLIKLEY event you will be confronted with violence. I teach preparedness. You have put yourself in a very violent situation with your brother and you FAILED to act. If anyone dies from your negligence it will be as much your fault as it is your brothers.Repeal of unconstitutional laws Gun laws, Drug laws, etc. You are just now figuring out I am a Libertarian? I mentioned several times in the past that I run for various offices under the Libertarian party!I would not deny ANYONE any of these things... I Libertarian, Your respons TOTALITARIAN.because you want to regulate me based on the actions of your (criminal) brother...Ah eliminate guns for "the common good". Eliminate the jews "for the common good", Eliminate freedom of religion "for the common good"."So although you are not my brother, I cannot trust you more than I trust my brother"But you trust your government more? The government has killed many more people than I have. In fact have I EVER indicated I would be willing to shoot anyone? (invading armies aside).Please quote me where I am "fanatical". You civil rights violator are the one who is fanatical and the pshycology behind your views is very scary.You are trying to take a literal approach to a non literal concept. And for this thread lets move on. Wrong! Karate has no chance of gun disarmament. Some Systems have better disarmament techniques than others. McDojo teaching punches and kicks in the air while bowing in a fake japanese/Korean setting is not going to teach you this. Anyways it is not the system its the practicioner+the system. WILL YOU PLEASE STOP ATTRIBUTING THINGS TO ME WHICH ARE NOT TRUE!***YAWN***Yet for the gazillionth time you are attributing points to me that I do not hold.***YAWN***Yet for the gazillionth time you are attributing points to me that I do not hold.Quote me where I say these things that give you this FALSE impression.***YAWN***Yet for the gazillionth time you are attributing points to me that I do not hold.Drop the master of destiny thing as you don't get it.***YAWN***Yet for the gazillionth time you are attributing points to me that I do not hold.A gun does not make me anything. Neither does that figure of speech you are held up on.Ok rubber glue right I am the sheep, good argument. The only "decision" you make is to roll on your back and expose your tummy... If it gets even harsher you may pee yourself. Yeah some goat you are! the rest:***YAWN***Yet for the gazillionth time you are attributing points to me that I do not hold.And your willing to bet your life on this?I bet you are wrong if you were honest.and***YAWN***Yet for the gazillionth time you are attributing points to me that I do not hold.Now answer the same question specifically if this guy has a gun and says he is going to kill you..If you respond to nothing in this post respond to this.***YAWN***Yet for the gazillionth time you are attributing points to me that I do not hold.***YAWN***Yet for the gazillionth time you are attributing points to me that I do not hold.

lol, if you have to ask then the point is already lost on you.What percent of those who resisted are now dead? That is exactly the point. You encourage resistance but won't admit that resistance has its disadvantages! Also you must be assuming that your arsenal would be an option at all if you were attacked. Reality would be that the criminal is looking to accomplish something with minimal difficulty and making as clean of a get away as possible. You would make both impossible and therefore people would of course get hurt. That is reality.That still doesn't make you master of your destiny. If you have no control then you are not master of your destiny. You can refuse to die on your knees but that doesn't prevent death from coming to you. Therefore the criminal would be 100% in control. You can try and convince yourself that you are in control just because you refuse to get on your knees but that doesn't mean that you are in control at all.I congratulate them for their willingness to die to protect themselves. That takes a lot of guts to do but that still doesn't make them master of their destiny. I’d also encourage them to learn some karate to go along with weapons skills as it will improve their hand to hand combat which will be most beneficial in that situation.I'm the pretty blonde I think. Watch it, I practice the open hand :)lol, need I remind you that you said you are master of your destiny. This would mean that you are in control. You also preach resistance and use of force. This would indicate violence will occur anyways so be pre-emptive. I just get the feeling that you are obsessed with the idea that violence will occur and you need a gun to save your life. But if you don't think that this is the case then at least I can see you have not lost complete touch with reality. Still I cannot understand your obsession with being in control of your reality based on having a gun.I'm not sure what your saying here. We were discussing how a screener at the airport was an extremist government agent and suddenly you then jumped to accusing the entire government of being extremists. Now I'm not really sure how you got on the topic of Waco but alright, sure they are government extremists as well I guess.You don't want anarchy, you just don't want any more gun laws and it doesn't go beyond that correct? I'm guessing your views are libertarian based on pieces of your posts?Sure you did. You said you were in master of your destiny.You said you were master of your destiny.I gave an example, I never suggested that it was a good idea to eliminate guns. I wanted to show that statistics could show whatever you want them to show on paper. But just to answer your question, I would eliminate drugs first of course. Gambling is perfectly fine with me although it has to be controlled. Knives are too easy to make to eliminate so why even try? Cars cannot be eliminated unless teleportation is developed. At that time cars can be eliminated. Which order would you eliminate them in anyways?Hey as long as it was not ad hominem and was instead not happy words :) hehe, well I'll forgive you for it, just be a little more careful in the future.Why would that mean that you are like my brother? I singled out my brother as an unusual case. How does that mean that everyone is like him including yourself? I realize you are not my brother and probably no one else in the world is, unless he has a twin!!!! (DAAAAH)I want to regulate you because I cannot trust you. I think you want too many freedoms and that will open up security risks for those who truly are good citizens. I think that you and people like you are asking for way too much to be doing it just for the good of mankind. You are out to accomplish something other than what you are stating therefore I cannot say that I trust you. So although you are not my brother, I cannot trust you more than I trust my brother. You are too fanatical about your belief.You have yet to clarify what you mean then. Let me help you. You are master of your destiny.Destiny - an event (or course of events) that will inevitably happen in the future.Therefore you are the master of what will happen to you in the future or what is currently happening to you. Do you realize type of mindset you would have to have in order to believe this? That is why I question your ability to understand a lot about this debate. I'm not sure whether or not you believe that you truly are master of your destiny or not. If you actually believe that you are then you are a few bricks short of a building.hehe, yeah I think it is pretty cool too. You stated that you wouldn't pull your gun if someone had one by your head. You are obsessed with being master of your destiny and if you knew karate you would have quick enough reflexes to have a chance at taking any gun that was put near your head. Yet interestingly you think this is a joke. lol :)You still don't understand what you are really saying, do you? I can't say that I'm surprised as it would seem that you have lost some touch with reality IMO. I used to think you were a pretty down to Earth person when it came to the gun control debate but lately you seem to be getting crazier with your debates and now that you are claiming that a gun makes you a God because it allows you to be master of your destiny, I can see my assumptions about you in the past were inaccurate.I also don’t care if you use the same line over and over again. You are stating something that is absolutely insane and I’m going to call you on it as it will pertain to this debate.This is particularly confusing as you believe a gun potentially increases your odds of survival yet you are still master of your destiny. That is really a strange point of view to take. Wouldn't you admit this is a strange statement?As far as I can tell I am making the logical statement here. You don't seem to know what destiny actually is and even if you do know what it is then you are crazy to believe a gun or anything else will make you master of it.lol you are the sheep. You believe that a gun makes you master of your destiny. I'm sure someone told you this and now you follow it to the letter like a sheep. I make my own decisions as the situation changes. I don't depend on a gun making me master of my destiny. I believe I can help my cause by making decisions that make sense in a particular situation.The criminal will often has is own interests in heart which will be to get what he wants and make a clean getaway. He isn't going to want a fight or to murder anyone as it will lower his risk-reward ratio.lol, well I could ask you the same questions and you would probably have the same answers. You would eventually fall back on pulling your gun which would probably get you and your girlfriend killed. I'm sure you think you become master of your own destiny just because you pull your gun but in actuality you don't. Think this way is only going to get you in trouble!Well if I can only answer yes or no then number 3 is where it becomes no. Number 3 is where the criminal is going to be focused on something other than what his intent is and will allow me to have a chance to strike at him and with good cause. Karate is valuable in this sort of situation although you may not believe that it is. The only time that karate becomes useless is when you are in gun sites from a distance and since this case has a knife then I have the option of force with me at all times. I'd also be willing to guess that step 3 is where you would take a stand as well since it would be your best opportunity and best risk-reward. Wallets mean nothing compared to the life of you and your girl so there is no reason to risk them over such a simple thing.I'm suspicious because I think you may actually believe that you are master of your destiny. You are a little crazy in the assumption and to have someone like you on the streets with a gun cannot be a positive thing. You are going to hurt someone or get hurt yourself so of course I'm suspicious of you. I don't know how far you have gone already but I know I wouldn't want to be there when you go further. You sound like the type of person that makes the case for gun control seem like a perfect idea.Also I hope the majority believes that no one can be master of their own destiny simply because they have a weapon.

Yes absolutley. Any thirteen year old with "flight simulator" could do as good a job as you. How to land a plane Why are you pilots so arrogant... This explains your snobbish attitude towards those who you suppsedly agree with you. I was a loadmaster in the Air-force for a while and practiced emergency drills with the pilot so I could (in an emergency) be guided (which became obviously unneccesarry) to land both 130s and 141s. So I know the drill. Besides... don't most commercial airlines have planes that all but land themselves? Those guys aren't even bus drives anymore... More like subway drivers.... get off yourself!What is the ideal cockpit crew? A pilot and a dog...the pilot is there to feed the dog, and the dog is there to bite the pilot in case he tries to touch anything.How many pilots does it take to change a light bulb? Just one. He holds the bulb and the world revolves around him.How do you know if a pilot is at your party? He'll tell you.How do you know when you are half way through a date with a pilot?Because he says: "That's enough about flying, let's talk about me"!Little boy to airline pilot: "You're a pilot?!?!? That must be exciting."Pilot: "Not if I do it right."

Hah hah! you are such a stereotypical pilot.... How do you get that big head into the cockpit!Your right... you wouldn't need it in a regular commercial jet as they can land themselves now, jr.Oh heres another from Maxim MagazineHow to Land a Plane (a 767 no less!)

You don't really seem to undestand that its a risk to national security...Should we be allowed to carry rocket launchers?Assault rifles?Gernades?C4?

But rocket launchers, C4, grenade, and assault weapons are all arms? Why can't we carry them around? Perhaps because there are laws? Do you accept this? How can you accept someone limiting your right to bear arms? Perhaps because there needs to be some limits? And let me ask you, If you were brought into a room full of 100 people, and told you that 1 of them might be a criminal, could you pick him out? What if we give all those 100 people assault weapons and put them on a plane? Would you get on the plane knowing that 1 of them might be a criminal? On the street, I have no problem with someone carrying an ak47. They are less likely to kill 300 people, and if they do start shooting, I can shoot back, run, or let the cops deal with him. In an airplane, there is nowhere to go. There might not be an air marshall or any of your "armed, trained, law abiding citizens" to deal with him. You can't pull over and get a cop. So why arm a plane ful of people, when you know that you could be letting armed terrorists on board? If you seriously want to debate, then answer these questions honestly and logically.

Seems kinda funny that you of all people would direct people to a site that clearly spells out gun control regulations. My point was the that there are laws making these things illegal, DUH. Could it be possible that in the wrong situation in the wrong hands they could be dangerous? Could this be the same with a gun on a plane? But you logic that any limitation on your right to bear arms is wrong, therefore the ATF must be a "gun hater" organization. What about the NRA?

First did the totally gun free zones at school work at columbine?The criminals at columbine did not obey the gun free zones only the law abiding citizens did!Second what did the totally gun free zones on the airplanes do on 9/11?So now box cutters are banned.

No, they did not. Had they actually been enforced, they would have.Obviously they did what they were supposed to (as far as preventing guns from being taken on a plane), because they were enforced.With what, car keys? You seem to ignore the fact that on the morning of 9/11, anyone could carry a knife with up to 4" blade on it? They did not prevent the hijackings either. So why would it be any different with guns?I have asked you on numerous times to show me the proof of these rulings. Where is it? And who do you think should be held accountable, the government? Certainly not the airlines as you have stated in the past, they do not make the laws. The government made the laws.I never challenged your right to have an opinion. This is a debate forum, and opinions are what make this work. I obviously don't agree with your position, but if you backed it up with logic and factual evidence, then maybe I could at least see your side of it clearly. Instead, you attack anyone with a different opinion than yours, label them as "gun hater", and refuse to debate any points or answer any questions. My opinion is that guns do not belong on an airplane in the hands of citizens. I think the government has taken responsibility for the law abiding citizens by ensuring that nobody can carry a gun or other dangerous weapon on board a plane. Would you want it the same way if guns were allowed on board and your entire family was killed by a terrorist or psycho with a gun? Or would you then blame the government and airline for their deaths? Yes, he certainly is. The question was, IS HE A "GUN HATER" because he proposes these limits? By your logic, he would have to be. My opinion is that he understands that some common sense gun control laws are neccesary and at the same time fights for the rights of gun owners. What is wrong with this? And what is your opinion?

The laws were enforced the law abiding citizens were obeying them, the criminals did not!You ignore the fact that the next time terrorist hijack another airplane they will simply use what is allowed on the airplane, as they did on 9/11!A gun hater is a member of a hate group. Hate groups want to take rights away from other people. Since you want laws that only affect the law abiding citizens right to bear arms you are a gun hater. Not one gun free zone prevents a criminals from bringing a gun into it! They do however stop law abiding citizens from exercising their right to bear arms!9/11 proved gun free airplanes do not work! Guns were not allowed on the airplanes on 9/11 and over 3000 law abiding Americans paid a price for that!Yes the government and airlines are responsible for the deaths of the victims on 9/11. By disarming people they assume responsibility for their safety.Without reading the whole speech I do not know if he defended gun free zones and then said as I do the government is responsible for the safety of the unarmed citizens.Now if he is demanding gun laws as other gun haters do that would disarm the law abiding citizens, and then not be responsible for the unarmed citizens yes he would be a gun hater!Your common sense is to disarm the law abiding citizen by gun control laws that criminals do not obey! No such thing as common sense limits on a right!Gun haters have the same traits as criminals and terrorist, they have no respect for other peoples rights!

Or would you then blame the government and airline for their deaths? Yes, he certainly is. The question was, IS HE A "GUN HATER" because he proposes these limits? By your logic, he would have to be. My opinion is that he understands that some common sense gun control laws are neccesary and at the same time fights for the rights of gun owners. What is wrong with this? And what is your opinion?

Again, no, they were not enforced. Putting a law on the books and putting up a sign is not enforcement. Enforcement is using screeners and technology to ensure that the guns do not get in the school. I ignore nothing...I asked you, what do they have left to take over a plane with? The magazines in the seatback? Car keys? Remember, that every citizen getting on a plane can carry anything that a terrorist can. They could on 9/11 too, but this did not prevent the hijackings. Why do you assume that allowing people to carry guns on board will make that difference? Suppose the terrorists are the only one on the plane that flight that have a gun? I only want laws that affect law abiding citizens? Does not ensuring that everybody getting on a plane does not have a weapon affect everyone getting on the plane? This includes law abiding citizens and criminals / terrorists. Why do you chose to ignore that fact. And the airports are perfect examples of gun free zones that prevent guns. BECAUSE THEY ENFORCE IT WITH THE APPROPRIATE SECURITY MEASURES. It could be the same with schools if every school had the proper enforcement. Enforcement means assuring compliance with a law. Like having the ability to screen people and assure that they do not break the law. No, 9/11 proved that we should not allow any weapons on board an aircraft, as arming the terrorists only makes their job easier. Being that there were no guns on planes on 9/11, i would say the gun free zone worked. The problem was, we let other weapons on, ie...knives, and this worked to arm the terrorists. Again, do you know that guns would have prevented it? Do you know if anyone would have been carrying a gun on board other than the terrorists? How can you blame not having guns on board for 9/11? The 9/11 terrorists could have just shot everyone on board and still flown the plane into the buildings. Dead bodies in a plane cause just as much damage as live bodies do. Again, maybe the government, but deffinately not the airlines. The government makes the laws, not the airlines. What about the people themselves? If you get on a plane where you know you cannot have a gun, you are taking the risk in the first place right? AND IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE USING THIS ARGUMENT ABOUT THE COURTS FINDING THAT THE AIRLINES AND TRANSIT AUTHORITY CAN BE HELD RESPONSIBLE, POST THE LINKS TO THE RULINGS. PERSONALLY, I HAVE LOOKED FOR THIS INFORMATION, AND HAVE NOT FOUND A THING. SHOW ME THE PROOF, OR STOP USING IT AS AN ARGUMENT. Well, I think his comment pretty much speaks for itself. So by your logic, Wayne is a "gun hater". Very nice. I'm sure many, many people would agree with you...sure. That is the most rediculous thing I have ever heard.

The laws were enforced the law abiding citizens were obeying them, the criminals did not!You ignore the fact that the next time terrorist hijack another airplane they will simply use what is allowed on the airplane, as they did on 9/11!A gun hater is a member of a hate group. Hate groups want to take rights away from other people. Since you want laws that only affect the law abiding citizens right to bear arms you are a gun hater. Not one gun free zone prevents a criminals from bringing a gun into it! They do however stop law abiding citizens from exercising their right to bear arms!9/11 proved gun free airplanes do not work! Guns were not allowed on the airplanes on 9/11 and over 3000 law abiding Americans paid a price for that!Yes the government and airlines are responsible for the deaths of the victims on 9/11. By disarming people they assume responsibility for their safety.Without reading the whole speech I do not know if he defended gun free zones and then said as I do the government is responsible for the safety of the unarmed citizens.Now if he is demanding gun laws as other gun haters do that would disarm the law abiding citizens, and then not be responsible for the unarmed citizens yes he would be a gun hater!Your common sense is to disarm the law abiding citizen by gun control laws that criminals do not obey! No such thing as common sense limits on a right!Gun haters have the same traits as criminals and terrorist, they have no respect for other peoples rights!

Can anyone show proof of rulings stating the airlines and transit authority can be held liable for the deaths on 9/11? I have looked several times and can find no such rulings.

Once again for the last time since gun haters seem to not want to accept the fact that gun free school zones were enforced. The law abiding citizens at any school that has a shooting obeyed the laws. The criminals did not! Results dead law abiding citizens!Again the terrorist will obey the rules to board the airplanes. Then the terrorist will use whatever the government or airlines allow on the airplanes to hijack them, as they did on 9/11. Basically a weapon is anything used to threaten to harm or kill a person. People not wanting to be harmed or killed will comply with the terrorist demands, as they did on 9/11. One group of people on one airplane decided they did not want to die and resisted. It appears they saved untold innocent law abiding citizens lives by doing so. I guess you are angry at these people for endangering the aircraft by resisting the terrorist! Oh hey what did the passengers that resisted use? Bare hands maybe? Yes you can also use you hands to kill people. And this is enough for some people to not want to confront terrorist. Just the threat of physical force will make some people comply!Gun free airplanes and schools worked, the criminals and terrorist were able to commit their crimes because no one could resist them!A weapon is anything that can be used to threaten to harm or kill a person to force them to comply with your demands! Criminals and terrorist used these gun free zones to their fullest advantage! Gun haters should be happy the gun haters made the criminals and terrorist jobs easier!Again you do not know if guns would not have prevented it.

They obviously were not enforced. Did they have screeners at columbine before the shootings? Did they have completely controlled entrance to the school. Did they search people? Did they have metal detectors? This is enforcement. The laws were not enforced, result, dead people. If they had all of these things in place at Columbine, it would have never happened. That's one of the worst arguments I have seen by anyone on this thread. Again, what weapons do they have to use now? Yes, they can use their hands, but as we saw on 9/11, so can the passengers. And I find it would be hard to hijack a plane with a pair of hands...don't you? And I am proud of the people that fought back, they did what they should have. It has also happened since 9/11 that passengers have subdued criminals and would-be terrorists on planes. That proves that this works. Passengers can fight back with their hands and be effective. What? Make people comply...like making the terrorists sit back down? Like 50 passengers choking him...with their bare hands? Wow, what a concept. They were able to commit their crimes on the planes because:1. they had weapons that they are not allowed to have now.2. the passengers did not know that the terrorists were on a suicide mission. The passengers who did find out (united 93) were the ones who fought back and saved countless lives on the ground. Before 9/11, people thought of hijackings as a couple of terrorists taking over a plane and going to cuba, demanding money, or some other political end. Few people envisioned them as taking over planes to use as weapons. That is why people were always told to comply and obey terrorists. The game is different now, and we now know we must fight back. If a plane full of people can figure that out in a few minutes by making a cell phone call, perhaps the rest of us who have had time to reflect on the events of 9/11 would have a good understanding that fighting back is no longer just an option, it is neccesary.They were able to commit the crimes at Columbine because:1. Nobody was waiting at the door to stop them, there were laws in place, but nobody to carry out the enforcement of the laws. PERIOD.No, I think the fact that we allowed 19 people to board 4 planes with boxcutters made it easier. Do you think that 19 people could again take over 4 planes with their hands? Or a pencil, or a book, or a magazine, or a PDA, or a camera, or a ...You are right, they might have prevented it, they might not have. Is it possible that they may have been the only ones on board with guns...yes. But skip that part, lets lay it out.1. 3 terrorists stand up, you are the only armed person on the plane. You shoot all three before they can shoot you or anyone else...unlikely, but lets say you do. WOW. Your a hero, you can go on Leno and get your I'm a hero with a gun medal, and everyone will think you are just great. WOW.2. 3 terrorists stand up, you are the only armed person on the plane. You shoot 2 of the terrorists before the 3rd on kills you. I guess you are still a hero of sorts, but sorry, they will only be able to put the medal in your grave with you, and no Leno. 3. 3 terrorists stand up, nobody else on board is armed, they win.Now let me ask you, you seem to feel very strongly about who to hold responsible. Would you be willing to take personal responsibility if someone with a gun hijacked a plane and ran it into another tall building? After all, you pushed to have the guns on there. Would you fight a lawsuit naming you as responsible for the plane full of people and those killed on the ground? Would you be willing to take responsibility if you accidentally shot someone on the plane while in a shootout with a terrorist? What if someone pulls out their gun to show someone else and they accidentaly shoot the person, or themselves. Will you take responsibility. After all, you pushed to have the guns on the plane. Truth is, if you push to have the guns on the plane, then you are responsible for the safety of everyone on the plane. If a terrorist kills someone with a gun, you are just as much responsible, after all, you wanted him to be able to walk on the plane with a gun. You say, the people who have forced others to give up their rights should be held responsible for the safety of the unarmed, so by the same logic, if you push to have guns on board, you are then responsible for anyone who gets killed by one of those guns. You find this to be an ambiguous statement?How about that? They are very clear, especially where he says "this means no guns in America's schools, period." Somehow it does not surprise me that you don't get this.

DUH! What is your point?In airports and schools, absolutely. And enforcing a gun free zone with security checkpoints and searches is not treating people like criminals. You have no concept of what security is.So if a terrorist stands up and says "anybody moves and I'll punch you in the head...this is a hijacking", people will cower in fear? I think I would probably laugh at him and tell him to sit down. I think you would find more than enough citizens who would subdue him if he didn't. And could you rephrase the rest? It made little sense to me, what do you mean? They aren't? You seem to think this is the 1700's, and you just might get to shoot a redcoat. Times have changed. Many things are different just since 9/11. I would call this change.What? Is your alarm on? Laws do not need to be enforced for law abiding citizens. They need to be enforced to prevent criminals from breaking them. Do you know what the word enforcement means? Enforcement is actually observing and ensuring compliance. How can you say the laws were enforced if 2 kids carried guns into school? If the had been enforcing the laws, they would have been stopped at the door. Ahh, the old what if argument. This is really stupid. And actually, I did give you your what if, #1. Sure that is the best case outcome, but I am not concerned with the best case scenario, I am concerned with the worst case scenario. You could say "what if nobody ever hurt anybody again". While it sounds nice in theory, this is far from logical. You really didn't answer the question. Would you be willing to be held responsible for deaths on a plane even if you did not shoot the gun? By your logic, if you push to have the guns on the plane, then you personally are responsible for the flying public. And you still never showed me any proof of the courts ruling that the airlines and transit authority can be held responsible for he deaths on 9/11. Is this perhaps because you can't find any proof of these? Don't worry, neither could I. So by your logic, wait until someone hijacks a plane and drives it into a building, or at least kills a few people on the plane and lock him up then? Or let 2 kids walk into a school and kill 13 people? Did it ever occur to you that if these kids had not been able to walk into the school with the guns, 13 people would still be alive?

There is no such thing as a Constitutional crime prevention law. Any kind of legal machinery or police program to prevent a specific act of crime will violate several civil rights.The law is meant to punish criminals or recover damages only AFTER a crime has occured.Just from your example at the school, you violate:1) Illegal seaches.2) Privacy.3) Due Process.You can do this to children. They are not full citizens. You break several civil rights when you try this on citizens.

So in other words, these things violate your constitutional rights, and you would rather die than have your rights violated. Very noble, also very extreme. So if it comes down to letting 10 innocent people die, then maybe arrest the criminal, or stop the criminal before he kills 10 innocent people, you would rather they die?

What is the point? Gun hater your gun free zones worked at columbine and the airports. The law abiding students at that school and the people on the airplanes on 9/11 obeyed the no guns on campus and no guns on airplane law. The two criminals that walked onto that campus did not! They killed 11 law abiding students because there was no armed law abiding citizen there to stop them. The terrorist on the airplanes used the next available weapon to hijack the airplanes and fly them into tall buildings!Oh and I will not lower myself to trying to insult you by using the word “duh” . Unlike gun haters like you I do not need to do this . But it appears gun hater such as you have a need to insult anybody they cannot win a debate with..Yes it is gun hater You have stated you trust no one! Gun hater you stated you would not allow a law enforcement officer on your plane with a gun “simply based on how that law enforcement officer looked at you!”. Gun hater you are paranoid! This what you tried to label people defending the right to bear arms. Gee gun hater what happen at the LAX? Did not some criminal go into a terminal up to the security check point and start shooting? So what was the solution to this from the paranoid people? Move the check points out past the terminals now. How is a society civilized if they search and suspect all of it citizens as you do? Not one of the security things you want will stop the terrorist the next time they hijack an airplane! But they will violate the rights of the law abiding citizens! Interesting how gun haters are all physically fit people, that can always beat up the biggest terrorist! Even the biggest person can being taken down by a group of people. Gun hater must all be like John Wayne!So gun hater you are claiming people are not forced to do things simple because of the threat of physical force. Never heard of mugging have you gun hater? Not all muggers use guns to take rob their victims!Times have changed? It appears criminals still harm law abiding citizens as they did in the 1700's. It appears America still has enemies as it did in the 1700's. It appears gun haters like you still want to take rights away from other people as they did in the1700's! So just how have times changed? Other then we now have gun free zones where criminals pretty much have a free hand to harm unarmed law abiding citizens. This gun hater must be your times have changed bs. Gun haters like you have made it easier for the criminals and terrorist! Is this change for the good of society?

The police could just arrest a person before they commit a crime. I think law enforcement works like this though. A criminal breaks the law and is apprehended by the police. Evidence it taken by the police. The criminal is given a lawyer and a date is set for court. Then a court of people decides based on evidence if the criminal is guilty or not. If not guilty the person is not punished. If guilty the criminal is sentenced to a prison term. This way a DANGEROUS person is separated from society making society safe from this DANGEROUS criminal!

DUH! What is your point?In airports and schools, absolutely. And enforcing a gun free zone with security checkpoints and searches is not treating people like criminals. You have no concept of what security is.So if a terrorist stands up and says "anybody moves and I'll punch you in the head...this is a hijacking", people will cower in fear? I think I would probably laugh at him and tell him to sit down. I think you would find more than enough citizens who would subdue him if he didn't. And could you rephrase the rest? It made little sense to me, what do you mean? They aren't? You seem to think this is the 1700's, and you just might get to shoot a redcoat. Times have changed. Many things are different just since 9/11. I would call this change.What? Is your alarm on? Laws do not need to be enforced for law abiding citizens. They need to be enforced to prevent criminals from breaking them. Do you know what the word enforcement means? Enforcement is actually observing and ensuring compliance. How can you say the laws were enforced if 2 kids carried guns into school? If the had been enforcing the laws, they would have been stopped at the door. Ahh, the old what if argument. This is really stupid. And actually, I did give you your what if, #1. Sure that is the best case outcome, but I am not concerned with the best case scenario, I am concerned with the worst case scenario. You could say "what if nobody ever hurt anybody again". While it sounds nice in theory, this is far from logical. You really didn't answer the question. Would you be willing to be held responsible for deaths on a plane even if you did not shoot the gun? By your logic, if you push to have the guns on the plane, then you personally are responsible for the flying public. And you still never showed me any proof of the courts ruling that the airlines and transit authority can be held responsible for he deaths on 9/11. Is this perhaps because you can't find any proof of these? Don't worry, neither could I. So by your logic, wait until someone hijacks a plane and drives it into a building, or at least kills a few people on the plane and lock him up then? Or let 2 kids walk into a school and kill 13 people? Did it ever occur to you that if these kids had not been able to walk into the school with the guns, 13 people would still be alive?

I bet any reasonable person would state that I have already won this debate many times over. I'm sorry if the use of "DUH" upsets you. I guess that is a bigger insult than calling someone "gun hater" continuously. At the airports, yes. There were no guns. At Columbine, no, there were guns. Exactly. So why arm the big bad terrorist with a gun?Yes, they have. Your extremist logic on this makes no sense.The law abiding citizens don't do that. This is for law enforcement and screeners to do. Your argument on this makes no sense.I did what if a positive for you. But why look at the positives? Positive situations don't kill me, the negative ones do.You completely don't get the point.

What is the point? Gun hater your gun free zones worked at columbine and the airports. The law abiding students at that school and the people on the airplanes on 9/11 obeyed the no guns on campus and no guns on airplane law. The two criminals that walked onto that campus did not! They killed 11 law abiding students because there was no armed law abiding citizen there to stop them. The terrorist on the airplanes used the next available weapon to hijack the airplanes and fly them into tall buildings!Oh and I will not lower myself to trying to insult you by using the word “duh” . Unlike gun haters like you I do not need to do this . But it appears gun hater such as you have a need to insult anybody they cannot win a debate with..Yes it is gun hater You have stated you trust no one! Gun hater you stated you would not allow a law enforcement officer on your plane with a gun “simply based on how that law enforcement officer looked at you!”. Gun hater you are paranoid! This what you tried to label people defending the right to bear arms. Gee gun hater what happen at the LAX? Did not some criminal go into a terminal up to the security check point and start shooting? So what was the solution to this from the paranoid people? Move the check points out past the terminals now. How is a society civilized if they search and suspect all of it citizens as you do? Not one of the security things you want will stop the terrorist the next time they hijack an airplane! But they will violate the rights of the law abiding citizens! Interesting how gun haters are all physically fit people, that can always beat up the biggest terrorist! Even the biggest person can being taken down by a group of people. Gun hater must all be like John Wayne!So gun hater you are claiming people are not forced to do things simple because of the threat of physical force. Never heard of mugging have you gun hater? Not all muggers use guns to take rob their victims!Times have changed? It appears criminals still harm law abiding citizens as they did in the 1700's. It appears America still has enemies as it did in the 1700's. It appears gun haters like you still want to take rights away from other people as they did in the1700's! So just how have times changed? Other then we now have gun free zones where criminals pretty much have a free hand to harm unarmed law abiding citizens. This gun hater must be your times have changed bs. Gun haters like you have made it easier for the criminals and terrorist! Is this change for the good of society? Yes the unarmed law abiding citizens at the gun free zones at schools and airports that were killed by criminals and terrorist were doing this ”Enforcement is actually observing and ensuring compliance. “ The criminals were not!Gun haters like you always what if the negative never the positive. Why is this? Simple gun haters like you want to limit or ban the right to bear arms!By the way gun hater you stated the what if bs! Oh that is right you have the ability to tell just who is going to commit a crime!

Since you want gun control laws that infringe on the right to bear arms, yes you are a gun hater!And yes gun hater gun free zones work. They disarm the law abiding citizens and make it easier for criminals and terrorist to kill unarmed law abiding citizens!Gun haters like you should be happy that you made it easier for criminals and terrorist to kill unarmed law abiding citizens!Yes the law abiding citizens obeyed the gun free zones at columbine and the airports. Results, 11 unarmed law abiding citizens killed at columbine. In the airplane unarmed law abiding citizens could not resist 4 terrorist with box cutters! Once gun haters like you should be happy that you made it easier for criminals and terrorist to kill unarmed law abiding citizens!Because you gun control laws are only obeyed by the law abiding citizen as proven at columbine! As proven on the airplanes on 9/11! Once gun haters like you should be happy that you made it easier for criminals and terrorist to kill unarmed law abiding citizens!Extremist are the gun hater like you that want to limit or ban a right in the name of security!

I guess dead unarmed law abiding citizen in gun free zones like schools and airplanes is your common sense approach to banning a right!

DON'T FINANCE THE MURDER OF THE BILL OF RIGHTS [You may think this is a little severe, but read it over again, and think about it - Fred]ALERT FROM JEWS FOR THE PRESERVATION OF FIREARMS OWNERSHIP - America's Aggressive Civil Rights OrganizationSeptember 19, 2001 Why I Am Canceling My Appearance at the Freedom SummitBy Aaron Zelman Executive Director, Jews for the Preservation of Firearms OwnershipWould you pay to have the Bill of Rights used as toilet paper? Would you write a check to have every liberty the Bill protects flushed into the sewer? Would you pony up your credit card for permission to be mangled in the inhuman and inhumane machinery of a corporate police state?If your answer to these questions is no -- and hell no! and DON'T TREAD ON ME -- then you'll understand exactly why I am canceling my scheduled appearance at the annual Freedom Summit, the weekend of October 6 & 7, 2001. To reach the Summit in Arizona, I would have to fly from my homein Wisconsin. This I can no longer do -- not with the latest "heightened [and useless] airport security measures" designed totreat me like a criminal, a serf, or both.I will never set foot on a commercial airliner until the airlines, the airport authorities, the FAA, and all other would-be regulators of air travel respect my rights. (And I'm talking about inborn rights, the ones Americans have bled and died for, not government-granted privileges that can be withdrawn at the whim of some faceless bean counter.)SUBMISSION ISN'T SAFETYTragedy and threats of war -- even the most horrible the U.S.has ever seen -- must not be allowed to become an excuse for the murder of liberty.Arbitrary searches don't halt violence. But as if they missed that entire point on September 11, 2001, the airlines and the regulators they're cozy in bed with want more of the same. Walkthrough their scanners. Humbly answer their questions, praying that you don't sound nervous or "suspicious." Open your bags. Open your purses. Open your shaving kits or your lipstick tubes.Bend over and open whatever orifice they might wish to inspect once they've determined your willingness to submit.Disarming me and you doesn't make the nation's skies safe. But -- tragically missing that point, also -- these police-statist cowards now want to make sure that millions of peopleare deprived even of their razor blades, Girl Scout knives -- and even plastic knives from fast-food joints. What will they want to take next? Our shoes so that we can't kick them? Our pens so that we can't gouge them? Our teeth so that we can't bite them? Our fingernails so that we can't clawthem? Because believe me, if we comply with their new demands -- if we docilely go along for the sake of convenience and the false promise of "safety" -- they will eventually take everything that makes us free human beings. Corporate airlines and their pals in the bureaucracy and in Congress will take our arms, ourrights, our courage, and our fight-back spirit -- and leave us as cowed as good Stalinist subjects, and as defenseless as newborn kittens. They saw the consequences on September 11 of disarming Americans and teaching them to be passive. And their reaction? To make us even more vulnerable, so we can't protect ourselves, each other,or our nation's freedom.These Beltway Bozos will make us unsafe on the ground as well as in the air. Remember several years ago, when gangs of criminals in Florida were targeting -- and sometimes killing --tourists who'd just gotten off airplanes? Why? Because the thugs knew their victims were disarmed. Now, with the new FAAguidelines, airline "security" agents are busily "disarming" travelers of their disposable razors, manicure sets, aerosol deodorants, hairspray, corkscrews, garden shears, sparklers, nail files, pen knives, and in one case reported by the Sacramento Bee, even an empty ammunition box. They want to make sure we can't fight back against anybody with any tool."Thanks, FAA," say the criminals, as they lie in wait for debarking passengers. "You've just made our job SO much easier."I say it halts here -- in my life. Furthermore, you and I havea chance to put a total stop to these abuses of our liberty using our economic clout.STOP COMPLYING NOW. Don't pull out your checkbook. Don't hand over your credit cards. Don't give the government-regulated airlines your business. They're already in financial trouble, and they'veearned it. Let them go bankrupt. Let them pay the price for conditioning us to act like cattle and lulling us into submission with their phony FAA-inspired promises to keep us"safe."The airlines are private companies, even though they and the federal government are in each others pockets (like so many other big corporations). The jets they fly are privately owned.Airlines have the power to tell the government to go to hell. And if they don't, then we should tell THEM to go to hell.Give them the Smith & Wesson treatment. Remember what happened when that gun manufacturer crawled under the sheets with Bill Clinton? S&W figured it would make politically correct guns, violate your privacy, compromise your safety, be paid off in lucrative government contracts and get federal protection fromlawsuits. Weren't the compromisers surprised when gun owners (who they thought were paper tigers) and dealers (who they thought would put up with anything) turned around and broke S & W?So let the airlines go under. Help put them under. Some libertarian can buy up their assets for 10 cents on the dollar and run a new airline. Flight attendants on the future LibertyAircan hand out frangible ammunition instead of pretzels. That waynobody will poke holes in a fuselage while poking holes in a hijacker. And no costly, uniformed, authoritarian, fumble-fingered, rent-a-cop "Sky Marshals" will be needed.To put it bluntly, corporations, regulators, and legislators who don't approve of free, armed Americans flying on airplanesare domestic terrorists. We already saw the mass bloodshed they helped perpetrate on September 11, after decades of encouraging citizens to comply with evil and idiocy, decades of conditioningus to surrender our rights to anyone who makes a strident enough demand, decades of depriving us of both mental and physical toolsfor serious resistance. Why should real Americans be subjected to the herd-think that turns so much of the rest of humanity into mere subjects? Did our ancestors not fight to free us of such subservience?More acts of terror are inevitable. And when they strike, the blood of innocent people will be on the hands not only of the attackers and their controllers, but on the hands of airline presidents, faceless rule writers, "just-following-orders" airline security inspectors, and authoritarians like Charles Schumer, Barbara Boxer, Orrin Hatch, Dianne Feinstein, Peter Jennings, and Dan Rather whose vision of utopia has their friends in charge and the rest of us cowed, tracked, stamped, numbered, disarmed, and helpless to resist.FIGHT BACK WITH TECHNOLOGY & PRINCIPLESThe mission statement of the Freedom Summit www.freedom summit.comsays: "Socialism and other coercive centralized planning schemeshave failed to improve, and indeed worsened, the human condition....[T]he Freedom Summit encourages individuals to promote freedom in non-coercive ways which are best suited to their individual talents."

No worries.The reason the whole issue of the aeroplane came up was Kelvin's inability to maintain a course of argument.At one stage he's assuring the world that he believes in the natural right to carry a gun.Next, it's not a natural right, but a legislated right re: constitution; Bill of Rights (which he wrongly maintained were wrestled from the Brits).I pointed out that the said law says quite clearly "Shall not be infringed"But Kelvin was happy that it is infringed, by commecial interests, but not the government.He's reveresed this in part. He's now happy the government says no to guns in national parks (before he was adamant you could blast away at deer). Then he said he's provisionally happy about commercial interests; [roviding that they actually give some kind of notification.He says that both airlines have a right to decide for themselves, but that guns would stop terrorists.Oddly he accepts both the airline to allow guns on, and airports to ban guns. So, if airports are no-gun zones, how on earth are aeroplanes to get them? Do they swoop down and grab them from nets on the ground?Thus, this is a very hard debate to keep track of, as Kelvin doesn't quite know which argument he wants.

"How are they saved? What are you basing this statement on?"www.guncite.com, www.thecodyexpress.com and www.keepandbeararms.com have excellent articles about my words. Read around.Comparing gun laws from differen countries them screaming about crime rates is useless. There are thousands of cultural differences between countries, which contribute to the differences you are going on about. I don't imagine you would be very happy if I were to wildly quote stats from Switzerland and Israel."I don't need you to save me with your gun and I'd rather not make it easier for a terrorist to take a gun on a plane." Somebody rushing the cockpit with a gun would no doubt arouse suspicion and be shot before he could do any damage on a well armed plane. As opposed to "hey that guy has a box cutter, lets sit around cowering to see what he does". Do you know why the air in commercial aircraft doesn't get stale? It is because of adjustable vents controlled from the cockpit. If bullets were to start flying, the vents would be closed slightly to account for the difference, and the aircraft would keep flying. If you are imagining a scene from aliens when a bullet goes through the wall of a plane....haw.

No worries.The reason the whole issue of the aeroplane came up was Kelvin's inability to maintain a course of argument.At one stage he's assuring the world that he believes in the natural right to carry a gun.Next, it's not a natural right, but a legislated right re: constitution; Bill of Rights (which he wrongly maintained were wrestled from the Brits).I pointed out that the said law says quite clearly "Shall not be infringed"But Kelvin was happy that it is infringed, by commecial interests, but not the government.He's reveresed this in part. He's now happy the government says no to guns in national parks (before he was adamant you could blast away at deer). Then he said he's provisionally happy about commercial interests; [roviding that they actually give some kind of notification.He says that both airlines have a right to decide for themselves, but that guns would stop terrorists.Oddly he accepts both the airline to allow guns on, and airports to ban guns. So, if airports are no-gun zones, how on earth are aeroplanes to get them? Do they swoop down and grab them from nets on the ground?Thus, this is a very hard debate to keep track of, as Kelvin doesn't quite know which argument he wants.

I don't carry a gun here in the US. Austrailia a beutiful police state... I love all of those cameras the government is installing.... If I was an aussie I wouldn't feel safe... Your governmental fedgoons are out of control.

Rev. HellH0und, I recall that you said you were coming to Australia for a visit.Did you actually do it?If yes, did you feel safe without having your gun around?

Yes, save us, we're being repressed. Crime is plummeting, please send us guns.And of course, after visiting our nation, we've got your DNA on file.

Why don't you, many others have no problem using these countries as examples, even though our cultures and societies differ vastly. You hope. Or, perhaps he could kill 2 or 3 people on his way to the cockpit, or he could shoot through the forward cabin bulkhead, hit one of the pilots, or damage instrumentation in the cockpit, or put a hole in the pressure vessel, or hit a fuel tank, or hit a fuel pump contained in a fuel tank causing the plane to explode...etc. You get it? You cannot make any accurate statement on the exact turnout of events. It is safer to assure no guns board a plane, unless carried by a marshal or credentialed law enforcement official. And one more thing...who are you to guarantee that many of the passengers on the aircraft are armed? It certainly would not be mandatory to carry a gun, so just suppose that the only armed people to climb onto the plane one particular day are the terrorists. Boy, that woud suck.Perhaps on the morning of 9/11...yes. Now...not a chance. It has already happened several times since 9/11 that the passengers...not law enforcement...have subdued unruley passengers. Prior to 9/11, a hijacking was seen as a couple people with a political agenda taking an airliner to an airport of their choosing, and bargaining for ransom of some sort (political, monetary, release of some prisoners...etc.) 9/11 changed the definition of hijacking. Now, people know they must fight back. Personally, I would rather face a terrorist with a boxcutter than one with a gun, but that's just me. Yes, I do. But is does not seem that you do. Not quite. It is because air...reffered to as "bleed air" is taken from the compressor section of a turbine engine. As air is spun into the compressor, there is a valve at the third compressor blade (P3 valve) that takes this air and bleeds it off of the engine...hence the term bleed air. This air then passes through something called an ACM (air cycle machine), where it is cooled and then allowed into the cabin. The air may be recycled through something called a VCM (vapor cycle machine), recooled, and sent back to the cabin, or it is discharged from he aircraft through outflow valves located at the rear of the pressure vessel. During a loss of cabin pressure, pilots do not play around opening or closing "vents". Pilots will descend the aircraft to a safe altitude (usually 10,000'). The problem here junior, is that you seem to be misinformed. At normal cruise altitudes of most airliners (30 - 40 thousand feet) the pressure outside the aircraft is very low. Normally, you will have something called a differential pressure, which is the measurement of the difference of pressure between the air outside and the air inside an aircraft. This pressure is normally 5.27 PSI in a fully pressurized aircraft. When a bullet would go flying through the side of an airplane, breaking the pressure vessel, it causes something reffered to as a rapid or explosive decompression. With the differential pressure, and the sudden weakening of one part of the structure of the aircraft, a bullet hole will turn into a huge hole within milliseconds. Take for example a balloon. XXXX it up just a little bit so that is just barely stretched (pressure inside not much greater than pressure outside), and poke it with a pin...what happens? The air slowly leaks out. Now, take a balloon and XXXX it up so that the skin is stretched tightly (pressure inside much greater than pressure outside), and poke it with a pin...what happens? BOOM. Same thing. It has happened with aircraft before...look up the example of the United flight that landed in Honolulu missing a large section if the overhead fuselage, and some passengers (seats included). The other problems are that when pieces of the aircraft go flying out, or people or seats etc...they have the potential to take out engines, strike the wing or tail...causing serious structural damage...etc. Flying a plane with structural damage with possibly one or more engine out is not my idea of a good time....haw.

Explosive decompression due to a small hole in an aircraft is a popular myth. In reality, if you had a bullet sized hole in a plane, you would experience a hissing sound, maybe an annoying whisteling sound. An airplane is not a balloon. At 5.27 PSI, you would need a hole with an area of 17.174 sq ft in order to cause lexan (the weakest component of the crafts shell) to degrede due to compression. At 172 PSI, a bullet hole will cause total loss of structural integrity on a piece of lexan. when you are talking about the actual skin of the aircraft (usually aluminum) the numbers are much higher.They test different materials for suitablitly in aircraft use. Decompression tests are carried out at 8.5 psi, much higher than most real world conditions. Explosive decompresion can only be caused by the loss of a significant portion of the airframe. In every case ever reported (all 8 of them) it was the result of either a mid air colision, an explosion, or metal fatigue (that is what happened in the flight that landed in honolulu). You simply CANNOT explosivly decompress an airplane without a catastrophic event.Adjusting the cabin airflow can (and has) been used in order to adjust for minor differences in cabin pressure (such as a small leak in a hatch seal). If every airplane that ever experienced a hatch seal failure in flight burst like a baloon, the aircraft manufacturers would not be in the financial situation they are now, as there would be plenty of orders for new planes (to replace all of the ones that exploded).As far as bullets hitting fuel pumps or fuel tanks, you would get a leak, not an explosion. Check out the UEL and LEL of different grades of aviation fuel. Besides that, you need a spark or an open flame in order to initiate an explosion (just heat won't do it) and, contrary to what you saw in lethal weapon, bullets do NOT spark when you they hit a metal object because they are made of lead and sometimes brass. I suppose that a tracer round into an empty fuel tank MIGHT do it, but most likely you would need an infusion of O2 under laboratory conditions to get the mixture just right. Your knowledge of aircraft maintenance is good. Your knowledge of physics and chemistry illuminates the need for school reform. I do not think that terrorists with guns should be allowed on planes. I have no fear of law abiding citizens.

That last big drug raid at the NY airport proves that terrorist would be able to get guns onto any plane they want! So if the security measures cannot stop the drug smugglers from getting guns and drugs onto airplanes, how are they to keep terrorist from doing it?

Well it appears the safety Nazis have nothing to say about the drug criminals ability to get drugs and guns aboard commercial airplanes.So tell us safety Nazis’ just what good is the added security at the airports if it cannot keep illegal drugs and guns off of the airplanes?So besides adding an enormous cost to flying what good is the added security at the airports?The criminals at that last drug raid demonstrated that they can get guns and drugs on airplanes.

(Skips to the end of the thread without bothering to read the intervening 13 pages)I'm all for it. If taking a gun on a plane is legal (Actually, I believe it already is, although extremely difficult) then I am going to have one, and if anyone tries to hijack the plane I am going to give them two in the chest and one in head.Problem solved.Long story short, people are going to try and hijack planes no matter what. And generally they are either very stupid (Thus dangerous) or suicidal (Thus dangerous) and the survival of the passengers decreases dramatically when this happens. Simply staying cool and following the orders of the Hijackers is not going to get you off the plane alive.Since these people are going to try and hijack the plane anyway, I would rather have the ability to stop them with minimal risk to myself and others than having to resort to using the cutlery provided, or my own body.

Perhaps you should go back and read the preceding 13 pages, you might have learned something. And no, unless you arre a properly credentialed law enforcement official, you will never be allowed to carry a gun on board a plane with you. You may have it in your checked luggage, but FAA regs require the bag to be located in a compartment that is not accessable by you, and the gun must be unloaded, and double locked. You retain the key. Just one thought on the rest of your post, yes, people have and will in the future hijack / attempt to hijack airplanes. Arming the passengers on a plane creates more danger than assuring that none of them are armed. Remember, just because you can shoot at him, he can shoot back. Would you rather get in a shoot out or simply tie someone up with the help of the other passengers?

The above quote is a lie!The very fact that the employees for one airline smuggled illegal drugs and guns onboard the airplane demonstrates the security measures are a farce! All the added security has done for air travel is to increase the cost of air travel!Great now we hear from the safety Nazis that passengers should wrestle terrorists down. Ok tough guys just how many of you will attack a person holding a sharp instrument a.k.a. a weapon. As for placing your firearm locked and unloaded in a part of the airplane you cannot reach. The same employees that will place your gun there are the same employees that can place guns where they want them. Thank god being a terrorist is not as profitable as smuggling drugs!America is no safer! Of course the safety Nazis will say this is just one case. Well 9/11 is also just one case of terrorist talking control of airplanes and using them as flying bombs. The safety Nazis used this one case to add all of the new security measures that cost money and time. Still, guns and drugs were placed on a plane.

Well let us see, your solution is to disarm all the law-abiding citizens then have these disarmed citizens wrestle any terrorist to the floor and tie them up. This was attempted on one of the airplanes on 9/11, only after some of the passengers received cell phone calls from loved ones telling them what was taking place in NYC.The criminals in NYC at that one airline demonstrated that they can place on airplanes illegal drugs and guns at any time. So now let us apply this to the terrorist that would do the same thing. So now we have unarmed passengers at the mercy of an armed terrorist.

You have nothing to fear from law-abiding citizens carrying guns. The criminals proved they can place guns anywhere they want them.

The people one the one airplane demonstrated they would rather fight and die then just sit in their seat and die!You have the right to continue telling people they need to be unarmed and attack armed terrorist.

No, obviously you do not have the ability to comprehend my position. My solution has nothing to do with disarming law abiding people. Actually, it is not my solution, it is the government's solution. Currently, the law is that only those with proper credentials (ie...law enforcement or certain govt. agents) may carry guns aboard an airplane. Everyone else is screened, law abiding citizens and would-be terrorists alike. The idea is to assure that every passenger getting on an airplane (other than those certain few) are not armed. And as far as wrestling a terrorist to the floor, yes, it has worked since 9/11. Remember the shoe bomber? It has also taken place on several other commercial flights since 9/11...it seems that people now understand what is at stake and are willing to take an active role in their own defense.

Every time a flaw is discovered, it draws light to the fact that things need to be fixed. I believe the philosophy is sound, I don't believe it is currently being implemented properly. And as far as wrestling with terrorists, yes, I do want passengers to wrestle with them. They should do whatever it takes to subdue him. It has worked since 9/11 as I pointed out above.

And what is your solution? You never really stated a solution. What is your plan to prevent another 9/11. How does your plan get implimented, how does it work? Again, the idea is for everyone to be disarmed, not just law abiding people. Besides, as seen on 9/11, we cannot discriminate who is a terrorist and who is not. The idea is to not gived anyone the opportunity to have a weapon which makes it easier for them to take over the plane. And post 9/11 I don't think it is even neccesary to tell people that they need to attack someone who threatens the safety of a flight and subdue them.

Obviously you do not have the ability to comprehend!How did this stop the airline employees from placing drugs and guns on the airplane? Terrorists can do the same thing. All the terrorists would have to do is pay an airline employee that is greedy enough to want to do it. Terrorists could also find an airline employee that agreed with their political cause. Now you would have an airline full of disarmed passengers at the mercy of armed terrorists. Which you stated in past post that these unarmed passengers should wrestle the armed terrorist to the floor and tie them up. Do you wear a blue outfit with a red cape and a big S on it under your cloths?Yes they did catch them, after the drugs and guns made it into America! LMAO at your security BS! When fighters are scrambled to force planes like this one down, they are there to shoot the plane down if it does not land where the fighters tell it to. Preventing it from striking the intended target You would have armed law-abiding citizens and armed terrorists more even fight. Unlike your fight plan of unarmed law-abiding passengers fighting armed terrorists. Again this worked on the airplane with the drugs and guns. All of the law-abiding citizens were disarmed. The criminal employees that were armed ones. The only difference was the employees did this for greed. Next time it could be for political reasons.You want unarmed passengers to fight an armed terrorist to retake control of hijacked airplanes. If the unarmed passengers do not retake control of the hijacked airplane, they are doomed to die. The fighter aircraft scramble is there to shoot them down to prevent other innocent law-abiding citizens from dying like on 9/11.The lie? You’re claim of trusting law-abiding citizens.

So by your plan, we can all carry guns on the plane, that includes both law abiding citizens and terrorists alike. OK, so you have said that there is nothing to prevent terrorists from sneaking guns onto planes right? Pay off thr ground crew, implant someone, etc. All well and good. So can we reasonably assume that the terrorists could do the same with a bomb? One of the baggage handlers or fuelers or maintanence techs which go vastly unsupervised about the airport could easily slip a bomb onto the plane, especially in the cargo hold. So what are you and you gun going to do now, shoot the bomb? And can you assure me that every flight, and I mean every flight will have an armed passenger on it? Are you going to quit your job and go fly from city to city every day with your gun to assure my safety? Are you going to assemble an army of these people to do the same and cover every single flight? If you answered no to any of these...plan fails. Try again.

Obviously you do not have the ability to comprehend!How did this stop the airline employees from placing drugs and guns on the airplane? Terrorists can do the same thing. All the terrorists would have to do is pay an airline employee that is greedy enough to want to do it. Terrorists could also find an airline employee that agreed with their political cause. Now you would have an airline full of disarmed passengers at the mercy of armed terrorists. Which you stated in past post that these unarmed passengers should wrestle the armed terrorist to the floor and tie them up. Do you wear a blue outfit with a red cape and a big S on it under your cloths?Yes they did catch them, after the drugs and guns made it into America! LMAO at your security BS! When fighters are scrambled to force planes like this one down, they are there to shoot the plane down if it does not land where the fighters tell it to. Preventing it from striking the intended target You would have armed law-abiding citizens and armed terrorists more even fight. Unlike your fight plan of unarmed law-abiding passengers fighting armed terrorists. Again this worked on the airplane with the drugs and guns. All of the law-abiding citizens were disarmed. The criminal employees that were armed ones. The only difference was the employees did this for greed. Next time it could be for political reasons.You want unarmed passengers to fight an armed terrorist to retake control of hijacked airplanes. If the unarmed passengers do not retake control of the hijacked airplane, they are doomed to die. The fighter aircraft scramble is there to shoot them down to prevent other innocent law-abiding citizens from dying like on 9/11.The lie? You’re claim of trusting law-abiding citizens.

Air marshals are on about 20% of flights most likely. They have not been real forthcoming in regards to exactly how many air marshals there are for security reasons, but you can make a pretty decent guess by looking at their budget, then working backwards. Putting them on every flight wqould be too expensive to be feasible. I would be personally willing to gaurantee that there is an armed passenger on every flight, if you would be willing to personally gaurantee that thee will be a terrorist on every flight. YOu are making a rediculous assuption, which is that by allowing law abiding citizens to carry a gun on a plane terrorists would automatically have the same right.If you were going to allow citizens to carry guns on planes, it would no doubt be only licensed citizens. Licencing processes in about every state required background checks, american citizenship, etc... So, you are stuc with the same dilemma in the gun on plane scenario that you are with the gun ban scenario. Felons are not allowed to buy guns.....terrorists would not be allowed to take guns on planes. By definition, a law abiding citizen is neither a criminal nor are they a terrorist, so banning their posession of a gun does not, common sense dictates, effect the ability of terrorists or criminals to posess a weapon except insofar as some studies indicate that criminals are reluctant to go up against armed citizens.

So by your plan, we can all carry guns on the plane, that includes both law abiding citizens and terrorists alike. OK, so you have said that there is nothing to prevent terrorists from sneaking guns onto planes right? Pay off thr ground crew, implant someone, etc. All well and good. So can we reasonably assume that the terrorists could do the same with a bomb? One of the baggage handlers or fuelers or maintanence techs which go vastly unsupervised about the airport could easily slip a bomb onto the plane, especially in the cargo hold. So what are you and you gun going to do now, shoot the bomb? And can you assure me that every flight, and I mean every flight will have an armed passenger on it? Are you going to quit your job and go fly from city to city every day with your gun to assure my safety? Are you going to assemble an army of these people to do the same and cover every single flight? If you answered no to any of these...plan fails. Try again. I think we already have people to do that, they are called air marshals. I would like to see them on every flight, I don't think they currently are.

If a criminal or terrorist wishes to place guns or drugs or even a bomb they will simply do it. This was demonstrated by the airline employees that placed the drugs and guns on that one airplane. This was one airplane that was discovered, how many more airplanes are not discovered that the drugs and guns make it to the intended criminals? You are happy that the drugs and guns were discovered by the authorities. The down side of this discovery is that the drugs and guns made it to their intended city. The drugs and guns were not discovered before they left the ground. So you are happy that the unarmed law-abiding citizens were placed in a dangerous situation if there had been a terrorist on that airplane.Air marshals? Once again your solutions are to cost law-abiding citizens more money. Was there an air marshal on that airplane with the drugs and guns? Using your logic we would place a cop on every street corner in America to fight crime. One has to find it funny that you place your security in armed air marshals and not armed law-abiding citizens. Is it the training air marshals receives that makes you feel all warm and safe?Criminals and terrorist are going to have all the guns they want no matter how many security measures enacted to disarm the law-abiding citizen by people such as you.It is amazing that people such as you will disarm law-abiding citizens to simply make yourself feel secure. If you are so fearful of terrible things happening on airplanes then maybe people like you should not be flying. When have I ever stated that the airlines should allow terrorists to carry guns on airplanes? I pointed out that no matter how many security measures you enact terrorists will still be able to place guns on planes if they want to. I pointed out that your security measure to search all passengers and luggage for weapons is costly. I pointed out that after all of your costly security measures to search passengers and luggage that drugs and guns are still able to be placed on airplanes. This makes it appear that all of your new security measures have failed!

Look, it is simple. The terrorists on 9/11 carried boxcutters onto the planes, legally. The boarded the planes, legally. They bought tickets forthe flights legally. We did not know that they are terrorists. So what is to stop someone from carrying a gun onto a plane legally, then using it to commit and act of terrorism. Nothing. After all, if we don't know they are a terrorist, how can we stop them? While yes, this has probably happened many times, the particular case you are talking about they did know about the drugs before the plane took off. The suspects were under investigation for a while. It probably happens on a regular basis without the knowledge of law enforcement. This is really not concerning to the point at hand. And by the way, there is no mention of them smuggling guns on board the aircraft, just the drugs. Guns are mentioned, but only that 5 guns were confiscated. The guns were most likely confiscated in the cars of the criminals. I think they would have mentioned the guns. Now of coarse, it would not be hard to imagine that guns could easily be placed on an airplane. (although everything had been placed in the cargo hold, which is relatively difficult to get to on most planes in flight. this even brings up the point that you may transport guns in your checked luggage, so in a sense, a lot of flights possibly already have guns in the cargo hold.)Make the airlines pay for it. Or eliminate some wasteful govt. spending and use that money to pay for it. There are a thousand possibilities. Was there an air marshal aboard...who knows. Air marshals are armed, law abiding citizens. And yes, the training that they recieve makes me feel SAFER than some of the XXXXXX that would carry a gun onto a plane if allowed. How easy is it to get a gun? How easy is it to get a CCW. I know many people tha have CCW and guns, but they would not make me feel safer than someone who is specifically trained in armed intervention on an airplane. Nice try. How about this...if you are so afraid to fly without a gun, take a bus. I am more fearful of what would happen on board a plane if we allowed guns on board. And just how could you do that? You have that many friends? This I find hard to believe. And I am being rediculous? Your plan of being able to "guarantee an armed passenger on every flight" is absolutely groundless. (unless you run the air marshal program) And again, it is obvious that it would not be difficult for a terrorist to get a gun on a plane, after all, they don't wear a label that says Hello...my name is Habib Q.

The passengers on the airplanes on 9/11 were unarmed because they obeyed the rules. The terrorist used box cutters to hijack these airplanes containing unarmed passengers. Then the terrorist used these airplanes as flying bombs.The passengers were all unarmed on this airplane carry guns and drugs. Guns were on the airplane as well as drugs. This can be seen in the news footage of the crime. The only thing that saved this plane from being hijacked is the fact that illegal drugs are more profitable to the greedy airline employees.Typical extremist left wing answer to a question about who pays for something. Just who pays the airlines for their service? The customers. Just who would pick up the added cost of your security measures? The customers!You should check out the firearms training for police departments before you talk about the requirements for a ccw.I never said I was afraid to fly, you are the one that fears law-abiding citizens carrying guns, not me!You would be much safer on a bus because you could always dial 911 and wait for the police to come.I read some of the post by that guy. A little extreme maybe, then again maybe not. What did Barry Goldwater say about extremism? Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. Then again you are the one that sees a terrorist in every airline passenger that approaches the gate.Well chicken little watch out for that sky!

Like I said, extremely difficult to do legally. Only very few people are allowed to do so. With any luck, I will be one of them (Just got recommended for a position in the Australian Special Forces).Actually, no it doesnt. You see, hijacking a plane is either suicidal (guaranteed death for passengers) or very stupid. A hijacked plane can only go so far on the fuel it has. It is easily tracked, easily boarded and easily re-taken. Professional and smart criminals do not do it any more because it is almost imossible to pull off effectively. When the plane lands, the ground forces will surround it, wait you out, and then take you out.Thus, the only people (excluding suicidal fundies) who hijack planes are stupid, unprofesional sorts. These people are extremely dangerous due to their lack of composure and control. When things start to go pear shaped for them, as they inevitably will, they will lose control of the situation fast and will resort to violence in an attempt to regain it. This is a very bad situation to be in.Yes, but he has to watch every passenger on the plance. I just have to watch him, and perhaps five of his buddies. Either he is suicidal, and intends to use the plane 9/11 style, or he is stupid. Either way, sooner or later he will present a clean shot. Point in fact, he will be armed whether I am or not. I would rather be armed legally than unarmed.With regards to the box-cutters or knives:emoticonXConfused You need to be very good to kill someone with a small knife like that. If someone on a plane I was on tried to hijack it with a box-cutter they would soon be in a world of pain. If they are good enough to kill me with it, they should be making their living by training ninjas in Japan rather than hijacking planes.

Perhaps you should go back and read the preceding 13 pages, you might have learned something. And no, unless you arre a properly credentialed law enforcement official, you will never be allowed to carry a gun on board a plane with you. You may have it in your checked luggage, but FAA regs require the bag to be located in a compartment that is not accessable by you, and the gun must be unloaded, and double locked. You retain the key. Just one thought on the rest of your post, yes, people have and will in the future hijack / attempt to hijack airplanes. Arming the passengers on a plane creates more danger than assuring that none of them are armed. Remember, just because you can shoot at him, he can shoot back. Would you rather get in a shoot out or simply tie someone up with the help of the other passengers?

Was it hard for the airline employees to place drugs and guns on the airplane that arrived at NYC?

1. Being in the Australian Special Forces will still not entitle you to carry a gun onto any flight arriving or departing the United States. I do not know what the law is for domestic flights in Australia, nor Australian international flights that do not enter the US. 2. The point was that I (as well as the majority of other Americans) feel that by screening for and attempting to keep guns off airplanes, you make it far less likely that a hijacking will take place. The idea is to mitigate the risk in the air, not to make it more likely and then deal with it once it happens. It is like the difference between using a condom for birth control and using abortion for birth control. And as you know, fuel was not a concern for the aircraft on 9/11, as a matter of fact, the terrorists specifically picked planes that would be heavily loaded with fuel to make the post crash fires more effective. 3. It sounds like you should have been on one of the planes on 9/11 then. Perhaps you could have put the 5 terrorists in a world of pain. While it may not be as easy to kill someone with a boxcutter than with a gun, it certainly can happen. 9/11 was the perfect case in point. Out of 4 attempted hijackings, 4 were successful, sounds like they did OK to me. The "fundies" (I like that term) as you called them, are highly trained individuals. They trained and planned for years to carry out a suicide mission. I would say that this shows an extreme level of commitment to their cause. These are not the terrorists that we used to think of, they are a new breed and should be regarded as a much greater threat.

This worked on the airplane that the drugs and guns were found on after it arrived at the NYC airport. How many more times does this happen and no one catches it?Three worked. The fourth one was stopped when the passengers were called on their cell phones and made aware of what was happening by their family members.

Three of the hijackers groups completed their task. The fourth airplane was prevented from completing its task by a group of unarmed passengers. Which you have stated in your past posts should attack armed terrorists. These unarmed passengers prevented the terrorists from completing their task and killing even more people.

After all, you are the one who continually points out that I support the idea of unarmed passengers confronting armed terrorists. Are you suggesting that they should have sat in their seats and let the terrorists do whatever they wanted? Your argument is circular, and makes no sense. My ideal situation is that nobody on the aircraft is armed, thereby preventing the need for any unarmed individual to attack an armed terrorist.

Oh I know that, but I dont intend to stop there. I plan on staying for six years before attempting the SAS, and from there, who knows? Perhaps CIA field agent, perhaps SF training instructor in any western nation...My point was that I'm on my way.I agree that letting just anyone have a gun on a plane is lunacy. I have always taken a middle-ground as far as gun control goes. I dont think just anyone should be able to take a gun onto a plane, but I dont see why more people arent allowed. Certainly licence the hell out of it, make the licences very hard to get, certainly. But I dont see why it should be practically impossible.No-one knows the exact details of the 9/11 hijackings. I think that they must have gained access to the cockpit, as the plane en-route to camp david crash-landed. It is my belief that certain passengers fought with the hijackers, but the pilot was slain and the place forced to crash. In such a situation weapons are accademic.As a side note, I almost wish I had been on the 9/11 planes. I am something of a martial arts expert. I train hard to be able to disarm, cripple and kill people at very close quarters. I have done this for years, and it happens to be something I am very good at. Like I said, the only people these days who hijack planes are either fundies who plan on killing everyone on the plane in a suicide attack, or fools who have little idea of the trouble they are in. Either way, the passengers are in trouble. The fundies are definately well trained, co-ordinated and very dedicated, and they are definately a threat. I think allowing people (heavily vetted, tightly controlled and only very few people) to take guns onto a flight will only help, not hinder the situation.

Here is an news article from a paper stating that airline employees can be paid off to break the law. This was before Phil Brennan, NewsMax.comSaturday Sept. 29, 2001 Ordinary, responsible Americans need to be armed, just as Israelis are in the war against terrorism, writes author/researcher John R. Lott Jr., who says that's the only adequate response to the terrorist threat Americans now face. Writing in today's Wall Street Journal, Lott notes the security problems the nation faces and insists that not matter how tight restrictions are, and no matter how many air marshals ride planes, nothing beats having an armed citizenry in the fight against terrorism. Lott, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "More Guns, Less Crime" (University of Chicago Press, 2000). itemizes the flaws in most of the security measures now in effect or being considered: Screening at airports, while important, will always be inadequate, he writes, noting that terrorists can always figure find some way around the controls such as bribing airport employees. Strengthening cockpit doors, he says, is probably a good idea, " but given current airline design it may create dangerous differences in air pressure between the cockpit and cabin. In any case, the door must be opened sometime, to allow pilots to go to the bathroom or get food." The marshals program is more promising. He cites research by Bill Landes at the University of Chicago that showed that between a third and a half of the drop in airplane hijackings during the 1970s were the probable result of having armed U.S. marshals on planes as well as law enforcement's increased ability to catch and punish hijackers. Putting merely one air marshal aboard every daily flight in the U.S. would require an army of at least 35,000 officers-a far greater number than total of all those who now work for the FBI, Secret Service and the U.S. Marshal Service combined (17,000). Moreover, he adds that one marshal might not be enough to foil a whole gang of hijackers, of the kind used by Osama bin Laden. Clearly, he says, it will take a long time to deploy enough marshals. In response to these and other problems, Lott suggests that the 600,000 active state and local law enforcement officers in the U.S. today who are currently forbidden to bring their guns on airplanes should not only be allowed to board planes but even be given discount fares if they fly with their guns. Moreover, since most pilots have also had military experience they should be armed as their union, and NewsMax.com's Chris Ruddy have demanded, exactly as Israel's El Al been doing all along. Lott dismisses fears of having guns aboard planes, explaining that the special, high-velocity handgun ammunition used on planes packs quite a wallop but is designed not to penetrate the aluminum skin of the plane. Even with regular bullets he notes, the worst-case outcome would simply be to force the plane to fly at a lower altitude, where the air pressure is higher. But using guns to stop terrorists shouldn't be limited to airplanes, he insists. "We should encourage off-duty police, and responsible citizens, to carry guns in most public places because cops can't be everywhere. In Israel, for example, Lott explains that about 10% of Jewish adults have permits to carry concealed handguns. Just to match that rate of permit holding, Americans would have to increase the number of permits from 3.5 million to almost 21 million, he wrote. "Thirty-three states currently have "right-to-carry" laws, which allow the law-abiding to obtain a permit if they are above a certain age and pay a fee. Half of these states require some training. We should encourage more states to pass such laws, and possibly even subsidize firearms training," Lott maintains. He concludes by noting that the states that do pass concealed handgun laws "experience drops in violent crimes, especially in multiple victim shootings - the type of attack most associated with terrorism. "Bill Landes and I found that deaths and injuries from multiple-victim public shootings fell by 80% after states passed right-to-carry laws."

Oh I know that, but I dont intend to stop there. I plan on staying for six years before attempting the SAS, and from there, who knows? Perhaps CIA field agent, perhaps SF training instructor in any western nation...My point was that I'm on my way.I agree that letting just anyone have a gun on a plane is lunacy. I have always taken a middle-ground as far as gun control goes. I dont think just anyone should be able to take a gun onto a plane, but I dont see why more people arent allowed. Certainly licence the hell out of it, make the licences very hard to get, certainly. But I dont see why it should be practically impossible.No-one knows the exact details of the 9/11 hijackings. I think that they must have gained access to the cockpit, as the plane en-route to camp david crash-landed. It is my belief that certain passengers fought with the hijackers, but the pilot was slain and the place forced to crash. In such a situation weapons are accademic.As a side note, I almost wish I had been on the 9/11 planes. I am something of a martial arts expert. I train hard to be able to disarm, cripple and kill people at very close quarters. I have done this for years, and it happens to be something I am very good at. Like I said, the only people these days who hijack planes are either fundies who plan on killing everyone on the plane in a suicide attack, or fools who have little idea of the trouble they are in. Either way, the passengers are in trouble. The fundies are definately well trained, co-ordinated and very dedicated, and they are definately a threat. I think allowing people (heavily vetted, tightly controlled and only very few people) to take guns onto a flight will only help, not hinder the situation.

Good luck to you. It is a long road, I hope you make it. I think we mostly agree on this point. They advocate repeal of all gun laws, stating that it is unconstitutional to place limits on a natural right. This means that they would have any old citizen with a gun carry it on board an aircraft. I know many people who own guns, few that I would trust in close quarter combat with one. The problem would be hillbilly Jed with his .45 gets on the plane, a passenger who appears to be middle-eastern stands up to go to the bathroom, and Jed blows a hole in his head. This is what I am against. The average American gun owner is not trained enough to be trusted with a gun in the situations that may arise in a hijacking. I would agree with making a special licence, making it difficult to obtain, and making the training extensive in order to get said licence. But in a sense, we already have that. We have the air marshal program, and whether the anti-gun control croud wants to admit it or not, this program does precisely what they are advocating. I am for expansion of this program, and making a volunteer air marshal program as well. Perhaps frequent flyers who are also gun owners complete the training succesfully, and then agree to carry aboard for say a 10% discount on airfares or some other perks. The only problem with this is that background checks would need to be done, and I don't mean sitting in front of a computer and looking for previous felonies, I mean real extensive checking where they talk to your neighbors where you grew up, get your highschool transcripts, extensive psychological testing, etc. The kind of checks required of trainees at the CIA and FBI. These checks are time consuming and expensive to do, so the anti-gun control croud would never go for anything that "waste" taxpayer money. I think a big part of the problem (certainly not your problem) that some of the people here have is that the air marshals are a government program; the FAA, TSA, and NTSB are government agencies; and that firearms laws and regulations are governmentally imposed; and these people are more anti-government than anything. They put more faith into a 230 year old piece of paper than they do a modern government that is attempting to deal with modern problems. The constitution is a good framework for our government to run by, but it is outdated, and needs to be applied to modern day America. No doubt, their efforts were heroic. Who knows why the plane crashed, perhaps the terrorists realizing that they could not win drove it into the ground out of desperation, or perhaps an untrained passenger simply stall / spun the aircraft into the ground after getting to the controls. We really will never know the true story. The point is, that if we had controlled by means of security who was allowed to get on the plane armed, and ensured that the others were not armed, the whole day of 9/11 would have been just another September day. We allowed people to legally carry weapons on board 4 aircraft, and these weapons were used to hijack 4 aircraft. Makes me wonder what would have happened if the terrorists had used several hundred hijackers instead of 19. We could have had 20 aircraft hijacked for every hundred passengers, and judging by the success rate on 9/11, this would have been devastating. Just think what could happen if we allow ordinary citizens on board an aircraft armed with guns like some have suggested. The terrorists could just blend into the crowd again, and board with weapons at the ready to take over a few more planes.

Here is an news article from a paper stating that airline employees can be paid off to break the law. This was before Phil Brennan, NewsMax.comSaturday Sept. 29, 2001 Ordinary, responsible Americans need to be armed, just as Israelis are in the war against terrorism, writes author/researcher John R. Lott Jr., who says that's the only adequate response to the terrorist threat Americans now face. Writing in today's Wall Street Journal, Lott notes the security problems the nation faces and insists that not matter how tight restrictions are, and no matter how many air marshals ride planes, nothing beats having an armed citizenry in the fight against terrorism. Lott, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "More Guns, Less Crime" (University of Chicago Press, 2000). itemizes the flaws in most of the security measures now in effect or being considered: Screening at airports, while important, will always be inadequate, he writes, noting that terrorists can always figure find some way around the controls such as bribing airport employees. Strengthening cockpit doors, he says, is probably a good idea, " but given current airline design it may create dangerous differences in air pressure between the cockpit and cabin. In any case, the door must be opened sometime, to allow pilots to go to the bathroom or get food." The marshals program is more promising. He cites research by Bill Landes at the University of Chicago that showed that between a third and a half of the drop in airplane hijackings during the 1970s were the probable result of having armed U.S. marshals on planes as well as law enforcement's increased ability to catch and punish hijackers. Putting merely one air marshal aboard every daily flight in the U.S. would require an army of at least 35,000 officers-a far greater number than total of all those who now work for the FBI, Secret Service and the U.S. Marshal Service combined (17,000). Moreover, he adds that one marshal might not be enough to foil a whole gang of hijackers, of the kind used by Osama bin Laden. Clearly, he says, it will take a long time to deploy enough marshals.

Still the above quote is the only concern of some people that have no regards for unarmed law-abiding passengers. People like this feel it is better to be a victim of armed terrorist.

Pls, tell me you are kidding on this one. A law enforcement officer is 7 times more likely to use their weapon inapropriatly than a regular citizen (MSNBC). Further, the requirement for a Law enforcement officer in most of the united states to carry a weapon is that they must be able to hit a paper plate sized target 6 times in 20 seconds at 20 yards.This is pathetic. I personally know I can do a 3x5 index card 16 times in less than 20 seconds at 20 yards. At 100 yards, I can kit a paper plate sized target 14 times in 15 seconds for sure, and that includes changing clips. I would imagine that most of the regular shooters here can do the same. I do a lot of competition shooting. We used to have a few cops that would show up and plan to show us "how it is done" They have all gone home shame faced.FOr some reason a lot of liberals seem to endow cops with some kind of superhuman ability when it comes to handling firearms and showing good judgement. Some of my best friends are cops, and I shure wouldn;t want most of them backing me up in a life or death situation which involved marksmanship. AS far as keeping their cool, lets all keep in mind that the ONLY tie in US history a registered machine gun has been used illegally it was in the hands of a chicago narctics officer who got mad while questioning a suspect and blew him away.

I am anti-gun but still pro-self-defense. Someone attacks you and/or your family? Do whatever is suitable and according to the law to protect yourself and your relatives.If these two things couldn´t go together than most of the Western nations wouldn´t allow people to defend themselves. And what sundowner tried to say (I am suggesting he tried to say that) is that the risk of armed passengers is higher than the benefit.Tell me, how many successful attempts of hijacking occured during the last 10 years involving American airlines or airlines travelling towards the USA or with mainly American passengers? Apart from 9/11 there weren´t many, if any at all.So even if we assume that these hijackings xould have been stopped (optimistic), we still should consider the accidents that could have happened during the same amount of time.One over-jealous passenger firing his gun is too much. I also wonder why airlines not simply invest a few bucks to improve the planes´cockpit doors.This could hold off hijackers better than any gun imo...

This is the phrase to watch out for when people claim to be pro something.The terrorists have demonstrated that airplanes today are just flying bombs. So now you have a airplane full of unarmed passengers at the mercy of armed terrorists. The security experts have stated terrorists can get guns on airplanes anytime the want to. This was demonstrated by the recent incident at the NYC airport when drugs and guns were found on an airplane placed there by airline employees.Calculate the risk, armed terrorists hijack a airplane and use it as a flying bomb. Are all of the passengers dead at the end of this? Security experts have stated that airplane design does not allow for that. What about restrooms and eating accommodations for the pilots? What would design concepts like these cost the airline customers? Are you going to design airplanes with the front third of the airplane for the pilots? How are you going to screen pilots to see how they would react to hostages being killed on the other side of that reenforced cockpit door because the pilot will not do as the terrorist demand?To top it off once the authorities on the ground become aware of a hijacking fighter aircraft will be scrambled to intercept the hijacked airplane. The pilots of the fighter aircraft orders will be to shoot that hijacked airplane down to prevent it from being used as a flying bomb. Is this more of a risk then “One over-jealous passenger firing his gun is too much”?

And sure, the pilots wouldn´t be perfectly safe, they never can be. But it is about reducing risks.I also see the dilemma when terrorists kill hossies to gain access to the cockpit. But in that case one could argue they would die anyway.

Make jokes all you want, but you have a problem with people defending themselves.This is a quote from you later on in this post “But in that case one could argue they would die anyway.” So when you argue people will die anyway it is still better if they all die not defending themselves. Even if a lone passenger defending themselves would save the airplane with a few casualties verse all onboard dead. Again we get your well they are all dead anyway why fight.Which is more likely to happen a plane hijacked used as a flying bomb like on 9/11 or an accidental discharge of a firearm causing an airplane to crash? Well can you produce one incident of a passenger causing an airplane to crash because of the accidental discharge of a gun? I can produce one incident of terrorists using airplanes as flying bombs.

Are YOU serious? While you may be able to hit a paper plate at 100 yards (with a handgun?) the average American gun owner has never had any formal firearms training, has probably not been to a firing range in the last year, and probably could not hit the paper plate consistently at 15 yards. Sad but true. Remember, it is not a requirement to be able to shoot a gun accurately to buy a gun. There are many people who buy guns for self defense, and then put it in their nightstand or car and never fire the gun once. If the law was opened up the way JustAnotherGuy wants, these are the people that will then be allowed to carry guns on board aircraft. This scares me. Police may not be expert marksman, but they do have firearms training, and must qualify with a firearm, showing that they at least have some measure of skill.

Make jokes all you want, but you have a problem with people defending themselves.This is a quote from you later on in this post “But in that case one could argue they would die anyway.” So when you argue people will die anyway it is still better if they all die not defending themselves. Even if a lone passenger defending themselves would save the airplane with a few casualties verse all onboard dead. Again we get your well they are all dead anyway why fight.Which is more likely to happen a plane hijacked used as a flying bomb like on 9/11 or an accidental discharge of a firearm causing an airplane to crash? Well can you produce one incident of a passenger causing an airplane to crash because of the accidental discharge of a gun? I can produce one incident of terrorists using airplanes as flying bombs.

Shooting is a simple thing. Line up your shot. Squeeze trigger. Repeat. THe reason some people have som much trouble with it is that they are taught incorrectly. WHen you first learn to shoot a pistol , you should put a piece of black electrical tape iver the rear sight, rendering it useless. Then, put your target about 20 yrds away (start with something bigger han an index card, say a man sized target). There are only two things to remember when shooting.1. line up your shot2. Take the shot when you feel it is right, the longer you stand there, the less likely you are to hitI would diagree that the maority of firearms owners don't shoot regularly. While there are certainly some that do not practice, I think the majority of them make it out to shoot at least occasionally. Beyond that, I think that many/most people who buy a gun go out and shoot it at least a few times. This is all it takes in most cases for somebody to be able to handle a handgun for close quarters (inside 50 yrs). With a cop, all you know for sure is that once a year they have managed to hit a big target 6 times in 20 seconds. A handgun is the easiest type of gun to shoot (besides perhapse a shot gun). It feels natural in your hand. Point your arm, pull trigger. Odds are, you just hit your target. IT takes some practice to get really good with one, but I would imagine that about any 10 yr old kid could hit a man sized target at 20 yrds the first time they pick up a gun. When learnig to shoot wiht a distance weapon like a rifle, you have a much harder time, since movement of the barrel of a fraction of a degree can throw your shot off a number of inches, or even feet, at any kind of distance. A handgun is primarily for close quarters as it doesn't require careful aiming (instinctive shooting is just fine in most cases).Anti-gunners/non-shooters overestimate the amount of skill needed to properly use a handgun.Could you provide any links to back this up? Any data or statistics?[/QUOTE]

Are YOU serious? While you may be able to hit a paper plate at 100 yards (with a handgun?) the average American gun owner has never had any formal firearms training, has probably not been to a firing range in the last year, and probably could not hit the paper plate consistently at 15 yards. Sad but true. Remember, it is not a requirement to be able to shoot a gun accurately to buy a gun. There are many people who buy guns for self defense, and then put it in their nightstand or car and never fire the gun once. If the law was opened up the way JustAnotherGuy wants, these are the people that will then be allowed to carry guns on board aircraft. This scares me. Police may not be expert marksman, but they do have firearms training, and must qualify with a firearm, showing that they at least have some measure of skill. Could you provide any links to back this up? Any data or statistics?

Who pays the cost of airliners slamming into buildings, killing thousands, injuring thousands more, and destroying 100's of millions of property? And the lawsuits that follow? And the rebuilding? And the cost of new security measures? The American consumer is the one who picks up the tab for all this. Prevention is cheaper than mopping up the mess. 9/11 has cost more and will continue to cost the American consumer more money than any other domestic disaster in history. Besides, creating jobs would do more to stimulate the economy and the cost rise would be negligable to the consumer anyway. Paying 3 or 4 more dollars per ticket is not going to break most travelers.

THere is ample example of this. Up until the late 50's there was really no prohibition against carrying guns on planes. In the charter for the air marshals program of the time, the lack of citizens carrying weapons was cited as one of the reasons for the program (History of Terrorism, pg 114).

No. And I never said there were.Dying while defending or dying in a crash is no difference and in that case the attempt to defend would be tried by anyone.Question is, are the dangers of confusing an ordinary citizen with a terrorist not too high?

The first time anybody was EVER shot on board an airplane was during a hijacking. No gun toting citizen has ever shot anybody on an aircraft.This ends up being a difficult point to argue on either side, since there is really not enough data or had research to draw a firm conclusion. I think the best argument for this would almost have to be the low number of inapropriate shootings by citizens carrying guns in general. There are over 40 states now that allow concealed carry, but according to the latest numbers from the ustice department the number of improper shootings is actually DOWN from where it was in the 1920's (the last time widespread concealed carry was allowed). They attribute this to the fact that most states that issues concealed carry permits require a class that explains the legal use of force. I can't see any reason that aboard an airplane would be any different.

NO, there were no hijackings when there were routinely armed citizens on airplanes. When citizens were no longer allowed to carry weapons on airplanes, that is when hijackings started. at the time, his was compared to old west train robberies. When trains were robbed it was highly unusual for the thieves to molest the passengers, since the maority of them were armed. Generally not. The police are nowhere near the experts in law hat you seem to think (thus the pathetically low conviction rate in America). The NRA has always been considered foremost experts in firearms safety and their proper use. This was actually the reason the NRA was started. They only stepped up as a guns rights orginaisation after the anti gunners went on the offensive. In many places (including around here) the NRA teaches the cops the classes on safe firearm handling and appropriate use of force.Since police are trained to this theoretically high level of awareness regarding the use of force, shouldn't they be held to a higher standard? TRaditionally if a police officer is found to have use force improperly or has an accidental shooting, they face suspension or even loss of their job. A private citizen guilty of the same thing faces prison. Seems a little lopsided to me, especially when you consider that police are MORE likely than private citizens to commit such an offense (this has been attributed to the kind of folks that become cops).Dozens, maybe hundreds. MOst hiackings do not end with buildings being crashed into. During a period from the late sixties to the early eighties hijackings were a real problem. This is true. Since civilian marksmanship programs commonly hold civilians to a higher standard than law enforcement officers, would't that mean that in all propreity we should be working to ban cops carrying guns on planes as opposed to law abiding citizens?Did you people all miss that deal a couple years ago about the guy suing the LAPD because according to their entrance tests he was too smart to be a cop? His IQ was only 123. THis is pretty average (when you discount mentally retarded people). How can you put so much faith in a bunch of folks when their departments have procedures in place to ensure that they only hire the dumbest of the mediocre?

Once the passengers on the fourth airplane were made aware of this by their family members on cell phones they reacted like they did. They choose to die fighting. They prevented an airplane from striking another building and saving the lives of other people.

I wasn't thinking firearm safety, because I would agree that, as the NRA's main occupation being the handling of firearms, I would imagine they're quite good at that :P I was thinking more the legality of using their weapon. If the NRA and the police are seeing eye to eye as to what's appropriate, then there's no problem. Do you see what I mean? Then there would be no questions later.No, I would think police should know what is appropriate, so they should be given more leeway in regard to what they do. They are also a government agency, created to protect us. What they do they do to protect all of us. That limits their liability. Obviously excessive use of force should be looked into, but their training should allow them some leeway as to what they are allowed to do.Private citizens are liable for their own actions, since they are private citizens.Here? In the US? Wow, I did not know that. Wait, and they all ended with the passengers being killed? Somehow I would think I would have heard about that :SI can't comment on their hiring procedures, since I don't know exactly what they look for in a recruit :P I would also rather have a police officer, since I know that everything he does will have the safety of the passengers in the forefront of his mind. A private citizen just wants to be Rambo and have a shootout. No thank you!

NO, there were no hijackings when there were routinely armed citizens on airplanes. When citizens were no longer allowed to carry weapons on airplanes, that is when hijackings started. at the time, his was compared to old west train robberies. When trains were robbed it was highly unusual for the thieves to molest the passengers, since the maority of them were armed. Generally not. The police are nowhere near the experts in law hat you seem to think (thus the pathetically low conviction rate in America). The NRA has always been considered foremost experts in firearms safety and their proper use. This was actually the reason the NRA was started. They only stepped up as a guns rights orginaisation after the anti gunners went on the offensive. In many places (including around here) the NRA teaches the cops the classes on safe firearm handling and appropriate use of force.Since police are trained to this theoretically high level of awareness regarding the use of force, shouldn't they be held to a higher standard? TRaditionally if a police officer is found to have use force improperly or has an accidental shooting, they face suspension or even loss of their job. A private citizen guilty of the same thing faces prison. Seems a little lopsided to me, especially when you consider that police are MORE likely than private citizens to commit such an offense (this has been attributed to the kind of folks that become cops).Dozens, maybe hundreds. MOst hiackings do not end with buildings being crashed into. During a period from the late sixties to the early eighties hijackings were a real problem. This is true. Since civilian marksmanship programs commonly hold civilians to a higher standard than law enforcement officers, would't that mean that in all propreity we should be working to ban cops carrying guns on planes as opposed to law abiding citizens?Did you people all miss that deal a couple years ago about the guy suing the LAPD because according to their entrance tests he was too smart to be a cop? His IQ was only 123. THis is pretty average (when you discount mentally retarded people). How can you put so much faith in a bunch of folks when their departments have procedures in place to ensure that they only hire the dumbest of the mediocre?

As far as I know, the NRA is the largest contract agent whne it comes to acceptable use of force instruction. They actually own another company that actually carries out the classes (b/c the NRA is non-profit, and they charge rather well for these courses). I would assume they see eye to eye, since the NRA is the one telling the police what to think on this one.There are strict and specific laws regarding what is an acceptable use of force. The law does not allow for "personal discretion" as a defense. YOur use of force is either justified, or it is not. If a cop uses unjustified force, they are breaking the law. THey have become criminals, and should be treated as such. All over the world. It was damn near an epidemic. Somebody was generally killed in every one of th hijackings. There were spectacular raids by british special forces (which ended up proving that british special forces should perhapse not try to pull off spectacular raids). This was why the Sky Marshal program was instituted it he first place. Ia m not sure how you could have missed this. Not much of a fan of history (or current events, as the case may be)?Ok, so you don;t know what kind of hiring procedures police departments use, therefore you have no idea where these guys that eventually end up wearing badges come from or what kind of background they might have, yet you are willing to blindly assume that they have the best interests of society at heart and you are absolutly certain that they posess the mental capacity, self control, and skills required to protect you?HAs it not occured to you that you are atributing an awful lot to a bunch of strangers about whom you apparently know very little? As far as the "rambo"" comment, growing up, my father was the fire chief in he town we lived in. As such, I had occasion to know most of the ranking public officials. I was pulled over and treated badly by a police officer, and I went to the police chief to complain. HE told me (And I am paraphrasing, since I didn't have it transcribed or recorded or anything). "Ask your dad, he has his XXXXXX to deal with, I have mine. The majority of cops become cops because they want a badge and a gun, they have wet dreams about shooting people, It is all a power trip to them." That part is absolutly verbatim and I will never forget it. The next is the paraphrasing part "THe next biggest group become cops because their father was a cop, and their grandfather was a cop, and they think they are better than regular people because of it. The last group is the smallest, probably less than 10 percent. They are the guys that become cops because they actually want to help people." Now, this was a guy who had been a cop for over 30 years and was the chief of a large police department. I think he matces the definition of expert pretty well. While the second half was paraphrased, I have a good memory, so I know all the prime points were there.It seems to me that the group most likely to go "rambo" on you are the guys who take a low paying, crappy job because they want to carry a gun and tell people what to do.I have lots and lots of guns. Everything from .22 plinkers to .50 cal sniper rifles. I have assault weapons, rifles, shotguns, pistols. I have never really had the desire to shoot anybody, nor do I forsee wishing to go on a killing spree in the near future. If it comes down to me lying in a puddle of blood in the gutter or a would be attacker lying in a puddle of blood in the gutter, I most certainly intent to ensure that the other guy gets the privelage of becoming a statistic.

Actually even with a concealed weapons permit, I do not believe you are allowed to possess a firearm on board an aircraft.The Second Amendment protects the right to OWN firearms and other weapons, and to use them in self defense. It does not grant a person the right to bring a gun on a plane, nor do I see how it could be interpreted to mean such a thing. Where do you get this question?And terrorists already recieve their weapons illegally. It is NOT LEGAL for any country to sell weapons to a terrorist country/nation/organization. But somehow they always get their hands on weapons. Hmm... I don't think they go out to their local shooting range and pick up a 9mm pistol. While it is possible (if they passed the backgroud check that is), its not probable. Because they would still have the illegal avenue to pursue the purchase of firearms with. If you want to ban firearms, the only thing you're doing is taking away the rights of citizens to defend themselves. Terrorists and criminals in general will find a way to obtain the firearms they desire no matter what laws are in effect. Llike they would follow the laws anyways? They ARE terrorists you know.)

Ok, so you are aboard an airplane full of people heading to New York or any major city in the United States. Would you be comfortable knowing that someone who wants to crash the plane can legally bring a gun on board, thus making it easier for him to follow through with his plan? Or would you rather make it more difficult for him to hijack the plane? Your choice.

I agree that the second ammendment does not give us the right to carry guns onto airplanes. It seems to me that terrorists would have no problem legally obtaining firearms, after all, they got pilots licenses legally. I actually took all of my practical flight exams with the same examiners that tested many of the terrorists. The terrorists did nothing illegal in the US until they hijacked those planes. Terrorists could go to any gun store and get a gun with the proper credentials. After all, they are not terrorists until they commit an act of terrorism. Banning guns will not stop them from getting them, but we do need security to assure that they don't get on the planes with them. I don't think there are many people here that are calling for banning guns.

Smuggling drugs in the cargo hold of an aircraft and carrying a gun into the cabin of an aircraft are 2 completely different things. Yes, it happened, get over it. The question is: What can be done about it, how can we prevent it in the future? Being able to carry your gun onto a commercial flight is not going to stop people from doing this. We need to identify and fix problems with security, not create more by allowing everyone (which includes terrorists) to carry guns onto aircraft. And I wonder how we caught these smugglers...could it possibly have been security measures in place? And just what hatred of what right are you referring to?

So now you are accusing the security people at the airports of not doing their jobs! Maybe they were paid to not do their job. Next time it may be terrorist forcing them to allow other employees to place guns onboard airplanes. How will the terrorist do this? Simple they will tell the security person that a member or members of their family will be harmed if they do not do as instructed! Bank robbers have used this act in the past to rob banks.

Is this your logic in denying airline passengers the right to defend themselves? Do you also use this logic when you purchase insurance? Insurance is like owning a gun. These two items are only good when you need them if you have them at the time of need.

After drinking a bottle of booze, I couldn´t kill someone with my insurance :p .My opinion is simply that, that there a better ways to protect people than just letting them carry a gun on board of a plane.The government could even use armed passengers as a lame excuse after the next hijack; after all, the passengers could have handled the situation themselves...(sorry, this was not very argumentative).

Welcome back! Going to stick around for a while to debate the issues? I hope so. Let's see. How am I going to stop the employee. Hmmm...perhaps proper pre-employment screening, proper security screening for all airport employees as they come to work, random surveilance of airport employees, tougher penalties for those commiting such crimes...etc. There are many ways to do this.

Criminals in the past have resorted to taking the families of bank mangers hostage to rob banks. So even with all of your security measure in place the terrorist will do this. Or the terrorist will become employed by the airlines. Not all people in these extremist religious sects have criminal records. I bet you that is what you will do. You will copy the security procedures used around their nukes. The military has something called a no alone zone. That means no one allowed in these zones alone. Wait if this system worked for the military there would be no need for these people in these no alone zones to be armed. But these people are armed in no alone zones, I wonder why?

Often, people in no alone zones aren't armed. Instead, the area is covered by a series of remotely operated mini guns. This is just what we need at airports. Sensor operated mini guns in conjunction with proximity badges and metal detectors. Got a knitting needle in your purse? 1200 rounds of .40 will teach you.Of course, then you have to do somethign to watch the guy who runs the mini guns, so we get another guy to stand there next to hom with a gun to his head.

At what point do you accept that the government cannot protect you all the time and take responsibility for your own safety?

There is no way to stop it. With each increase in security measures that people like you demand, the terrorist will just change their tactics and go around them.

Sure were. Did people on these planes have firearms? No one knows. We do know that when guns were allowed on planes no one acted like a hero.

Terrorists did hijack aircraft depsite the fact that it was possible there were armed citizens aboard the aircraft. If there were armed people on the aircraft, they were cowardly gun toting people who despite the fact that they could have potentially intervened in a terrorist hijacking, they chose to sit in their seat and do nothing. My response:Comparing hijackings pre 9/11 and post 9/11 is pointless. Terrorism before 9/11 and after 9/11 have 2 distinctly different meanings. In pre 9/11 hijackings, planes were taken by armed passengers who either legally or illegally took guns on board aircraft, took the aircraft, then demanded to go to a non-extridition country such as Cuba, and held the passengers as hostages in order to achieve some sort of political goal. This happened fairly often...why do you think they banned guns on aircraft in the first place? 9/11 taught us that the new face of terrorism is something much more sinister and deserving of attention. This new breed of terrorist still desires for political change, however is willing to kill thousands of innocent people and themselves in the process. Arming the citizens on board aircraft has proven in the past not only to fail, but make it vastly easier for terrorists to carry lethal weapons on board airplanes and hijack aircraft. Why would we want to make the process any easier on them? I have little time or patience for people who repeatedly will criticize others for their possible solutions to such problems, but offer none of their own. As you recall, I did ask you if you had a solution, and you stated: "There is no way to stop it.With each increase in security measures that people like you demand, the terrorist will just change their tactics and go around them.

IMHO, your philosophy stinks of the anti-government type who supports only his own rights and ignores the negative consequences that they can have on society as a whole. They hide behind the 2nd ammendment of the constitution of a government and people they could care less about, all in the name of their own personal freedoms. The kind of people who will whine and complain about not being able to carry their guns at 30000 feet for no other reason than the government told them that they cannot, and they simply do not want the government to tell them what they may and may not do.

This is the only way you can respond to law-abiding Americans carrying guns!Why because you cannot defend your demands? Before 9/11 when law-abiding Americans were allowed to carry guns on planes how many people died during these hijackings? If you were capable of comprehending the concept of punishment, you would know the answer. You do not punish law-abiding citizens. You punish criminals or in the case of 9/11 the terrorist that waged war on America. Now you will claim the terrorist died that day along with unarmed law-abiding Americans. The terrorist countries and governments that planned, financed, and sent the terrorist are not gone.Why are terrorists starting to attack American targets now? Because people like you only want to compromise with terrorist countries. Your solution is to make targets more secure thus increasing the political advantage of attacking them. The terrorists get more political leverage for their efforts the harder it is to take a target. The terrorist experts stated they cannot prevent another 9/11. You must think you can, because all you want treat every law-abiding America as a terrorist! All in the name of attempting to prevent something that the terrorist experts stated we cannot prevent. You do nothing to the terrorist countries or governments that sent the terrorist to wage war on America! You will treat law-abiding Americans as terrorists!What are the negative consequences of being used as a flying bomb?

Actually, I think it was up until the late 1960's that people were allowed to carry guns on aircraft, not 9/10/01. Some people were killed in pre-9/11 hijackings, but again...it was not the same kind of terrorist. And regardless, it is obvious that allowing people to carry guns on aircraft did not stem the tide of hijackings. As you even mentioned yourself, we do not even know if anyone was carrying on any of those flights. As I pointed out, if there was, they certainly did not pull them out to challenge the terrorists. But it must be obvious...even to you, that the terrorists back then knew that people could carry on the flights, and it did not seem to stop them. If it is not going to stop those terrorists, how can anyone assume that it will stop suicidal terrorists who are bent on destruction and killing innocent Americans at any cost? I have never mentioned punishing law abiding citizens. And yes, I know who was responsible for 9/11...they are called terrorists, thank you for providing me with that astonishing piece of intelligence. I know they are not gone, I watch the news. I know that we, as well as many other nations remain targets and will be attacked in the future. I want to compromise with terrorist countries? Let me write that down. emoticonXWow You know very little about me to be able to make that kind of statement. You know little of my politics, nor little of my current feelings about the terrorists. I do not see how making a target more secure you are increasing "political leverage". What a rediculous term anyway. Terrorists seek the targets the provide the least risk of failure, and the greatest shock value to the American public. Taking a nuclear launch facility inside the US would be a highly valuable score for terrorists, and extremely hard to do. Do you honestly think the terrorists would attempt it? Not a chance. Terrorists seek soft targets where they can easily carry out their plans to kills many innocent civilians. And any "expert" that says we cannot prevent terrorist attacks needs to go back and study some more. We may not be able to prevent all of them, but looking back now at all the clues left leading up to 9/11, we see where we might have been able to step in. Of course, pre-9/11 terrorism was something that most Americans thought happened in the ME, Africa, and Northern Ireland. I never stated that I want to treat all Americans as terrorists, I don't know where you get your misinformation from. Personally, no, in the past 8 years I have not done anything to those countries. I support America's war on terrorism, I support the war in Iraq, and I think more needs to be done to seek out and destroy terrorists on a global scale. And again, how is it that I want to treat law abiding citizens as terrorists?

This is the only way you can respond to law-abiding Americans carrying guns!Why because you cannot defend your demands? Before 9/11 when law-abiding Americans were allowed to carry guns on planes how many people died during these hijackings? If you were capable of comprehending the concept of punishment, you would know the answer. You do not punish law-abiding citizens. You punish criminals or in the case of 9/11 the terrorist that waged war on America. Now you will claim the terrorist died that day along with unarmed law-abiding Americans. The terrorist countries and governments that planned, financed, and sent the terrorist are not gone.Why are terrorists starting to attack American targets now? Because people like you only want to compromise with terrorist countries. Your solution is to make targets more secure thus increasing the political advantage of attacking them. The terrorists get more political leverage for their efforts the harder it is to take a target. The terrorist experts stated they cannot prevent another 9/11. You must think you can, because all you want treat every law-abiding America as a terrorist! All in the name of attempting to prevent something that the terrorist experts stated we cannot prevent. You do nothing to the terrorist countries or governments that sent the terrorist to wage war on America! You will treat law-abiding Americans as terrorists!What are the negative consequences of being used as a flying bomb?

1958 brought us the first wide spread ban on posession of a handgun on airplanes. It was in response to the first attempted hijacking. The would be hijacker was shot by a passenger. There was a steady increase in hijackings after this. Between 1967 and 1972, there were over 150 hiackings.

Actually, I think it was up until the late 1960's that people were allowed to carry guns on aircraft, not 9/10/01. Some people were killed in pre-9/11 hijackings, but again...it was not the same kind of terrorist. And regardless, it is obvious that allowing people to carry guns on aircraft did not stem the tide of hijackings.

This is how you respond to gun owners when they do not act as you claim gun owners will. These people if they were on these airplanes acted responsible. Since they did not do as you claimed they would you have to attack them by calling them names.When your treat law-abiding citizens as potential terrorist it is punishing them. You know some what how the Nazis treated all people as suspects by asking for their papers.So are you demanded nuclear security at airports? Who is going to pay the bill for this? Come socialist last time you were asked this you said the airlines would pick up the cost of security. I guess in your economic logic is this is not passed on to the customer.

So let me sum up what you tried to say.1. There is no way to stop it. : Meaning- Terrorists will continue to try to attack us in the future, and there is nothing we can do to stop it...so do nothing.2. With each increase in security measures that people like you demand, the terrorist will just change their tactics and go around them. Resulting in tragic events like on 9/11. : Meaning- So in other words, the more roadblocks we put in front of terrorists, the more they will attack us. And these terrorist acts are also the fault of those who put these security measures in place. So do nothing, and the terrorists will just go away.3. Prior to the ban on carrying guns aboard planes there was no one acting like heros. Did planes get hijacked before the ban on carrying guns aboard planes? Sure were. Did people on these planes have firearms? No one knows. We do know that when guns were allowed on planes no one acted like a hero. :Meaning- Nobody jumped up and fought with the terrorists prior to guns being banned on aircraft...but then again, we don't even know if there were armed passengers on the aircraft. Terrorists did hijack aircraft depsite the fact that it was possible there were armed citizens aboard the aircraft. If there were armed people on the aircraft, they were cowardly gun toting people who despite the fact that they could have potentially intervened in a terrorist hijacking, they chose to sit in their seat and do nothing. My response:Comparing hijackings pre 9/11 and post 9/11 is pointless. Terrorism before 9/11 and after 9/11 have 2 distinctly different meanings. In pre 9/11 hijackings, planes were taken by armed passengers who either legally or illegally took guns on board aircraft, took the aircraft, then demanded to go to a non-extridition country such as Cuba, and held the passengers as hostages in order to achieve some sort of political goal. This happened fairly often...why do you think they banned guns on aircraft in the first place? 9/11 taught us that the new face of terrorism is something much more sinister and deserving of attention. This new breed of terrorist still desires for political change, however is willing to kill thousands of innocent people and themselves in the process. Arming the citizens on board aircraft has proven in the past not only to fail, but make it vastly easier for terrorists to carry lethal weapons on board airplanes and hijack aircraft. Why would we want to make the process any easier on them? I have little time or patience for people who repeatedly will criticize others for their possible solutions to such problems, but offer none of their own. As you recall, I did ask you if you had a solution, and you stated: "There is no way to stop it.With each increase in security measures that people like you demand, the terrorist will just change their tactics and go around them. Resulting in tragic events like on 9/11." Why don't you just state you real agenda and stop hiding inside you inane argument. IMHO, your philosophy stinks of the anti-government type who supports only his own rights and ignores the negative consequences that they can have on society as a whole. They hide behind the 2nd ammendment of the constitution of a government and people they could care less about, all in the name of their own personal freedoms. The kind of people who will whine and complain about not being able to carry their guns at 30000 feet for no other reason than the government told them that they cannot, and they simply do not want the government to tell them what they may and may not do.

And how exactly did I claim that gun owners would act? And by responsible, you mean that they kept their guns holstered and did not attempt to use them? Well, if so, I am confused. I thought you were claiming that responsible gun owners (those with training who were able to use a gun properly and accurately) would use their firearms to stop a hijacking? Isn't that why you think that everyone should be able to carry them on board? I am not attacking anyone, I am just pointing out that if there were armed citizens on board, and again, we do not know if there were, they did not use their guns. I am also pointing out that even though the terrorists were aware of the possibility of armed passengers, they still decided to hijack aircraft. It seems as if guns do not deter terrorism. In fact, it seems as if allowing people to carry guns on board aircraft made it easier for the terrorists to hijack them, as the terrorists in many cases just walked right on board with the guns. How is enforcing a gun free zone (ie...aircraft) treating people like terrorists? Remember that flying is a completely voluntary act, you do not have to get on the aircraft. So in other words, if you choose to get on the aircraft, you agree to follow the regulations that govern the operation of the aircraft. If you don't like those regulations, you are free to charter a private aircraft where you may carry as many guns as you wish. You make it seem as if flying on the airlines is something that you are forced to do. People know that when they purchase an airline ticket, they are not allowed to bring any prohibited items aboard the aircraft, ie..guns, knives...etc. Also, people know that they will be subject to search, and possible criminal charges if they attempt to violate the regulations. People buy their tickets voluntarily, get into the security line voluntarily, and get on the aircraft voluntarily. It is their choice to do so, and in such, they agree to play by the rules. I never demanded any such thing. I think we have the right idea when it comes to security screening at the airport, although they need to be a little more attentive, and perhaps get a little better scanning and detection equipment. And yes, the airlines should pick up the tab for the increased security measures, based on the number of passengers that particular airline places in the security lines at each airport. I myself am perfectly happy to pay a $3 fee for added security measures every time I fly, since I understand the value of such security. $3 is not going to break the bank, and if this fee were applied to every passenger, it would provide vast amounts of money for the added security measures. It also allows for the funding of the security measures to come from those people who benefit from them, instead of throwing the burden onto the taxpayers. In other words, only those who fly pay for it. And just remember, flying is voluntary, so if you don't like the fee, you can always take the bus.

No, you said this not me. I said they should be allowed the option. Now if this person did this, then that armed passenger observed the hijacking and responded accordingly. You attacked this person by calling them names. Even law enforcement has done this when they thought the use of firearms would not help resolve the hijacking.How do you purpose to check every passenger for weapons? When you treat law-abiding citizens as potential terrorist it is punishing them. You know some what how the Nazis treated all people as suspects by asking for their papers. It was a question. As for the price you quote that is what you stated the cost will be. Add in the added cost in time to passengers. The added cost of space required to preform these security measures. The added cost of maintenance of the security measures. Let us not forget that every time a person is thought to have been missed at any of the various check points the airports are shut down and every passenger is researched and check. Just how big of security perimeter do you want?

And I suppose you know of a machine that can tell the difference between a knife or gun and some other kind of metal that a person has on them? ie... belt buckles, metal soles in shoes, car keys, watches, jewelry, etc... Would you rather everyone just walk to the plane with no screening at all?

You are defending the security measures you demand that treat law-abiding passengers as terrorist not me. So you need to answer your own question.As pointed out there was the problem prior to the ban on people carrying guns on airplanes. People that had guns acted how you wanted them too. There were no gun battles on airplanes as you claimed. Yet you had to use degrading names to describe law-abiding citizens carrying guns.

No, I asked you: Would you rather no screening at all? You should know my opinion on this...I asked you. You can either answer it, or dodge it...your choice.How did I want them to act? I don't believe I have ever made the statement that I wanted people to carry guns on aircraft in the first place, so I certainly would not have expectations of those people. And if nobody used them, in any of the hijackings that took place...what is the point of having them? Remember, the fact that everyone was allowed to carry a gun on board made it easier for the terrorists to hijack the aircraft. Just like allowing people to carry a knife with up to a four inch blade made it easier for the terrorists on 9/11 to hijack the aircraft. They just walked right on with their legal weapons...and bam...3000 people dead. And what degrading names did I use? Are you talking about me saying that they were cowardly? Well, if they had guns, and could have prevented or stopped the hijacking in the process as you claim guns will, and did not use them, I would say that is a cowardly act.

I responded no.My reasoning would be that a law abiding citizen wouldn't need a gun or weapon aboard an airplane flight.If the gun or weapon was for personal protection,what would be the need for a weapon if no one else had one.In that case,I would say it could be checked with the luggage upon arrival at the airport,although I'm not fully aware of the laws concerning transportation of firearms.
