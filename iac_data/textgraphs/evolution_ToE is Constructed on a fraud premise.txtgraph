This post contains a perfectly simple explanation of why ToE is a sham along with a challenge to any Darwinist to prove me wrong.ToE is constructed on a fraud premise. This premise says that the fundamental unit of evolution is the gene. Whenever an evolutionist talks about “evolution” he’s not talking about mere phenotypic change – he’s talking about changes in genes. To a Darwinist, just because an animal changes phentoypically, or even if he passes these changes down to progeny does not mean that “evolution” has occurred. A fish could morph into a human, but if there are no changes in genes then this would not be considered "evolution." The only way evolution can happen, by their own definition, is if there is a change in genetics. This premise, I suggest is a complete and total fraud...and I will explain why now:Let’s take humans and dogs, for example. When compared side-by-side, sure enough, humans may have an assortment of genes that dogs do not – and possibly the other way around. But just because humans may have certain genes that dogs don't, does not mean that these genes cause the difference between humans and dogs. Of course, there are no “dog genes” or “human genes.” But likewise there are no “tongue genes,” “tail genes” or “toenail genes.” Parts are not translated genes. Thus, the assertion that new genes got created or that individual genes mutated over time to chnage one kind of animal into another is blatantly false and physically impossible.But it's worse than that.As I said before, humans have a whole slew of genes – theoretically, at least -- that dogs (or other animals) don’t have. But evolutionists still contend that these genetic differences cause the difference between the organisms! That’s why they analyze DNA with such scrutiny! But did it ever dawn on them that studying genetics is a compete waste of time because of the real possibility that each dog or each human has the genes they have because of what they are? Scientists have been telling us for decades that who or what we are is determined by what genes we have...But they’ve got it backwards! Instead, we have the genes we have because of who we are. A dog isn't a dog because he barks; a dog barks because of what he is. Same with genes.This, of course, spells destructin to ToE because it means genetic evolution is a fraud. Evolution, thus, should not be a theory based on changes in genes, but a theory based on changes in traits.But scientists continue to mess around with genes and try to make the body do weird things by mutating them. They simply won’t give up because they’ve seen correlations between gene activity and various physiological responses.But here’s where they’re screwing everything up:When you were a kid did you ever stand on your head? If so, did your face ever get red if you stayed upside down for a period of time? If so, do you admit that it was the act of being upside down that caused the blood to rush to your head? Or, do you have the audacity to claim that you were upside down because your face was red? That’s excactly what science is doing with genetics: they’ve got the audacity to claim that changes in genes (the red face) is causing the organsim to change physiologically (go upside down.) In reality, what’s happening is the organism is experiencing a new environment (turning upside down) and then the genes are responding in kind (turning red).The only way you can prove this logic wrong is to do one of two things:1) show me conclusively that mutations happen completely randomly and unoriented to environmental pressures. 2) show me that the same environmental pressures on genes will not produce the exact same physiological effects over and over and over.So there it is. Go for it.

you are sidestepping the issue: any trait that appears and gets passed on is not considered "evolution" unless there is a change of genes. For example, if a population of mice find and consume a new diet that their parents did not consume, it might reshape their jaws or teeth if they come upon this new diet early in life when their bones, teeth and jaws are moldable. As long as the diet remains available, future offspring will continue to sport these new jaws and teeth, which would be different (and beneficial) than their ancestors' jaws and teeth. But this is not "evolution" to you guys. Neither is it "evolution" if baby mice emerge with different coat colors based on what their mother ate. There is no changes in DNA, thus -- to you - no evolution. The reality is, nobody knows what the limits to biological change are without a change in genes. Gene expression goes along way. For example, every cell of your body contains the same sets of genes...but the genes in your kidneys are expressed differently than the genes in your brain. Same in different animals. Cats have the same basic eye gene that flys and other organisms do...the difference is in the way they are expressed. A change in expression is very often brought on by an interaction between the organism and it environment and has nothing to do with new genes or mutations....thus, once again -- no "evolution."But likewise there are no “tongue genes,” “tail genes” or “toenail genes.”Evidence?yea -- silence.Parts are not translated genesEvidence?yea -- silence.You say that as if studying genetics was a waste of time.it is. Changes in genes are not the cause of evolution any more than a key is the cause to starting your car. Starting your car takes an individual turning the key.

Life is unscientific and unexplainable. Just because there is no materialistic explanation of how animals change does not mean we have to resort to a false and failed explanation. The fact that science refuses to test purposeful, heritable variation in real, living organisms speaks volumes. The fact that all they care to do is bury their noses in genes and play dumb that each creature operates in the context of its ecological environment also speaks volumes. Science has absolutely no desire to learn how animals really change.

Nope. It's unexplained. Not inexplicable. You are appealing to a god of the gaps argument, as all Creationists do. You can't instantly explain something, you want your god to be responsible for it: Hey Presto! He is!Pull the other one, it has bells on. Sorry, but nothing in biology remotely supports any noodle-headed theory of Intelligent Design. Produce your "Intelligent Designer" so we can have a look at it.No current developments in biology refute Darwinian theory. They may add to it, they may extend it. They might even disprove this idea or that. They don't dissolve the core.You are going to have to come up with something better to get your god in the door.

This is an attempt to reason with a True believer. Never works.When these guys produce an individual of one species which evolves, without breeding or genetic change, into an individual of a totally different species, owing to a mere change in the environment, we can take the clowns seriously.

Hi It's Me: You say that as if studying genetics was a waste of time.it is. Changes in genes are not the cause of evolution any more than a key is the cause to starting your car. Starting your car takes an individual turning the key. The cause of evolution takes a "turning of the key" as well -- which is an internal or external environmental cue.I believe that the billions of hours scientists have spent studying genes will go down as mostly a colossal waste of time. The theory of evolution is changing, and instead of random actions of genes as the cause of evolution, it's the interaction of the organism with its environment. It seems everything coming out lately contradicts ToE...and what's really interesting is the stories written in media outlets are getting more and more bold with their anti-ToE comments.http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases...0509205719.htmThe research, by an international consortium led by the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, revises our understanding of genetic evolution. Scientists previously thought that evolution slowly changed the genes that create specific proteins. As the proteins changed, so did the creatures that owned them. The current research shows that opossum and human protein-coding genes have changed little since their ancestors parted ways, 180 million years ago. It has been the regulation of their genes - when they turn on and off - that has changed dramatically"The official textbook picture of how genes work really didn't appear to be right,

Clearly it doesn't happen by physical processes, electrochemical signals being transmitted through your brain and up and down your spine, mysterious Vital Forces from Beyong Space and Time make it happen.And as for people with spine damage or brain damage sometimes being unable to type?

what makes these signals happen?....what makes your fingers move intelligently across the keyboard?...oh, that's right, the process of thinking. There may be signals involved, but these are merely the physical responses from the onset of the act of thought...the signals themselves don't cause the thought...just like they don't cause typing on the keyboard.

same reason your cable company is not responsible for you seeing your favorite tv program if the actors from that show go on strike. (Let's say you like American Idol) Sure, you can't see Idol without a cable connection, but this connection is not the cause of you being able to watch Simon, Paula and Randy every week. (Those 3 have something to say about whether you get to see them or not) Likewise, signals in your brain telling your fingers to move are a requirement in order for it to happen, but they are not the cause of movement; they are merely the circuit which allows it to happen. Cut off the cable, no more Paula, Randy or Simon. Cut off the signals leading from your brain to your fingers, no more movement. But neither one are causes; they're each just mediums for one source to communicate with another, and they're each downstream of the cause.Same concept when you're talking on the phone with someone; the telephone line is not the cause of communication. The cause of communication is the dialog between 2 people; the telephone line is just the line of communication. Cut the line, no more communication -- but it does not eliminate the the source of the dialog -- which is the person on either end.

So you really do believe the laws of physics are violated in the brain, things happen which can't, or don't elsewhere outside of living organisms, with the same physical interactions occuring.That would be very interesting if it were true, but I would be very surprised if it was.

Well the premise you claim is not the core premise of evolution. Indeed Darwin never invoked genes at all. He did make the observation that some variability was clearly inherited (but not all variability), he also observed that some variants survived and reproduced better than others. From this he concluded that natural selection operated to change the heritable traits exhibited by populations, and extended this to resulting in large changes over long times. Changes sufficient to result in new species which were reproductively isolated or nearly so. To an actual Darwinist genes did not enter the theory at all - they were not known at the time except to an obscure Monk who published in a less than prominent journal!As to a fish morphing into a human without any genetic alterations .... Produce a case where that has happened and we can discuss it in depth. Till then I will claim that such a transformation cannot be accomplished without alteration of the underlying genome. I am most dubious that you have any such example at hand. emoticonXGood

This post contains a perfectly simple explanation of why ToE is a sham along with a challenge to any Darwinist to prove me wrong.ToE is constructed on a fraud premise. This premise says that the fundamental unit of evolution is the gene. Whenever an evolutionist talks about “evolution” he’s not talking about mere phenotypic change – he’s talking about changes in genes. To a Darwinist, just because an animal changes phentoypically, or even if he passes these changes down to progeny does not mean that “evolution” has occurred. A fish could morph into a human, but if there are no changes in genes then this would not be considered "evolution." The only way evolution can happen, by their own definition, is if there is a change in genetics. This premise, I suggest is a complete and total fraud...and I will explain why now:Let’s take humans and dogs, for example. When compared side-by-side, sure enough, humans may have an assortment of genes that dogs do not – and possibly the other way around. But just because humans may have certain genes that dogs don't, does not mean that these genes cause the difference between humans and dogs. Of course, there are no “dog genes” or “human genes.” But likewise there are no “tongue genes,” “tail genes” or “toenail genes.” Parts are not translated genes. Thus, the assertion that new genes got created or that individual genes mutated over time to chnage one kind of animal into another is blatantly false and physically impossible.But it's worse than that.As I said before, humans have a whole slew of genes – theoretically, at least -- that dogs (or other animals) don’t have. But evolutionists still contend that these genetic differences cause the difference between the organisms! That’s why they analyze DNA with such scrutiny! But did it ever dawn on them that studying genetics is a compete waste of time because of the real possibility that each dog or each human has the genes they have because of what they are? Scientists have been telling us for decades that who or what we are is determined by what genes we have...But they’ve got it backwards! Instead, we have the genes we have because of who we are. A dog isn't a dog because he barks; a dog barks because of what he is. Same with genes.This, of course, spells destructin to ToE because it means genetic evolution is a fraud. Evolution, thus, should not be a theory based on changes in genes, but a theory based on changes in traits.But scientists continue to mess around with genes and try to make the body do weird things by mutating them. They simply won’t give up because they’ve seen correlations between gene activity and various physiological responses.But here’s where they’re screwing everything up:When you were a kid did you ever stand on your head? If so, did your face ever get red if you stayed upside down for a period of time? If so, do you admit that it was the act of being upside down that caused the blood to rush to your head? Or, do you have the audacity to claim that you were upside down because your face was red? That’s excactly what science is doing with genetics: they’ve got the audacity to claim that changes in genes (the red face) is causing the organsim to change physiologically (go upside down.) In reality, what’s happening is the organism is experiencing a new environment (turning upside down) and then the genes are responding in kind (turning red).The only way you can prove this logic wrong is to do one of two things:1) show me conclusively that mutations happen completely randomly and unoriented to environmental pressures. 2) show me that the same environmental pressures on genes will not produce the exact same physiological effects over and over and over.So there it is. Go for it.

Superspot:]you are sidestepping the issue: any trait that appears and gets passed on is not considered "evolution" unless there is a change of genes. For example, if a population of mice find and consume a new diet that their parents did not consume, it might reshape their jaws or teeth if they come upon this new diet early in life when their bones, teeth and jaws are moldable. As long as the diet remains available, future offspring will continue to sport these new jaws and teeth, which would be different (and beneficial) than their ancestors' jaws and teeth. But this is not "evolution" to you guys.What a chuckle. Of course its not evolution. Its not even the creationists misplaced microevolution. Any more than the experiment of chopping tails off mice generation after generation resulted in evolution of a new species of mice without tails. As long as you chop of the tails every generation you have tailless mice. When you stop you will have mice with tails. No evolution has in fact occurred. No heritable traits have changed.

look...the fish thing was an exaggeration. My point was simply that all kinds of new, beneficial traits could emerge in a population, but evolutionists wouldn't call it "evolution" unless DNA was somehow involved. That's the only point I was making. And quite honestly, nobody knows how flexible each genome is because science refuses to test it.And the tail thing is a strawman. Nobody would claim that brutalizing an animal would lead to evolution. Instead, what a lamarckist would claim is that internal responses to environmental cues may be inherited.Weismann was a conman who propped up a giant strawman....and all of science fell for it.

That's the only point I was making. And quite honestly, nobody knows how flexible each genome is because science refuses to test it.Again if you have heritable traits which arose without a corresponding alteration of the genetic structure including of course epigenetics which is dependent itself upon genes for implementation.SSAnd the tail thing is a strawman. Nobody would claim that brutalizing an animal would lead to evolution. Instead, what a lamarckist would claim is that internal responses to environmental cues may be inherited.Nope its no more a strawman than your rodents were. An environmental variable results in an apparent phenotypic change, remove the change in the environment and the very next generation will have the same characteristics as their distant ancestors. There is no HERITABLE change involved so its not evolution. As to Lamarkists yes they claimed that animals "willed" their own evolutionary changes - the famous neck stretcher example. But their theory failed when tested against empirical experiment. And remember please that in your own example the rodents were in effect being brutalized by nature because of their bad diet!:)

lol...I posted on IIDB probably 9 months ago or more...even at that it was only for a couple weeks before the mods decided it was best that an mildly-informed creationist not be on that forum. It's probably been 6 months since I've posted on Christian forums. It's not like most everyone here posts on other forums as well. For me it's here and Carm. Join me there if you'd like.

It really isn't that suprising to me... Supersport has been spewing his regurgitated garbage and quote mines on countless boards - IIDB included (where I know him from - that and christianforums). It is perfectly logical that Chemist99a  has run into him on one of the many boars he spews on, and knows him from there.

No kidding!Well, if epigenetic change alone resulted in a stable new species that didn't hybridise with its parent species, then I think you'd find that biologists would call it evolution! And no, science is testing the flexibility of genomes, developmental biology is cutting edge science and has been since the DNA code was cracked. It's just that most genomes aren't all that flexible (and none of them are limitlessly flexible!) and have a limited repertoire of phenotypic changes they can accommodate.It may be that epigenetic changes alone might account for some examples of microevolution where there is diversification of subspecies within a species and hybridisation is still possible, but that's a long way from being confirmed. It isn't going to be able to account for macroevolution, where there are known and quantitated changes in the genome. For example, although chimp and human genomes are very similar (but not identical), no-one has seriously suggested that the distinct and stable phenotypes are solely the result of epigenetic changes. Instead, what has been postulated is that relatively minor changes in DNA sequence or arrangement can cause considerable alteration in the patterns of gene expression. Human and chimp genes that encode structural proteins are very similar, with almost the same genes present, but the genes and DNA sequences involved in controlling the timing and location of structural gene expression have subtle differences in sequence, number and position.This is still a story we're just at the beginning of, but there is nothing I can see in it so far that disproves Darwinian theory. No sign of lurking Lamarcks here!Well, when someone comes up with a mechanism for Lamarckian evolution, then biologists will accept it. I can't see one even on the horizon, not even in the new buzzword epigenetics.

Giraffes were actually created with long necks. I challenge you to show me any gradual change from some other short-necked animal to a long-necked giraffe. Longer-necked giraffes may come about through sexual selection.And the mechanism of biological change is the mind. The mind, at least in higher animals, is what senses the environment and triggers the nervous system to release hormones. We know hormones play a role in turning genes On or Off. There is no reason to disbelieve that the same hormones that turn genes On or Off in the organism can do the same thing to its developing embryo....thus, evolution.

Oh and Supersport, note that the argument here is not that evolution by epigenetic modification is in principle impossible, or that an organism couldn't in principle selectively induce particular mutations or epigenetic reprogramming of zygotes or embryos, it's that there is not a shred of evidence that this is what happens.And even if these speculations turned out to have factual bases, the offspring would still be subject to Darwinian selection!

Biologists are always open to that, but you need to do a lot more than theorise to get rid of old Charles Darwin. Find the evidence for these non-Darwinian mechanisms.

show me where the con artists in science have attempted to prove/disprove this notion -- they've had decades to do it...they've had decades to show without a shadow of a doubt that animals don't evolve epignetically -- they've had decades to construct real tests on real animals that could put an end to the mystery --- Oh, but that's right, science isn't interested in that because it's not "evolution." No it wouldn't. The logic behind darwinism is that organisms evolve new traits by way of natural selection -- that variation does not reside from within each individual -- that selection is the creative element. But if the organism itself is the evolvable unit, that's where the creativity lies, not selection. Nice try. strawman -- nobody says that.wrong -- for the reason I just gave. You have constructed a little intellectual fairytale around yourself that says no matter what happens "I win, you lose." But if variation is biased from within each creature, it means individuals evolve, that each one is the creative force in evolution, and selection plays no role other than stablizing the population.

The answer is still the same. That isn't "evolution", it's development. Evolution is about the origin of heritable traits. Mere environmentally induced alterations in developmental pathways aren't usually heritable. For example, if a child has an alcoholic mother or is nutritionally deprived during her pregnancy, then developmental pathways may be altered such that the child is born with congenital mental deficiencies. However, that does not mean that child will then go on to have abnormal children -- provided those same environmental conditions aren't replicated. Unless you mean to call such developmental effects "evolution", which no biologist would do, I don't see what the relevance to evolution is. Development and evolution are not the same.When you figure out a mechanism for how hormone-controlled development can generate permanent changes in somatic and germ cells that result in a new species different from the ancestral one, then you'll have an alternative mechanism for variation besides random mutation.Produce the evidence. Or do you not bother to reply to scientists who know something about this field any more?

You don't alter genes just by changing the environment -- you have to have mutation as well. Mutation is essential for evolution to work at all -- this is not speculation, but established fact. Epigenetic control is also important, especially in development, but it cannot by itself account for evolution. If it did, then every organism would have the identical genome. We know that isn't true. There is no known mechanism for the heritability of epigenetic changes. Also, there are plenty of known examples of epigenetic changes which are not in themselves heritable. So far as anyone knows, epigenetics are responsible only for the details of development, in response to the environment. They do not, as a rule, establish traits that are heritable. Children can be born with congenital disabilities as a result of the intrauterine environment, but that doesn't mean their children will inherit the same problems.For evolution, you need more change to the genome than just some epigentic decorations.Sorry, but it's an empirically determined FACT that mutational changes in genes cause heritable changes in phenotype, while epigenetic changes usually do not.

what rock are you hiding under to say that epigenetic inheritance does not exist? Why should anyone believe a word you say when you can't even get the basics right?http://www.chem.ucsb.edu/coursepages...c_concepts.pdfABSTRACT: We discuss the changing use of epigenetics, a term coined byConrad Waddington in the 1940s, and how the epigenetic approach to developmentdiffers from the genetic approach. Originally, epigenetics referredto the study of the way genes and their products bring thephenotype into being. Today, it is primarily concerned with the mechanismsthrough which cells become committed to a particular form or functionand through which that functional or structural state is thentransmitted in cell lineages. We argue that modern epigenetics is importantnot only because it has practical significance for medicine, agriculture, andspecies conservation, but also because it has implications for the way inwhich we should view heredity and evolution. In particular, recognizingthat there are epigenetic inheritance systems through which non-DNAvariations can be transmitted in cell and organismal lineages broadens theconcept of heredity and challenges the widely accepted gene-centered neo-Darwinian version of Darwinism.https://notes.utk.edu/Bio/greenberg....5?OpenDocumentBecause a genome can pick up or shed a methyl group much more readily than it can change its DNA sequence, Jirtle says epigenetic inheritance provides a "rapid mechanism by which [an organism] can respond to the environment without having to change its hardware." Epigenetic patterns are so sensitive to environmental change that, in the case of the agouti mice, they can dramatically and heritably alter a phenotype in a single generation. If you liken the genome to the hardware of a computer, Jirtle explains, then "epigenetics is the software. It's the grey area. It's just so darn beautiful if you think about it." The environmental lability of epigenetic inheritance may not necessarily bring to mind Lamarckian images of giraffes stretching their necks to reach the treetops (and then giving birth to progeny with similarly stretched necks), but it does give researchers reason to reconsider long-refuted notions about the inheritance of acquired characteristics.

This only confirms my prior opinon.And to your 2nd paragraph, obviously I recognize that plants don't have minds....which is why I put the disclaimer in "at least in higher animals." Plants are not made like higher animals are and they have different sensory mechanisms.And yet you can make the absurd claim - knowing that minds are not universal among organisms that:And the mechanism of biological change is the mind.When you should have said one instead.You then go on with a postulate which has virtually no evidence in support.The mind, at least in higher animals, is what senses the environment and triggers the nervous system to release hormones.In actuality the triggering of hormones is not done by mind its done (in some cases) by the nervous system and in other cases by other endocrine glands without intervention of the nervous system. Hormone secretion is far from being under voluntary control.We know hormones play a role in turning genes On or Off.Do we really? Can you provide specific examples of what hormones you are talking about and what genes they are known to turn on or off? That would add considerably to the strength of your argument. And then if those hormones are under control of the mind you will be even further along. For example is human growth hormone released (or inhibited) under voluntary control of human intelligence and thought? If not what does control its production and release?There is no reason to disbelieve that the same hormones that turn genes On or Off in the organism can do the same thing to its developing embryo....thus, evolution.Only if the turning of genes on or off by the hormones is heritable across multiple generations. If you really believe this to be an argument you can sustain then you need at least a few demonstrable examples. For example find a hormone which is under voluntary mental control which causes a known gene or gene to be turned on or off in a developing embryo (and subsequently in the adult offspring) and then find evidence that this change will persist beyond that offspring into future generations.Frankly you have a very long path to tread to reach the end of that demonstration. If you cannot complete the chain your argument is very very questionable on other grounds. The issue is whether or not you can back up your bald-faced assertions with real data which is relevant to your claim. Thus far I see absolutely no evidence that you can do so. Of course I can always be wrong and I am more than willing to be proven incorrect.

And sinces changes in genes are not the cause of change, genetic evolution by natural selection is a fraud....the only alternative is special creation.I see you are trying to develop a scientific cover for creationism. Good luck. Unfortunately you have a problem here. These days we can alter the genes in an organism in a deliberate way and demonstrate a linkage between that alteration and the subsequent changes in the organism. We can also silence a gene and show a corresponding change in the organism. There are a vast array of lines of evidence that genes and changes in genes do CAUSE changes in organisms and that changes in organisms do not cause in very many cases changes in the genes.

your first link to TO is worthless. Your second link verifies my prediction that sexual selection may have something to do with it.You can get an explanation why different animals have different genomes by referring to my OP. You have a different fingerprint than your wife or kids, don't you? If so, is it that fingerprint that causes you to be a different person? Or, are you a different person, which makes your fingerprints different? Same concept with genes. Evolutionists have gotten this whole concept backwards. Genes are not the cause of differences -- just a result of differences. This is why when animals change the actions of genes have a way of accompanying this change -- which is simply a memory device that makes the change heritable.And sinces changes in genes are not the cause of change, genetic evolution by natural selection is a fraud....the only alternative is special creation.

I quote from SSs excerpt from the literature.In particular, recognizingthat there are epigenetic inheritance systems through which non-DNAvariations can be transmitted in cell and organismal lineages broadens theconcept of heredity and challenges the widely accepted gene-centered neo-Darwinian version of Darwinism.First of all methylation patterns are like it or not changes in DNA. They are NOT non-DNA variations in any real sense of the word. The altered DNA has a different structure than the original DNA does and where this change is inherited its conceptually at least "gene-centered". Given that rather simple perspective then any heritability observed can (if its persistent) enter into the standard NDS context. Of course bear in mind my perspective is that of a chemist. I can see that its useful to separate out methylation patterns from main line genetics and for that purpose to consider alterations of certain bases by methylaltion to NOT be changes in the base sequence - since such changes are labile biochemically.The problem you have Supersport is that you want to make epigenetic mechanisms the SOLE pathway for variability and this just ain't so. Its one pathway to some degree of phenotypic variation, and in some cases it may even enter the process of evolution (if its persistently inherited) but the evidence for genetic inheritance via DNA is absolutely overwhelming. To support your argument you have to falsify all of that known mechanism. This I do not think you will manage to do.

Your second link verifies my prediction that sexual selection may have something to do with it.Sorry but the first link is in fact verified by the reference to Stevens in the second link. Neither link is worthless. And if you wish to postulate sexual selection as having something to do with it you are accepting genes as the controlling codes although you do not appear to realize this. You have a different fingerprint than your wife or kids, don't you? If so, is it that fingerprint that causes you to be a different person?Fingerprints develop during embryogenisis and are at best partially heritable but only in very general terms. In addition they are NOT an active store of information like genes. They are effects not causes.Or, are you a different person, which makes your fingerprints different?Its not about personhood its about heritability - heritability being one of the core requirements for evolution.Same concept with genes. Evolutionists have gotten this whole concept backwards. Genes are not the cause of differences -- just a result of differences. This is why when animals change the actions of genes have a way of accompanying this change -- which is simply a memory device that makes the change heritable.If so you will be hard pressed to explain why an elephant usually gives birth to another elephant instead of a baboon or an oak tree. In addition given the specific knowledge of the molecular biology of inheritance and the means by which genes are duplicated during reproduction etc you are not just out on a limb here you are like Wiley coyote running off the edge of a cliff. You have just not as of yet looked down and crashed. Please look down and get it over with. And sinces changes in genes are not the cause of change, genetic evolution by natural selection is a fraud....the only alternative is special creation.I see you are trying to develop a scientific cover for creationism. Good luck. Unfortunately you have a problem here. These days we can alter the genes in an organism in a deliberate way and demonstrate a linkage between that alteration and the subsequent changes in the organism. We can also silence a gene and show a corresponding change in the organism. There are a vast array of lines of evidence that genes and changes in genes do CAUSE changes in organisms and that changes in organisms do not cause in very many cases changes in the genes. This falsifies your core argument that genes do not have a causal relataionship to the structure and functions of organisms. emoticonXKill

No I don't. I'm open to the concept of organisms exchanging genes horizontally in some cases. I'm also open to the concept of nonrandom mutations. The main source of variation however, would actually be the environment working in concert with the developing embryo, which can produce new, heritable traits by turning genes on or off. It's been ignored for decades.

The evidence however is that other mechanisms than epigenetic ones are "the main source". Those mechanisms for generating heritable variation are all based on genes and even epigenetic mechanisms are based on genes!

Every study of any trait which has been shown to be inherited via genes constitutes evidence. Since there are literally thousands upon thousand of these you will have to find your own examples in the literature. But you can start with things like sickle cell trait, hemophilia, polydactly, Huntingtons disease, the various genetic forms of Muscular Dystrophy, seed shattering in wild rice, rust resistance in wheat, sensitivity of chloroplasts to tentoxin, sensitivity to victoria blight, and of course human tasters and non-tasters of specific substnces.

Tell me, do you ever actually, you know, read what I post? I said that epigenetic changes are usually not heritable. I didn't say such inheritance was either impossible or didn't exist. However, I am unaware that they have been implicated in speciation. I know of no studies that suggest this, merely studies that suggest that in a small handful of cases known so far, limited information about dealing with an environment can be passed on to offspring epigenetically, and persist for a few generations. There is nothing in Darwinian theory that is contradicted by that, because as I've explained, it's independent of the means of passing information from one generation to another. Darwin didn't even know what a gene was, he just assumed that information had to pass from one generation to another, by means as then undiscovered. The important feature of Darwinian theory is variance, selection and inheritance. If some of it is epigenetic rather than genetic, it doesn't alter that aspect at all, it merely says that genes alone aren't sufficient to store all relevant information, which biologists have long known -- they just hadn't understood until the last couple of decades how gene expression was controlled. Nothing contra-Darwinian there.If you know that it has been implicated in speciation, which is what Darwinian evolutionary theory deals with, let me know, with examples. Even if there are a few such examples, they would not refute evolution by natural selection, or by genetic mutation. They would be an additional feature.*shrug* I just don't see what you and our lagomorph are getting all excited about.

what rock are you hiding under to say that epigenetic inheritance does not exist? Why should anyone believe a word you say when you can't even get the basics right?http://www.chem.ucsb.edu/coursepages...c_concepts.pdfABSTRACT: We discuss the changing use of epigenetics, a term coined byConrad Waddington in the 1940s, and how the epigenetic approach to developmentdiffers from the genetic approach. Originally, epigenetics referredto the study of the way genes and their products bring thephenotype into being. Today, it is primarily concerned with the mechanismsthrough which cells become committed to a particular form or functionand through which that functional or structural state is thentransmitted in cell lineages. We argue that modern epigenetics is importantnot only because it has practical significance for medicine, agriculture, andspecies conservation, but also because it has implications for the way inwhich we should view heredity and evolution. In particular, recognizingthat there are epigenetic inheritance systems through which non-DNAvariations can be transmitted in cell and organismal lineages broadens theconcept of heredity and challenges the widely accepted gene-centered neo-Darwinian version of Darwinism.https://notes.utk.edu/Bio/greenberg....5?OpenDocumentBecause a genome can pick up or shed a methyl group much more readily than it can change its DNA sequence, Jirtle says epigenetic inheritance provides a "rapid mechanism by which [an organism] can respond to the environment without having to change its hardware." Epigenetic patterns are so sensitive to environmental change that, in the case of the agouti mice, they can dramatically and heritably alter a phenotype in a single generation. If you liken the genome to the hardware of a computer, Jirtle explains, then "epigenetics is the software. It's the grey area. It's just so darn beautiful if you think about it." The environmental lability of epigenetic inheritance may not necessarily bring to mind Lamarckian images of giraffes stretching their necks to reach the treetops (and then giving birth to progeny with similarly stretched necks), but it does give researchers reason to reconsider long-refuted notions about the inheritance of acquired characteristics.

no it doesn't. It's only evidence if the genes mutated randomly, then creating a new trait or body part. I'll ask again -- show me your evidence. You would also have to show that the genetic mutation is the cause of disease or a trait, as opposed to merely correlated to it.And it's funny how, when I asked you for evidence of evolution, you give me a bunch of diseases that do nothing but degenerate and or cause destruction. You call that evolution? I call that devlolution. And just because you don't know why a gene would mutate or why a disease would form such as huntington's disease, does not mean there wasn't a cause for it. The cause may not have been identified, but that does not mean one doesn't exist.Please tell me -- do you believe mutations create new body parts? If so, how...and give evidence. If not....how can you keep believing in ToE? Also explain to me how you can believe in ToE when it is known that genes do not translate into body parts....how removing large sections of the genome often result in little or no change in phenotype? If genes were so important in creating specific morphology how is it that mice and humans share 99% of genes?

Also, there are plenty of known examples of epigenetic changes which are not in themselves heritable. So far as anyone knows, epigenetics are responsible only for the details of development, in response to the environment. They do not, as a rule, establish traits that are heritable.

The implication is certainly there that epigenetic changes are not heritable. The word "usually" destroys darwinism -- which is a thoery of mutating genes causing new traits. But if mutating genes don't cause traits then there's nothing to select! And if traits "usually" go through selection, then that means there are beneficial traits that don't go through selection. If that is the case, you will have to fight it out with Dawkins and E.O. Wilson who say all beneficial traits go through selection. So who's wrong -- you or them?

Darwin didn't even know what genes were, ergo his theory did not specify that heritable changes must be genetic.Mutating genes do cause changes in traits... and you have provided no argument they do not.And if other, non-genetic changes are heritable, clearly there is something to select, those very non-genetic heritable changes.So I don't follow what kind of argument you are trying to make, there is no logic here, and it appears you are being drawn to conclusions by some kind of religious sentiment.

Whether that change is random or not is equivalent to asking if the number 3 is random.] I'll ask again -- show me your evidence. You would also have to show that the genetic mutation is the cause of disease or a trait, as opposed to merely correlated to it.OK then sickle cell trait is quite precisely known as such a situation. If a gene which is transcribed to make hemoblobin is mutated in a specific way the resulting hemoglobin is defective and as a result one gets distortions in the shape of red blood cells. There is a clear path of causation all the way to the bottom.

The implication is certainly there that epigenetic changes are not heritable.Usually means usually some case of epigenetic inheritance for a couple of generations are known. Its no big deal and it does no damage to Darwinism whatsoever. See below.The word "usually" destroys darwinism -- which is a thoery of mutating genes causing new traits.Nope the presense of a secondary system of inheritance does not destroy Darwinism. Any source of heritable variability will suffice to drive Darwinist evolution. This includes epigenetic effects. But if mutating genes don't cause traits then there's nothing to select!Causality can and often is mulatiple. Genes DO cause traits acting either alone or in combination with other genes. This is provably so. Epigenetic effects can cause traits also. Both CAN lead to variability. That epigenetics exists and may sometimes generate heritable traits DOES not imply that genes do not exist and do not generate heritable traits.And if traits "usually" go through selection, then that means there are beneficial traits that don't go through selection.Nope all heritable traits DO go through selection since to be heritable requires that multiple generations be involved. Unless you propose that all variants survive and reproduce equally (have equal fittness) then every variant is subject to selection no matter the source of the variability.If that is the case, you will have to fight it out with Dawkins and E.O. Wilson who say all beneficial traits go through selection. So who's wrong -- you or them?In this case Dawkins, Wilson, and I are correct, you are wrong. Its a very simple determination.:)

This post contains a perfectly simple explanation of why ToE is a sham along with a challenge to any Darwinist to prove me wrong.ToE is constructed on a fraud premise. This premise says that the fundamental unit of evolution is the gene. Whenever an evolutionist talks about “evolution” he’s not talking about mere phenotypic change – he’s talking about changes in genes. To a Darwinist, just because an animal changes phentoypically, or even if he passes these changes down to progeny does not mean that “evolution” has occurred. A fish could morph into a human, but if there are no changes in genes then this would not be considered "evolution." The only way evolution can happen, by their own definition, is if there is a change in genetics. This premise, I suggest is a complete and total fraud...and I will explain why now:Let’s take humans and dogs, for example. When compared side-by-side, sure enough, humans may have an assortment of genes that dogs do not – and possibly the other way around. But just because humans may have certain genes that dogs don't, does not mean that these genes cause the difference between humans and dogs. Of course, there are no “dog genes” or “human genes.” But likewise there are no “tongue genes,” “tail genes” or “toenail genes.” Parts are not translated genes. Thus, the assertion that new genes got created or that individual genes mutated over time to chnage one kind of animal into another is blatantly false and physically impossible.But it's worse than that.As I said before, humans have a whole slew of genes – theoretically, at least -- that dogs (or other animals) don’t have. But evolutionists still contend that these genetic differences cause the difference between the organisms! That’s why they analyze DNA with such scrutiny! But did it ever dawn on them that studying genetics is a compete waste of time because of the real possibility that each dog or each human has the genes they have because of what they are? Scientists have been telling us for decades that who or what we are is determined by what genes we have...But they’ve got it backwards! Instead, we have the genes we have because of who we are. A dog isn't a dog because he barks; a dog barks because of what he is. Same with genes.This, of course, spells destructin to ToE because it means genetic evolution is a fraud. Evolution, thus, should not be a theory based on changes in genes, but a theory based on changes in traits.But scientists continue to mess around with genes and try to make the body do weird things by mutating them. They simply won’t give up because they’ve seen correlations between gene activity and various physiological responses.But here’s where they’re screwing everything up:When you were a kid did you ever stand on your head? If so, did your face ever get red if you stayed upside down for a period of time? If so, do you admit that it was the act of being upside down that caused the blood to rush to your head? Or, do you have the audacity to claim that you were upside down because your face was red? That’s excactly what science is doing with genetics: they’ve got the audacity to claim that changes in genes (the red face) is causing the organsim to change physiologically (go upside down.) In reality, what’s happening is the organism is experiencing a new environment (turning upside down) and then the genes are responding in kind (turning red).The only way you can prove this logic wrong is to do one of two things:1) show me conclusively that mutations happen completely randomly and unoriented to environmental pressures. 2) show me that the same environmental pressures on genes will not produce the exact same physiological effects over and over and over.So there it is. Go for it.

So what this guy is saying is that he believes in natural selection but not evolution?Nope he does not believe in natural selection either. He believes that genes (and epigenetics) are the product of direct intelligent modification by the species which is evolving. He believes in what one has to call intelligent vitalism. Basiclly Lamarckism with some bells and whistles.In fact he is simply an anti-evolutionist and probably a creationist at heart. Do not expect cogent scientific argument from his direction.

Sorry, dear, but it doesn't destroy Darwinian thinking -- for all I know, it destroys the "Darwinism" of your invention, but then, that never had anything to do with Darwinian theory, it was just a construct of your own imagination.Epigenetic changes are usually not heritable.

depends on what you mean by "evolutionist." If you mean simply change over time, then I guess I'm an evolutionist. I do however, believe the world was created rather recently.I also believe that genetic activity is the purposeful result of an interaction between the organism and the environment -- it is not the result of happy randomness, as the neo-darwinists explanation goes. And since purposeful genetic activity resides from within each individual, it eliminates any creative role for natural selection -- which thus -- merely acts to stablize the population. Ultimately this means individuals evolve, not populations, which contradicts the basic premise of ToE.edit: I also believe epignetic activity precedes genetic mutations, thereby making most mutations nonrandom.

mind providing examples of these delusions? And no, archaeology is the study of historic or prehistoric peoples - and that, my friend goes back well beyond any literalist interpretations of the bible.However, you did bring up what I missed, although you assumed I meant it by archeology. That would be - paleontology (and paleoboatany, etc.) And sorry, but all of them explicitly support the FACT of evolution, and most of them seem to be adequately explained so far by the THEORY of evolution by Random Mutation and Natural Selection.

What would align the vectors in such a case? How would the bias arise and even more difficult how would it be maintained. Not to mention where would the knowledge necessary to align the vectors be obtained? Variation MIGHT be biased in that way, but if it were it would become less so rapidly and there are no known mechanisms to link the fitness landscape to such a bias should it exist. On the other hand its very clear that selection provides a means of "biasing" the direction of change.
attacks

Highly unlikely. How would an organism know how to bias variation, be it genetic or epigenetic, in any direction? It's clairvoyant? All it knows is its present environment, so the most it could do is attempt to suppress variation away from its local optimum. And how could it "know" what additional variation might be "better" for its local environment? These are the sort of questions it's incumbent on you to answer.An organism might make a local adaptation to an environment purely through an epigenetic change, and if, somehow, it could also fix that change in its germ cells so its progeny came epigenetically pre-adapted to deal with the same environment, then it would have a step up through natural selection on its competitors that were not able to make such epigenetic adaptations. Suppose, however, the organism guessed wrong, and the pre-adaptation wasn't successful because the environment had changed? Well, natural selection would dispose of its progeny. It's all pretty Darwinian from where I sit. You see, in Darwinian theory, if you replace "genetic" with "epigenetic" when talking about heritable traits, you don't really see much difference, because you still have the same vary-select-inherit condition.But I don't see how organisms could predict future environments to drive their progeny in the appropriate direction, genetically or epigenetically -- unless you are proposing they have evolved some sort of Tardis gene that allows them to look into the future. How, for example, does a swimming vertebrate "know" it's a good idea to drive its progeny in the direction of developing walking limbs rather than fish fins? It makes no sense. So if you have some mechanism, show us some evidence for it.

However scientists can take note of the fact that there is no positive evidence for the idea. In any case science cannot adopt a theistic explanation for any natural process - its simply against the core scientific philosophy to do so.He is free to believe as he chooses, but he is not free to claim that his belief is science based when in fact it invokes a deity of some sort directly or indirectly. When he claims to be scientific then he has enetered the domain of science and his beliefs and claims become fair game for scientific analysis and even falsification.

Interesting isn't it that you speak of uncovering the truth and then go on to tell us what that truth IS. Implies that you KNOW the truth already. How so one must ask. Revelation perhaps.As to testing for randomness of mutation how would you propose to do so. Where relevant studies have been made in organisms with a sufficiently short reproductive cycle the assumption of randomness has held up statistically. Where specific point mutations have been studied the rates of mutaion seem to confirm a random pattern. Even environmentally induced mutation appears to be random - as in radiation damage, chemical mutagenesis, and so forth.Now if you have a specific system in mind - in other words a test species and a set of traits which have high heritability then propose the relevant experiment in a workable system. Otherwise you should sit in a corner and remain silent while the working scientists proceed to answer the problems which really are of concern.

Not natural selection alone, but selection against a background of heritable variability. Absent variability selection cannot function as it has nothing to select. Evolution leads to capture of information in the sense that fitness of phenotypes MAY be increased. Its very much like a random or pseurandom search for a minimum value on a sum of squares regression surface, but of course a maximum search rather than a minimum. As long as one or more of the candidate variants allow for "uphill" movement some progress is possible via adaptation. And yes it should sound familiar. The demise of evolution has been asserted by creationists (and IDsts) many many times in the past. All wishful thinking so far and as of yet there is no scientific falsification of the core concepts.

Gould:The essence of Darwinism lies in a single phrase: natural selection is the major creative force of evolutionary change. No one denies that natural selection will play a negative role in eliminating the unfit. Darwinian theories require that it create the fit as well. Selection must do this by building adaptations in a series of steps, preserving at each stage the advantageous part in a random spectrum of genetic variability. Selection must superintend the process of creation, not just toss out the misfits after some other force suddenly produces a new species, fully formed and pristine perfection. The Panda's Thumb. Pg 190.Lesz: please notice the word random in there. I rest my case; nonrandom variation cancels out the creative role of selection.

Lesz: please notice the word random in there. I rest my case; nonrandom variation cancels out the creative role of selection.Nope it does no such thing. You have yet to define non-random relevant to the optimized change vector. Selection can increase fitness even if non-random changes are biased in a direction well away from the optimum change vector. Indeed the statistical angle between the population change vector and the optimum vector can exceed 90 degrees and selection will still allow for change in gene frequencies after selection to be within 90 degrees of the optimum vector.That mutations might be non-random (ie not equally probable in all directions from the population means) does not imply that such non-randomness is in any way representative of changes which will increase fitness. To show what you are claiming you wil need to demonstrate that the bias you propose IS such that without selection the population will increase in fitness. This you have failed utterly to do. Indeed I know of no studies in which such an effect has been observed. Many biologists in the past believed that mutations were in general biased in the opposite way - ie that most or many were detrimental. Thats not the consensus these days as I understand it. Les may know more than I on this subject. In any case the strict randomness of mutation has nothing of significant bearing on what Gould was discussingThe fact remiains is that the only known process which can direct genetic change toward the binding of additional or more accurate information about environments is selection of heritable changes.Frankly your proposed bias as a substitute for natural selection is a non-starter of a concept unless you have substantive evidence that when the environment changes, and without selection steps, then the pattern of mutation changes so as to provide improvements in fitness under a variety of circumstances. Good luck.

lol....oh, so now your defense has sunk to the level of "defining non-random." You are one funny dude. You are no different than all the other darwinists who who try to use word games as a defense because that's all you have.The reality is nonrandom variation undermines selection. I think Gould probably knows better than you do.Gould:The central logic of Darwinism requires that natural selection not merely operate, but that it be the creative force of evolutionary change. Selection wins its role as a creative force because the other component of evolutionary mechanics — the forces that pro-duce the raw material of genetic variation — are random, in the special sense of “not inherently directed toward adaptation.” That is, if local environments change and smaller organisms are now at an advantage, genetic variation does not produce more small individuals, thus imparting a direction to evolutionary change from the level of variation itself. Variation continues to occur“at random,” in a broad spectrum about the average size. Selection must impart direction — and be the creative force of evolution — by differentially preserving those random variants yielding smaller than average phenotypes.http://home.wxs.nl/~gkorthof/korthof63.htmDarwin's theory ... cannot be equated with the simple claim that natural selection operates. Nearly all his colleagues and predecessors accepted this postulate. Darwin, in his characteristic and radical way, grasped that this standard mechanism for preserving the type could be inverted, and then converted into the primary cause of evolutionary change. Natural selection obviously lies at the center of Darwin's theory, but we must recognize, as Darwin's second key postulate, that claim that natural selection acts as the creative force of evolutionary change. The essence of Darwinism cannot reside in the mere observation that natural selection operates -- for everyone had long accepted a negative role for natural selection in eliminating the unfit and preserving the type. (Gould 2002: 139) (....) We have lost this context and distinction today, and our current perspective often hampers an understanding of the late 19th century literature and its preoccupations. Anyone who has read deeply in this literature knows that no argument inspired more discussion, while no Darwinian claim seemed more vulnerable to critics, than the proposition that natural selection should be viewed as a positive force, and therefore as the primary cause of evolutionary change. The "creativity of natural selection" -- the phrase generally used in Darwin's time as a shorthand description of the problem -- set the cardinal subject for debate about evolutionary mechanisms during Darwin's lifetime and throughout the late 19th century. [It is poised to once again become the central question due to the amazing scientific discoveries taking place in evo-devo.] (Gould 2002: 139) Non-Darwinian evolutionists did not deny the reality, or the operationality, of natural selection as a genuine cause stated in the most basic or abstract manner. (....) They held, rather, that natural selection, as a headsman or executioner, could only eliminate the unfit, while some other cause must play the positive role of constructing the fit. (Gould 2002: 139) (....) We can understand the trouble that Darwin's contemporaries experienced in comprehending how selection could work as a creative force when we confront the central paradox of Darwin's crucial argument: natural selection makes nothing; it can only choose among variants originating by other means. How then can selection possibly be conceived as a "progressive," or "creative," or "positive" force? (Gould 2002: 140) The Requirements for Variation In order to act as raw material only, variation must walk a tightrope between two unacceptable alternatives. first and foremost, variation must exist in sufficient amounts, for natural selection can make nothing, and must rely upon bounty thus provided; but variation must not be too florid or showy either, lest it become the creative agent of change itself. Variation, in short, must be copious, small in extent, and undirected. A full taxonomy of non-Darwinian evolutionary theories may be elaborated by their denials of one or more of these central assumptions. (Gould 2002: 141) COPIOUS. Since natural selection makes nothing and can only work with raw material presented to its stringent review, variation must be generated in copious and dependable amounts.... Darwin's scenario for selective modification always includes the postulate, usually stated explicitly, that all structures vary, and therefore evolve.... If these universally recognized distinctions arise as consequences of differences in the intrinsic capacity of species to vary, then Darwin's key postulate of copiousness would be compromised -- for failure of sufficient raw material would then be setting a primary limit upon the rate and style of evolutionary change, and selection would not occupy the driver's seat. (Gould 2002: 141-142) Darwin responds by denying this interpretation, and arguing that differing intensities of selection, rather than intrinsically distinct capacities for variation, generally cause the greater or lesser differentiation observed among domestic species. I regard this argument as among the most forced and uncomfortable in the Origin -- a rare example of Darwinian special pleading. But Darwin realizes the centrality of copiousness to his argument for the creativity of natural selection, and he must therefore face the issue directly: Although I do not doubt that some domestic animals vary less than others, yet the rarity or absence of distinct breeds for the cat, the donkey, peacock, goose, etc., may be attributed in main part to selection not having been brought into play: in cats, from the difficulty in pairing them; in donkeys, from only a few being kept by poor people and little attention paid to their breeding; in peacocks, from not being very easily reared and a large stock not kept; in geese, from being valuable only for two purposes, food and feathers, and more especially from no pleasure having been felt the display of distinct breeds (p. 42). Second, copiousness must also be asserted in the face of a powerful argument about limits to variation following modal departure from "type." To use Fleeming Jenkin's (1867) famous analogy: a species may be compared to a rigid sphere, with modal morphology of individuals at the center, and limits to variation defined by the surface. So long as individuals lie near the center, variation will be copious in all directions [isotropic; non-directional]. But if selection brings the mode to the surface, then further variation in the same direction will cease -- and evolution will be stymied by an intrinsic limitation upon raw material, even when selection would favor further movement. Evolution, in other words, might consume its own fuel and bring itself to an eventual halt thereby. This potential refutation stood out as especially serious -- not only for threatening the creativity of natural selection, but also for challenging the validity of uniformitarian extrapolation as a methodology of research. Darwin responded, as required by logical necessity, that such limits do not exist, and that new spheres of equal radius can be reconstructed around new modes: "No case is on record of a variable being ceasing to be variable under cultivation. Our oldest cultivated plants, such as wheat, still often yield new varieties: our oldest domesticated animals are still capable of rapid improvement or modification" (p. 8). (Gould 2002: 142) (….) One of the most appealing features of Mendalism a strong reason for acceptance following its “rediscovery” in 1900 lay in the argument that mutation could restore variation “used up” by selection. (Gould 2002: 143) [See Klein & Tanaka, 2002, "Where Do We Come From: The Molecular Evidence for Human Descent," p. 197-204, regarding atavism.] SMALL IN EXTENT. If the variations that yielded evolutionary change were large -- producing new major features, or even new taxa in a single step then natural selection would not disappear as an evolutionary force. Selection would still function in an auxiliary and negative role as headsman -- to heap up the hecatomb of the unfit, permit new saltation to spread among organisms in subsequent generations, and eventually to take over the population. But Darwinism, as a theory of evolutionary change, would perish -- for selection would become both subsidiary and negative, and variation itself would emerge as the primary, and truly creative, force of evolution, the source of occasionally lucky saltation. For this reason, the quite properly, saltationist (or macromutational) theories have always been viewed as anti-Darwinian -- despite the protestations of de Vries ..., who tried to retain the Darwinian label for his continued support of selection as a negative force. The unthinking, knee-jerk response of many orthodox Darwinians whenever they hear the word “rapid” or the name “Goldschmidt,” testifies to the conceptual power of saltation as a cardinal danger to an entire theoretical edifice. (Gould 2002: 143) Darwin held firmly to the credo of small-scale variability as raw material because both poles of his great accomplishment required this proviso…. At the theoretical pole, natural selection can only operate in a creative manner if its cumulating force builds adaptation step by step from an isotropic pool of small-scale variability. If the primary source of evolutionary innovation must be sought in the occasional luck of fortuitous saltations, then internal forces of variation become the creative agents of change, and natural selection can only help to eliminate the unfit after the fit arise by some other process. (Gould 2002: 143-142) (....) UNDIRECTED. Textbooks of evolution still often refer to variation as “random.” We all recognize this designation is a misnomer, but continue to use the phrase by force of habit. Darwinians have never argued for “random” mutation in the restricted and technical sense of “equally likely in all directions,” as in tossing a die. [Rather it means statistical frequencies around a modal norm, like the bell curve for example, which does not imply that the underlying cause is totally random like tossing die.] But our sloppy use of “random” (see Eble, 1999) does capture, at least in a vernacular sense, the essence of the important claim that we do wish to convey -- namely, that variation must be unrelated to the direction of evolutionary change; or, more strongly, that nothing about the process of creating raw material biases the pathway of subsequent change in adaptive directions. This fundamental postulate gives Darwinism its “two step” character, the “chance” and “necessity” of Monad’s famous formulation the separation of a source of raw material (mutation, recombination, etc.) from a force of change (natural selection). (Gould 2002: 144) In a sense, the specter of directed variability threatens Darwinism even more seriously than any putative failure of the other two postulates. Insufficient variation stalls natural selection; saltation deprives selection of a creative role but still calls upon Darwin’s mechanism as a negative force. With directed variation, however, natural selection can be bypassed entirely. If adaptive pressures automatically trigger heritable variation in favored directions, then trends can proceed under regimes of random mortality; natural selection, acting as a negative force, can, at most, accelerate the change. (Gould 2002: 145) (....) Darwin clearly understood the threat of directed variability to his cardinal postulate of creativity for natural selection. He explicitly restricted the sources of variation to auxiliary roles as providers of raw material, and granted all power over the direction of evolutionary change to natural selection…. He recognized biased tendencies to certain states of variation, particularly reversions toward ancestral features. But he viewed such tendencies as weak and easily overcome by selection. Thus, by the proper criterion of relative power and frequency, selection controls the direction of change: “When under nature the conditions of life do change, variations and reversions of character probably do occur; but natural selection, as will hereafter be explained, will determine how far the new characters thus arising shall be preserved” (p. 15) (Gould 2002: 145) We may summarize Darwin’s third requirement for variation under the rubric of isotropy, a common term in mineralogy (and other sciences) for the concept of a structure or system that exhibits no preferred pathway as a consequence of construction with equal properties in all directions. Darwinian variation must be copious in amount, small in extent, and effectively isotropic. (Gould 2002: 145) (….) Only under these stringent conditions can natural selection -- a force that makes nothing directly, and must rely upon variation for all raw material -- be legitimately regarded as creative. (Gould 2002: 145) (....) Gradualism. Selection becomes creative only if it can impart direction to evolution by superintending the slow and steady accumulation of favored subsets from an isotropic pool of variation. If gradualism does not accompany this process of change, selection must relinquish this creative role and Darwinism then fails as a creative source of evolutionary novelty. If important new features, or entire new taxa, arise as large and discontinuous variations, then creativity lies in the production of the variation itself. Natural selection no longer causes evolution, and can only act as a headsman for the unfit, thus promoting changes that originated in other ways. Gradualism therefore becomes a logical consequence of the operation of natural selection in Darwin’s creative mode. (Gould 2002: 149) Yeap...gould agrees with me. Good luck believing in your fairytale.

Lesz: please notice the word random in there. I rest my case; nonrandom variation cancels out the creative role of selection.Nope it does no such thing. You have yet to define non-random relevant to the optimized change vector. Selection can increase fitness even if non-random changes are biased in a direction well away from the optimum change vector. Indeed the statistical angle between the population change vector and the optimum vector can exceed 90 degrees and selection will still allow for change in gene frequencies after selection to be within 90 degrees of the optimum vector.That mutations might be non-random (ie not equally probable in all directions from the population means) does not imply that such non-randomness is in any way representative of changes which will increase fitness. To show what you are claiming you wil need to demonstrate that the bias you propose IS such that without selection the population will increase in fitness. This you have failed utterly to do. Indeed I know of no studies in which such an effect has been observed. Many biologists in the past believed that mutations were in general biased in the opposite way - ie that most or many were detrimental. Thats not the consensus these days as I understand it. Les may know more than I on this subject. In any case the strict randomness of mutation has nothing of significant bearing on what Gould was discussingThe fact remiains is that the only known process which can direct genetic change toward the binding of additional or more accurate information about environments is selection of heritable changes.Frankly your proposed bias as a substitute for natural selection is a non-starter of a concept unless you have substantive evidence that when the environment changes, and without selection steps, then the pattern of mutation changes so as to provide improvements in fitness under a variety of circumstances. Good luck.

Sorry SS but you misread gould in a very selective way. Please note well that he also defines non-random in a specific and precise way. You do not and you deliberately confuse your non-random with Goulds. This does not help your case. Goulds definition is in accord with my own, not with yours.Let me point out the relevant language in Goulds statement:he forces that pro-duce the raw material of genetic variation — are random, in the special sense of “not inherently directed toward adaptation.”Did you note prehaps the careful use of the term "in the special sense of"? Or did you just skip over that part as being inconvenient to your thesis?

lol....oh, so now your defense has sunk to the level of "defining non-random." You are one funny dude. You are no different than all the other darwinists who who try to use word games as a defense because that's all you have.The reality is nonrandom variation undermines selection. I think Gould probably knows better than you do.Gould:The central logic of Darwinism requires that natural selection not merely operate, but that it be the creative force of evolutionary change. Selection wins its role as a creative force because the other component of evolutionary mechanics — the forces that pro-duce the raw material of genetic variation — are random, in the special sense of “not inherently directed toward adaptation.” That is, if local environments change and smaller organisms are now at an advantage, genetic variation does not produce more small individuals, thus imparting a direction to evolutionary change from the level of variation itself. Variation continues to occur“at random,” in a broad spectrum about the average size. Selection must impart direction — and be the creative force of evolution — by differentially preserving those random variants yielding smaller than average phenotypes.http://home.wxs.nl/~gkorthof/korthof63.htmDarwin's theory ... cannot be equated with the simple claim that natural selection operates. Nearly all his colleagues and predecessors accepted this postulate. Darwin, in his characteristic and radical way, grasped that this standard mechanism for preserving the type could be inverted, and then converted into the primary cause of evolutionary change. Natural selection obviously lies at the center of Darwin's theory, but we must recognize, as Darwin's second key postulate, that claim that natural selection acts as the creative force of evolutionary change. The essence of Darwinism cannot reside in the mere observation that natural selection operates -- for everyone had long accepted a negative role for natural selection in eliminating the unfit and preserving the type. (Gould 2002: 139) (....) We have lost this context and distinction today, and our current perspective often hampers an understanding of the late 19th century literature and its preoccupations. Anyone who has read deeply in this literature knows that no argument inspired more discussion, while no Darwinian claim seemed more vulnerable to critics, than the proposition that natural selection should be viewed as a positive force, and therefore as the primary cause of evolutionary change.

Selection would still function in an auxiliary and negative role as headsman -- to heap up the hecatomb of the unfit, permit new saltation to spread among organisms in subsequent generations, and eventually to take over the population. But Darwinism, as a theory of evolutionary change, would perish -- for selection would become both subsidiary and negative, and variation itself would emerge as the primary, and truly creative, force of evolution, the source of occasionally lucky saltation. For this reason, the quite properly, saltationist (or macromutational) theories have always been viewed as anti-Darwinian -- despite the protestations of de Vries ..., who tried to retain the Darwinian label for his continued support of selection as a negative force. The unthinking, knee-jerk response of many orthodox Darwinians whenever they hear the word “rapid” or the name “Goldschmidt,” testifies to the conceptual power of saltation as a cardinal danger to an entire theoretical edifice. (Gould 2002: 143) Darwin held firmly to the credo of small-scale variability as raw material because both poles of his great accomplishment required this proviso…. At the theoretical pole, natural selection can only operate in a creative manner if its cumulating force builds adaptation step by step from an isotropic pool of small-scale variability. If the primary source of evolutionary innovation must be sought in the occasional luck of fortuitous saltations, then internal forces of variation become the creative agents of change, and natural selection can only help to eliminate the unfit after the fit arise by some other process. (Gould 2002: 143-142) (....) UNDIRECTED. Textbooks of evolution still often refer to variation as “random.” We all recognize this designation is a misnomer, but continue to use the phrase by force of habit. Darwinians have never argued for “random” mutation in the restricted and technical sense of “equally likely in all directions,” as in tossing a die. [Rather it means statistical frequencies around a modal norm, like the bell curve for example, which does not imply that the underlying cause is totally random like tossing die.] But our sloppy use of “random” (see Eble, 1999) does capture, at least in a vernacular sense, the essence of the important claim that we do wish to convey -- namely, that variation must be unrelated to the direction of evolutionary change; or, more strongly, that nothing about the process of creating raw material biases the pathway of subsequent change in adaptive directions. This fundamental postulate gives Darwinism its “two step” character, the “chance” and “necessity” of Monad’s famous formulation the separation of a source of raw material (mutation, recombination, etc.) from a force of change (natural selection). (Gould 2002: 144) In a sense, the specter of directed variability threatens Darwinism even more seriously than any putative failure of the other two postulates. Insufficient variation stalls natural selection; saltation deprives selection of a creative role but still calls upon Darwin’s mechanism as a negative force. With directed variation, however, natural selection can be bypassed entirely. If adaptive pressures automatically trigger heritable variation in favored directions, then trends can proceed under regimes of random mortality; natural selection, acting as a negative force, can, at most, accelerate the change. (Gould 2002: 145) (....) Darwin clearly understood the threat of directed variability to his cardinal postulate of creativity for natural selection. He explicitly restricted the sources of variation to auxiliary roles as providers of raw material, and granted all power over the direction of evolutionary change to natural selection…. He recognized biased tendencies to certain states of variation, particularly reversions toward ancestral features. But he viewed such tendencies as weak and easily overcome by selection. Thus, by the proper criterion of relative power and frequency, selection controls the direction of change: “When under nature the conditions of life do change, variations and reversions of character probably do occur; but natural selection, as will hereafter be explained, will determine how far the new characters thus arising shall be preserved” (p. 15) (Gould 2002: 145) We may summarize Darwin’s third requirement for variation under the rubric of isotropy, a common term in mineralogy (and other sciences) for the concept of a structure or system that exhibits no preferred pathway as a consequence of construction with equal properties in all directions. Darwinian variation must be copious in amount, small in extent, and effectively isotropic. (Gould 2002: 145) (….) Only under these stringent conditions can natural selection -- a force that makes nothing directly, and must rely upon variation for all raw material -- be legitimately regarded as creative. (Gould 2002: 145) (....) Gradualism. Selection becomes creative only if it can impart direction to evolution by superintending the slow and steady accumulation of favored subsets from an isotropic pool of variation. If gradualism does not accompany this process of change, selection must relinquish this creative role and Darwinism then fails as a creative source of evolutionary novelty. If important new features, or entire new taxa, arise as large and discontinuous variations, then creativity lies in the production of the variation itself. Natural selection no longer causes evolution, and can only act as a headsman for the unfit, thus promoting changes that originated in other ways. Gradualism therefore becomes a logical consequence of the operation of natural selection in Darwin’s creative mode. (Gould 2002: 149) Yeap...gould agrees with me. Good luck believing in your fairytale.

You need to bear in mind that Gould was not much of a quantitative theoretician. He tended to argue his points in words and was often shall we say less than precisely coherent in mathematical terms. If you wish you can experess the fitness landscape in high diemesional terms and the extent and direction of change for a species in similar terms. You can then assume various forms of variability and run the simulations to determine what might happen with regard to adaptation. This requires extensive use of monte carlo methods, distributional mathematics, and careful error controls for the numerical computations. BUT the results are meaningful. You will find that non-random distrivution of variation will not accomplish anything much different than random variation will in such a system.Its quite obvious you consider such an approach garbage and prefer simply to claim that your preferred beliefs are true because God wills it. I am sorry to inform you of this but that does not actually constitute an argument, and any opponent need only say that no he does not but rather wills an opposing position. Its an endless and uselfess process.

Sorry SS but you misread gould in a very selective way. Please note well that he also defines non-random in a specific and precise way. You do not and you deliberately confuse your non-random with Goulds. This does not help your case. Goulds definition is in accord with my own, not with yours.Let me point out the relevant language in Goulds statement:he forces that pro-duce the raw material of genetic variation — are random, in the special sense of “not inherently directed toward adaptation.”Did you note prehaps the careful use of the term "in the special sense of"? Or did you just skip over that part as being inconvenient to your thesis?And later gould is quoted as follows: UNDIRECTED. Textbooks of evolution still often refer to variation as “random.” We all recognize this designation is a misnomer, but continue to use the phrase by force of habit. Darwinians have never argued for “random” mutation in the restricted and technical sense of “equally likely in all directions,” as in tossing a die.

(Gould 2002: 144)Again he is in agreement with me as to what random means (and by extension what non-random means). Its profoundly different from your attempt at hijacking the concept.

Nope. First, natural selection is, as I've pointed out before, merely a filter. It doesn't matter how variants that arrive at the filter became variants, they still have to pass through if they can.Second, even if variation isn't perfectly random, and no evolutionary biologist claims that every mutation makes it through the initial filter of development to reach the filter of natural selection, such canalisation is still a naturalistic phenomenon.If you want to argue that variants, genetic or epigenetic, arise in order to take advantage of future environments, then you have to propose a mechanism for how they do so. How can they predict what environment they will experience, and how do they know how to alter their molecular biology to take advantage of it? These are huge questions you are ignoring.Conspicuously, you have avoided trying to do this, besides resorting to the anti-scientific nonsense of "special creation", presumably by the deity of your choice who can foresee the future.Sci-fi waffle.

Gould:The essence of Darwinism lies in a single phrase: natural selection is the major creative force of evolutionary change. No one denies that natural selection will play a negative role in eliminating the unfit. Darwinian theories require that it create the fit as well. Selection must do this by building adaptations in a series of steps, preserving at each stage the advantageous part in a random spectrum of genetic variability. Selection must superintend the process of creation, not just toss out the misfits after some other force suddenly produces a new species, fully formed and pristine perfection. The Panda's Thumb. Pg 190.Lesz: please notice the word random in there. I rest my case; nonrandom variation cancels out the creative role of selection.

that's a laugh. There is no "mechanism" for you being able to think and solve an algebra problem. There's no "mechanism" for the release of hormones to induce pigmentation if you spend extended periods of time in the sun. There's no "mechanism" for a tadpole who changes its tail shape/color in direct response to the presence of a predator. These things -- and millions of other things just like them -- just seem to happen. And it doesn't matter how they happen -- they just happen. Life is mysterious and unexplainable and miraculous. I don't have to explain jack. The important thing is that individual lifeforms don't need to die (or breed less successfully) in order for populations to evolve new, beneficial traits -- which destroys the very foundation of which your silly theory was constructed.

Well, Gould was a science popularizer, after all, and anyone who writes for the general public is going to have to use lots more words than numbers. Chuck in a bunch of formulae, and you have your audience heading for the exits in droves. What you lose in precision, you gain in (at least general) comprehension. Although it seems that in the case of some people (SS?) reducing the concepts to words of one syllable wouldn't help.

Then there's no theory for you to palaver about. No, dear, they don't "just seem to happen" as if they were some sort of miracle. Everything in biology has some sort of mechanism. It's the sort of thing biologists research, not that I would expect you to be familiar with any of that sort of thing. Takes too much work, for one thing.No dear, again, things don't "just happen". They are caused. Biology is the science of finding out how and why things happen the way they happen. You have heard of it, I suppose? Maybe not.Nope. It's natural and explicable. Biology is... well, I don't expect you to understand anything about biology. You have your religion instead, but i assure you, it's no science.Then don't expect to have your fairy tales and fantasies taken seriously. If you can't explain jack, you have nothing interesting to say, period. You're just wasting everyone's time.If you can't explain how and why, then all you have is a fairy tale. Which is all your silly "theory" amounts to. It isn't even a bona fide scientific hypothesis, it's just so much dilettantish handwaving and pontificating. You don't even understand evolutionary theory, never mind having a hope in hell of disproving it. You're out of your league in science, mate.

Some humans do indeed not seem to have a mechanism with which to think at least not effectively. For such their thoughts just happen and they make very strange statements which are clearly not due to any thinking mechanism. Their arguments also seem to just happen. Just happen to be wrong.
