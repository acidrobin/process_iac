The moral opposition is loud, too, echoed in Europe and the rest of the industrialized world, where all but a few countries banned executions years ago.What gets little notice, however, is a series of academic studies over the last half-dozen years that claim to settle a once hotly debated argument — whether the death penalty acts as a deterrent to murder. The analyses say yes. They count between three and 18 lives that would be saved by the execution of each convicted killer.The reports have horrified death penalty opponents and several scientists, who vigorously question the data and its implications.So far, the studies have had little impact on public policy.

"The conclusion is there is a deterrent effect."A 2003 study he co-authored, and a 2006 study that re-examined the data, found that each execution results in five fewer homicides, and commuting a death sentence means five more homicides. "The results are robust, they don't really go away," he said. "I oppose the death penalty. But my results show that the death penalty (deters) — what am I going to do, hide them?"Statistical studies like his are among a dozen papers since 2001 that capital punishment has deterrent effects. They all explore the same basic theory — if the cost of something (be it the purchase of an apple or the act of killing someone) becomes too high, people will change their behavior (forego apples or shy from murder).To explore the question, they look at executions and homicides, by year and by state or county, trying to tease out the impact of the death penalty on homicides by accounting for other factors, such as unemployment data and per capita income, the probabilities of arrest and conviction, and more.Among the conclusions:• Each execution deters an average of 18 murders, according to a 2003 nationwide study by professors at Emory University.

Death Penalty Decreases Crime

Even if the death penalty does decrease crime the error rate in capital cases is too great to tolerate in a civilized society. We make too many mistakes and execute too many who are not guilty.

Many economists are so obsessed with statistics that they lose sight of meaning. A study of cause and effect requires experimental design in which a single variable is manipulated or allowed to vary, correlational design can at best hint at relationships between variables, even when sophisticated factor analytic techniques are employed.In this case what we have is a correlation, and the very likely possibility that a third, fourth or fifth factor results in both decreased murder rates and increased executions.By the same logic many economists use, we could find any number of absurd things. For example there is a well known correlation between skyscraper construction and economic downturn, we could conclude from this that tall buildings depress economies and that recessions can be avoided if we disallow the construction of record-height buildings.The other thing economists need to realise is that economic statistics are entirely historical, they provide empirical information about a particular group at a particular time, not universal truths about mankinds' behaviour in general. Even if we run an experimental design in the realm of human action showing X causes Y, differing social and cultural norms may result in the precise opposite effect at another period of time.

Considering the avg number of capital punishments a year is around 70..... think of the 4000 babies in the womb that arent guilty of any crimes that are everyday being slaughtered through abortion..... Just putting some things in perspective for you......Just as many people died in the world trade center attack on September 11th, thats how many babies die from abortion everyday in America.... There have been 2000 soldiers that have died in Iraq... thats only half the number of babies that die everyday from abortion on our own soil....What a shame for the "land of the free" that has "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"... THERE IS GENOCIDE HAPPENING AND NO ONE IS STANDING UP FOR THE TRUE INNOCENT AMONG US! in fact the ones against the death penalty ARE FOR ABORTION! Truly they are for the life of the innocent right.... ???? (said sarcatically)

It appears that they have done just that."To explore the question, they look at executions and homicides, by year and by state or county, trying to tease out the impact of the death penalty on homicides by accounting for other factors, such as unemployment data and per capita income, the probabilities of arrest and conviction, and more."Any statistician worth his salt knows about multivariate statistics and doesn't need to design an experiment with only ONE variable. With enough of a population size, you can check the effects of dozens of variables at once. So, the cavaet is "The death penalty is a deterrent in the USA TODAY!" I can live with that.emoticonXGood

Exactly.1 innocent person given a life term in prison is too many, but it happens. I would even be willing to bet that the margin for error is greater in non-death cases, due to the close scrutiny that death cases recieve. I am all for minimizing the chances that an innocent person is given the sentence, however I am not willing to throw out a useful and effective means of punishment simply because the system which issues it is somewhat flawed. Problem is, everyone keeps talking about all of these innocent people that we have put to death, yet coming up with concrete examples seems to be a bit of a problem. Where is this massive horde of innocent people that have been put to death? And by the way, are you chemist99a's other personality?

You can check the statistical relationship between dozens of variables, not the effects of them.For example if I correlated left hand strength with right hand strength across a billion individuals I would probably find a correlation of about 0.93, however this relationship is not causal, cutting off one hand will not result in a 90% strength reduction in the other.Correlational studies like this one can not determine cause and effect.That would (almost) be a valid conclusion if the study employed experimental rather than correlational design, a very difficult thing with regard to broad social trends, but the only way such a conclusion could be validated.

Problem is, everyone keeps talking about all of these innocent people that we have put to death, yet coming up with concrete examples seems to be a bit of a problem. Where is this massive horde of innocent people that have been put to death?The problem is that once the prisoner is executed there is no reason whatsoever to examine his guilt or innocence. If he was innocent there is nothing to be done and nobody is interested in rocking the boat. If he was guilty there is also no interest. What we do have is a number of cases which otherwise would have proceeded to execution except for last minute DNA evidence which proved exculpatory. Too many mistakes.

Frankly I don't care what the stats say. I don't want my government to have the power to execute.And IF we are. Everyone on death row gets the same level of representation. I am sick of the rich being able to buy themselves off with better representation.Actually - that kind of ticks me off period. The idea that money should purchase you better counsel for the same crime (or a worse crime) than the poor slob using a public defender.An attorney friend of mine thought it might be helpful if ALL attorneys were required to do 1-2 years of public defender service and that it was then part of their record as an attorney.

If he was innocent there is nothing to be done and nobody is interested in rocking the boat. If he was guilty there is also no interest. What we do have is a number of cases which otherwise would have proceeded to execution except for last minute DNA evidence which proved exculpatory. Too many mistakes.

Considering the avg number of capital punishments a year is around 70..... think of the 4000 babies in the womb that arent guilty of any crimes that are everyday being slaughtered through abortion..... Just putting some things in perspective for you......Just as many people died in the world trade center attack on September 11th, thats how many babies die from abortion everyday in America.... There have been 2000 soldiers that have died in Iraq... thats only half the number of babies that die everyday from abortion on our own soil....What a shame for the "land of the free" that has "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"... THERE IS GENOCIDE HAPPENING AND NO ONE IS STANDING UP FOR THE TRUE INNOCENT AMONG US! in fact the ones against the death penalty ARE FOR ABORTION! Truly they are for the life of the innocent right.... ???? (said sarcatically)

Although I agree with this researcher's opinion, I would be hesitant to consider any of the numbers or researchers cited in this article as reliable. Why? It seems more relevant to ask the opinion of sociologists and criminologists about the death penalty serving as a deterrent. But again, this article was printed by Fox news, who simply provide conservative propaganda and not factual information. And that is not an opinion but an observation after watching several Fox news shows.Additionally, the fact remains that "Relatively few crimes committed in the U.S. are eligible for the death penalty...[Therefore,] by definition, the death penalty cannot have much of an effect on the overall U.S. crime rate" (Mays & Winfree, 2005, p. 396).And in regards to the effect the death penalty has on the murder rate in the U.S., "...we simply do not know. The death penalty might be a deterrent, but we have no way of knowing the number of murders that did not occur. However, if executions did lower the murder rate, we would expect Texas [who by far has executed more people than any other jurisdiction in the U.S. since the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976] to have the nation's lowest per capita murder rate" (Mays & Winfree, 2005, p. 396). But, it does not!Source: Mays, G.L., & Winfree, L.T. (2005). Essentials of corrections(3rd edition). Belmont, CA: Thomson Wadsworth.

http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,280215,00.htmlAnti-death penalty forces have gained momentum in the past few years, with a moratorium in Illinois, court disputes over lethal injection in more than a half-dozen states and progress toward outright abolishment in New Jersey.The steady drumbeat of DNA exonerations — pointing out flaws in the justice system — has weighed against capital punishment. The moral opposition is loud, too, echoed in Europe and the rest of the industrialized world, where all but a few countries banned executions years ago.What gets little notice, however, is a series of academic studies over the last half-dozen years that claim to settle a once hotly debated argument — whether the death penalty acts as a deterrent to murder. The analyses say yes. They count between three and 18 lives that would be saved by the execution of each convicted killer.The reports have horrified death penalty opponents and several scientists, who vigorously question the data and its implications.So far, the studies have had little impact on public policy. New Jersey's commission on the death penalty this year dismissed the body of knowledge on deterrence as "inconclusive."But the ferocious argument in academic circles could eventually spread to a wider audience, as it has in the past."Science does really draw a conclusion. It did. There is no question about it," said Naci Mocan, an economics professor at the University of Colorado at Denver. "The conclusion is there is a deterrent effect."A 2003 study he co-authored, and a 2006 study that re-examined the data, found that each execution results in five fewer homicides, and commuting a death sentence means five more homicides. "The results are robust, they don't really go away," he said. "I oppose the death penalty. But my results show that the death penalty (deters) — what am I going to do, hide them?"Statistical studies like his are among a dozen papers since 2001 that capital punishment has deterrent effects. They all explore the same basic theory — if the cost of something (be it the purchase of an apple or the act of killing someone) becomes too high, people will change their behavior (forego apples or shy from murder).To explore the question, they look at executions and homicides, by year and by state or county, trying to tease out the impact of the death penalty on homicides by accounting for other factors, such as unemployment data and per capita income, the probabilities of arrest and conviction, and more.Among the conclusions:• Each execution deters an average of 18 murders, according to a 2003 nationwide study by professors at Emory University. (Other studies have estimated the deterred murders per execution at three, five and 14).• The Illinois moratorium on executions in 2000 led to 150 additional homicides over four years following, according to a 2006 study by professors at the University of Houston.• Speeding up executions would strengthen the deterrent effect. For every 2.75 years cut from time spent on death row, one murder would be prevented, according to a 2004 study by an Emory University professor.In 2005, there were 16,692 cases of murder and nonnegligent manslaughter nationally. There were 60 executions.The studies' conclusions drew a philosophical response from a well-known liberal law professor, University of Chicago's Cass Sunstein. A critic of the death penalty, in 2005 he co-authored a paper titled "Is capital punishment morally required?""If it's the case that executing murderers prevents the execution of innocents by murderers, then the moral evaluation is not simple," he told The Associated Press. "Abolitionists or others, like me, who are skeptical about the death penalty haven't given adequate consideration to the possibility that innocent life is saved by the death penalty."Sunstein said that moral questions aside, the data needs more study.Critics of the findings have been vociferous.Some claim that the pro-deterrent studies made profound mistakes in their methodology, so their results are untrustworthy. Another critic argues that the studies wrongly count all homicides, rather than just those homicides where a conviction could bring the death penalty. And several argue that there are simply too few executions each year in the United States to make a judgment."We just don't have enough data to say anything," said Justin Wolfers, an economist at the Wharton School of Business who last year co-authored a sweeping critique of several studies, and said they were "flimsy" and appeared in "second-tier journals.""This isn't left vs. right. This is a nerdy statistician saying it's too hard to tell," Wolfers said. "Within the advocacy community and legal scholars who are not as statistically adept, they will tell you it's still an open question. Among the small number of economists at leading universities whose bread and butter is statistical analysis, the argument is finished."Several authors of the pro-deterrent reports said they welcome criticism in the interests of science, but said their work is being attacked by opponents of capital punishment for their findings, not their flaws."Instead of people sitting down and saying 'let's see what the data shows,' it's people sitting down and saying 'let's show this is wrong,'" said Paul Rubin, an economist and co-author of an Emory University study. "Some scientists are out seeking the truth, and some of them have a position they would like to defend."The latest arguments replay a 1970s debate that had an impact far beyond academic circles.Then, economist Isaac Ehrlich had also concluded that executions deterred future crimes. His 1975 report was the subject of mainstream news articles and public debate, and was cited in papers before the U.S. Supreme Court arguing for a reversal of the court's 1972 suspension of executions. (The court, in 1976, reinstated the death penalty.)Ultimately, a panel was set up by the National Academy of Sciences which decided that Ehrlich's conclusions were flawed. But the new pro-deterrent studies haven't gotten that kind of scrutiny.At least not yet. The academic debate, and the larger national argument about the death penalty itself — with questions about racial and economic disparities in its implementation — shows no signs of fading away.Steven Shavell, a professor of law and economics at Harvard Law School and co-editor-in-chief of the American Law and Economics Review, said in an e-mail exchange that his journal intends to publish several articles on the statistical studies on deterrence in an upcoming issue

Here is a link about people who were released prior to the death penalty due to being shown to be innocent (124 people since 1973). It also lists at least seven people who were executed despite strong doubts about their guilt.

Name 5 and provide the links.

There is an important point that hasn't been made here yet.Namely, even if a particular punishment can be proven to reduce certain types of crimes, the punishment itself still has to be analyzed for the morality / ethics of its use. Reducing crime is not a sufficient reason to install a particular punishment. After all, in some repressive countries of this world (ex. in Saudi Arabia), people have their hands cut off if they steal. Certainly, that would reduce the amount of theft, but does that make the punishment right and moral? The bottom line is that reduction of crime (which still has yet to be fully proven for the death penalty) is not enough - the punishment has to be judged on its own merits and morality.

At least with life in prison, they have the maximum chance of being proven innocent. You can't give them any more time for proving their innocence than their natural lifetime. With the death penalty, you cut short that chance.

My main objection against the death penalty is that the major reason which I hear coming out of supporters is basically the desire for state sponsored vengeance.

I trust the jury, and the trial / appeals process that we use prior to execution (although the appeals process needs some streamlining). Why do we need trials after execution? Why do I need to be convinced at all? Why do I need to search for evidence of their innocence? If they were convicted in a courtof law by a jury of their peers, so be it. They get a fair appeals process, and in most cases (unless you are in Texas or Florida) stand little chance of being executed any time soon anyway. Even in Texas the average time on death row is 10.26 years. If you can't get it together and cast some doubt on your conviction in that amount of time...too bad.

Just because the Chicago Tribune finds some "expert" in the field of arson investigation who examines paper evidence and says their may be cause for doubt does not mean that the man was innocent.

Last I read, the death penalty was not considered an effective deterrant. I think that is mainstream accepted position on the issue.I'm kind of borderline myself, thinking of some of the worst crimes, and victims' families, but swing decidedly towards getting rid of it. It just doesn't work the way it's supposed to. In order to have a democratic society, we need the appeals process that exists. But that same process is tortuous to both victims and offenders. Better for both sides to have closure. Also, even the appeals process doesn't *out the truth* the way it always should. The system is imperfect. Even cursed as a bureaucratic and unfair mess. So I think getting rid of the death penalty is a more humble position. It acknowledges that our knowledge of life, death and judgement belongs to eyes we do not possess.Finally, there is the globalization matter. How can we tell, say, an Islamic theocracy not to execute our children or theirs, when we don't follow such laws ourselves?I think getting rid of the death penalty helps move the entire planet towards a more humane vision for living, and probably, our own violent society as well.

murder is intentional killing whether it is legal or not it is irrelevant, for it is the intention that counts, not the perprator.What if a State murders millions of people as during the Holocaust, is it legal?if yes then why after the war the authors were also executed (murdered) by the occupying powers?why? because there is a moral law that says that murder is murder whether it is state sanctioned or not.Technicalities will not save your a-s-s when the day of reckonning comes

By that definition if it is legal then it is not murder. Notice it says "the crime".

Merriam Webster disagrees with Cambridge:1 : the crime of unlawfully killing a person especially with malice aforethoughtAs does Dictionary.com:1. Law. the killing of another human being under conditions specifically covered in law. In the U.S., special statutory definitions include murder committed with malice aforethought, characterized by deliberation or premeditation or occurring during the commission of another serious crime, as robbery or arson (first-degree murder), and murder by intent but without deliberation or premeditation (second-degree murder). As does American Heritage Dictionary:The unlawful killing of one human by another, especially with premeditated malice. Interesingly, Cambridge Dictionary describes a murderer assomeone who illegally and intentionally kills another personSince no one but a murderer can commit murder, it would necessarily follow that Cambridge Dictionary agrees with the other cited sources that murder is intentional and unlawful. What if a State murders millions of people as during the Holocaust, is it legal?No, because murder is, by definition, illegal. if yes then why after the war the authors were also executed (murdered) by the occupying powers?See abovewhy? because there is a moral law that says that murder is murder whether it is state sanctioned or not.Using the same logic I could claim that robbery is robbery whether it is state sanctioned or not to avoid paying taxes.

murder noun [C or U] the crime of intentionally killing a person:(Cambridge Dictionary)to execute a prisoner is murder, for it is an intentional killing. It is State sanctioned murder. They make it legal that's all.

It is correct that other dictionaries define murder as: The unlawful killing of one human by another, especially with premeditated malice. The unlawful killing of one human by another, especially with premeditated malice. The unlawful killing of one human by another, especially with premeditated malice.But you missed the point and the point is that what is legal today can be illegal tomorrow due to a change in circumstances such as in the case of the defeat of Germany and subsequent occupation by the Allies. What was lawful killing one day became murder tomorrow.The only difference in killing by the state and killing by an individual is that the State killing is that one can not be punished and the other can.However if there is God both in my opinion are contrary to His moral law and that moral law speaks to us thru our conscience.Semantics and legal technicalities can not hide the crime and the State’s crime is the most heinous for it is committed in cold blood and sometimes decades after the convicted man was imprisoned this constitutes in my view cruel and unfair punishment.

The moral law, speaking through my conscience has no problem with the death penalty. So presumably, God is telling us two separate things? Is your God right or is mine? How about Joe's God speaking through his conscience? What was God telling the axe murderer? Morality is individual and separate from legality. Eating pork is perfectly legal for all members of society and moral for the vast majority. For those strict adherants to Orthodoxy, the eating of pork is immoral. I would not have you use your morality to deprive me of bacon any more than I would allow your morality to serve as a litmus test to what is just for our society.It is precisely because the moral law is subject to change that we have laws. What was immoral yesterday is moral today, and vice versa. A societies laws represent its collective view of what is right and what is wrong based upon the needs of the society and the individual. As such, there is nothing inherently immoral about deleting a member of society who has killed others. You remove the disease from the body politic.

http://www.innocenceproject.org/Will provide some indication to you of the error rates involved in convictions of people for crimes. Some of these are in fact for murder and some of those were for death sentences. You might read the current case they are working on in which they are about to test a hair for DNA to determine whether an person executed for murder was innocent or not. And if you want to see how the system can abusively treat people read John Grishams "An Innocent Man".

I bet not too many. ~"We have executed too many innocent people in this country!"*"Who?"~"Well, we almost executed them."LOL, I love it. :)

It really doesn't matter. The reality is that the person is taking up space in a prison that could be used to house another criminal. But since he's there, the other criminal gets an "early out" and he's likely to commit more crimes. In reality, prison population is a zero sum game because nobody wants a new prison in their back yard (NIMBY principle). So, to incarcerate one, you have to let one out. If you're housing a lot of death row inmates, they can't house other criminals, so some are getting released too early and committing more crimes.

But you dodged the actual issue. You argued that because of the high rate of recidivism among criminals in general that life sentences (which might not be served in full) for capital crimes were inappropriate. But of course what you did not quote is the actual recividism rate for those specific types of criminals its vital you quote the correct rates you realize its very possible that murders are a lot less likely to repeat their crimes than say drug addicts or drug dealers!!!

Beyond a reasonable doubt is the standard used in the US for criminal prosecution. There is a reason that the phrase includes the term "reasonable doubt". All doubt would be a rediculous standard that could not realistically be implemented into the US judicial system.

The jury has already decided the matter of guilt or innocence to the level required by law.

snake,Name 5 innocent people that have been put to death in the US. That's just one more in a string of stupid statements from you, pld boy.Once the prisoner is executed, the case ends.The more proper inquiry will be, "How many people who have been convicted and sentenced to the DP were later exonerated and walked out of prison free people?"Get this: Juries err!emoticonXAngry 

I know that, but thanks for the update.The prosecutorial burden in homicide refers to the conditions required to obtain a conviction. If the burden of proof is met, a conviction can be obtained. Mitigating and aggravating circumstances are used to determine the sentence that will be handed down and have nothing to do with the determination of guilt or innocence. That has already been accomplished.

snake, Are you sayng that to find someone guilty and sentence them to death should have a higher burden of proof than to find that same person guilty of the same crime and give them LWOP?Not at all. The SCOTUS has made it plain that only the jury may, once it has convicted an accused, make the choice between the DP and LWOP. Judges are permitted absolutely no input.What I am saying is that the second choice must meet a MUCH higher burden of proof than the first. For me ANY mitigating evidence whatsoever is sufficient for me to vote for LWOP.emoticonXIdea

sspit,So the appellate process works? emoticonXMad emoticonXMad Not necessarily.The appellate process has worked for some individuals.How many more it has failed to work for is still the question.One still wonders why so many states are still resisting DNA analysis of physical evidence used against those who have been convicted in the past.What is it that the states' prosecutors are trying so hard to hide?emoticonXMad
