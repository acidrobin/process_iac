Are you for marriage between 2 biologically related heterosexuals? I'm not either. Incest has nothing to do with homosexuality.

Ya know, it is really funny how you use the bible as your weapon against gay marriage, but yet you are forgetting about the very beginning as the bible tells it."Adam and Eve" were the only two homosapians on earth in the beginning, right? Are you with me so far? "Adam And Eve's" were instructed to go forth and multiply the earth. Who do you think Adam and Eve's sons multiplied with? Wouldn't it have to be their sisters? Or do you feel your ancestors multiplied with the dinosaurs? How about the story of Noah's ark? Noah's grandchildren had no one but the own cousins to breed with. The way I see it, you might want to be thanking your Creator that incest and poligamy existed in the old "traditional" days or your butt may not be here to breed your hate in the name of God.As far as gay marriage leading to poligamy being legalized...that is the "traditional way" back in the old testiment. Many men had more than one wife. So if you want to use your bible as a weapon against gay marriage, and if you fear this all leading to incestial marriage or poligamy, what is going to be your weapon against stopping that? You won't be able to use your bible as your weapon because incest and poligamy stories far out number your arguments against them.I would say you better get to finding a new weapon if this is your fear. Tell me, how does it feel to fear the future so much? Your insides must be tormented and in a dis-ease on a constant basis beings you are not able to force your beliefs and "morals" on everyone. Did you know that dis-ease causes disease? Just to clarify my position a little better...who people fall in love with and marry, is not my business. (or yours, contrary to what you might think.)Love is never wrong...God is love. Only people's false concept of what love really is, is the problem we face in this world.Lilac Angel

I will indeed.I approve of any sexual act between adults providing it is will the full consent of all involved parties, and has no adverse affect on others. Quite what people do to each other behind close doors is their own business.I further support the rights of people (note I said people, not two people) in a consenting, loving relationship to have the support of the government in providing full marital (or whatever you want to call it) support.Marriage is no longer about God, it is about creating a stable and supportive relationship between people.There, I think that shows my exact stance on the matter.And like I say, in every other instance God explicitly spells out his disapproval of human actions (yes including homosexuality). He does not here, therefore it is implied he approves. In the context of the chapter it is seen that the daughters did the right thing in allowing their lineage to be preserved. Further, as angel points out, why would he have made only two original humans, therefore creating the necessity for incest from the outset?One cannot use God to confirm one's prejudices in one case and twist His word when it doesn't confirm another

I don't believe I could have worded my stance on this as good as what you just wrote. I am in agreement 100 percent on all your words.I agree with everything you wrote above also except...Human's wrote the bible. Not all words in the bible were inspired by God. They are simply fallable man's interpretation of a greater intelligence. Human's little finite minds cannot comprehend this greater intelligence in all concepts. I believe that is why God sent his Spiritual Masters, such as Jesus, to us so that he could up-date our understandings. But yet we still have a long way to go. Lilac Angel

Sickness is all in the eye of the beholder, what I find sick you may well not and I think we have seen that I find things acceptable that you don't. I will not condemn any of it however unless it actually causes harm.Oh I quite agree. Unfortunately, not everyone is able to see it as such. I was admitting to those who don't that it does appear that God confirms their homosexual prejudices. To back Traveler up however, I don't buy the 'closet case' answer myself. People who are racist aren't secretly scared they are black, equally homophobes aren't necessarily closet homosexuals. Unfortunately such irrational prejudices just exist.

I actually haven’t given this subject much thought before and am just interested in what’s behind the thinking on this being wrong.Cousins are 25% related by genetics. Based on your statement, would I be right in assuming you would not consider sex with someone that was related by 24% genetics as incest?I am trying to get a handle on what you consider incest and why you consider incest a sin. Is it the act of having sex with someone that is too closely genetically related or is it the acceptance of the act. In other words if someone married an adopted sibling that they did not know was their sibling, would having sex with that person be incest before they found out or after they found out or both. And would they need to obtain a divorce or should they stay married and just never have sex with that person again or how would that work? I'm making the assumption that you believe divorce is a sin which may be a bad assumption.

Only problem with incest is that after several generations the chance of getting a recessive genetic disorder in the offspring are quite high. So really the only problem is that it can produce disabled childrenif continued, one off incest isn't really at all damaging (unless one of the original parents of the incesting couple has one of these genetic disorders). As a homosexual coupel have absolutely no chance of producing a child with these disorders these rules wouldn't apply. Is it actually a crime to have an child through incest- or just marrying your cousin/brother/parent by the way?Raises another point though, if the increased risk of disabled children is the reason for the law why are people who suffer from an serious dominant genetic disorder or two carriers of a recessive disorder allowed kids as long as they are not related?

Well, you should know that in the U.S., several states allow marriage between cousins. If gay marriage is ever made legal, there will be second cousins who are gay that sooner or later will want the right to marry, just as there have been second cousins who are heterosexuals who have, unfortunately, been given the right to marry.Gay second cousin marriage could very likely open the door to other gay marriages past even that.Not likely? Go back 60, 70 years and tell someone that legal gay marriage could happen one day. They would laugh in your face.Think that gay marriage between 2nd cousins and then on from there to say gay uncles/nephews, aunts/neices wont ever happen if gay marriage is legalizedThink again...They will argue that they can't have deformed children, heck they can't even have children, so the incest laws wouldn't apply to them...This world is becoming more and more depraved by the year, and you had better realize that...

Is it purely for the biological reasons that incest is wrong though (i.e higher chance of genetic defect)? This would be the reason it isn't very common in any cultures to a real degree.

So it is all a matter of degree to you. Let me ask, how do you decide what is acceptable and what is not? Is there a book or manual that breaks incest down into acceptable and not acceptable. And if you are against ALL incest as you claim, and we are ALL related.....

That's called a historical trivialization. The difference between blacks and whites and homosexuality and heterosexuality is that homosexuality is abnormal, it is a mental disorder that can be cured- just like depression, alcoholism, and even pedophilia. It is not in human nature to be depressed, be an alcoholic, be a pedophiler, or be gay. Being Black or Jewish is completely natural.

That's called a bad anology.I think you'll find being homosexual is far more common in nature than being Jewish, and alchololism has a very strong genetic tendacy, also it is not cured but overcome. Most of the other other things you suggest are either suspencted or known to be linked to biological causes. Human nature is just a way of you saying what you think poeple shoud be like in this case.

Saying that homosexuality is abnormal is a subjective argument. Saying that it is a mental disorder that can be cured is a fallicy. Look at the DSMIV, there is no listing of homosexuality as a mental disorder. And comparing it to depression, alcoholism, and pedophilia is a rediculous connection. Depression is a mental disorder, one that often has underlying physiological origins..ie...imbalances of neurotransmitters. This can hardly be helped by the individual, and often can be treated and controlled, but not cured. Alcoholism is a disease, one that has strong genetic links. The addiction associated with alcoholism is both psychological and physiological. Alcoholism has also been associated with imbalances of neurotransmitters. Again, alcoholics cannot be cured, they can only be treated. You will never find a cured alcoholic, only a recovering one. Ask anyone who is a member of AA if they are an alcoholic or a former alcoholic. Pedophilia is a criminal act, unlike the rest of the list. Saying that pedophilia is a mental disorder is technically correct. It is listed in the DSMIV under the category of Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders. It is important to note however that most pedophiles are often diagnosed with other disorders, such as personality disorders...etc. Again, you will find few that would agree that this can be cured, only controlled through medication or behavior modification therapy. Homosexuality is a lifestyle, not an abnormal disorder or mental disease that can be cured. Where is your objection to homosexuality based, in your views, observations, and knowledge of human psychology or in your religious views? Saying that homosexuality is not human nature could not be farther from the truth...what do you think human nature is? Do you think gay people are "recruited and brainwashed" into the homosexual lifestyle? All of the things you listed are human nature. Human nature does not only include that which is considered good and morally acceptable by society, or the church. Human nature is behavior observed in humans. Being black is not human nature...it is genetic. Having 2 black parents makes you black. And being Jewish is not human nature...it is a religious affiliation that is learned. If being Jewish was human nature, people would be born with Jewish tendencies and ideals. Would you say that you were born Orthodox or raised Orthodox? If you were born and raised in a completely neutral religious environment where religion is not taught and information is not available on religion, would you still be Orthodox? Would you know what Orthodox theology was all about? If you did, then you could say that it is human nature.

Sorry, I didn't see it.Ok, first, I hate divorcce. God hate's divorce. So yes, I believe it is a sin, except under some cuircumstances.As in if one of them is cheating on the other. This is perfect grounds for a divorce if you want.I also wouldn't exactly be suprised by a divorce where abuse was involved. If you're getting beaten up by your husband, then you probably should get out of there.

Incest does too have to do with heterosexuality...if bilogically related brothers and sisters engage in sodomy or any other sex act, then that is incest.Again, I don't see why this is a difficult concept for you, but:Should biologically related straights, say brother and sister, be allowed to engage in sodomal incest in the privacy of their homes???Allowed to marry?

Because of the following and many more.Klinefelter's syndrome Turner's syndrome – Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (or adrenogenital syndrome) Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS, or testicular feminization) Partial AIS: Mayer-Rokitansky-Kustur-Hauser syndrome Vaginal agenesis Cloacal exstrophy Hypospadias HermaphroditismAll of the above are sexual disorders caused by genetics. Since sometimes we can’t even determine whether a child is a male or female, it is obvious that genetics plays a very important part in human sexual orientation.So I would ask this question. If a person with female outward appearance that has XY chromosomes, has sex with another female, is she/he a homosexual?

Here's a "nutshell" layman's terms quote from the Advocate:"ALL THE SCIENCE SO FAR Here's what researchers have reported in their search for the "cause" Lesbians' ring fingers tend to be longer than their index fingers, whereas straight women's ring fingers tend to be the same length as their index fingers. Boys who show "pervasive and persistently" effeminate behavior have about a 75% chance of growing up gay. A person with a gay identical twin is at least 10 times more likely to be gay than a person without one. There is about a 2% chance that a firstborn male will grow up gay. That chance grows to at least 6% for males with four or more older brothers. Gay men and lesbians are more likely to be left-handed. Gay men have smaller hypothalamuses than straight men. A man is more likely to be gay if there are gay men on his mother's side of the family. Lesbians' inner ears tend to react to sounds more like men's inner ears than like straight women's. Gay men have more testosterone and larger genitalia than straight men." --and this from Behavior Genetics:Multivariate structural equation modeling techniques have been applied to examine the causes of individual differences in responses to several items concerning sexual orientation. To minimize potential ascertainment and response biases, the study sample involved a large (N = 4901) community-based cohort of Australian twins aged 18–52 who answered an anonymous questionnaire on sexual behavior and attitudes. The statistical power of the analysis was increased by the availability of multiple measures of sexual orientation (behaviors, attitudes and feelings), providing stronger evidence for the existence of additive genetic influences on this phenotype than in a previous analysis (Bailey et al., 2000). Estimates of the heritability of homosexuality in this sample ranged between 50 and 60% in females but were significantly lower (heritability of approximately 30%) in males. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

Actually I think it's a valid point, no doubt said people 100 years ago would spout bogus facts that interacial breeding is a disorder, in fact they did do many similar things in using science to 'prove' blacks were inferior.Cured?

I would ask this question: if a person has X and Y chromsomes but female characteristics, does that determine which gender they will be sexually attracted to? I am aware that sexual disorders exist and they are genetic. but how does that necessarily correlate to sexual preference (which is the basis of homosexuality)? since the existence of the Y chromosome or even testosterone in men does not dictate that they are sexually attracted to females, then what does? so far you have not demonstrated a link between genetics and sexual preference

my answer, as it has always been, is that sexual preference is a personal choice, not influenced by genetics, biology, chemistry or physiology. people choose to be either sexually attracted to males, females, family members, animals, etc. its a choice. nobody is born gayit is beyond me that people take my point to mean that I am against gays, or that I think homosexuality is wrong, or anything like that. people make choices, and it is up to them to live with their choices. no matter what choice anyone makes, the consequences of that choice is theirs to bear, whether you consider them 'good' or 'bad' to me is really a question of perception, which is also based on choicethe statement "people are not born gay" does not condemn people for being gay. it simply brings to light a common misconception that society has been spreading for the past few years. and the statement itself, being a factual statement, is always open for verificatin to see whether it is true or not. it is not an opinion statement, and if it can be proven that people are born gay, then I would gladly retract itpersonally, I have no problem with gays as people. homosexuality is just something I choose not to practice

Today I chose to be heterosexual. Just as I can choose later today to be homosexual. the choice itself doesnt change anything about me except what I do.Q: If a person with female outward appearance that has XY chromosomes, has sex with another female, is she/he a homosexual? I think the person is a male, possibly a transvestite or a man that took a sex-change operation. the outward appearance would be female, but the genetic composition would be the same as before. and no, technically that person is not a homosexual (although they would fall under the biblical category of "sexual pervert")Q: How do you think the gender of a person should be determined?The traditional way: see if they got testicles. if that fails, then the chromosomes, if possible.Of course it can be argued that if someone is born with a peculiar gender, and they dont have sex with someone of their gender then they are really not homosexual. probably if all else fails use the chromosome method. there's no ambiguity in that

Okay but personally I find that strange. I have always been attracted to females and never to males. I don’t think there is any amount of will that would make me become attracted to a male. I guess we’re just different. But I don’t believe I have ever talked to another male that has said they could be attracted to a male if they tried except for a homosexual.Then you are very uninformed. About one of every two thousand children in America are born with some kind of indefinite sexual characteristics. There is a point in fetal development when the sex organs of the child are determined by a shot of testosterone. If a child gets that hormone, they develop an external sex organ or penis, if not then they develop an internal sex organ or a clitoris. This is regardless of whether they have the XY male chromosome or the XX female chromosome. Of course if every thing goes according to plan, the fetus with the XY chromosome will get the shot of testosterone. However is a child with XY chromosomes does not get the shot of testosterone, then they develop female sex organs even though they have the male XY chromosomes. And the amount of testosterone can vary greatly, causing mixed sexual organs or underdeveloped sex organs.I don’t understand how that was responsive to my question. But let me ask it a different way. What gender do you think a child should have when they have both sex organs.Again you are uninformed. A person can have XO, XXY, XX/XY and other combinations. So there is a lot of guesswork. So with that information which you can look up for yourself if you don’t believe me, I will ask the question again.If someone that has female sexual organs but XY chromosomes and doesn’t know that, has sex with a male, then they are homosexuals?And again I’ll say, by your previous definition, God would have created a “sexual pervert”.

After seeing all the things that can go wrong in fetal development. After finding out that your sexual organs are determined by hormones, and enough of them, at exactly the right time. After finding out that those hormones can be anywhere from non-existent to too much. You still now say that you think everyone has total control over their sexual preferences. Someone once said “with what judgement you judge, you will be judged”. You obviously have no empathy for walking in someone else’s shoes. I will just speak for myself at this point. Although you can apparently make yourself become attracted to another male, I don’t have that capacity. Something inside me, whether it is genetics or hormones or some kind of chemical makes me attracted to females and females only. I never picked my sexual preference. It has been females from the very beginning and will always be females. You may be hooked on logic but you don't know how to use what has hooked you.

Do you know anything about genetics and reproduction. Or are you just a plain ignorant brainwashed homophobe.Did you know that every child conceived in the womb is female unless it is given a certain chromosome, i dont want to go into too much detail and waste my time as i think you havent the intellegence to understand, and you neither have the feedom of mind to comprehend. In other words every human starts life in the womb as female, oh i can just hear you thinking, what about lesbians?

=====================================I truly think the original post is confusing in the way it is posed...My points:1)We cannot really compare homosexuality and incest - unless someone can prove me wrong (and I am willing to hear arguments here), incest is a matter of choice and behavior which most people consider to be immoral. Homosexuality is not a matter of choice and behavior. People do not choose to be gay.2)It think it is misleading and faulty to try and mix issues of personal morality and the Constitution. The argument against the ban on gay marriages is over breaches of the Constitution. This isn't about personal views. It is about legal rights that are not being extened to all of the citizens of the United States that are afforded by the Consitution. The Consitution does not force you, or me, to approve of anything - only to respect the rights of those who are protected under it. The real question, then, is what right does anyone have to deny Constituational rights based on a sense of personal morality and NOT the reverse as stated at the end of the original post.3)If the Constitution protects those who engage in incest, and if those who do engage in incest are being denied any rights afforded them by the Constitution by unconstituational laws, then I would have to say that I support a shift for those rights to be extended. Does this mean that I personally approve of incest? No it does not. We live an a country that respects a variety of people while allowing use to hold to our own personal views and beliefs. What is this thing with the human will to power to try and make everyone think the same way?MC

As well, I hear all the time that what someone does in the privacy of their own homes is their business. Would you agree in the case of two biologically related gay men/women, such as two biologically related gay brothers/sisters who are at the age of consent?I hope not.Lets see how many who say that it is discriminatory to ban gay marriage as with the proposed Cons. Amend. will show themselves to be hypocrites by not being for gay marriage with two biologically related gay men/women such as brothers/sisters who are at age of consent....Lets see how many are sick enough to be FOR marriage between two biologically related gay men/women, such as brothers/sisters, who are at age of consent.I am consistent. I am ONLY for traditional marriage... between a man and a woman.No gay marriage of any type, thank you.

When people are insecure about their own beliefs, they feel compelled to force them onto others. In this area people that are called conservatives in this country are the worst offenders. They are scared to death their beliefs might not be ‘right’.

=====================================I truly think the original post is confusing in the way it is posed...My points:1)We cannot really compare homosexuality and incest - unless someone can prove me wrong (and I am willing to hear arguments here), incest is a matter of choice and behavior which most people consider to be immoral. Homosexuality is not a matter of choice and behavior. People do not choose to be gay.2)It think it is misleading and faulty to try and mix issues of personal morality and the Constitution. The argument against the ban on gay marriages is over breaches of the Constitution. This isn't about personal views. It is about legal rights that are not being extened to all of the citizens of the United States that are afforded by the Consitution. The Consitution does not force you, or me, to approve of anything - only to respect the rights of those who are protected under it. The real question, then, is what right does anyone have to deny Constituational rights based on a sense of personal morality and NOT the reverse as stated at the end of the original post.3)If the Constitution protects those who engage in incest, and if those who do engage in incest are being denied any rights afforded them by the Constitution by unconstituational laws, then I would have to say that I support a shift for those rights to be extended. Does this mean that I personally approve of incest? No it does not. We live an a country that respects a variety of people while allowing use to hold to our own personal views and beliefs. What is this thing with the human will to power to try and make everyone think the same way?MC

I would not think that someone would 'choose' to be incestuous. You are attracted to who you are attracted to. But I agree there is no comparison between the two.And I totally agree with everything else you say.

If you are talking about the act of homosexuality or incest, then it is definitely a choice. If you are talking about being attracted to the same sex or a relation, then it is not a choice. Our debate is usually about whether the act should be legal or not. Although sometimes the debate is about whether it is even a choice or not. UP is arguing that the attraction is a choice. I find that not to be true, at least in my own personal case.

Hank, show one single case where genetics, chemistry or biology dictated which gender someone was attracted to. I'm talking about a case where the facts are scientifically backed up, not a case based on personal feelings or perspectivewe already went over the cases where gender is deviant from straight-forward male or female. you said this acounts for about 1 in 2000 people. but you have yet to show a link between hormonal imbalance and sexual preference. that is, what hormones present have been shown to make certain people attracted to males, or to females, or perhaps family members if possible, etc. or what gene, biological feature or chemical composition makes people more likely to be attracted sexually to a particular gender.

After seeing all the things that can go wrong in fetal development. After finding out that your sexual organs are determined by hormones, and enough of them, at exactly the right time. After finding out that those hormones can be anywhere from non-existent to too much. You still now say that you think everyone has total control over their sexual preferences. Someone once said “with what judgement you judge, you will be judged”. You obviously have no empathy for walking in someone else’s shoes. I will just speak for myself at this point. Although you can apparently make yourself become attracted to another male, I don’t have that capacity. Something inside me, whether it is genetics or hormones or some kind of chemical makes me attracted to females and females only. I never picked my sexual preference. It has been females from the very beginning and will always be females. You may be hooked on logic but you don't know how to use what has hooked you.

Before I do that, so I'll know if it will do any good, do you have an explanation for why about 95% of females appear to be attracted to males and 95% of males appear to be attracted to females?

no explanation, but I can guess because its normal and its what was taught growing up. everywhere in the society sexual attraction to males and females is promoted. now that homosexuality is being promoted more liberally than years past, I expect to see homosexuality more commonly. like I said, its not an explanation, just a guess

yeah, scombridae, better wording. by 'promote' I mean more openly expressed, not meaning advertising...yes and no. animals learn by mimicking or they just know by instinct, depending on the animal and environment. it is abundantly clear that humans differ from other animals in that survival and preservation of the species is not the instinctive driving force for humans. humans can choose leisure or entertainment over reproduction and physical health. humans also are capable of being guided by ethics and culture over natural instinct.

Well humans are animals also. And they learn exactly the same way.But what about the apes for instance. Do you think they learn sex by mimicking or do you think they instinctively know how to have sex?Survival is not an instinctive force for humans? Sex is not an instinctive force for humans? What planet are you talking about? You couldn’t be more wrong.Reproduction is entertainment. LOL But seriously humans CAN choose leisure or entertainment over sex but most don’t.Above you said sex was not an instinctive driving force for humans. So what natural instinct are you referring too?

you are confusing sex with reproduction. sex without reproduction is solely for pleasure, sex with the intent or reproduction is for preservation of species. but sex and reproduction is not interchangable, although they can be, and the same with pleasure. for instance, you said "reproduction is entertainment". actually sex is entertaining, childbirth usually isnt. get the picture? and I never said "sex is not an instinctive force", I never said that, I said species preservation is not the driving forceanyway, I cant answer for how apes learn about sex, all I can give you is guesses.I have a question for you: what makes humans prone to commit self-destructive actions (drug abuse, sky-diving, drag racing) knowing fully the potential hazard those actions can have on their personal survival?

Since when did incest, emoticonXConfused , equate homosexuality? Last I checked they were two different words with two different definitions. I laugh at the incompetents convinced that the acceptance of gay relationships will suddenly lead to legalized incest, pedophilia, or animal-human interbreeding. Homosexuality does not lead to the carnal love of one's toaster. I personally know of no gay individual that provoked a desire among their peers to engage in coitus with their pet turtle either. This sort of illogical association is too funny to rationally protest! emoticonXClown

nobody said that incest was the same as homosexuality. however, Im sure you would agree that people in incestuous relationships are being socially pressure similar to the gay community a few years ago. so think about it, an incestuous couple cannot legally get married or benefit from any of the rights that homosexuals are protesting for. yet, like gays, their position is that they are consenting adults that are not hurting anyone by their actions. the sanctioning of gay marriages will very likely open the doors for incest marriage. bestiality commiters will possibly make similar arguments, since their logic is about the same (i.e., not illegal, not hurting anyone else), and there will be no surprise if people could marry their pets in the future.while nobody equated homosexuality to incest, there are grounds of commonality between the 2, and thats what the discussion was about.

Maybe some of the Homophobes who are in fear of 'brother-sister-', 'animal-human-' or 'plant-stone-' marriages should remember that there is a biological reason why incest is forbidden.So it is nonsense to see the gay-marriage as a step towards that direction.Even in liberal European countries where homosexuals are allowed to marry, there aren´t even attempts to allow other forms of marriage; not even marrying 2 or more women.

But bestiality consists of animal cruelty, so very much hurts another. Just not another human.

not necessarily. it is not impossible to think that the animal would enjoy, or learn to enjoy sex with humans. think of male dogs with women (well, you dont really have to think about it if you dont want to :p ), it would be hard to prove that the dog would be under cruelty

Then, do you think we should disallow same-sex marriage (i.e. deny gay's their rights) because society may be forced to debate other controversial marriage issues (i.e. incest, animal-human, polygamy etc.) and continue to reshape our definition of it? I hope not. Change and redefinition = inevitable.

nothing is being forced. I said the possibility may arise. furthermore I never said disallow gay marriages in the first place. what reason is there for a mother and son or 2 sisters not to get married?and on touching "gay rights", nobody is denying gay rights. gays are not being allowed to marry because thats the law, not because anybody is prejudiced or victimizing gays. until the laws change, it will be illegal for gays to marry. gays are making a big issue out of it, when really, they are the ones currently at fault. you cannot disregard a law and then be mad at the legal system for not accomodating you. if the laws change so that gays can get married, then fine. but nobody is denying gays any rights. gays are aware of the laws concerning marriage, yet they want do things contrary to the established legal framework and then cry discrimination when the legal system doesnt accomodate them. thats not how things work. I have no problem with gays lobbying to change the laws. thats what your state government is for. but dont go accusing people of discrimination when the gays are deliberately going against the law, and feeling the consequences
