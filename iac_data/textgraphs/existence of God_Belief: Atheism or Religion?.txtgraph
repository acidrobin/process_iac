Belief: Atheism or Religion?

I do not beleive in God I see no reason to do so.You cannot create smilies. When you create a post you can add smilies to your post by clicking on the one you desire on the left side of your screen. The bottom of your post... I presume your talking about signature. Click on user cp (top right) and edit your signature.To quote something someone previously said as I have above copy and paste what the person has said into your post and highlight it Then hit the box to the left of the "#".

God did not need to be created because time did not exist before the big bang singularity according to modern theoretical physics. If time did not exist then words like 'beginning' and 'end' don't make sense. As far as chaos theory goes: A butterfly flapping it's wings in Tokyo can cause rain in New York.This implies that all things are connected. While all things may not follow a particular set of rules, they do have placement and succesion and that's what I mean when I say order. And Chaos theory does not mean that all things work on thier own and that complete understanding is hopeless: modern physicists are still searching for the Grand Theory of Everything. They know that the Chaos is not absolutee: all things can be understood which means that they were formed by an intelligent being with intelligible thoughts. Also, "Randomness in nature is not proof that there is no God, it is impossible to prove conclusively that what appears to be random really is random... and even if the universe did arise from chaos a believer could reasonably argue that God elected chaos as best suited for that purpose"(Timothy Ferris/The Whole Shebang/ p.310)Besides AMD4EVER no one in this forum has mentioned the Bible as evidence of God.

How could anything exist outside of time? How would it tell the difference and why would it want to? And why would it be the Christian god? And if so why would it allow people to worship different gods before it? As religions go Christianity is quite young, and compared to others even Judaism quite young as well. I seem to remember hearing that Hindism is the world's oldest living religion. I'm not sure though.Actually, there was no Big Bang. It was more of a Big Expansion. There is nothing to say that the universe itself couldn't have always existed as well and goes through cycles of expansion and collaspes over and over again.

What some people do has nothing to do with what the truth really is.I think I may have read of this somewhere. Still, it does not explain where the universe came from.

My point was that if the universe was eternal, the stars would have heated up the universe by now, in fact, this question was what caused the big expansion theory to be formed. By the way, the man who first expressed the big expansion theory was a Jesuit priest  named Georges Lamaitre.Also, if the universe is eternal, why hasn't everything happened already?I never really belived in the tooth fairy.

Some?The same place your god came from? :)I've heard creationists use the same question when they also try to disprove that the universe is around 15 billion years old instead of their 10,000 years. BTW, if Earth didn't have its magnetic shield we would fry from the Sun and Cosmic background radiation as well as other such nasty things. :)There is one school of thought that says that time is a loop with no real beginning or end. Maybe everything has happened. Whatever everything is? :)I find that hard to believe. Not even as a small child?Why? Who moved the mover?People create god in thier own image. You are no different.It makes more sense than what you believe which is "Puff, GODDIDIT!". We can show that these things exist, we can't show that god exists.Define oblivion in this context? Is it a place without time and form? Isn't that where you say you god came from?You can believe that your god came from nothing, or has existed forever, but you can't accept the same of the universe. The difference is that the universe is easy to prove its existence, it is not so easy to prove god's existence. You believe in god because you want to, not because of any real evidence.

God did not 'come' from anywhere, time did not exist before the big bang so God does not have a beginning.

So if the Universe did not exist neither did time. Yes, but remember space and time are connected. The Universe is spacetime. So saying that the universe is in a time loop is the same as saying that space is static and has been here always which is not very probable considering the findings made by physicists in the past century.The answer to that argument is that the Universe is expanding, so light does not heat up the Universe, that is also why we have not reached a thermal equilibrium and observations of background radiation have shown that the density in the Universe was once 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 tons per cubic inch, meaning that the matter in the Universe was once on top of one another in the 'primeval atom' Lamaitre talked about.

Who told you this? If that is true then how would god tell the difference if one moment is exactly like any other moment? If you're in the same instant for an eternity how would you tell the difference? It is quite illogical.Unless the universe has always existed in a repeating cycle of expansion and collapse.Maybe, maybe not.It still agrees with what I'm saying.I had said that that was the same arguement used by creationists to dismiss an old universe. And it is.I haven't as of yet seen you present any credible, verifible, or unbiased evidence to back up what you are asserting.Same god.You forget than I'm an agnostic and that there can be no evidence either way.

sounds as plausable as saying god is and always has been, although, atoms are more logical than a fairy that praises or damns you after death.

weird, it could be that our universe is the atom of another much, much (understated) larger creature and that creature's universe is an atom in a much, much, much, much (understated) large creature. etc.see? anything is possible. god is as relevant as my thery above: an endless cycle of atoms in atoms in atoms than make up our universe and the infinity more universes. who made these universes? who says it has to be created? i believe it is beyond our comprehension to even begin to comment on it.

Who told you this? If that is true then how would god tell the difference if one moment is exactly like any other moment? If you're in the same instant for an eternity how would you tell the difference? It is quite illogical.Unless the universe has always existed in a repeating cycle of expansion and collapse.Maybe, maybe not.It still agrees with what I'm saying.I had said that that was the same arguement used by creationists to dismiss an old universe. And it is.I haven't as of yet seen you present any credible, verifible, or unbiased evidence to back up what you are asserting.Same god.You forget than I'm an agnostic and that there can be no evidence either way. The burden of proof is not mine, it is yours.People create god in their own image. You're no different. Understandable by whom? Apparently. :)

Just as an aside, heat requires a medium for transmission. The majority of space is a vacuum, therefore it does not transmit heat. However, light does transmit heat in the form of radiation when it hits something.

Yes space is a vaccum but, there is stuff in it. All the planets and asteroids and debris would heat up If the Universe were static the light from all the stars would touch all the planets at all times and things would get sweaty.We'd eventually reach a thermal equilibrium everything would be the same temperature.

Actually the side facing away from from the Sun will freeze solid, but the side facing the Sun will boil, but you'll only have to worry about for a short time since you'll explode from lack of pressure. :)I had heard that he no longer makes such references anymore from the biography on A&E. They got him into too much trouble. :)Though, I found this passage in the ebook version of the book which meantions what I had said about the universe running in a cycle.It is in CHAPTER 3 THE EXPANDING UNIVERSEIn the first kind of Friedmann model, which expands and recollapses, space is bent in on itself, like the surface of the earth. It is therefore finite in extent. In the second kind of model, which expands forever, space is bent the other way, like the surface of a saddle. So in this case space is infinite. Finally, in the third kind of Friedmann model, with just the critical rate of expansion, space is flat (and therefore is also infinite).But which Friedmann model describes our universe? Will the universe eventually stop expanding and start contracting, or will it expand forever? To answer this question we need to know the present rate of expansion of the universe and its present average density. If the density is less than a certain critical value, determined by the rate of expansion, the gravitational attraction will be too weak to halt the expansion. If the density is greater than the critical value, gravity will stop the expansion at some time in the future and cause the universe to recollapse.I have touched on them a little.

quite correct on the freezing/boiling bit. However, it is not heat that is transmitted. The light energy will be quite hot, but only from the light. It is not heat radiated through space. Plus, boiling actually occurs due to lack of pressure as does the explosion of all blood vessels in a very short time. Still, note my apollo 13 example. The capsule was freezing. Even though a part of it faced the sun. That is because heat requires a medium. I don't actually know what Hawking believes, but I do know that he contemplates god.

So therefore there can't be a heat death from a too old a universe. Isn't heat (Caused by IR or microwaves) just another form of radiation? Only in what others interpret on what the universe is. His primary goal was not to find god, or even to prove god's existence, but to find out how the universe "works".

Finding out how the Universe works is key in finding out about God. Stephen Hawking would agree I think because he said:"If we do discover a complete unified theory(of the Universe) , it should be in time understandble in broad principle by everyone not just a few scientists.Then we shall all, philosophers, scientists and just ordinary people be able to take part in the discussion of the question of why it is that we and the Universe exist,If we find the answer to that, it would be hte ultimate triumph of human reason- for then we should know the mind of God.Obviously, Hawking does not feel that the concept of God is illogical any more than I do. "If the Universe was static and infinite in every direction, every line of sight would end in a star, which would make the night sky as bright as the sun"The universe in a nutshell pg 73The Universe is not static, it has not always been here. There was very probably a first cause. "He (Einstein) thought that the Universe might have a previous contracting phase, with a bounce into the present expansion at a fairly moderate density.However, we now knw that i order for nuclear reactions in the early Universe to produce the amounts of light elements we bserve around us, the density must have been at least 10 tons per cubic inch and the temperature 10 billion degrees.Further, observations of the of the microwave background indicate that the density was probably once a trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion tons per cubic inch. We also now know that Einsteins general theory of relativity does not allow the universe to bounce from a contracting phase to the present expansion.As will be discussed in chapter 2, Roger Penrose and I were able to show that general relativity predicts that time has a beginning, although he was never happy with the idea.The Universe in a Nutshell Chp 1 pg 23

I don't think what the Universe has shown us .

It seeks to prove nothing it just lays out the facts and predicts what should come next like any good scientific work should. A first cause without a cause? Is this what you're telling me?Do you think there was a first cause that just happened without reason?"According to St. Augustine, before God created the heaven and the Earth, He did not make anything at all. In fact, this is very close to modern ideas.In General relativity, time and space do not exist independently of the universe or each other...It is quite conceivable that time defined in htis way, within the universe, should have a minimum or maximum value- in other words and beginning or and end. It would make no sense to ask what happened before the beginning or after the end because such times would not be defined."Stephen Hawking again in his book The Universe in a Nutshell Chp2 page 35So if General relativity is correct (and countless experiments say it is) then time and space are inextricably connected and defined by measurements within  the Universe (like inches and seconds)time and space outside the Universe would have no definition. Since God created the Universe then, God must exist outside of the Universe and has no time because according to General relativity (which is supported by countless experiments) time and sppace are inextricably connected and do not exist separate of one another.This is hard for us to grasp since we live within the Universe where there is time just as it is hard for us to grasp the concept of nowhere.This is what I've posted before concerning the expansion and collapse of the Universe.

Given enough time anything will become complex. :)Weren't most of the references in relation to what St Augustine, Newton, and others had said about their interpretations of the universe?It is the same problem with the concept of god as well. Asserting that god was "outside" of time is meaningless. It is nothing more than speculation using belief only as your evidence. And why would god want to create time? Things tend to wear out and there goes your perfect system. :)I just seen the NOVA episode "The Elegant Universe". It is quite interesting and it does present an eternal (multi)universe as one theory. Not quite the same as what I had spoke about, though, but still one.

Actually, I don't know the answer for sure on this one. I believe (from my physics classes) that the universe is much more likely to die cold, not hot. Heat is being lost from kinetic to potential energy all the time. It is Kinetic that makes heat. Light is a form of radiation that does produce heat when it contacts a body. Heat (increased temperature) requires a medium (law of physics) to be conducted. Space is very cold. Apollo 13 folks had temperatures in the area of water freezing during part of the return voyage. One of the crew had a cold and was having a tough time because of the cold. Light itself doesn't have heat. It's radiant energy causes the electrons in other objects to become more excited. It is the movement of these electrons which produces greater kinetic energy and heat. In a vacuum there are very few electrons relative to the empty space and therefore heat is not transmitted. Light radiation produces far less heat than the heat necessary to produce the light. Shine a light on a thermometer for a while and measure the increase in temperature. Then turn on the stove until it gets red (light production) and measure the temperature. I would say do this with the filament of the light bulb (which would be more proper) but if you broke the glass of the bulb the filament would burn up rapidly. Agreed, it was not his primary goal to find god or to prove god. However, He does consider God. The point being, he is willing to consider the possibility.

So therefore there can't be a heat death from a too old a universe. Isn't heat (Caused by IR or microwaves) just another form of radiation? Only in what others interpret on what the universe is. His primary goal was not to find god, or even to prove god's existence, but to find out how the universe "works".

So, it could still oscillate over great expanses of time and noit produce the heat death which some assert? Dispite its name a cold isn't caused by being cold. It is caused by a virus. ;) I remember reading somewhere that if a body were suddenly exposed to space, without protection, that the side facing the Sun would boil and the side facing away would freeze. Plus, the thermal shields on the shuttle aren't just to protect the ship on takeoff and re-entry either. They protect the side which faces the Sun as well from the heat. Space itself doesn't produce, or absorb heat, but any object in it can absorb it and thus "heat up". An example is when you go out on a "sunny" day. the "heat" you are feeling is actually ultraviolet and IR as well as other "harmful" radiation. A sunburn in reality is a radiation burn as if one walked into a nuclear reactor. The Earth's magnetic field and O-Zone layer is all that is protecting us from getting fully "cooked". Mars doesn't have a strong magnetic field or O-Zone layer. At a few inches off of the surface it would be a comfortable temp for us, but above that in the day it is quite high, and at night quite low. Enough to roast and freeze any unprotected life. Visible light is only a very small part of what the Sun produces.Maybe, but most likely not in the same context as some would like. :)

Actually, I don't know the answer for sure on this one. I believe (from my physics classes) that the universe is much more likely to die cold, not hot. Heat is being lost from kinetic to potential energy all the time. It is Kinetic that makes heat. Light is a form of radiation that does produce heat when it contacts a body. Heat (increased temperature) requires a medium (law of physics) to be conducted. Space is very cold. Apollo 13 folks had temperatures in the area of water freezing during part of the return voyage. One of the crew had a cold and was having a tough time because of the cold. Light itself doesn't have heat. It's radiant energy causes the electrons in other objects to become more excited. It is the movement of these electrons which produces greater kinetic energy and heat. In a vacuum there are very few electrons relative to the empty space and therefore heat is not transmitted. Light radiation produces far less heat than the heat necessary to produce the light. Shine a light on a thermometer for a while and measure the increase in temperature. Then turn on the stove until it gets red (light production) and measure the temperature. I would say do this with the filament of the light bulb (which would be more proper) but if you broke the glass of the bulb the filament would burn up rapidly. Agreed, it was not his primary goal to find god or to prove god. However, He does consider God. The point being, he is willing to consider the possibility.

Correct. Ask any physics professor if a medium is needed to transmit heat.I am well aware of that. My point was not that it causes a cold but can make one worse which it did. Have you seen the movie or read the account? You will find it educational and very exciting.You are correct here. However, please note below, my argument that points out the the heat necessary to produce the light is far less than the heat produced by contact with llight. The boiling is caused not just by the minimal heat produced by the light but by the actual lack of pressure. The pressure on the inside is much higher than on the outside. A similar thing happens when divers ascend to quickly, the nitrogen in their blood simply boils out.I will need to read this again to comment on this.

I believe in Religion, Albert Einstein once said the more he studied the solar system the more he believed in a higher power. I mean we all didn't get here from nothing; the solar system didn't just create itself did it? If you believe the solar system created itself then you’re more screwed up than most think you are.My reasons for believing in religion are as simply put as night and day, Religion is what keeps us at peace; if we follow the rules of the bible "catholic bible" we really would not have many problems in the world today. Problem today is we have too many that want to change the rules "liberals" and when they see something that is going to stand in the way of what they want to accomplish, there going to try and separate Religion from State and corrupt the world even further if its accomplished. Ask anyone that believes in God and goes to church, how to you feel about yourself in general? What is your opinion of who you are? Then ask an atheist the same questions and compare notes. The only way to be truly happy in the world is “faith” easy as that.Its always easier in life to be bad than it is to be good.

True, it was not a big bang. I realize this, but since it is the common term I made use of it. No one mentioned Christianity or Judaism until you did. Since you brought it upChristianity is about love, goodness and faith. So is Judaism. These religions only deal with the human plight: they are not scientific theories, they are not arguments. QUOTE]There is nothing to say that the universe itself couldn't have always existed as well and goes through cycles of expansion and collaspes over and over again.[/QUOTE]Where does this idea come from? I have never heard it before. The Big Expansion theory is the only explanation I know of. Besides if the universe has always existed than why hasn't it heated up from all the stars?Why isn't the light from the stars reaching us twenty-four seven?You're saying that believeing in God is illogical. I'm showing you that it's not. There are scientific ideas that prove that God could exist and that belief in God is not illogical.

It’s the same thing if you ask me. God isn't evil is he? Then he must be a Christian right?

I love it! He assumes I am a Christian, even though I in no way even mentioned Christianity in my argument.Since you sound like your about twelve, let me explain a bit more. Christianity and God are separate. I do not base my belief in God because of Christianity. I base my type of God on Christianity. But what am I trying to prove to you? I am trying to prove that there is a God, not that there is a Christian God.
