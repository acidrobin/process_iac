As a staunch Roman Catholic, I am Pro-Life. However, I am also consistant in my concern for the needy. It ticks me off when conservative Republicans who consistently oppose the efforts of liberal Democrats to help the poor, the homeless, the uninsured, the underpaid, and minorities of all kinds, trot out Christ's teaching about helping "the least of these my brothers" to support their anti-abortion views! Why can't the advocates of justice for the homeless, for minorities, for the uninsured, the imprisoned, for victims of various kinds of abuse get the kind of attention that abortion gets?

WE should have never invaded Germany. We should have dealt with America's abuse issues before the holocaust, or at least as your same argument goes. I'm also a staunch Roman Catholic, and personally, Abortion is far more an important issue than Abuse and homelessness. Don't get me wrong; abuse and homelessness are serious issues, but we take care of that. There are no Catholic orders who's goal is to stop abortion; Missionaries of Charity, Vincent DePaul Society, Franciscans, Dominicans, occationally Jesuits (hiss) and even diocisans (no order) help the poor, and it is their MISSION to help the poor. Abortion is also needed to fight. I would rather be poor and hungry than killed before I can get a chance to change my life.

Here's some good pro-choice banter I picked up from some of my friends, as well as from www.liberalslikechirst.orgThere is not now, nor will there ever be, a scientific instrument that will be able to detect the presence of a human soul or a human person at any stage of development of human beings, ( including the stage that you and I are at). Pro-Life people look at the limited evidence, like the early appearance of the physical characteristics of human beings in the fetus, and they say "the glass is half full", jumping to the conclusion that there is a human soul there. Pro-Choice people look at the same evidence and say "the glass is half-empty", and there is no human person there. Science cannot prove the ABSENCE of human souls any more than it can prove their presence. This entitles BOTH SIDES to believe whatever they choose (on grounds other than RATIONAL PROOF), but it doesn't entitle them to use politics to impose their views through legislation on others. If people believe that God is all knowing and that the Bible is God's Word, how do they explain the fact that neither the God of the Old Testament nor Jesus used even ONE of the 31,173 verses of the Bible to tell the world that abortion is the killing of a human being ? Was it because God didn't know that human life begins at conception? God didn't know that abortions were being performed from ancient times (with herbs and the like)? God didn't know or care that, without CLEAR condemnations of this practice, billions of innocent human beings over the centuries would be killed and billions of adults would be murderers themselves, or accessories to murder? God was squeamish about sex? God didn't have the courage it takes to attack popular sins? Why do Americans allow some people to transform an issue which is not even MENTIONED in the Hebrew or the Christian Bibles into THE SINGLE MOST PRESSING MORAL ISSUE OF OUR TIME?

Wait........you KNOW that that is what is going on inside a pro-choice person's head.............why? Not all people have the same feelings for being pro-choice. I am still very much pro-choice because I believe that I should be allowed to abort a child. There are still times when I WOULD abort a child, like if having the baby would kill me, or if it was probable that the shild would only live for a week, or if it had some debilitating disease for which there is no cure. I don't want the child, so if you think that I should not be allowed to take that child, will you take him/her? Or would you rather it end up in a dumpster?No, I myself would need some pretty big reasons to abort a child, more than just a broken condom. BUT, I am not God, and more likely than not, neither are you. I would also venture to guess that you are not a supreme dictator of the human race. Assuming that both of these statements are true, you have no right to tell other people whether or not they have choice over their bodies. Just because we THINK it's wrong, doesn't mean we have precedence over every other human and their choices. I am not pro-life, or pro-abortion, I am pro-choice because I believe that it is every woman's CHOICE as to whether they want to get an abortion or not.

Well, this is an interesting thread to have a real hot abortion debate...Chai, I would like to suggest something to you. Since you already have an aversion to abortion, I fancy I may be able to convince you. Like Phat Albert said, science cannot prove when a human recieves a soul. Since we cannot prove this, is it not "better safe than sorry" and just to ban abortion? This is a question of life. The interests of the mother cannot be allowed to overrule the child's right to life, before or after birth.

The Roe v. Wade decision was predicated on two suppositions: the assumption that the fetus was not a "person," and the assumption that a woman's right to privacy included the liberty to terminate her pregnancy on demand. The Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment declares that no state shall "deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law." Because the personhood of the fetus was so critical to the outcome of the case, the outstanding question during the Roe hearings was "when does life begin?" That question, however, was not resolved and instead, setting it aside, the Roe Court assumed that the fetus was not a "person," and handed down a decision saying that "[i]f this suggestion of personhood is established, [Roe's] case, of course, collapses, for the fetus' right to life would then be guaranteed specifically by the [14th] Amendment." Because of this clause, Roe should be reexamined. In 1981, internationally known geneticists and biologists addressed the question of when life begins in a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee hearing. Dr. Micheline M. Mathews-Roth, of Harvard Medical School, gave testimony, supported by reference from over 20 embryology and other medical textbooks, that human life began at conception. Dr. Jerome Lejeune, the "Father of Modern Genetics," testified: "To accept the fact that after fertilization has taken place a new human has come into being is no longer a matter of taste or opinion ... it is plain experimental evidence." Dr. McCarthy de Mere, a medical doctor and University of Tennessee law professor, testified: "The exact moment of the beginning of personhood and of the human body is at the moment of conception." "Calling human beings "embryos" or "fetuses" serves the same purpose as calling them "adolescents" or "adults." These scientific terms are used to indicate where a person is in his or her development. They were never meant to imply that the unborn child is not human. As the "infant" is different from the "adolescent" in terms of development and dependence, so the "fetus" is different from the "infant." Yet all are genetically human, and therefore persons." ~From Language of Illusion: The Abortion Slogans At conception, all 46 human chromosomes are present, beginning a unique human life. Twenty one days later, the fetus' heart is pumping the baby's own blood through a closed circulatory system. Brain waves can be recorded 42 days, or six weeks, after conception. By eight weeks, although still weighing less than one ounce all body systems are present. Eighteen weeks after conception, the baby can turn somersaults, grasp objects with his hands, dream, and cry. At 25 weeks, 79 % of babies survive a premature birth. From the start, this life is clearly not just a part of the mother, but an individual person entitled to the rights of life, liberty and pursuit of happiness. Justice Rehnquist wrote in his dissent to Roe:"I have difficulty in concluding… that the right to "privacy" is involved in this case…. A transaction resulting in an operation such as [an abortion] is not "private" in the ordinary usage of that word. Nor is the "privacy" that the Court finds here even a distant relative of the freedom from searches and seizures protected by the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, which the Court has referred to as embodying a right to privacy."Unenumerated rights cannot take precedent over enumerated rights; a child's right to life preempts a woman's "right" to an abortion. Because abortion involves the purposeful termination of human life, it must be recognized as different in kind from other "privacy" rights protected in earlier cases.

Liberty~Your quotes and speeches were all very nice, and they have certainly convinced me that a fetus may very well be alive when it is in the mothers womb. That there is no question of. I still, however, believe in two things that still make me keep my views. 1. Mental & social health is just as important as physical health. It is a nature vs. nurture argument. I personally believe that if a baby is going to be aborted the mother is not ready/able to take care of it. How many Albert Einsteins have come from single mother families with young mothers who didn't want the child? Now, how many murderers/rapists/gang leaders, etc. have come from these households? Even if one does have a right to life, one would think, what kind of life is one where you are not wanted?2. Judging from your attempt to persuade me, I would venture to guess that you are pro-life. I am, obviously pro-choice, but not because I believe that a broken condom is a reason to kill a fetus. As stated before, I have pretty high standards to meet before I would even consider aborting a child inside me. However, I am not morally better or superior to anyone else, so why should I force my beliefs on them? Abortion may or may not be morally wrong. But we're debating legality here.

Chai,I think you missed the entire point of my argument. Roe was based on the idea that the fetus was NOT a person. I quoted the clause from Roe that said that if the personhood of the fetus were established, Roe would collapse. We know that the fetus is a person...therefore, Roe should be overturned. Your statements about the "Mental & social health" of the mother and the part about "unwanted" babies, etc. don't stand up very well when you consider the fact that another person is going to DIE. Abortion doesn't solve a mother's problems of any kind. It doesn't help her mental health, certainly not her physical health, and it doesn't even keep her from being a mother; it just makes her the mother of a dead baby. Adoptive parents are waiting for those "unwanted" babies. I didn't mention Einsteins, or thugs. On the legal side, Roe should never have been imposed on the ENTIRE nation by the will of five justices on the Supreme Court. Such legislation by an UNELECTED body is tyranny.

Imposed? I don't think imposed is exactly the right word. Just because you don't want to give up your baby doesn't make you supreme. And, last time I checked, the fetus was inside the mother, and whether it is alive or not, it is still a part of the mother's body. It may resemble a person since it has a brain, a heartbeat, etc., but how can one consider it a person if it's stillin its mother's body??Just to make it interesting, who ever said that one had a RIGHT to life, anyway??

My two cents: I'm pro-choice. I definitely do NOT support abortion just because of a broken condom, like Chai said, but in cases such as rape, the child is diseased and won't live anyway, or the child will kill the mother, then I believe that abortion is probably the best thing for the fetus and the mother. But I also don't think women should get abortions after the 22nd week, as that's when the fetus becomes capable of thought. Before then, you're only destroying the potential for a child, which is has pretty much the same result as abstinence, birth control, etc. And even if it's after the 22nd week, it's still the mother's choice.Just my two cents (I said that already, didn't I?)

So basically you're saying that we seperate humans from non-humans based upon the ability to think independently? Some humans can "think"better than others, so you're saying that we can groups humans into different levels of "humanity". So, mentally handicapped people are barely human, while MENSA members are at the top of ladder.You say that the potential at 21 weeks is no different than the potential that birth control, etc. A sperm is not a human being, an egg is not a human being. I ask you this, what is that mysterious little clump of cells in the womb? And don't say a clump of cells, because that's what we all are.

All I think she's trying to say is that if it's not really alive it's not as bad as killing a baby who can control it's actions, and can think.

no, that's not what I mean. It's not like it's fine to kill anything. I'm not going to walk up to someone in a coma and kill them just because they can't control their actions and think as good as everyone else. It's just better than walking up to a person walking down the road and stabbing them in the back. It's just if you got pregnant 'cause of rape or something, don't you think it would be better toget an abortion when the baby can't really think, etc. I know it's still bad, but it's better. That's all I think she's trying to say, and if not, that's what I say.

No actually I don't think it is any better to kill a person in a coma than just walking up and "stabbing them in the back".I don;t think that there are varying degress of "wrongness" when it comes to killing someone. You've stated that it is a human. You've stated that you're killing it. How can you say that it's "better"? Better than what? Waiting until the child is 15 to kill them?There's nothing "better" about it, the only difference is that you feel "better" killing something that you can't identify with. Yes it's far easier to kill someone while their in a coma than when they're walking down the street. You don't have to look in their eyes, listen to them plead, feel them struggle, etc. They just lie there. Same with an unborn child.

Chai, if you believe that the fetus is alive, than that fetus has a right to life as protected by the 5th Amendment. "There is no question of it." So since you want to argue the legality, under the constitution, abortion is illegal. This isn't a question of being "morally superior" or not. This is a question of right and wrong. to theLIBERTARIAN: First let's establish that abortion is right or wrong.

Patriot, thanks for commenting.Abortion is more than wrong. In fact wrong enough to possibly be illegal. I have been pro-Abortion my whole life. A couple of years ago something happened to change that view. If something is illegal, people will be punished. Otherwise, why have a law. My dilemma: If a woman takes a pill and aborts a fetus (commits murder), should she be executed or spend the rest of her life in prison?

I agree with... well heck, I agree with all of you pro-LIFE people. Killing someone in a coma and stabbing somone in the back when they're walking down the street are not any different in "wrongness." Actually, if we had any pity left in our evil hearts, we would most likely find it harder to kill someone in a coma, BECAUSE of the fact that they can't protect themselves or think! Of course, if we had any pity, abortion wouldn't even be an issue. It is murder. If people can get the death penalty for murdering an grown person that is fully capable of defending themselves (at least, they used to get the death penalty), then why not a child that hasn't even breathed the air of this world yet? In my opinion, abortion should be illegal. LovetheSouth

ok, ok. I see ur point, and I don't really think there is an amount of "wrongness" (anymore ;) ) but if someone didn't mean to get pregnant and they're not ready to have a kid (like if they're 12 and were raped) then I think if u have to, then get an abortion, but not just 'cause you didn't have enough condems or it broke or something. Pay the penalty and don't kill an innocent baby, but you HAVE to then you have to. I don't think anyone SHOULD unless they absolutly NEED to.

there are no degrees of wrongness in killing? So if someone is attacking e with intent to kill, I'm not allowed to kill them to defend myself? I should just let myself be killed? In the heat of the moment, it's not always possible to simply incapacitate someone, escpecially if they're hellbent on killing you. I still don't understand this though: we care so much about a fetus, which had a potential for life, but which can't even live on it's own for long periods of time, but we don't want a woman, who already has a life and can live outside of it's mother's womb, to live because eventhough having the child will more than likely kill her, abortion is completely wrong? I know this isn't all scenarios, or even most of them, but according to what most people are saying, this woman would be sentanced to die.

Liberty it’s not really an argument, it is more of a dilemma, because I don’t like abortion and would like it stopped (unless the mother is in danger). If abortion is murder, should not the women that takes a pill and aborts the fetus be tried in court and if found guilty of premeditated murder be sentenced to death, or at least life in prison? By the way thanks for replying to my post Liberty.

You have reached quite a dilemma. I am against abortion. I am for the death penalty. To some people, this may seem quite a contradiction of myself, but I assure you, it is not. In an abortion, the person who dies has not done anything to "merit" death. In the case of rape, abortion is killing the wrong person. The rapist, not the child, should be executed. In the area you are struggling with, I'll tell you a true story. In very early American history, (I think it was in the 1600s) a woman killed her child as soon as it was born by smashing it against the floor. She was convicted of murder, sentenced, and executed. Abortion is the same thing, dispite the fact that it is now called a "safe and legal" procedure, and is performed in a hospital or clinic. Is killing a person any better when it is done in a hospital by someone wearing a mask and gloves? I think not. Abortion kills the innocent; the death penalty executes the guilty.

Crim,What is the difference between killing a baby a day before it is born, and killing it a day after? I don't think there is one. If there is something wrong with the way the dealth penalty is executed, (pun intended) then fix that problem, don't just get rid of the death penalty. Abortion can just about occur on new borns. Partial Birth Abortion is used up until delivery. Chai, According to your logic, if a woman can abort for trivial reasons, then abortion should be legal until the "fetus" is 18 years old. If the mother thinks before the child is born, that the child will bother her health, she can pay to have the child "legally" killed. Lets say that after the child is born, it bothers the mother's health. "My kid was driving me crazy today...I believe I'll abort him." So, why not have abortion until 18 years of age? "THAT'S MURDER!!" some will cry. But, I think it's just as much murder to kill a child in the womb at any stage.

Not that adoption is a bad choice or doesn't always work, but in your version of the world, the adoption program would be swamped with all the children who couldn't get aborted, so chances would be that I wouldn't get adopted.

To the person who said there were no Bible verses saying abortion is murder-Check out:Psalms 51:5Psalms 139:13Jeremiah 1:5Also, if you know the Bible really well, you will know of the story in Luke (1:44) that talks about when Elizabeth's baby "lept in her womb." When that part of the Bible was translated, the same word was used for baby in that sense as was used for child when Jesus said, "Let the children come to me."They are both children, and both human. Abortion is indeed murder.

Once again, I am pro-life. That arguement was one I picked up from some of my pro-choice friends and from liberalslikechirst.org. I have been aware of those verses for a while. Ps 51:5 ("Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me") is the best one because sinfulness is a spiritual rather than a physical condition. This implies that David had a spiritual nature since his conception.

Pro choice. A question for all of you pro-life people: are you also CO's? (concientious objectors). The way you put it, every soldier in every army is also a murderer. I will state this again. There is more to life than simply being alive. Maybe you don't realize it, but people in other countries HAVE to kill their babies, or give them up to starvation. Wouldn't you rather that a seven year old child die of painful starvation, or be aborted while still a fetus? Sure, in America and other first world countries we don't have as much of a problem, but can you honesly say that each and every child born in a first world country has a garuantee of even a halfway decent life? Sometimes, abortion is more of a mercy killing than murder. "The parents should take responsibility and not have sex" That's a very wonderful idea, and in a perfect world, I would agree. However, if you haven't noticed, we are far from a perfect world, and that theory applied only leads to more trouble. How would you like to go through life knowing you were an unwanted mistake? And don't think that parents will "instantly love their child and regret ever thinking of abortion". Welcome to the real world. People can be mean and ugly, and they won't hesitate to get rid of a baby any way possible, including killing it. Even if they don't kill the baby and give it up for adoption, imagine the huge influx of babies from people if everyone who was pro-life got their way, and made abortion illegal. What is the system supposed to do with them? And if a woman is raped? Sure, the baby didn't do anything wrong, and so therefore shouldn't be punished, but should you also punish the mother every day of the rest of her life by reminding her about that baby? By not letting her let go of it, by saying 'too bad. You have to keep the baby, because killing it is a crime, but punishing you for the man's crime isn't"? While I myself would not abort a child simply because I was irresponsible, I am not God, and I won't impose my morals on other people, who live a different life than I do, that have different experiences than I do. Just because you would have had that baby doesn't mean the other person has to.

Irregardless of anyones religion or beliefs women have the right to choose what's best for their body. The government cannot force religious beliefs or morals on the people.There's plenty of gray area in regards to abortion. You can argue one way or another when it's socially acceptable and when it's not. For me it's black and white, women have the right to choose whether that's the choice I would make or not personally is not the point.I ask you as potential parents, what would you do when faced with an unwanted pregnancy? No one truly knows what they would do until it happens to them. You can't tell me that the most religious prolife family in the world would not consider abortion for their 14 year old pregnant daughter.

What kind of a working relationship are you talking about? The only working relationship I can think of that would allow for there to be any sex at all is called marriage. If you do not have sex, you can be 100% sure you will not get pregnant. But of course, that is beside the point. If abortion is wrong, there is no contingency by which it could be right.

From my perspective it's not.The point. All of the before mentioned clumps of cells are not human beings. ”Life is a state of a cell or organism characterized by capacity for metabolism, growth, reaction to stimuli, and reproduction. A fetus is life, just as an embryo, a sperm, an ant, an acorn, and a tree, are all life. All these forms of life have no rights. The characteristic of life is necessary to possess rights, but it alone is insufficient.Characteristic of a human being: independent physiological existence. A fetus is human, in the sense that it contains human DNA; however, a fetus, like an embryo, is not a human being, as it has no means of independent physiological existence (as does a baby, child, or adult). As such, it is a potential human being, just like an acorn is a potential oak tree. It contains all of the DNA of an oak tree, but it is not an oak tree.” http://www.abortionisprolife.comI would venture to say that most anti-abortion activist allow their emotions, morals, personal beliefs, and religions to fuel their debates. When debating whether or not abortion should be legal one cannot allow religion or personal beliefs into the equation. Our laws and government are not governed by religion. Society must respect everyone's personal beliefs from atheists to Christians. But keep in mind just because some people are pro-abortion does not mean that they are atheists.The laws govern human rights. Society must decide whether or not an embryo or fetus is a human being or not. If it's not then it doesn't have human rights by law. Therefore, abortion is not murder. signed,avoiceofreasonhttp://www.abortionisprolife.com

Poet, What is your definition of a "relationship?" Is it a life-long committment in marriage, a boyfriend-girlfriend dating period...and how narrow is your definition of a strong/good relationship? Do you propose that sex is a necessity or simply one component of a good relationship? That is, would a good relationship be one that is good enough to survive even without the good sex? Say your partner gets paralzyed and loses sexual function. Is your relationship good enough to stay? Maybe they get a traumatic brain injury and their leg muscles tighten up so much that they can't have sex. Is there still a good relationship? So can a young or old relationship have physical attraction while abstaining from sex and still be strong/good? I think Gilligan is the voice of failure and cynicism when he states that premarital sex is an inevitability. If you are a parent then you are creating a self-fulfilling prophecy for your kids that will bring on serious consequences. Just some semi-random thoughts.

Voice of reason,Unlike a mole, or a kidney, a tumor, the zygote/embryo/fetus/baby has a distinct and separate genetic code establishing it as an entity different from its mother. It is more properly a living being in symbiosis with another living being. It is not a part of the woman's body.Furthermore, If independent physiologic existence is the requirement for personhood does a person requiring mechanical ventilation for a short period of time lose his rights? There are quite a few more examples of this across age groups.The theory of life and independence being the requisites for personhood and rights is faulty.

Making abortion illegal will reduce the number of abortions, and put in prison those who do them or attempt to get them.When people aren't trained, they can't do them. Why would someone want to risk their life to get rid of a child when they know the person isn't trained and may not do it right?Also, you have the issue of cost. With abortions illegal, they will cost a lot more. Some people will choose not to have an abortion solely because it will cost too much money.I agree with making adoption easier, but I think it needs to be used in conjunction with illegalizing abortion.

That's true. Sorry, I spoke without thinking. (again!) What I meant was that some wouldn't know the proper way to do them, and would be in it only for the money. If you've never had an abortion before, you wouldn't know who actually knew the procedure and who would just try to kill the baby through any means possible without regard to the mother's health. I'll deal with these two together:Robbery is illegal, yet we still have people who rob.Murder is illegal, yet we still have people who murder.The basic idea is that we make thing illegal to reduce the number of people who do those, and then we reduce it further by enforcing the law and issuing fines or jail sentences to those who do. We'll never stop people from having abortions all together, but we can reduce it by making it illegal.And how many people actually do that?

What I was going for was that making abortions illegal simply makes it more dangerous. Let me get the rest of this straight: Those in the pro-life camp stress heavily that every life is important, and that abortion is like murder. However, if a mother is killed trying to abort her fetus illegaly, it serves her right? If a mother is killed through a complication of an unwanted pregnancy, it was her fault for not remaining celibate? Perhaps I'm just easily confused.

If you want to argue the personhood of the fetus, go find someone else. I don't particularly care whether you consider it "alive", or "human", or "having a soul". My point was that the baby's life isn't the only one at stake, and that there is more to having a life than simply being alive.

Maximus,I agree the zygote/embryo/fetus/baby has a distinct and separate genetic code establishing it as an entity different from its mother. This only proves that it is a living organism. The fetus is a part of the mother. It is a parasite living off the mother’s nutrients just like a tapeworm. A zygote/embryo/fetus or tapeworm are living organisms, neither are human beings; they act as parasites.“The fetus is physically within the mother and connected to her via the placenta and umbilical chord. It is directly physically dependent on the mother for all of its life sustaining needs-oxygen, energy and safety from the external environment. The relationship between mother and fetus is not that of two distinct human entities, but rather that of an independent human being (the mother) with rights and a dependent physical appendage, something that is physically within and part of the mother and therefore cannot have individual rights.Individual rights cannot be granted to the parts of human entities-to do so would make a surgeon a murderer when he removes a healthy kidney from a patient for an organ transplant, an internist a murderer when he poisons a tapeworm to achieve its removal from a patient's intestine, a dermatologist a killer when he removes a mole from a patient's face.” Richard G. Parker, MD runs Objectivist Issues in Medicine (OIM). Richard G. Parker, MD is an Objectivist emergency physician in Dallas, Texas.The issue of abortion is dependent on the law that governs the people. We must establish who has rights the mother or the zygote/embryo/fetus. Human beings are granted rights qua man’s status as a rational animal, not a qua animal.”The essential distinction between man and all other animals is his rational faculty and it is this quality which confers political rights. In other words, man has rights by virtue of "rational living entity," not by virtue of "living entity."Most (if not all) animals move and have sensations. The view that the unborn fetus has rights because of its ability to move and sense, by logical extension, is tantamount to arguing that all animals (and some plants) have rights. In other words, if you ate steak and potatoes yesterday you are a co-conspirator in murder and a cannibal.The basis for individual rights lies in man's nature as a rational animal, as a living being with a volitional consciousness (free will). The concept of individual rights can therefore only be properly understood in the context of a RATIONAL INDEPENDENT ENTITY, not in the context of a living thing with rudimentary sensations.” Richard G. Parker, MD runs Objectivist Issues in Medicine (OIM). Richard G. Parker, MD is an Objectivist emergency physician in Dallas, Texas.So, if a pro-lifer can prove that a zygote/embryo/fetus is a rational independent entity then and only then will they have rights by law. Otherwise, to give rights to a zygote/embryo/fetus means you are giving rights to a living organism who is not a rational independent entity. This in turn will condemn a major part of the population who would now be found guilty of murder for eating a plant or animal, which are both living organisms.Furthermore, if rights are given to living organisms (zygote/embryo/fetus) will women who've had a miscarriage be charged with attempted murder? Will they be charged for pre-meditated murder because their body conspired to commit murder with pre-meditated intent by aborting the zygote/embryo/fetus? Will these women be called down to the local police station and interrogated for lifting an object that clearly their gynecologist told them not to lift for risk of miscarriage? Will the gynecologist's record be used in a court of law because it clearly states on their patient records that they were foreworned to not lift heavy objects? etc. I think you get the point.To answer your question in regards to:”If independent physiologic existence is the requirement for personhood does a person requiring mechanical ventilation for a short period of time lose his rights? There are quite a few more examples of this across age groups.The theory of life and independence being the requisites for personhood and rights is faulty.” MaximusOnce again a human being has rights because they are a rational independent entity. When a human being requires mechanical ventilation they do not stop being a rational independent entity. Therefore, they still have rights. For a human being to choose whether they want mechanical ventilation or not does depend on wither they have decision-making capacity or not.“The principle of patient autonomy requires that physicians respect the decision to forego life-sustaining treatment of a patient who possesses decision-making capacity. Life-sustaining treatment is any treatment that serves to prolong life without reversing the underlying medical condition. Life-sustaining treatment may include, but is not limited to, mechanical ventilation, renal dialysis, chemotherapy, antibiotics, and artificial nutrition and hydration.A competent, adult patient may, in advance, formulate and provide a valid consent to the withholding or withdrawal of life-support systems in the event that injury or illness renders that individual incompetent to make such a decision. A patient may also appoint a surrogate decision maker in accordance with state law. “ American Medical AssociationREFERENCES:http://www.abortionisprolife.com/http://www.ama-assn.org/http://capmag.com/article.asp?ID=2160For those with religious beliefs that choose to bring your morals into this debate, may I remind you that pro-abortion activists support your first ammendment rights. Is it too much to ask that you support women's rights to choose?THE FIRST AMENDMENT "Congress shall make no laws respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances."

Chai,I’m glad you admit that the baby’s life IS at stake. We all know how intimately the mother is involved.There is more to life than simply being alive but should this life be snuffed before having a chance to be more than simply alive? There is more to having a life than simply being alive but there is also more to taking a life than a simple sterile antiseptic “medical” procedure that is compared to removing a tumor. There is more than the euphemisms of “reproductive freedom,” “termination of a pregnancy,” or “abortion” will cloak. There is more left afterwards that the mother must deal with alone most of the time.

Voice of reason,You contradict yourself. You state in the 1st sentence that you agree the "being" is a different entity than its mother as established by separate genetic code. Then in the 2nd sentence you state that the separate entity is a part of the mother. Then you say, "A zygote/embryo/fetus or tapeworm are living organisms, neither are human beings." If the zygote/embryo/fetus has the genetic code of a human then how does it suddenly become a different species? It is human as established by genetic code. It is living as established by growth and development.The points above establish why removing a fetus/embryo/zygote is not like removing a kidney, mole, tapeworm. It is the removal of a distinct albeit dependent human life. The being is not a part of a human entity but a distinct human entity.Now, does the being's dependence on the mother forfeit its rights? If so then does an 80 year old helpless grandmother, a down-syndrome adolescent, a 2 week old birthed baby lose their rights?Does the dominance of the mother over the being negate its rights? One can use the same examples as above.Does the location or proximity of the being forfeit its rights? Do you forfeit your rights when you go into someone else's home?

Voice of Reason,I think that Mr. Parker needs to go back to medical school by the way. I forgot to include that in my last post.Do you propose to allow the extermination all those in nursing homes, insane asylums, homes for the mentally retarded due to not meet the criteria of a Rational Independent Entity? Do you propose to allow the extermination of all those under the age of 2 years or so due to not meeting those criteria? I think it is Mr. Parker who will be condemning a major part of the population if he uses these criteria for rights.

Voice of reason,Sorry for yet another post but you did bring up quite a few issues in your post.1.http://www.abortionisprolife.com/ -- I think they are in the habit of calling evil good.2."Abortion is a moral right—which should be left to the sole discretion of the woman involved; morally, nothing other than her wish in the matter is to be considered. Who can conceivably have the right to dictate to her what disposition she is to make of the functions of her body?" — Ayn Rand The problem is that pregnancy is not a function of the woman's body brought about solely by the woman. It is a state that protects and develops a product of two people--a man and a woman. (Another proof that the fetus is not a part of the mother).Yet a man has no say in the matter. He cannot save his child if he wants to. And most accuse the pro-lifers of being inconsiderate. Ayn Rand's quote sounds pretty selfish to me.3. RE: THE FIRST AMENDMENT "Congress shall make no laws respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances."The DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain UNALIENABLE Rights, that among these are LIFE, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." THE FIRST OF THESE IS LIFE! “That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes DESTRUCTIVE of these ends, it is the RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE TO ALTER OR TO ABOLISH IT, AND TO INSTITUTE NEW GOVERNMENT, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their SAFETY AND HAPPINESS." 4. "The issue of abortion is dependent on the law that governs the people." No issue is dependent on the law to the point that it goes unchallenged or unquestioned. The law does not govern, people govern. The law is made by people. In the instance of abortion, a few people sitting on the supreme court. The law does not tell you that rape or murder or anything else is immoral. If rape and murder was legal than it would not become moral. It would remain detestable, cruel and immoral.

No, you're not only putting words into my mouth, you're also making up things about religious beliefs. The Bible tells us not to have premarital sex (once you get married, you can have all the sex you want, so what's the problem) because the one of the results are problems like unwanted pregnancies, among others. If every teenager stayed abstinent, there would be very little use for abortion centers, but, as I said before you misquoted me, it's easy for irresponsible and stupid teenagers do whatever they want, as long as someone else suffers the consequences.

Maximus,I don't have a really set or concerete opinion on abortion because its such a controversial subject. Its a tough one. ;) "1. What, in your opinion, is the solution to abortion? (If you think one is needed)"- If I was against abortion, (except in the cases of rape, incest, and when the baby poses a threat to the mother), I'm not sure. Making it illegal is an option, and this would certainly discourage abortions but of course you still have people who try to do it illegaly which is not safe."2. Why is it respectable not to have sex before marriage?"- I said that meaning that I'm not going to make fun of someone who does (as some would). A study showed that its very common among highschool boys to pressure others into having sex (with girlfriends), that is a partial reason to them doing so anyways. "3. What kind of relationship do you think is the most stable and healthy for children to be raised?"- Two loving parents who can devote time to the child and his well being.

Poet, I agree with you on many points. We agree that making abortion illegal might cut down on the number of abortions because it would discourage some from having them. We agree that the best place for children is in a home with two loving parents. We agree that sex can make a relationship stronger. We agree though that sex is not a necessity that the couple cannot do without. (I think I have gotten all of this correct so far).Would you also agree that decreasing the number of people having sex in times when they are not ready for children might also cut down on the number of abortions? Maybe this is not the entire solution but it is a reasonable start. I think this was the point Habbit was trying to make although I am not trying to speak for him/her. Perhaps, Habbit was not saying that you should only have sex when you want a child but that you should only have sex if you are accepting of a child. Gilligan conceded that children are the natural fruit of sex sometimes even when various birth control interventions are used to prevent this. So maybe people have sex due to love or due to the desire to achieve that stronger relationship. Kids are not their aim. But kids are a known result of the sexual act. So, whether you use birth control methods that fail or do not use anything, if you are having sex then should you be accepting of the natural consequence of your actions, the natural fruit of the sexual act?You and Gilligan look at the issue as an observation of the whole and say that people will have sex no matter what. There will always be people having sex. I concede that this may well be a current fact but not an immutable, eternal fact. It can change. I think that your suggestion is that we need other ways to deal with the fruit of sex than abstinence due to the fact that there will always be people having sex. But how do we deal with this on a practical level? Let’s say you are a parent and your kid is reaching the age of adolescence. Do you tell him that he has no chance to resist the physical urges of his body and that he/she should go out and do what all people do? Or do you not say anything to your child about sex and let him figure it out on his own with the possibility that he will meet kids having sex and think that all kids do it? On a practical level this will become a dangerous self-fulfilling prophecy that I spoke of to Gilligan. I am guessing that you would say that neither of the above options would be the best parenting. Let’s go to the next step. You may tell your kid that sex is “natural” but he should use a condom or birth control pill (which I propose makes the sex not very “natural” but these are semantics for a different thread). Again this can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Maybe this advice will protect them a little bit more than an outright reckless apathy or encouragement of unprotected sex though. But as we have established sometimes even these methods do not prevent pregnancy (or STDs). So what is the best advice a parent can give to his child about sex outside of a permanent, committed relationship? I propose it is abstinence. So what is the best path to lead people to achieve this type of relationship? Can you agree that abstinence is not the only method but definitely the best method in practical terms of negating peer pressure and preventing STD, unwanted pregnancy, emotional baggage, and even abortion? What is the best path to lead your child on that will show him the idea that you already have—that the best place for a child is in a home with two loving parents? I cannot think of any adverse side effects of abstinence. It is fullproof. Until you and PARENTS see this as the most appropriate method on a practical level then it will continue to be an ideal that is not a possibility. But if you realize its potential as the best method of protection and prevention then it can become a reality. Finally, you may ask how this applies to the millions of adults having sex who have no parents to instruct them. I have two points in this matter. 1. Kids practicing abstinence will grow up into adults practicing abstinence. (continuing to prevent abortion) 2. Should we tell kids to practice abstinence (established as the best protection against unwanted babies and STDs) if we as adults are not practicing abstinence?I have reserved the “Christian moral onslaught” from this post because it seems like some have a reactionary awareness of anything that hints of faith. But if you look at things in practical terms, Christianity works. I’m not saying that this is the reason one should believe but rather that there is a harmony of things as a side effect of proper Christian practice and understanding. The harmony and peace is tangible. It saves people a lot of pain, distress, and heartache.Peace

You may tell your kid that sex is “natural” but he should use a condom or birth control pill (which I propose makes the sex not very “natural” but these are semantics for a different thread). Again this can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Maybe this advice will protect them a little bit more than an outright reckless apathy or encouragement of unprotected sex though. But as we have established sometimes even these methods do not prevent pregnancy (or STDs). So what is the best advice a parent can give to his child about sex outside of a permanent, committed relationship? I propose it is abstinence. So what is the best path to lead people to achieve this type of relationship? Can you agree that abstinence is not the only method but definitely the best method in practical terms of negating peer pressure and preventing STD, unwanted pregnancy, emotional baggage, and even abortion? What is the best path to lead your child on that will show him the idea that you already have—that the best place for a child is in a home with two loving parents? I cannot think of any adverse side effects of abstinence. It is fullproof. Until you and PARENTS see this as the most appropriate method on a practical level then it will continue to be an ideal that is not a possibility. But if you realize its potential as the best method of protection and prevention then it can become a reality. Finally, you may ask how this applies to the millions of adults having sex who have no parents to instruct them. I have two points in this matter. 1. Kids practicing abstinence will grow up into adults practicing abstinence. (continuing to prevent abortion) 2. Should we tell kids to practice abstinence (established as the best protection against unwanted babies and STDs) if we as adults are not practicing abstinence?I have reserved the “Christian moral onslaught” from this post because it seems like some have a reactionary awareness of anything that hints of faith. But if you look at things in practical terms, Christianity works. I’m not saying that this is the reason one should believe but rather that there is a harmony of things as a side effect of proper Christian practice and understanding. The harmony and peace is tangible. It saves people a lot of pain, distress, and heartache.Peace

Chai,My initial impression of you is that you are all BITE and no BARK. :)My concession, as poorly worded as it was, originally was in the context of sex outside of marriage. When I conceded that people would always be having sex as a current but not eternal, immutable fact, I meant that it is possible that there can be a real, functional abstinence of society. I now realize that my wording posed a contradiction.RE: Your statements on celibacy...You say that we are genetically wired to have sex then you say that celibates have a difficult time passing on "traits" to others that promote celibacy. It seems that you mean that celibate mean cannot pass on their celibate genetics because they are not reproducing. But I thought you said that we were genetically wired for sex? Are some genetically wired for celibacy? Is that how they do it? I don't think so. I never said that abstinence was easy. But the difficulty of some task or philosophy does not establish it as impossible or ineffective. I would guess that most teens do not fail at abstinence because it is difficult. They fail because they have been sold the lie of safe sex, the lie of the self-fulfilling prophecy of "sex is natural," because their parents do not take the time or effort to tell them why waiting for sex is beneficial. I think that celibates are able to remain that way due to a lack of ego-centrism. They see something beyond themselves. And in the Christian philosophy they give themselves for others just as Christ did (whether it be in marriage or the priesthood). Maybe we can start a new thread on this one!!Does the fact that we are genetically wired to have sex mean that we cannot resist the urge? Does the fact that resisting the urge is difficult mean that we cannot do it? Does the fact that we are genetically wired to eat mean that we cannot resist the urge? Does the fact that we are genetically wired to sleep mean that we cannot resist the urge? (this comparison breaks down due to the fact that sex is not necessary for the survival of the individual as are some of the other "urges") But the question is not whether we have the ability to resist the urge but rather, "What are the benefits of resisting that urge?" I established the benefits in my last post. Of course I left out a few: less risk of cervical cancer for women, departure from the encouragement of lack of committment in men and women due to establishing a pattern of instant gratification/physical intimacy lacking emotional intimacy, increased chance of infidelity in other relationships...Face it, after the 1960s sexual revolution and the introduction of the pill, condoms, and every other method of contraception the teen sex rate has risen decade after decade. The government saw that it was getting out of hand and they saw what effect it would have on the stability of society. So they introduce sex education in school with a major emphasis on safe sex and encouragement of contraceptives. The rate continued to increase and STDs like HPV went out of the roof. So then in the 90s the government began to sponsor abstinence programs. For the first time since the 60s boom the rate actually went down--practical and effective."What child can ever observe their parents practicing perfect celibacy?" Do you mean perfect celibacy or absolute celibacy? Or did you simply mean periodic abstinence? Why would parents need to practice absolute celibacy? If married, they are in that stable, committed relationship that is the best place to raise children. But I will give a shot to provide examples of abstinence in a marriage:1. Father dies, mother devotes herself to children, loves no other for the rest of her life due to the extraordinary love she had for her husband, a devoted celibate2. Mother dies, father falls in love again, waits until marriage before having sex, he discusses why he does this with his kids3. Father is injured and loses sexual function (a Christopher Reeve type thing--although I cannot speak about C. Reeve's sexual function, some with spinal cord injuries can, some cannot), wife remains with him faithfully--kids see that parents love is not based on sex4. Dad has a broken hip, sex would hurt, mom has the ability and committment to wait for him to get better5. Mom just had a baby and an episiotomy, can't have sex for awhile, dad comforts and pampers her6. Mom and Dad wait until marriage to have sex, they tell their kids about it to influence their sexual decisions7. My wife and I are periodically abstinent for a few weeks a month when there are serious reasons for post-poning pregnancy (via Natural Family Planning)

"You and Gilligan look at the issue as an observation of the whole and say that people will have sex no matter what. There will always be people having sex. I concede that this may well be a current fact but not an immutable, eternal fact. It can change. I think that your suggestion is that we need other ways to deal with the fruit of sex than abstinence due to the fact that there will always be people having sex. But how do we deal with this on a practical level?" "1. Kids practicing abstinence will grow up into adults practicing abstinence. (continuing to prevent abortion) 2. Should we tell kids to practice abstinence (established as the best protection against unwanted babies and STDs) if we as adults are not practicing abstinence?""If your parents didn't have children, chances are you won't either" ~AnonymousFirst of all, we're genetically wired to have sex. Even priests who take a vow of celibacy have a hard time keeping it. And those than do practice celibacy have a hard time passing along traits that help people resist having sex. I'm still wondering, though, what child can ever observe their parents practicing perfect celibacy?

Chai-Yeah. Um. I think you're smart enough to know what I meant. I never said no couple would ever not have kids, but, tell me of any that say they will never have kids with the expection of it not being possible. By the way, "There are people who wait to have kids because the financial situation's just not right." You're only reinforcing my statement with that quote. The couples want kids, but have decided to wait until their finacial situation becomes better. Once again, I never said that no couple in the world would never want to have kids, but those make up like 5% (exaggeration) of the world's population. I'm going to start this response off with the same first three sentences in the last one. "Yeah. Um. I think you're smart enough to know what I meant." The majority of women having abortions... are they married women who usually are the ones having babies, or are they single teenage girls who have hundreds of reasons of why they want to abort their baby. ----As for SilentPoet's post and Chai's other responses, I think maximus did an excellent job in his posts of what I was going to say.

I'm against abortion. Whether it's legal or illegal is just an issue of law.Although it's legal in early stage, I don't think in all countries, it's not a good thing ethically.However, it's sometimes innevitable because if a mother doesn't do so, it could be worse(I'm not saying I'm for it) like ... unhappy baby, mother's suicide maybe, etc.In any cases, I'm basically against it but not all abortion.

[QUOTE=maximus]Chai,My initial impression of you is that you are all BITE and no BARK. :)Heh heh. I see. It's quite possible. Your points are very valid and if you sincerely want an apology, you've got it. Same goes for Habbit. I have a small problem of arguing issues like this on completely different planes for other people, so while their debating whether its murder or not, my point is that it may very well be murder, but to me, the worse crime is actually having the child and raising it in a world unwanted while the mother doesn't get to go to college (she could, with the baby, I'm not saying that women who have babies can't do college at the same time. My mom went through grad school with my sister and I.) and without things like hope. Then, I get blown away for condoning murder or something along those lines. Or, I will point out that I personally would not have an abortion unless somehow having the baby would kill me, or if the baby would be born with a defect that make it live with a horrible disease that would mean a short life of unending pain, and no, I'm not talking about something like Down(s?) syndrome. I would have the child even if it had Downs. I'm more along the lines of a really bad case of cystic fibrosis. However, I am still pro-choice because I have realized long ago that my moral standards are not neccecarily the only right way, and I don't believe that abortion itself is a horrible thing. Then people will tell me that in fact, I am pro-life. I just wanted to take this last chance to clarify that. I'm getting tired of banging my head against this massive brick wall (I realize that most of you probably feel the same way about me), so I'm getting off of this topic. Adios, amigos.

Chai,I was just joking--kind of :). I don't need an apology for the friendly debate of which we have partaken. I have no problem with stern words in debate as long as it's not ad hominem. I throw around strong words too. Let me get this right. You are saying that growing up in poverty is worse than not growing up at all? Murder (your words) is better?As far as kids being born with a death sentence due to various supposed painful, torturous, incurable conditions with little life expectancy I have this to say: I work in the medical field and I have first hand knowledge of kids like that living totally different lives than what the doctors predict. They sometimes out live their life expectancy as well. Doctors don't always know what is going to happen. But the problem is that they will not often tell you that they don't know.You can experience joy and happiness with these kids. And THEY can experience joy and happiness as well as other facets of life. If it's a kid of my own flesh and blood then I want to know that kid--whether it's a few hours, a few days, a few months, or longer. This is not selfishness. I would gamble that he might want to know me and his mother as well. If this thing is a kid then abortion is a horrible thing. I'm not saying this as a condemnation to those who abort but as a regret. They may feel the loss at some time. Actually your moral standards may be the only right way. There are certain things that are universal. There is objectivity in morality. Don't be afraid of that. P.S. I hope you continue banging your head. Just plug in some really loud 80s stuff like Quiet Riot or Twisted Sister to make it more fun.Peace.
