At what point do church groups stop being about god and start being all just politics? At some point do they not break the rules for being non-profits when it comes to lobbying efforts?25,000 Churchgoers Sign On To Mass. Anti-Gay Amendmentby Margo Williams 365Gay.com Boston Bureau Posted: October 3, 2005 1:00 pm ET (Boston, Massachusetts) Organizers of a ballot initiative to ban same-sex marriage and civil unions in Massachusetts said that a one-day blitz on churches has put it almost half way to collecting enough signatures for the measure to be placed before voters.Petitions supporting the constitutional amendment were circulated Sunday at all Catholic Churches and at evangelical and other Protestant churches throughout the state. The amendment has the backing of the state's four Roman Catholic bishops and other conservative religious leaders. On Monday, Vote On Marriage - the umbrella group behind the amendment - said that it had collected 25,000 signatures. It needs 65,825 signatures by Thanksgiving for the measure to be considered.The names then would need to be verified by the Secretary of State. The proposed amendment would then go to the legislature where it requires the support of 50 members. The earliest it could go to voters would be in 2008.Some people who signed by petitions on Sunday said they felt pressured. One woman who did not want to be identified said that others at her church who tried not to sign were harassed by church elders who were circulating the forms. "I didn't want to be singled out," she told 365Gay.com. "I just signed it and hoped that would be the end of it."LGBT marriage rights group MassEquality was also out in force at a number of churches Sunday, conducting what it called a "truth squad". Standing on public sidewalks in front of churches members of the group tried to dissuade people from signing the petitions."We completely respect people's right to worship," said Marc Solomon, the group's political director. "However, we are very concerned that the church hierarchy has made taking away marriage equality -- and replacing it with nothing else -- such a high priority."Former Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn, one of the petition's chief sponsors, said church officials have an obligation to "speak out on important issues in the civic arena.""The marriage petition is not against gays but for children," he said. "We believe that a loving family with a mother and a father is the best environment for children to be brought up in."Last week Vote On Marriage hired a California consulting companied used by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to help it win the amendment. (story)Arno Political Consultants, of Sacramento was used by Schwarzenegger most recently to help sell his legislative reform package which goes to voters in a special election this November. The company has been involved in a number of conservative ballot measures nationwide including the anti-gay marriage amendment in Ohio. That measure passed by a wide margin last year. It has also worked for the Republican National Committee to register GOP voters in Florida.Earlier this month the Massachusetts legislature turned down its own proposed amendment that would have banned bay marriage but allow civil unions. (story) Many of those voting against the measure opposed the civil unions provision and said they would support the Vote On Marriage version.Even if Vote On Marriage gets its initiative on the ballot there are growing indications it will be rejected by voters.A new University of Massachusetts-Lowell poll suggests that 56 percent of registered voters oppose the initiative and that 40 percent support it. Among Catholics who have been flooded with church material supporting the amendment the poll shows they are almost equally divided on gay marriage.

Boy, you guys are really hot and bothered about these petitions aren't you? This isn't the first I've seen this issue come up lately.Christians have a right to participate in the political process too. I bet you aren't nearly as down on PFLAG and their non-profit status even though they make no secret of their politics either.Another thing you don't understand is that all of these Christians signing these things aren't from any one church--they're just Christians, period. Some may not even go to church that much.

Yeah, it sucks how it's their "obligation" to ram their version of morality down our throats. I mean, when you think about it in their terms, what does it matter, if they're going to heaven anyway? I suppose that when we die, those of us who didn't buy into it will be led screaming to hell while the christians get up on some escalator to heaven, where they bust out the popcorn and have a good laugh at us pagans. Or something like that. Or I suppose that we'll be invisible to them, they'll just get that snooty I knew I was right all along feeling, so that they won't experience any negative emotions while in their heaven.But back to the point, I do find it rather frightening that so many churches are getting so politically active. It seems that the pushes that they're making are really having an effect, which is no good AT ALL.

The article makes it clear it was circulated at many chuches. Just because some members sign it doesn't mean that the churches themselves (as governed bodies) officially sanction it.Religious people are the only group in society that are expected by some to not take part in the political process. That's hardly fair at all. No, we're Americans too, and we aren't going to go away. Get used to it.

There's a quote in the article saying that the movement is "not against gays" but for the children? Bull. They say that the best environment for children to be raised is with a mother and a father, but who's to say that two fathers or two mothers can't do just as good a job? I understand that aspect of their protest. I respect that side. But what I don't understand is what about the children who have two loving mothers or fathers, who would have had a worse life without any parents at all? Wouldn't just having parents in general be better than nothing? Would you not say that two women or two men could do a better job raising their kids than say a single mother or father could? It's just this that I don't get at all. They say that it's for the children, when in reality this is actually harming children.

As I have said before, doesn't matter about my behavior. I would be gay either way. To disapprove of me being gay is to disapprove of me. They are one in the same thing. It is like saying I love you but I disapprove of the fact you are a blonde. Being gay is a piece of not only who I am, but who I love how I love my life. If someone really cares about me, they would support my happiness and my happiness relies on me being who I am, and protected for who I am.I find it annoying and insulting when people make these love the sinner hate the sin comments because they are so contradictive and ignorant of what being gay means. It is not possible to care about gays and disapprove of how we live. If someone really care about me, that means they accpet and support what makes me happy, healthy and safe. I lived my life as a psuedo-heterosexual for years. I was very unhappy, lonely and depressed. People who really care about me don't want to see me that way.I got an email once from a friend who knew me when I was a closet case. He had found out that I had finally come out and said how happy he was I found peace with myself.

I disagree. We aren't robots in this world. I myself (along with everyone else) am hardwired to eat, but that doesn't mean I don't have the ability to know when and when not to eat. It's easy for you to say that it's disapproving of you personally because it give you a way to claim people are attacking you, which often isn't the case.It would be like saying I know you are blond but don't particularly care for the mohawk you wear it as. Nevetheless I can still approve of you as a person. That's a different issue. I honestly think you realize this, it's just that you continue to say it's personal because it's another way to politicize and try to get people to stop disagreeing with you. I'm sure an alcoholic could make the very same argument, as he is wired to love alcohol.It depends on the context of the discussion as to whether or not they are appropriate. If we are talking about biology and genetics, or someone who claims they hate you for what you ARE, then I agree with you, they need to understand there is an issue of nature going on here. But in the context of Biblical issues and religious disapproval, it's usually all about the behavioral aspect. And there's nothing wrong with that. If you choose to be insulted everytime someone in life disagree with something you do, you are going to have a very long hard life. People need to learn to dialog and talk without being insulted about such things. I could just as easily say I am "insulted" when you take issue with MY behavior of pointing these things out. This is all part of debating and discussing these issues, and it's a healthy thing. So I would simply say . . . suck it up. Grow some skin. It's a debate.You are so wrong. You are making these statements because they give you a way to claim being insulted as a tactical move in the overall issue of gay rights. These attempts by your movement to try and silence the debate like this are very transparent. Again, grow some skin. The debate will go on with or without you, regardless of whether you choose to be insulted or not.That's fine--but not everyone has his view of homosexual behavior.

First, Falwell and Robertson don't need to be in the same sentence as Phelps. That's not to say that Falwell and Robertson are right, but let's be clear--they don't picket funerals or rise to the level of hate speech that Phelps does. Whether you like it or not, it IS important to note the differences in people here, even if they are not on your side. I think really that gay pride lobbyists love Phelps, because he gives a name everyone associates with hate for them to put in the same sentence as anyone else they want to associate with him in order to demonize them.Second, you are wrong in your assertion that evangelicals don't speak out against this sort of hatred. The problem is that you really want them to say that "homosexual behavior is just fine and dandy--do anything you want." They don't (even though they do speak out against violence and hate speech), so you say they don't speak out. It's not that they don't speak out against it, they just don't cater their message exactly the way you want.If you don't understand the difference between Phelps and the rest of evangelicals, do some research. Start with the fact that Phelps has protested the Southern Baptist Convention.Night & day: The difference between Southern Baptists & Fred Phelps

What is the definition of "embrace the lifestyle?" All they want that I can see is to be able to indulge in all the freedoms and rights anyone else has. They want their love to be acknowledged, they want to be families and raise kids. They want to walk down the street hand in hand, they want not to be beat up for who they love.It maybe sinful to you but it is not to them and to all of us who are their friends and families.

The active gays I've seen and heard from don't just want to be accepted for who they are, they want America to actually embrace their sinful lifestyle, like it was something that's good in God's eyes (which it's not).

Preached against and demonized are two different things. You preach for abortion yet I believe you are probably a nice person. I just think it is a bad way to judge people if they disagree with you on an issue. Jerry Fallwell will allow a gay person into his office or church just like anyone else. He just happens to believe in God so he preaches that homosexuality (among other things) are sins.
attacks
In a nut shell:It was in response to Matthew saying that anyone who preaches against his people are not nice guys. You say that isn't a very good way to look at people - so I ask you if you would consider those who preached against/demonized those you love "good guys".

You are absolutely right on this. One of the sad things the gay pride movement does is attack the person for their views, demonizing them and portraying them in the worst possible light.Make no mistake, it's a tactic on their part, pure and simple.

Matthew has shown that he has an extremely black and white view of the world. He doesn't understand that people can disagree with gay peoples' behavior and still care about gay people. I think the understanding that the world is in shades of gray and/or multicolored instead of all black and white comes with time. He'll come to learn these things, eventually.

That's not a question about "caring." It's a policy issue.But to answer your question, yes I support that right. I don't agree with it morally, but I support your right to do that. I'm not in favor of sodomy laws.

I find it funny how you limited sexual cases yourself. Are you saying it is ok to denying a willing a adult and child to have sex? If the asnwer is yes then someone having the view that sex should be limited to only between a man and a women is just as valid. Both should be up to the people via voting and legislative processes.

I would say they are not. They aren't right, but they don't have nearly the level of vitriol.

Sort of like people who make outrageous comparisons of people they disagree with to Hitler.I hear it all the time. You just don't like it because they usually ALSO aren't ashamed to state their view that it's morally wrong in the same sentence. Sounds like you should listen more. [shrug]Evangelicals are under no obligation to call any press conference for you. If you want to know what they really think, you should actually listen to average evangelicals instead of assuming Phelps, Robertson, and Falwell speak for them. Otherwise you are no better than someone who would think that the Log Cabin Republicans or Andrew Sullivan speaks for all gays.And I seriously doubt the president has ever listened much to Fred Phelps or any of these guys.

Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.”1 Corinthians 6:9-10 – “Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God?

What I find hard to believe is that someone, in the year 2005 almost 2006, can still be so afraid of gays and their lifestyle. Most progressive people who have "actually peeked behind the curtain" have come to learn that gays are just like anybody else for the most part and are, for the most part, totally harmless to society. These progressive people have no problem, whatsoever, in letting the gays take their rightful place in society with all due rights and privileges afforded to any other, tax paying, law abiding, adult citizen.In my opinion, regarding the regressives, it's simply a matter of lack of understanding and education and the reluctance to be taught. It's a matter of sticking one's fingers in one's ears and screaming "LALALALALALALALALA" I DON'T HEAR YOU!! LALALALALALA"As society is evolving and becoming more educated and tolerant towards those of an alternate lifestyle, the people opposed to this acceptance are slowly but surely dwindling away. (Twenty years ago, "XXXXX Eye for the Straight Guy" would have never been accepted.) The Regressives who adamantly fear this change in society are going to great lengths to anchor their belief and moral system into a constitutional vault to disable our society from evolving further or even considering the issue. Even if their actions are nothing less than facist. I think their take on it is "Desperate times require desperate measures and if that means facism, then so be it."The only thing is, the gay issues before us all as a society do NOT equate to "desperate times." We have people blowing themselves up, starving, hurricanes and yet some folks focus on gays marrying? What does that say about them? The only people who have problems with gays are the people who LET themselves have problems with gays.Myself, I'm a breeder. I emoticonXLove my women.

What I find hard to believe is that someone, in the year 2005 almost 2006, can still be so afraid of gays and their lifestyle. Most progressive people who have "actually peeked behind the curtain" have come to learn that gays are just like anybody else for the most part and are, for the most part, totally harmless to society. These progressive people have no problem, whatsoever, in letting the gays take their rightful place in society with all due rights and privileges afforded to any other, tax paying, law abiding, adult citizen.In my opinion, regarding the regressives, it's simply a matter of lack of understanding and education and the reluctance to be taught. It's a matter of sticking one's fingers in one's ears and screaming "LALALALALALALALALA" I DON'T HEAR YOU!!

The government's case is based on federal drug laws, that a physician should not be allowed to prescribe controlled substances to enable suicides. Oregon, my current state of residence, has the only legislation allowing assisted suicide (for terminal health issues) in the US.

Interestingly enough, the Catholic and Mormon populations of Oregon voted in favor of the law, resisted only by fundamentalist Christian sects.

The medicial marijuna thing was a little more complicated then what you say.

Are you in favor of hurting some families with different tax laws?Not always. Like I said, the law has winners and losers for every issue. This is why we vote on it.

It will mean my kid will have to start supporting himself three years sooner than planned!Not when soley dependent upon my body functions. Gays marriage will not impact your rights, freedoms or hurt you in way way. You can even hate gays if it tickles your fancy. They aren't demanding you be gay or that you even like gays. You can continue your "I'm a macho straight guy and think XXXXXX are gross" lifestyle if you like. They aren't demanding YOU do anything. They aren't imposing ANYTHING on you. That is what YOU are doing.Plus I would like to point out that we were talking about gay sex and sex in general. Whether or not your pervy butt should be able to vote on the sex lives of consenting adults.

Otherwise you are no better than someone who would think that the Log Cabin Republicans or Andrew Sullivan speaks for all gays.And I seriously doubt the president has ever listened much to Fred Phelps or any of these guys.

well let's see, one has picketed funerals of slain gay people, said that gay people burn in hell, and has perhaps the most hate-oriented website on the entire internet. He blames every national-level disaster on gays and has never apoplogized for any of it, he travels around the country literally making it his life's work to put out hate speech about gays.The other two make a comment linking homosexuality and 9/11, for which they later apologized for.No, I don't think there's much of a comparison.No, not at all. I have absolutely no obligation to you to do anything. It's not my fault you assume someone who claims to speak for a group is automatically right. heck I could easily assume Andrew Sullivan speaks for all gays, but I've got enough sense to know that's probably not the case. Good grief. Surely you aren't THAT naive.

Bingo.And that's the bottom line of all of what you are saying. I think everyone knows your point is not to advocate these other kids of relationships, but to show that they are ALL cases of gay people showing inconsistency by imposing a moral code in these other cases. The biggest failure of the gay rights message is it's inconsistency. If they are truly for equality, they should make marriage truly equal for everyone. If not, then be honest enough to admit that their message is not truly equality, but simply moving the boundaries of marriage a bit.

When you say a 14yr old can't drive or 17yr old can't smoke you are imposing a moral standard on people. You probably don't even realize how many laws you have that impose a moral standard on people.

That wasn't the question. I said "IF I could find evidence". It may impact things I can and can't do.

Another B.S. argument. No one is imposing any moral codes on anyone by allowing same sex couples the right of marriage. The argument is even more disingenuous when you consider that your supposed moral objection to same sex marriage cannot stand up to the fact that you would be okay with civil unions instead. Your argument is nearly as bad as the arguments that people use against abortion except in the case of rape or incest. By making your argument a moral one, you limit yourself to a zero-sum position. Either homosexual relationships are good or not. If they are bad, then you cannot be for civil unions, marriage, domestic partnerships or any recognition.

Bingo.And that's the bottom line of all of what you are saying. I think everyone knows your point is not to advocate these other kids of relationships, but to show that they are ALL cases of gay people showing inconsistency by imposing a moral code in these other cases. The biggest failure of the gay rights message is it's inconsistency. If they are truly for equality, they should make marriage truly equal for everyone. If not, then be honest enough to admit that their message is not truly equality, but simply moving the boundaries of marriage a bit.

You can't. I know this like I know the sky is blue. You saying this is like me asking you "Would you believe I was an angel if I sprouted wings and flew away". I can't sprout wings and you can't prove gay families are any more harmful than straight ones. Like what? Specify please.Nobody is asking you to be gay, marry a man, or even like gay people. Nothing is being imposed on you. At all. Not one thing.Because goats and children can't consent. Are you daft? I love cows - on my plate, my leather jackets. mmmmoooooooooo Of course I am talking legally. There has to be a limit to when one is a legal adult. That is generally 18. It makes sense - they are done with school at that age and can start work full time. If you think 16 is better - make your arguments and go for getting the legal adult age limit changed - but it does need to be somewhere.Of course we set these standards. But there are valid reasons. You need to have a certain level of sense and coordination to operate a motor vehicle. When we set up a rule there has to be a reason. It serves the better good to not let rapists hurt people for example. You can't marry kids because it's molestation. The law is there to protect people from a real damage that can be done.Two adults in a consenting relationship doesn't hurt one damned thing. Offending your religion and pushing the button on your ick factor are not valid reasons to impose a rule on somebody.

Why should your answer depend upon whether I will change my position on the issue? Either your answer is good enough to challenge my position or it is not. I am rather disappointed in you. I thought you were better than this.I've answered this before. If the genders are equal under the law, then restricting marriage based on gender is unconstitutional. We restrict many things based on age due to lack of informed consent. Rather than base age restrictions on each individual's maturity level, governments have chosen to set an arbitrary age limit (some places say 16 or younger, others say 18). Now, one could argue that setting an arbitrary age limit is wrong, or that the limit should be younger or older, but that will not change my point, which is that the issue of age limit deals with informed consent.

Make sense now?We restrict things based on gender as well. Now the purpose of age restrictions are that they represent a difference in a 16yr old in a 40yr old.

Frankly we didn't vote on any of those issues. We vote for representatives to create laws. Those laws should serve a purpose that is more beneficial than harmful. Laws against gay marriage are more harmful than beneficial as gay marriage will not harm straight people at all, but denying it will harm gay people.Nope. And?No, because the photograghs themselves are illegal and should be brought to the attention of the authorities.Once again a law was created weighing out the good and the bad here. More damage is done by allowing animal cruelty (even though said animal is your property) then it is requesting that you treat your animal with dignity. Actually I do get that we legislate for a more peacable society. With half of this society being women - allowing them legal recourse should their marriage partner turn violent is extremely beneificial to 50% of society.No. I just do not wish to enact rules that serve no positive purpose. Laws against gay sex or gay marriage do not do ANYTHING to benefit society AT ALL.

Well, since the constitution treats genders equally, the law cannot justify restricting marriage based on the gender of the participants.Now, why don't you tell us how civil marriage for same sex couples will affect you personally?The purpose of gender restrictions in some instances are VERY different than those with age. Considering that most (if not all) societies have been historically chauvinistic (an understatement), we do make accomodations that take into consideration this historic discrimination (separate bathrooms, for instance). The same cannot be said for marriage, since we do not assign any roles to gender in society any more (as much as some would like to keep it that way), at least not legally.

Jitobear doesn't have that idea. Jitobear told you specifically that laws should serve a purpose. I do not believe it is up to government to legislate morality. There is substantial enough evidence that child porn does enough damage in society to outlaw it.Gay sex and gay marriage do not harm you in any way that you can substantiate. The only reason laid out is that some people's religions consider it sin. Well tough. Freedom of religion in part means you don't to impose adhearance to your faith.

yeah I am. If you can destroy someones theory by using their own logic then all the better.WHy does Jitobear have this idea that people should do what they want and no one should and impose a moral code but then turn around and decide to impose a moral code? I believe you can impose a moral code so long as people vote for it. Jitobear thinks we can't vote on some things.In other words, I am trying to show her that she is inconsistent in her thinking.

Who are you to decide what serves a purpose or not? seems like maybe you want to apply some standard to everyone... If 95% of people feel gay marriage should be outlawed then maybe it serves a purpose to have it outlawed. And why can't I impose my faith? I can impose my non-faith views but can't impose my faith-based views? That seems to be against freedom of religion.

For the non-faithful to be imposing on you they would have to demand you not practice your religion. Nobody is doing that.I am not deciding anything.99% percent can think it causes harm - I don't care. Back it up. Provide substancial evidence that you will be harmed. Shooting somebody causes them harm. This is not my opinion. It's fact. Hurt, bleading, possibly may die. Fact. That is what I mean by substantial evidence that something does harm. There is none that gay sex and gay marriage do. No reason to outlaw it - regardless of how 95% may feel about it (and the numbers aren't that high anyway).

Jitobear Steeeeve doesn't understand that GLBT people are hurt everyday. He doesn't understand that we could be thrown out of our homes, not be able to make decisions for our partners, or if we have children they could be taken away. Even if we have the proper legal paperwork, homophobic, evangelical families could still do harm to us. Without marriage we have no protections. Steeeeve doesn't understand this or will he ever understand this until he is actually hurt. Steeeeve and other conservates feel they have a right to vote on our lives. That is the sad thing and I know dear I am preaching to the chior on this one.

Well - I suppose you are right. The masses could also potentially vote to make you wear pink tutus to work. I fail to see what this has to with the argument.If it makes you feel any better I would fight just as hard for you to be able to practice your religion as I do to not allow you to impose it.I don't believe in establishing anyone's morality. (Except maybe the child I am raising - it's part of my job as a parent). OK? Laws should surce a purpose.Your religion thinking gay marriage is spiritually harmful is very nice and all. But to pass laws to prevent it is in opposition to gay people's freedom from your religion. Provide concrete, solid evidence that gay marriage will cause anyone any kind of harm in the secular realm we all share. Creating the law for any other reason is tyranny.

The point is, you can vote on just about anything. Why shouldn't this be allowed? If people in Kansas don't want gay marriage, let them.Maybe you misread the 1st amendment. No one has a freedom from anything my religion believes. For example my religion believes murder is illegal but we don't say I am imposing my religious beliefs on people. This would hold true even I was argueing for a law against murder for the sole reason that my faith was against it. Motives are not outlawed in our country.The point is, all homosexuals want laws supporting their cause for emotional reasons as well. Does outlawing gay marriage cause them to bleed? No. Does disallowing homosexual sodemy give homosexuals cancer? No. They just happen to want these things. And thats fine. Vote on it. Others can vote against it for emotional reasons. See, these are all emotional.Is that what I said? No. But if someone is hurt spirtually I am not going to make fun of them because this is just as legimate as being hurt emotionally. Maybe you should stop insulting people and actually read what was written. I never said anything that would indicate my position here. My whole arguement is that people should be allowed to vote on this issue. Imposing a moral code is something this country does. We can do this by voting.

Becuase banning gay marriage does more harm than good.I most certainly have not. Freedom of religion means you can practice and it also means I can tell your religion to eff off. You have no right whatsoever to impose your faith. Imposed faith is one of the main reasons a whole lotta people left Europe and came here in the first place.

Really, if you think value of people and family should be up for a vote - then I suspect you are beyond any kind of sane dialogue.No they shouldn't.

I am sure they feel that way. I am saying they need to do more than feel that way. They need to PROVE IT will harm them - in a REAL way.

We live in a democracy though. You could have no reason and still vote for something. You aren't required to have a good reason to vote. You can vote based on looks of the candidate if you want. In a free society you can make a law that puts restrictions on people. Freedom works both ways.

I know. This is misuse of a majority power. This is why we don't actually vote on issues. It's why there are checks and balances in government. It's to prevent tyranny. Just becuase a majority supports the oppression of another group does not mean it should be allowed. That, contrary to whatever silly idea seems to me tossing about in your mellon, is the ANTITHESIS of freedom.When there is only freedom for one group - that is not freedom. That is tyranny and somebody is being a tyrant.Now we certainly need rules for a peacable society - and so we have them. But those rules need to serve that purpose (peacable society). They are not there to appease a majority.

Well, morality isn't just some arbitary rules - most of it has reasons or at least history behind it. To see whether its right or wrong its just a case of seeing how it fits alongside other values that you accept to be right.A tad circulular, but you don't need to find some ultimate truth to begin as long as both sides can agree on a suitable starting place (and philosophers are threathened with violence)

You have been shown time and time again how that reasoning is fallacious. I can't believe you have not made any progress. Your science fiction fantasy about polygamy has nothing to do with gay rights. But here we go again. By the way, I hardly think a straight male polygamist can only be sexually attracted to a woman if she is one of many wives. This is unlike gay people who are only sexually oriented or attracted to those of the same sex. That is our basic sexuality, that is our sexual orientation, as gay people.

Short rant:Promiscuity is present in both genders of hetero and homosexuals. Some establish long-term relationships with varying degrees of success including physical lifespans. Others, like fundamentalist Mormons, are persecuted in the US for polygamy, a federal crime without consideration for freedom of religion. It took American Native tribes decades of legal battles before the feds allowed peyote to be used in their worship rituals. Gays fight an uphill battle in exercising their civil rights, just has any possible deviation from a WASP society dominated by a majority of believers adhering to a written oracle based on mythology. Higher education would help, but our (US) general public is falling behind on that opportunity to expand our strength. IMO the best strategy for gay rights is business as usual while keeping lawyers well supplied with money, the American way. It could take until the point where Christianity is no longer the dominant US belief system, 2030-2040 depending on whose numbers one likes, but, since several states are already preparing legislation for civil union benefit rights equal to those possessing the magic word 'married' couples, I think perseverance for gay rights will be fully rewarded far earlier than that future date. Keep the pressure on and remember that you're in combat with what advertising and TV writers identify as the lowest common demoninator.

Hmm, not sure I'd wait that long, seems a lot easier to convince the public now than hang on until 30 years and there's a Catholic (though seeing as it seems that its the West that counts half the time it would depend on the Pope) or Muslim majority. Without setting the precedent now its only going to get worse I'm afraid.

A human with a functioning brain. Any hurt that happens to you as a result of gay people having sex or getting married is completely self inflicted.It doesn't. But they are not yet afforded the rights as adults that will make marriage a difficulty so its best to have them wait. For legality's sake an age needed to be determined - 18 was it. Plus I think they can get married with parental consent.Anyway. Legal age limits serve a distinct and reasonable purpose.Banning gay sex and marriage does not.And it won't hurt you. I have even been to a gay wedding and I am perfectly fine! Amazing, huh?

We are the ones being oppresed and I think that from our, the GLBT, point of view it is wrong.From the conservatives point of view oppression has always been proper. The following is some conservate sentaments thoughout the years."Those stupid liberal Abolitionists tring to get rid of slavery. Don't they know that it would ruin the US Economy."

LOL, No. the issue of slavery and women's rights don't just fit right over the top of gay rights like a boot over a foot. Slavery wasn't a fight of liberalism versus conservatism in any sense of what those terms mean today. In fact it was as much a state's rights thing as any. If you are going to try and fit one issue over the other as analogy, one could just as easily argue that the abolitionists represent the people trying to protect marriage from the gay pride movement, and that the gay pride movement represents the push for slavery. The point is of course, that it really doesn't fit either way.It makes a decent tactic for your movement though.

So you wish to determine what hurts me and what doesnt?Maybe banning gay marraige serves a distinct and reasonable purpose to some. It seems you just want to have what you say be true and have everyone else follow that...eventhough, at the same time, you preach we shouldn't impose beliefs on others...And you know what we did to change these things? convinced the people and voted on the issues. For slavery it sadly took at war (althought more was there then just slavery). Notice none of the above were decided bya judge.

No. Reality does. Maybe I think your tennies hurt me. But in reality they don't (unless you beat me over the head with them). Maybe I think the bottle of water next to me is talking - but that doesn't mean it is.If gay marriage will hurt you - demonstrate it. That or just admit you are being oppressive.Forcing others to appease the tenents of your faith is not reasonable in a free society.You do not have to have a gay marriage. Even if it's legal. I swear. You can still marry some poor girl.

It seems you just want to have what you say be true and have everyone else follow that...eventhough, at the same time, you preach we shouldn't impose beliefs on others...And you know what we did to change these things? convinced the people and voted on the issues. For slavery it sadly took at war (althought more was there then just slavery). Notice none of the above were decided bya judge.

You would accept some forms of hurt. So how can someone convince you? And hurt is not everything. What if someone just thinks it is wrong? Slavery doesn't hurt me, but I believe it to be wrong. Lets apply your stance on abortion here to see if you are inconsistent in your thinking. YOu believe that someone should do whatever they want with there body above whether or not it hurts someone (as abortion obviously kills someone). So if you tell me I can't do something (such as be opposed to gay marriage or feel that gay marriage hurts my life in a spirtual or emotional way) because this hurts others then aren't you putting hurt over what I want to do with my body? After all, body is your mind as well isnt it? You don't want me to make decisions in your life yet you want to make decisions in mine? How does that work? Your inconsistent thinking leads down a bad path.Who said it had to be just faith? Someone can oppose gay marriage for moral reasons of their own. Is this now reasonable?Besides your "faith" says 17yr olds shouldn't marry...why do you force other sto appease to your faith but I can't do the same? Inconsistent again.But you are still forcing me to live a certain life. What if I am an employer who is Catholic and 100% against gay marriage. The policy of the company is that if you hire a person you have to offer a job to their spouse (this is common by the way). Now the employer is FORCED to do something 100% against his beliefs. He has to accept gay marriages. So don't think you aren't forcing beliefs on others.

No. Reality does. Maybe I think your tennies hurt me. But in reality they don't (unless you beat me over the head with them). Maybe I think the bottle of water next to me is talking - but that doesn't mean it is.If gay marriage will hurt you - demonstrate it. That or just admit you are being oppressive.Forcing others to appease the tenents of your faith is not reasonable in a free society.You do not have to have a gay marriage. Even if it's legal. I swear. You can still marry some poor girl.

Say I own a company I would be required to keep that same catholic on the payroll because I can't fire him because he is protected by law. If the religious people can fire gay people because they are gay I want to be able to fire religious because they are religious people. I don't want to offer religious people benefits because they hold certain beliefs. As long as religious people can legally discriminate against gay people I want the same right to discriminate against religious people.

ok? This is a a slightly different topic though. My point in that was that Jitobear wishes to say I can't impose my beliefs on others but she is doing that same thing. I think you can impose a moral code so long as people vote on it. If you want to be able to discriminate against religious people then vote for it.

No, try re-reading what I wrote:Do I believe you should be allowed to discriminate? Well sometimes. I think you can discriminate based on age such as 15yr olds not being allowed to marry. But yeah, the majority can vote in discrimination against anyone I guess (doesn't mean I would be for it...or vote for it). I understand this to be part of "freedom"..you are free to restrict freedom.

I'd disagree, 'free society' can mean pretty much anything from a benign dictatorship where people are left to do what they want (to the everyday person there is no difference) to complete anarchy. Democracy being the 'free society' is just propaganda really seeing as we are far from being free, its not really that commonly used in the UK and then is generally referring to the values of the society rather than its system of government.

After three times of not being able to read you have just failed and I can't give you another chance. I do believe you can impose a moral code. But this doesn't have to be oppression of the minority. For example a law saying 17yr olds can't marry is a moral code but does it "oppress" the minority? I'd say not. I then further say that if one (matthew S) wishes to discriminate against religious people then he needs to vote that way. This was indicate that he is for oppression, maybe, but all I was saying is that with voting you can vote on anything...sometimes this leads down a bad path but you can vote for that bad path.I do like how you have chaned your comment though...you said "In other words, you believe majorities should be able to discriminate but minorities shouldn't." but now have changed it to say the quote at the top.Thank you Calhoun

At what point do church groups stop being about god and start being all just politics? At some point do they not break the rules for being non-profits when it comes to lobbying efforts?25,000 Churchgoers Sign On To Mass. Anti-Gay Amendmentby Margo Williams 365Gay.com Boston Bureau Posted: October 3, 2005 1:00 pm ET (Boston, Massachusetts) Organizers of a ballot initiative to ban same-sex marriage and civil unions in Massachusetts said that a one-day blitz on churches has put it almost half way to collecting enough signatures for the measure to be placed before voters.Petitions supporting the constitutional amendment were circulated Sunday at all Catholic Churches and at evangelical and other Protestant churches throughout the state. The amendment has the backing of the state's four Roman Catholic bishops and other conservative religious leaders. On Monday, Vote On Marriage - the umbrella group behind the amendment - said that it had collected 25,000 signatures. It needs 65,825 signatures by Thanksgiving for the measure to be considered.The names then would need to be verified by the Secretary of State. The proposed amendment would then go to the legislature where it requires the support of 50 members. The earliest it could go to voters would be in 2008.Some people who signed by petitions on Sunday said they felt pressured. One woman who did not want to be identified said that others at her church who tried not to sign were harassed by church elders who were circulating the forms. "I didn't want to be singled out," she told 365Gay.com. "I just signed it and hoped that would be the end of it."LGBT marriage rights group MassEquality was also out in force at a number of churches Sunday, conducting what it called a "truth squad". Standing on public sidewalks in front of churches members of the group tried to dissuade people from signing the petitions."We completely respect people's right to worship," said Marc Solomon, the group's political director. "However, we are very concerned that the church hierarchy has made taking away marriage equality -- and replacing it with nothing else -- such a high priority."Former Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn, one of the petition's chief sponsors, said church officials have an obligation to "speak out on important issues in the civic arena.""The marriage petition is not against gays but for children," he said. "We believe that a loving family with a mother and a father is the best environment for children to be brought up in."Last week Vote On Marriage hired a California consulting companied used by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to help it win the amendment. (story)Arno Political Consultants, of Sacramento was used by Schwarzenegger most recently to help sell his legislative reform package which goes to voters in a special election this November. The company has been involved in a number of conservative ballot measures nationwide including the anti-gay marriage amendment in Ohio. That measure passed by a wide margin last year. It has also worked for the Republican National Committee to register GOP voters in Florida.Earlier this month the Massachusetts legislature turned down its own proposed amendment that would have banned bay marriage but allow civil unions. (story) Many of those voting against the measure opposed the civil unions provision and said they would support the Vote On Marriage version.Even if Vote On Marriage gets its initiative on the ballot there are growing indications it will be rejected by voters.A new University of Massachusetts-Lowell poll suggests that 56 percent of registered voters oppose the initiative and that 40 percent support it. Among Catholics who have been flooded with church material supporting the amendment the poll shows they are almost equally divided on gay marriage.

I think we should put to a vote, the right of the religious extremists, to vote at all. What say ye?If the majority agrees, they have no say in anything anymore. Isn't that the way Steeeeeve says it should be done? Put it to a vote?

So what if they do? They does not mean they should run ramapant over other people's lives.What? Do you think the sun rises and sets in your rear? It hurt the SLAVES. They were real live people that were being hurt by a majority who just thought it was wrong to grant them rights as people.This argument is barely followable. Demostrate how you will be harmed by gay marriages. Many in this forum have demonstrated how gay people and families are hurt by not allowing it. Tag your it. Prove hurting your little feeling matters more than protection for families.It doesn't have to be faith - but it usually is. However, let me rephrase "restricting the actions of indivuals to appease the morality of others when said action does not impact them is not reasonable in a free society."My faith says absolutley nothing about 17 year olds getting married. the law does. Change it. Frankly I don't care. I just understand the reasoning behind it.He could quit.Then you completely misunderstand freedom.

If gay marriage were as spelled out in the constitution the way voting is, I might agree with you. But it's not. The best you can do with gay marriage is to make it fit into an amendment that doesn't specifically mention it, that was written about an unrelated issue. With the legality of the issue so vague, what do you expect? If you want to avoid people voting on issues like this, perhaps you should follow historical precedent in dealing with civil rights issues and get an amendment passed that spells it out.

Ok, so if the law hurts someone else then it shouldn't be a law or you shouldn't force others to go by it? Very well then, what forms of hurt are allowable? Are emotional forms of hurt allowable? Does it have to be actual cuts? If it is just emotional then a law making gay marraige legal might hurt me emotional. Who are you to say it doesn't? This would be a law hurting someone and thus void by your standard here. Maybe it is "who gets hurt worse". Once again, who are you to determine this? I simply vote would solve this problem though.I'm just showing how your view on abortion is not consistent with your views on gay rights. You state that laws shouldn't hurt people but you are for killing someone. How is killing not a form of hurt? You might say "it hurts the mother worse"...which is not really your call, but nevertheless I am not sure how "financial health"(for example) is worse then someone killing you. Your standard on abortion needs to be consistent inorder for us to take your seriously. My views on gay rights(which none of you know) and abortion are consistent if you wish to find out.What? Now you are for 17yr old getting married, what about 5 yr olds? I guess a 10yr old should be allowed to smoke weed and take some cocaine for his bus ride to school.What if he owns the company? Shut it down? You wish to force views on this mans life and cause him all this trouble? Double standard.I'm glad you asked for my opinion. For the marriage thing, I believe we have actually gone over my views on that. Check the thread by that WM guy a few back. As for allowing gay couples to adopt, I have no stance at this time. As for homosexual sodomy (or any for that matter), mixed views but would probably vote to make the choice up to a person...this isn't protected by the constitution though.

The minority has to conform to the view of the majority. If the majority says it is unacceptable to murder people, the minority who want to do that are forced to conform to this. Otherwise we wouldn't have laws, for there to be a law in place there must be someone who doesn't agree with it to potentially break it.But this really is how it is done!

To get around the objections, why not call "marriage" by another name, like covenant. This word has the advantage of signifying a civil (or religious) liberty.

Marriage does mean something to gays and lesbians, that is exactly why we want it extended to us with it's present definition....that of a legal contract with legal benefits.......that whole one man, one women thing was added later by the religious right....who is of course niether.

Marriage by any other name, isn't marriage....it doesn't carry the same weight of words....words can be very powerful. SOmetimes calling the same thing by another name, changes the meaning drastically.

Ironically, it only has 'powerful' meaning because opposite-sex couples made it that way, since it's an opposite sex institution.

Broadening it to include same-sex couples, not to the point of meaninglessness is the issue. Unless you believe allowing same-sex couples to marry will make marriage meaningless. I don't believe so.I'll take it too. I support same sex marriage and different sex marriage. I don't support anything goes.

When gay couples are given the chance, they will continue to give it meaning.
