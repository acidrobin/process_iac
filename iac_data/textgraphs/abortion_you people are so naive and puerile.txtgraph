My dear child, before you claim that you will stop abortion in its tracks, please prove to me that you will provide a loving, supportive homes for all the unwanted childrent the future holds. Your ignorant opinions about abortion do not impress me, nor do they affect the lives of the poor women who are put in the terrible position in which abortion becomes an option. The one thing I might agree with you upon is that it is a terrible thing, life should be treasured. But not a one of you "pro-lifers" has ever given consideration to a single moment past the time of the abortion. Have you ever considered what kind of a life a child would expect to have without the love of their parents? Another thing you might consider in your time off from misinterpreting the words of the bible is the term overpopulation. In China, they have such a problem, not only do you have to be given the nod from the government to have a child, if you do so without their consent, you are required to abort! Pretty picture, huh? Grow up, for God's sake, and try and understand the world you live in, not judge it.

My dear mortal, have you not ever heard of adoption? Women are aborting because their too selfish to wait 9 months to give their CHILD a loving home. Their are 3 million people a year waiting for a baby! Maybe your the one who should open your eyes and see the truth, I pray that God will unharden your cold heart...

Ever been pregnant? Women have abortions for many reasons. I doubt you could possibly understand. However, if "loving homes" abounded I think less women would be forced to make the hard decision of having an abortion.Perhaps you should concentrate your efforts on creating loving homes. I think it would be a more efficient use of your time.

"I want to adopt a kid""ok, here's a kid who needs to be adopted"

So where do you draw the line, oh person-who-feels-they-can-define-what-no-one-else-can? Is sperm a person? Is an ovum? Every 28 days I get rid of a potential child, am I a murderer for that? Should I please god and get pregnant very time I ovulate? Should I then have started at eleven years old?Is it with the meiosis, or only once mitosis sets in that the fertilized ovum becomes a person? When the zygote still has a tail, is it a person? http://zygote.swarthmore.edu/regul15.GIF Or is it as soon as limbs have formed? Anyway, no one is saying that a zygote or an embryo is a "nonentity". But until it can live independently of the mother's body, it is a part of her body. I've yet to meet a person who has had an abortion who did not find the experience traumatic and had to grieve the loss. It is a terrible thing. Attacking people who go through that tragedy is cruel and misplaced.

Yes, I have heard of adoption, and I encourage a woman's consideration of it when she is faced with this very difficult situation. But I also realize that not all women are comfortable with the idea of it, some women are afraid that they would not be able to part with a child after the bonding experience of pregnancy, beyond that, perhaps they are afraid their child would end up with the wrong people, people, perhaps like you, who lack an open mind! Selfish, you say? perhaps selfish would be the one who expects the rest of the world to adhere to their beliefs and ideas. Perhaps selfish is the one who is too concerned with some preconcieved notion to have compassion for their fellow being. The truth is, the law still stands that it is legal for a woman to choose, another truth is that the God you mention has repeatedly warned you against judging others.In response to your last sentence, I pray that the Buddha's wisdom will find a home within your MIND- my heart is not cold, it is quite warm I am sure, but it is merely a pump and nothing more.

hey numbskull- the word is pregnantyour little statement displays such ignorance I can't beleive I am replying, but before you proclaim they rip off a child's limbs and cause trauma to your life, at least educate yourself on the matter. The gross majority of abortions performed are during the first few months, in which the fetus has not yet developed limbs, you might be talking about partial birth abortion, which has been characterized as abortion performed after the first trimester, although in many of these instances, it is the same procedure as the first kind I mentioned. To be exact, the type of abortion in which a child's limbs are "ripped off" for years has only been permitted in dire medical need, but because of people like you, this has recently been outlawed , meaning you take more consideration for the life of the unborn than that of the mother. Shameful. You also calim that an abortion causes trauma to your life- do you mean emotional trauma? In that case, I suggest you show a little compassion for these women, If you are talking about physical trauma, that is increased severely when you make the procedure illegal and women are forced to go to unclean and often inept "doctors" often causing serious complications and even death.

Post Abortive Stress Syndrome (PASS) (http://www.boundless.org/2000/features/a0000230.html)"Standard PTSD is a psychological dysfunction that often comes from threats or experiences of physical injury, sexual violation, and the witnessing of or participating in a violent death. It's the same as the "shell-shock" that veterans go through. The trauma makes the victim's defense mechanisms soar out of control. They take on a life of their own and cause alterations in personality and behavior. In technical terms, the results are hyper-arousal (extreme sensitivity, nervous agitation, sleeplessness, constant alert to danger); intrusion (the bad experience breaks into ordinary life, often in the form of nightmares) and constriction (inability to reach out to others and express emotions). The trauma in PASS comes from the pressure to abort from boyfriends or family, the anxiety over choosing the abortion, the physical pain of the procedure (despite anesthesia!) and, most obviously, guilt once the abortion has been performed. Some women have even said that an abortion feels like rape — a sexual violation performed by a complete stranger causing extraordinary pain. PASS is particularly virulent in women who have had chemical abortions, because these abortions produce a complete, perfect and dead child. One study found that at least 19 percent of women who have had abortions suffer from some form of PASS. In all likelihood, the rate is actually higher, because these studies have high drop-out rates — and generally from the women who suffer the most intensely. Dr. Wanda Franz, testifying before a congressional hearing on the impact of abortion in March of 1989, summarized the syndrome by saying that women "report horrible nightmares of children calling them from trash cans, of body parts and of blood ... they re-experienced it [the abortion] with terrible psychological pain ... they feel worthless and victimized because they failed at the most natural of human activities — the role of being a mother." It doesn't stop there. There are reports of sexual dysfunction, both of extreme revulsion to sex and extreme promiscuity. Many women contemplate suicide and a fair number of those attempt it; studies in England and Finland identify a definite link between abortion and suicide. Smoking, drinking and drug use all increase after abortions, as do eating disorders. Post-abortive women are more prone to divorce and chronic relationship problems; they find it difficult to bond with their children born after the abortion and many simply continue the pattern — by now, 45 percent of all abortions are repeat abortions. All these expressions of PASS can show up from minutes after the abortion to decades later. Often it takes five to ten years of denial before the memories and emotions begin to surface uncontrollably. The turmoil of PASS is probably best seen in the dreams of those suffering from it. The site afterabortion.org catalogs a number of these dreams. Here's a fairly representative one: My dream has been repeated so many times over the years ... I can wake myself up now. The dream starts in an old three-story house. Sometimes I'm in the back of the house, sometimes I'm just driving up, sometimes I am already in the house. Big, white, clean, hardwood floors, beautifully decorated. I always think that it is a good dream. Then I start up the beautiful winding stairs. I am apprehensive but I still go up the stairs. I finally make it to the room on the third floor. The room is completely empty. There is only a white box under the window across the room. I walk into the room. I am never alone, someone is always with me. That part is ironic considering the complete feelings of isolation I have had all these years. Anyway, I walk to the box. Sometimes I hear a baby crying and I quickly open the box only to find it empty. Other times I have opened the box to find baby clothes. Other times I have found a dead baby. Other times I have found my old bloody clothes. I stand over the box crying and the intensity wakes me up."Yup, us Pro-Lifers definately don't care about the woman. We are Patriarchial Men who are plotting ways to keep them upstart women under our thumb. We want to ruin women's lives. Our lives are driven by a compulsion to control. We don't really care that the unborn, which we believe to be human, is being murdered. No, that's just a front so's we can use compassionate people to unwittingly help us fulfill our neurotic need for power.

Yes they are usually done in the first few months, but at that point the fetus does have limbs. You can’t have an abortion without the fetus being a certain size. However, abortions are still done quite often at later stages. Any kind of abortion is legal up to 9 months. LOL! How ridiculous! It’s called Surgical Abortion and no it hasn’t been outlawed. If you go to a Planned Parenthood office they offer it. The Partial Birth Abortion is now illegal, but that’s when they take the entire fetus out except for the head, and stab the back of the fetus’ head. I was talking about both physical and emotional trauma. Both happen on legal abortions. There was a recent case about a woman in Los Angeles who died from a Planned Parenthood abortion- it was completely legal. She had two sons and a husband. Bad abortions are happening within the companies that do them. Robbie has already given you a link for PASS.

I agree with Epaphras. Your justification for abortion was that women die from illegal ones (or something to that extent). My condemnation for abortion is that becuase the fetus is human, abortion is always homocide.

Funny how it is science that developed the procedures used, guaranteeing us the safe and sanitary methods employed across the globe.Funny also that logicians won't touch this subject with a ten foot pole.And morality.... well, as we all know, morality is in the eye of the beholder. When your morals are based from a religious stance, Can the two be separated?One person's morals are another person's cage. Let's look back through time at all the peopled supposed to be "moral and just" who are convicted of horrible assaults upon their children and spouses, and worse! How many people have died, victims of holy wars and someone's idea of "morality"?One of the values my mother gave me was that of compassion for my fellow man (or woman) My compassion would not include depriving them of freedom. But that's just my version of morality.Another person's version of morality might make it ok to bomb an abortion clinic.Thank heavens the American curts have taken all evidence: moral, logical, and scientific, and have still supported a woman's right to choose.

Funny how it is science that developed the procedures used, guaranteeing us the safe and sanitary methods employed across the globe.Funny also that logicians won't touch this subject with a ten foot pole.And morality.... well, as we all know, morality is in the eye of the beholder. When your morals are based from a religious stance, Can the two be separated?One person's morals are another person's cage. Let's look back through time at all the peopled supposed to be "moral and just" who are convicted of horrible assaults upon their children and spouses, and worse! How many people have died, victims of holy wars and someone's idea of "morality"?One of the values my mother gave me was that of compassion for my fellow man (or woman) My compassion would not include depriving them of freedom. But that's just my version of morality.Another person's version of morality might make it ok to bomb an abortion clinic.Thank heavens the American curts have taken all evidence: moral, logical, and scientific, and have still supported a woman's right to choose.

I didn't say that I know God totally, I respect your right, but like I said it was an opinion, accept it or not, that doesn't mean i'm violating your right. Listen to yourself. The next thing i will type you can accept or not. I don't care. But i think that you should take it into consideration, that s all i ask, ok? How do you know that God doesn't have a plan for that fetus? What if he does? You don't know so stop making contradictions of someting you know nothing about, You don't know God enough (you don't know him at all actually), don't you understand? Get to know God first then talk to me. God can do a miracle for that fetus when it comes for adoption. It just comes down to prayer. I know that we don't have the majority anymore but I think that's why there are so many kids orphaned. Simple, not enough prayer. I'm sure other christians have different opinions, so don't think that this is the answer that all christians have. You try to prove things through physical things, You can't do that.... it's spiritual, you can feel it...that would be the holy ghost. you can't see it because it is nothing of this world. If i have something incorrect here like something i missed, plz tell me, it's not my fault, sometimes i can't pay attention enough to what is said here. So much so little time. (I'm in school)One more thing which doesnt pertain to abortion but it troubles me, Evolutionists have been saying that the Earth is not young, correction it is young IN GOD'S EYES.

Now now now, I htink we're letting our emotions run away with us... take a deep breath.Now- please tell me what possible reason you have to think that your own personal opinion about anything should enter into my decision making process? You call me ignorant if I choose to "kill" that fetus, that I screw up God's plan for that human. I'm sorry... I know this is far beyond you to realize that I might have my own plan. Far be it from me to ask you to respect my right as a human to make choices regarding my own life, my own personal health, my own future. Why can't you people realize that your religion and it's beliefs are not superior, and are definitely not relevant. Guess what? Even if I was to buy into the whole christian mythology... I would still protect my right to choose... that's my responsibilty as a human.Go ahead and pray... I know I can't stop you....But I would trade a thousand of your prayers for just one ounce of understanding.

OK, I'm going to put this in as clear terms as possible.I don't beleive in god.I don't beleive the bible is inspired by the character depicted within.I don't believe that this character has any "plan" for me or for my unborn children.I have read the bible, plus many other scriptures that were edited out of the bible, and have yet to decide it is anything but mythology.Plainly and simply- this religion that I do not subscribe to has absoloutely nothing to do with the choices I make in life.I suppose you feel entitled to your opinion- but please realize that your opinion also has absolutely nothing to do with the choices I make.I have taken your opinion into consideration, and have found it...unreasonable.I am a buddhist. that means that I try to adhere to the teachings of a man. A simple man who wanted to figure out the world.I am also an american, which means that I have the freedom and the right not to listen to the opinions of christianity, that I have the right and freedom to live my life in any way I see fit (within the bounds of the law)And it also means, that for the time being, I have the right to have an abortion if I see fit.None of my expressed opinons mean that I would choose to do so if I found myself in that predicament. All it means is that I have the option.And I intend to defend and protect that option for myself and for all other women to the best of my ability.

Sure, adoption is a great alternative, but not always the most appropriate. In this debate I always hear about the thousands of childless couples who are just dying to adopt...but the same day, I hear about another dozen unwanted and unloved children slipping through the crack of the system. It seems that these "loving" couples have too many conditions to meet; the child is either too old or too young, too black or too white, too ugly, too needy, too much something wrong.I know three couples who are looking to adopt right now. Out of the three, not one would be willing to take a child with serious health problems. "It would be too hard, after all this." one woman said. Another, not so sensitive, said only, "How do you play with a crack baby?"A large percentage of the pregnancies that are aborted each year include those with serious defects and diseases. Add to that the children of drug addicts and "undesirable" lifestyles. Is there no case in which the woman has a right to decide her own medical future? Isn't there any justification for a woman dying of cancer to want to savor and enjoy her last days, rather than in pain and distress over a pregnancy which will shorten her life, a pregnancy with a poor prognosis because of her disease? I knowbecause it makes you feel better as a person to sit there and pass judgement on her.because that's what a certain religion dictates- nevermind that its not her religion.because these ignorant pro-life folk are much more concerned with a hypothetical life, than the quality of an existing one

Firstly, abortion has not been around since the beginning of mankind, although it’s been around for a while. Secondly, murder (which abortion is), has been around since the beginning of mankind. Now it’s a very dangerous procedure; you could be arrested or suffer death penalty. You seem to be quite ignorant about abortion. What exactly is abortion “eliminating”? What is being “eliminated”? You’re not answering my question. I’m not asking why she makes this choice; I’m asking what the choice does. Be very specific. Since when is it her body? Since when does a woman have a penis or two vaginas? And also, since when is it the mother’s choice whether her child should live or painfully die? Again, be specific.

Nope. Murder (or the killing innocent others) has been around since humans existed. In the earliest known history of man, we have evidence of murderers. Remember the Iceman? That was over 5,300 years ago (3,300 BC). Abortions only began to happen in  2600 BC. You are wrong.

I know you said that you don't believe in God, but I think it just comes down to prayer. If you pray about that child, then I believe that that person will be adopted.

Depends on how they defined it. Murder is a legal term. As I had said, to the Hebrews it was murder to kill one of their own, but not a heathen, or gentile. Do you want to know how many times they went to the toilet as well? :) You're asking a very frivolous question. You're the one who percented the link to that old abortion recipe not me. You trying to change the question now. :)And that was what?Yes, I agree, but it doesn't actually show what you think it does. All it showed was that abortions were at least that old. Not, that they were only that old. Ask any archeologist and they will give you the same answer.

That is a very cruel statment. You mean that your god is so petty that not even one prayer would be enough to get these children adopted? That he/she/it would punish orphaned children just because most people don't pray?BTW, at least 84% of Americans believe in the Christian god. And around 95% believe in a god.What am I saying, of course god would..

I don't think someone who has an abortion is going to ruin the almighty, all knowing, all powerful diety who obviously knows the future and thus the outcome of anything is his plan.So the abortion of a fetus is actaully part of his "plan".

What exactly is abortion “eliminating”? What is being “eliminated”?[QUOTE] OK, Parcum, I can tell you want me to spell it out. What is terminated is a possibly healthy life. An unborn child dies. A pregnancy is terminated. That is definite, what is not is the quality of life and health of that child, if it was to be born. The latter does not seem to concern you.[QUOTE]You’re not answering my question. I’m not asking why she makes this choice; I’m asking what the choice does. Be very specific.[QUOTE]OK, once again, the man who has called me ignorant knows not what this choice does. ok, let me spell it out for you. In a normal, early-term abortion, the woman goes to the clinic, is put up in the stirrups. She is given a local anaesthetic, and another drug which will dilate her cervix. At that point, the doctor goes in and scrapes the sides of her uterus, removing the lining and the pregnancy. In simple terms, once again, the life is terminated. This is a relatively painless outpatient procedure. IN most cases the woman suffers almost no pain, no bleeding, and no permanenet damage. In about 1 out of 1000 cases there will be some hemoraging, and in about 1 in 10,000, resulting sterility. since when is it her body? Since I have never seen a deed to her uterus signed over to another, to be blunt. A woman has one vagina, usually in order for pregnancy to occur, it has to be penetrated by a penis,ejaculated into, and her ovum must be fertilized. (rather simple stuff- my 8 year old nephew gave me a refresher- you should try some elementary education.) Since when should a mother be able to decide whether her child should live, or painfully die? Back a few paragraphs i explained the abortion procedure to you. I seriously doubt the child feels any pain, since in the first trimester, it's nervous system is barelybeginning to form, and the pain receptors have not been established. (if this is hard for you to understand, that 8 year old might be able to explain it.) The woman has the right because it is she who has this thing growing in her body, not you on your high seat of holier than thou power. Most people think that a woman is naturally ingrained wih the knowledge of waht is best for her children after birth, but no-one can handle thinking she is before.

Firstly, abortion has not been around since the beginning of mankind, although it’s been around for a while. Secondly, murder (which abortion is), has been around since the beginning of mankind. Now it’s a very dangerous procedure; you could be arrested or suffer death penalty. You seem to be quite ignorant about abortion. What exactly is abortion “eliminating”? What is being “eliminated”? You’re not answering my question. I’m not asking why she makes this choice; I’m asking what the choice does. Be very specific. Since when is it her body? Since when does a woman have a penis or two vaginas? And also, since when is it the mother’s choice whether her child should live or painfully die? Again, be specific.

That is a very cruel statment. You mean that your god is so petty that not even one prayer would be enough to get these children adopted? That he/she/it would punish orphaned children just because most people don't pray?BTW, at least 84% of Americans believe in the Christian god. And around 95% believe in a god.What am I saying, of course god would..

God knew that abortioned baby before it even entered the womb. There is something like that, im not saying anymore cause ill know ill be critized again

I don't think someone who has an abortion is going to ruin the almighty, all knowing, all powerful diety who obviously knows the future and thus the outcome of anything is his plan.So the abortion of a fetus is actaully part of his "plan".

Yes, the Romans did it all the time. That was the killing of innocent human beings. The unlawful killing of human beings would mean it was against the law- but the Romans obviously did not have moral or governmental laws against this sort of murder. No, Abortion hasn’t been around since the first unwanted pregnancy. I already showed you that the earliest findings of Abortion were in 2,600 BC. There is something we must understand: If the fetus is a human being, it has every right to live. Nobody can take it’s life. However, if it’s part of the mother or not a human being, it has no right. Now let’s say the infant is born. Do I have a right to kill it because it has the possibility of living a very sad life in the future? Of course not. There are two reasons for this; 1) You are not to judge another being’s state and choose for it whether it should live or die. 2) You never know what it’s future will be. Joan of Arc had a sad childhood. Saline Dion was planned to be aborted. Since when do parents have the right to decide if their children should die? There have been 273 deaths of women from legal abortions from 1980-1990. However, usually it is painless for the mother. But what about the fetus? That fetus is torn apart inside the mother’s body and taken out, literally. The fetus definitely feels pain! Don’t you think the fetus matters too?A) But it isn’t her body. If it were her body the fetus would need to have the same DNA, same blood type, same everything. But it doesn’t. The fetus has a different DNA. The fetus has a different blood type. Also, if the fetus was part of the mother, then that would mean the mother has two vaginas, or a penis and vagina, or four arms, four legs, two different brains, four eyes, four legs, two hearts, et cetera. I don’t think there is such thing as one human being with all that. B) The child does feel pain. The nervous system comes at around six weeks, and sympathetic nerves come at 8 weeks. 78% of abortions are done during or AFTER the 6th week, and 60% of abortions are done during or after the 8th week. Obviously, most abortions do cause the pain of the fetus. But does it matter whether it feels pain or not? If I go unconscious, most likely I don’t feel pain. Does that mean anyone has the right to kill me? Of course not. C) Why does the woman have a right to control anything growing in her body? That doesn’t necessarily matter. If I were to shrink and be placed in a tiny ship to go into the mother’s body to fix her heart, does she have the right to kill me? No. The fetus is a living, human being, who has every right in the world.

This is an open forum. Live with it. What I had said was nothing in comparison to the offensive statement you had made above. Saying that your god was making these orphaned children suffer just because people weren't praying. That is as bad as when Jerry Falwell stated that the 9/11 attack happened because Americans weren't praying enough and this was a punishment from god. Is it anywonder so many speak out again the religious like you.

The earliest findings....that is a concieted way of saying records. Let me point out that the first narrative, the Epic of Gilgamesh, dates from roughly the same period, 3rd millenium B.C. Are we to believe that people didn't tell stories before that?1. People choose the whys wherefores and hows of other beings existence everyday. I'm from Colorado (farm country) and have seen this firsthand. On a daily basis we are called to make these decisions. We put a horse down to "put it out of it's misery", we kill of millions of "pests" (prairie dogs, rats, etc) every day, we kill off thousands of cows a day because they taste good. These are everyday occurrences people in farm country are comfortable with, and these deaths are for worse reasons that say, inevitable organ shutdown.2. Of course we never know what the future holds, but perhaps the extensively learned and trained medical professionals have more insight than most? Parents make this decision on a regular basis. Visit the ICU sometime, you'll meet parents struggling with that decision. Of course, whether they'll want your opinion remains to be see. (PS its CELINE- as in the greek moon goddess, not SALINE- as in a water/salt solution.)Your ignorance astounds me. Except in the case of late term abortion, the fetus is removed intact. (This is to pervent a little thing called toxic shock syndrome) And also I might point out, again, that in most cases, the abortion is performed before the end of the first trimester. Simple anatomy here: pain is the brain's response to electrical stimuli, without a fully developed nervous system, including complete neural networks, this "feeling" does not exist.Take your ridiculous propaganda and throw it away- get the facts before you try to use words like "of course".What gives you more right than she to make these decisions?answer carefully.

That is because to them it wasn't murder. Only citizens of the Empire had any rights.Irrelevant. That only showed that it was at least since then. Ask any archeologist and they'll give you the same answer.It is only a potential human being.Under the law it has very few rights and they are supercede by the mother's.Then it is a person under the law.The law does.Irrelevant. They don't now, but a fetus is neither a baby nor a child just the same as we aren't either. It is a fetus. Again you use emotional blackmail and an untruth as well. There is risk in any medical procedure.Having pain and knowing pain are two different things.[Irrelevant emotional blackmail deleted]

I dare say her childhood wasn't nearly as bad as her death. Burned at the stake... can you imagine how horrific that was? How incredibly painful? How it must have felt to have her skin, inch by inch, burned to a crisp. took a while too, I'm sure. Hours. compared to the ten minute (at a stretch) abortion procedure.You talk about the pain of an incomplete, partially formed embryo, one that has not the nervous system to support the feeling of pain, and in the same post you then point out how great Jean d'Arc's life was? How much worse off she would have been if she had not lived? I'm sure she felt that way as she was imprisoned, tortured, and finally executed by the devoutly religious. She was killed at the hands of the Catholics, remember? The same people who are supposed to believe in "Thou shalt not kill"And remember, it took the church 500 years to decide, well, maybe we shouldn't a done that.Great example there.

I don’t doubt that Abortion has been around for a long time. But I’m positive murder has been around longer, which was the debate me and Charchuk were having.1) Would you put an infant “out of it’s misery”? Obviously, horses and humans are two different things. Humans have laws; animals have instinct. Every human is going to eventually die. Just because the fetus would die at the age of three doesn’t mean it doesn’t have a right to live. This is why the overwhelming population of handicapped people are pro-life- if you’re not conceived perfectly with no problems, you’re killed. Handicapped people aren’t perfectly created, so they know they will be next. 2) Why does that matter? Have you not seen the movie “Gattaca”? The main character in the movie, Vincent (later “Jerome”), wasn’t born perfectly in his futuristic world, where humans were created genetically perfect. He had a 99% chance of dying at the age of 30 from heart failure. His whole life people thought of him as chronically ill. So much so, there was a new lower-class of people who weren’t genetically perfect. In the work force, the only good-paying prestigious jobs were only open to people created perfectly. He fought the system and eventually got the most prestigious job there, and he didn’t die at the age of 30. Nothing happened. I’ve been to ICUs. I think it’s great that mothers are trying to save their children. But do you think parents should make the decision to kill their newborn infant, or should they do their best to let it live? LOL! Here is an image drawn by Nucleus Medical Art that shows the abortion procedure on a 9-week-old fetus. I could show you the 23-week old one too if you’d like. Secondly, according to the CDC, 60% of abortions are done during or after the 8th week, when the fetus can feel pain. This is before the first trimester, but the first trimester goes all the way to 12 weeks. That doesn’t matter. The  fetus still feels pain, and this is from a very liberal site  This signal is sent via nerve pathways to the spinal column, then to the thalamus - an egg-shaped structure within the brain. Finally the signal is transferred to the cerebral cortex where it is sensed as pain. In a fetus, the pain receptors develop around 7 weeks after conception; the spino-thalamic system at about 13 weeks. Here He estimated the age at which a preborn child feels pain: "As early as eight to 10 weeks' gestation, and definitely by thirteen and a half weeks, the human fetus experiences organic pain." HereThe fetus feels the full pain at 20 weeks, that is pain like we feel, but there is still pain to the fetus with the new pain receptors. What makes the government the right for me not to kill you? Why should I listen to the Pope? Your parent says it’s wrong for me to kill you, but what gives them to make my decision? It’s MY choice, is it not?

So we should’ve killed Joan of Arc when she was a fetus, right? What about when she was newly born? What if she was paralyzed? What if she was unconscious? Just because you either don’t or feel little pain doesn’t mean that somebody has the right to inflict it on you, because in their opinion you should be dead. I’m sure Joan of Arc was happy she lived. I’m happy I lived. If I died savagely, I’m not going to ask God to make it so I never existed; I’m happy that I at least had a little bit of life. She was Catholic, and in fact a Catholic saint, and before that she was a venerable, and blessed (only a few decades after her death). Sure, it took the church 500 years to decide if she was a saint or not- but it takes a while. We weren’t sure if her miracles were true; we weren’t sure if she was holy. The church doesn’t just say “Ah she was good, she must be a saint!”. It takes YEARS for one to be a saint. It took Kateri Tekawitha 150 years. Joan of Arc’s time is relatively short compared to others.

For one it is not pro-abortion rights or anything. It is pro-choice.

Also, could every person here who is pro-abortion rights explain briefly why they believe the fetus is not a "person?" Please also say whether or not you think there is such a thing as objective moral law. I know this is a bit redundant but it would make things easier considering there is a lot of disagreement about it and I'd appreciate it. :-)

That fallacy again? The world was formed from the Solar Nebula around 4.5 billion years ago. The universe is around 8 to 9 billion years older than our solar system. Before that it is an unknown.As you would know if you'd bother to read what has been posted is that we've never said that it wasn't human. When I say potential I mean a potential human being, a person. That is the point. You believe that DNA is what makes us a human being. Transgenic animals prove you wrong.

The remains of a previous star system. It is the ultimate recycling program. :) A star dies, the expelled material gradually condenses to a critical point and nuclear fusion occurs again. The planets are just left over debris which was far enough away not to get dragged back into the sun but was still able to form on its own. Did you know that Jupiter is a failed star? The Alpha Centari star system had been part of the same nebula as well as Tau Ceti and some other local star systems which gradually had drifted out of the stellar nursery, which had been the nebula to where they are now. One could say that this is how stars reproduce.

It was since you are assuming that your god created the universe. Just because we don't know how the universe came about doesn't automatically mean that your god did it.Being human.Since you believe that being human means the same as being a person and the only thing relevant to that is DNA.Wrong on all accounts. All we're in favor is for the right to choice. You keep assuming that women will always use this choice to have abortions only.Wrong. We only support the right to choose not what is chosen. That is one of the lamest and sickest statements you have made. And totall inaccurate as well. It is nothing more than emotional blackmail.We never have.And of course you are quite wrong.The part of the brain where the mind is formed.To Western culture yes it was and Germany is part of that culture.Yes since it is based on a lie and deceptions. It was unjustified.I know what you're trying to get at here and it is irrelevant. To our culture those things are wrong, to another they aren't. In Afghanistan, under the Taliban, it was right to oppress women since women are nothing but prpoerty to them (Our culture was really no different not too long ago). We didn't invade Afghanistan because of what they were doing to women. We invaded because they were habouring an enemy who attacked us.The context is the same as it would be here and will take the same time since it is saying what we're repeating here.Basically, yes, though it wasn't overnight as you are trying to imply.Because god doesn't really explain the orgin of the universe either.What does evolution have to do with the origin of the universe? They are two totally unrelated issues."Puff GODDIDIT!"Since you already believe in fairy tales what's one more? :)That is a tautological arguement or circular logic.There are many different theories about the origin of the universe.

I have been pondering this abit. Here is my thinking. The universe exists within a framework. Most folks would call that framework space-time. To be self existent, it would necessarily have to come from outside of the framework. There would have to be something that is outside of time for time to exist. We could call that eternity. No one might say that eternity is a framework and would require something outside of it to exist. That would not follow logically. Eternity by definition is frameless. Boundless. That concept leads to a definition of God.

There is also the thought that our universe is part of a much bigger framework called the COSMOS where universes are born and die all of the time. Why would god even need to create anything when there is no perception of time for god? And why would god need us to believe in god as well? What would be the point? Do you expect the atoms in your body to worship you? Are you even aware of them on in individual basis as god is suppose to be?

Define "natural". By conventional definitions, anything which is cultural isn't "natural". Likewise, many things which are very harmful are arguably "natural", disease for example. Unless you happen to live without electricity, medication, clothing, buildings, etc.- in which case you wouldn't be in a forum at all- it makes no sense for you to argue against anything on the basis that it is not "natural".Abortion has been around for as long as people have been using plants to medicate themselves, which predates agriculture. It is arguably instinctual to use herbs to affect the body- many primates and even other mammals "medicate" with plants.

The difference is that slaves have always been human beings. Defining them as not has always been a racially and prejuically (sp) motivated belief. A fetus, on the otherhand is defined as not being a person on scientific grounds.

George McKenna wrote this in an article titled "On Abortion: A Lincolnian Position,""In all these [presidential speeches and Lincoln Douglas debates] he [Lincoln] continually reminded his audience that the theme of choice without reference to the object of choice was morally empty." (emphasis mine)Lincoln was speaking to Douglas' reference to the "freedom of choice" of slavery. The article, a comparison of slavery and abortion, can be read here:http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/95...n/abortion.htm

Where did I say that or even imply it? Abortion takes a conscious choice. All I had said was that the concept of murder has only existed since the concept of law was invented.

Here is the abortion clinic's history of abortionEncyclopedia.com says that it was probably used earleir than ancient Greece, Egypt, and Rome, but that's still not saying much. No, I'm not admitting anything. Charchuk is trying to make it as if though humans almost instinctively have abortions. I'm trying to tell him this is not the case. He's also trying to say that murder came AFTER abortion.

They are one and the same.

I've been trying to tell him I meant murder in a moral form, but he isn't listening.

Let's accept your belief. That still doesn't mean abortion came before murder. Again, the earliest records of abortion are in 2600 BC- and Sumerian culture lived way before then, not to mention that there were many other cultures that found murder sinful.

Murder has only been around since the concept of law has been around to define it as such. And even then it was a very narrow definition as well considering that it only applied to members of each tribe or city and not to those outside.

So if one man from a tribe murdered a child from the same tribe, he wouldn't be punished? Of course he would! Either way, this is irrelivent to the abortion issue. The fetus is a human being and therefore it is wrong to kill it.

I believe in the same thing. Like in places like India and China where they abort the fetus just because it is a girl. Boy babies are considered to be more valuable. In many of these places gender typing is illegal now. They won't even tell you the gender of the fetus here even though gender typing isn't used to abort female fetuses here.

Mind: That which thinks, reasons, perceives, wills, and feels. The mind now appears in no way separate from the brain. In neuroscience, there is no duality between the mind and body. They are one. Medical DictionaryAre unconscious individuals not humans then? They don't think, reason, percieve, will, or feel. The mind is within the brain, but are two seperate entities. Saying that you only need a brain (as in the organ) to be human is like saying "You need liver to be human". The fetus is a human being because it is: A) A seperate entity from the mother, B) alive C) biologically human. Further, it is a person (being) because it has it's own DNA, it's own stimulation in the womb, it's own future, et cetera.

Facts? You want facts? Fine. At conception, the zygote has 46 chromosones (unless it has down's syndrome), and it's own, unique, DNA (unless it has a twin or clone). The zygote at that point has the exactly blueprint of what it'll look like, what diseases it will have, et cetera infinitum. This zygote is independent from the mother- if it's part of the mother, does that mean the mother has two DNAs, two blood types, two vaginas or a penis and vagina? No. The zygote is seperate; it's a parasite. Is it a life? Yes, because it follows the criteria for lie; it metabolizes, reproduces, grows, and stimulates. Is it human? Yes, because it's DNA type is human. Anyone with human DNA is Human. Period. Is it a person? Certainly. It has it's own future; that's a person. Does it think? Not until about 12 weeks does it think like you and I do, and at the 7 weeks has brainwaves. But that doesn't matter; it doesn't make it any less human. A mind doesn't make somebody human. People who are unconscious don't have a mind (they arn't aware, or have the ability to think, will, et cetera). Are they not human? Of course not. Finally, the only type of being the fetus can be is a HUMAN being, because of biogenesis (hence, two dogs of opposite sex make puppies; humans make humans (zygotes)).That was pretty much a sum of how teh fetus is human.

Parcum, parcum parcum.....What you provided me with (after I decoded your atrocious spelling and grammar of course) was the basic biology of a human zygote.Your simplistic explanation explains that this zygote is human, but as far as I know, that was never in question. I don't think anyone has ever accused it of being canine, bovine, etc.You say it has it's own future, but unfortunately, you fail to realize that every child's future is determined by it's parents. At least the technical parts of it's future, like survival. (I'm not going to get into whether it will be a doctor, lawyer or indian chief with you)Maybe she'll decide not to have an abortion, but then decide not to use a car seat... a much more dangerous and tragic proposition.Perhaps that child's future is destined never to be realized, or better put, perhaps its destiny is to be aborted. The idea that it has its own future apart from what the mother decides is strictly a matter of opinion.My opinion is that nothing is pre-ordained, there is no such thing as destiny, fate, etc. The choices we each personally make determine our future, what else? God? the very concept of god is a matter of opinion, not fact.You also say that it has a genetic blueprint- which is true. but every component of that blueprint is genetically handed down by either the mother or the fatherNOT YOUSo why should you, or anyone else, but the mother or father have any say in the future of that molecular structure?

Superbudd, I think you’re simply misunderstanding my argument. In California, the law is that if you’re brain dead you’re officially dead. If an individual is brain dead, there’s no use in keeping them alive, because they aren’t going to come back. So, no, there aren’t thousands of people who are brain dead in the country; most of them are dead. Sometimes doctors keep them alive for transplants. It depends; there are levels of unconsciousness. Sometimes they can be somewhat aware, other times they aren’t aware at all. For instance, I have levels of sleep. If I’m partially asleep, I and my parents talk to me, I can hear them. However, if I’m in a deep sleep, I don’t hear anyone at all. Being unconscious is usually much deeper though, and a person doesn’t think at all, as what happened to my father a few years ago. The medical definition of “unconscious” is: Unconscious: 1) Interruption of awareness of oneself and one's surroundings, lack of the ability to notice or respond to stimuli in the environment. A person may become unconscious due to oxygen deprivation, shock, central nervous system depressants such as alcohol and drugs, or injury. 2) In psychology, that part of thought and emotion that happens outside everyday awareness.You’ve already said the fetus is not a human being. That’s what I’m asking you. Not if it’s human, if it’s a human being (even though that’s just a useless technicality). The fetus is alive and therefore has the right to keep it’s life. The mother cannot decide whether it should live or die, because it isn’t her life, it’s the fetus life. It’s not “my body, my choice”, it’s the “fetus’ body, the fetus’ choice”. Please, define both.Charchuk, I would shut up. Nobody ever understands what you’re talking about. You just annoy everyone because of your incompetence.

At one time death was when the heart stopped beating, now it is when the brain ceases to function. Most of the time the bodies are kept going because the families are willing to accept that their loved one is dead.UnconsciousFunction:noun Date:circa 1912: the part of mental life that does not ordinarily enter the individual's awareness yet may influence behavior and perception or be revealed (as in slips of the tongue or in dreams)The mind is always active, even when it is not connected to the waking part of it. Just take brainscans of any coma patient. The waves maybe different, but they are still there.It is not a human being, a person. having human DNA doesn't make one a person.It maybe alive, but it doesn't have a life.Ireelvant. You are proving that you just won't get the difference here since you really don't know any better.Please, you're the one who is incoherent. You don't even know the different being human and being a human being, a person. Or even the correct definition of conscious and unconscious.

So where do you draw the line, oh person-who-feels-they-can-define-what-no-one-else-can? Is sperm a person? Is an ovum? Every 28 days I get rid of a potential child, am I a murderer for that? Should I please god and get pregnant very time I ovulate? Should I then have started at eleven years old?Is it with the meiosis, or only once mitosis sets in that the fertilized ovum becomes a person? When the zygote still has a tail, is it a person? http://zygote.swarthmore.edu/regul15.GIF Or is it as soon as limbs have formed? Anyway, no one is saying that a zygote or an embryo is a "nonentity". But until it can live independently of the mother's body, it is a part of her body. I've yet to meet a person who has had an abortion who did not find the experience traumatic and had to grieve the loss. It is a terrible thing. Attacking people who go through that tragedy is cruel and misplaced.

The dictionary, as you pointed out, is not necessarily the best place to define scientific terms in the medical field, which is why my definition came from a medical dictionary. If we look at a regular dictionary, it says “Consciousness” is the “mind”.  Main Entry: con•scious•ness Pronunciation: -n&sFunction: nounDate: 16321 a : the quality or state of being aware especially of something within oneself b : the state or fact of being conscious of an external object, state, or fact c : AWARENESS; especially : concern for some social or political cause2 : the state of being characterized by sensation, emotion, volition, and thought : MIND3 : the totality of conscious states of an individual4 : the normal state of conscious life <regained consciousness>5 : the upper level of mental life of which the person is aware as contrasted with unconscious processes Main Entry: 1un•con•scious Pronunciation: "&n-'kän(t)-sh&sFunction: adjectiveDate: 17121 a : not knowing or perceiving : not aware b : free from self-awareness2 a : not possessing mind or consciousness <unconscious matter> b (1) : not marked by conscious thought, sensation, or feeling <unconscious motivation> (2) : of or relating to the unconscious c : having lost consciousness <was unconscious for three days>3 : not consciously held or deliberately planned or carried out <unconscious bias>- un•con•scious•ly adverb- un•con•scious•ness noun Further, brain waves aren’t part of the mind. As I’ve shower from the medical dictionary, one must be able to “think, reason, perceive, will, and feel”. Brain waves don’t involve any of these things. The mind isn’t the only source of personhood. The fetus has its OWN DNA. Sure, if a fetus has a twin or is closed it doesn’t have its own DNA, but it still has, at least something of its own. Also, there really isn’t such thing as a “non-person, living, human”. Such humans don’t exist! Throughout history, blacks, women, people of different religions, et cetera, were considered human non-persons. But the truth of the matter is such humans don’t exist. How? Debating involves having a counter argument, not just making a counter statement. If you say that your car is green, I can easily say “no it’s not” or “it’s blue”, but I need an argument with evidence to back it up. I’m assuming you’re saying that because the zygote doesn’t have a brain means it’s not a life. Jellyfish don’t have brains, but they have lives, don’t they? If a jellyfish killed another jellyfish would that jellyfish be committing murder, or no? Show me an example of a human non-person that has a life. Boopee20, It’s not horrible to believe women have rights. That’s not a bad thing. There is even a very large organization called Feminists for Life. The thing is just because women have rights doesn’t mean they can decide whether their children should live or die. In the 1950’s the earliest point of viability for the fetus was 8 months. By 1970 it was 7 months. Today, we can do it at 5 months. Does this mean that the 7-month-old fetus in 1950 wasn’t human, but now is? Does that make any sense?But the Sperm and Egg are part of another being’s body. They aren’t their own beings. The DNA of the sperm is half the DNA of the father, and the DNA of the egg is half the DNA of the mother. The fetus, however, has it’s OWN DNA. If the fetus is part of the mother, would that mean the mother has two blood types? Two brains? If the fetus is a boy, a penis? Of course not, that’s ridiculous!

Why in the world do you keep making this (non) point? No one ever said the woman created the child all by herself. No, they weren't. But there's a big difference between slavery and abortion. In fact, I'm led to believe you would rather a child be born into slavery than not be born at all.Fortunately, our govrnment has chosen not to agree with your limited, biased, juvenile view of things.Now I have a question for you, Parcum.Actually, I would just like you to answer my past questions.I'll start with...

Ok, Parcum, once again you are misusing terminology.A fetus is not a parasite for the simple fact that it is created (yes with help) by the mother.A parasite, by definition, is something that attaches itself to the host, feeds off the host, contributes nothing to the host, and is a detriment to the well being of the host. And, it is incapable of survival without a host throughout its entire lifespan. A fetus, on the other hand, has a very good chance of survival without the mother only a little past halfway through the pregnancy, and its chances are only improved from that point on. By the time of natural delivery, it is completely capable of survival on its own-hence, it is not a parasite.A parasite is not OF the host, it is a separate entity. It is a completely separate animal, and, I have to point out, is always a different species than the host.But, by using the word parasite, you make us think it should be exterminated....like with an abortion. With all the connotations attached to the term parasite, you are actually helping to support the pro-choice view.Perhaps you should get a little more worldy experience before you start making judgements on something you have such a limited understanding of....oh, yeah, I'm still waiting for some answers

I don’t see how women who commit incest are not responsible; they still had sex by their own decision. For faulty birth control, the woman should’ve known the risks, so yes she’s responsible. As for rape, she is not responsible for what happened, but she is still responsible to take care of the baby. Why when something happens we have to make it worse by killing a human being? Okay, so I can kill my children because “I made them!”? LOL.From a Medical Dictionary: Parasite: An organism that lives in or on and takes its nourishment from another organism. A parasite cannot live independently. Parasitic diseases include infections by protozoa, helminths, and arthropods: • Protozoa -- Malaria is caused by plasmodium, a protozoa, a single-cell organism that can only divide within its host organism. • Helminths -- Schistosomiasis, another set of very important parasitic diseases, is caused by a helminth (a worm). • Arthropods -- The arthropods include insects and arachnids (spiders, etc.), a number of which can act as vectors (carriers) of parasitic diseases. The term "parasite" came from the Greek "parasitos" (para-, along side of + sitos, food) meaning "eating at the side of, as at the same table." The sense of the term later changed to that of a poor friend or relative who lived at the expense of another. Not until the 18th century did "parasite" come into English as a biologic term. The study of parasites is parasitology. Yes, a fetus is a parasite, for at least the first 5 months of the pregnancy (this will change in time). Either way, the fetus is still a human being. It is NOT part of the mother! So, the newborn baby is also part of the mother? It’s called a type. ‘Terminate’ is used more for non-living beings, when the fetus is a living being. You’re not only terminating the pregnancy, you’re killing the fetus. What, in your opinion, is the fetus? Just make sure you understand that you WERE once a fetus. You were never a sperm and egg, you were, however, a fetus. I suppose one could say evolution is happening faster than we think!

We never said that it was a part of her. We said that it was attached. Remove this connection too early and it will die.We never said anything otherwise. BTW, it is possible, though. A hermaphrodite can have one of it's set of reproductive organs be function, but not both.No, because slaves have always been human beings. Even under the constitution and Bill of Rights. The whites just refused to acknowlege this fact because of prejudice and the fact that it was cheaper to keep slaves than to actually pay someone a fair wage.Every person has a right to life in the USA, a fetus is not a person.

Yes. Very good. That's irrelivent. The hermaphrodite is concieved with these organs; the mother isn't. Is the mother then, during pregnancies, a hermaphrodite? Nope. THey were 3/4 human, remember? Not fully human. Fetuses for the longest time were considered human beings, only recently have they not been considered humans. In fact, blacks throughout history have been considered lesser humans.

We never said that it was a part of her. We said that it was attached. Remove this connection too early and it will die.We never said anything otherwise. BTW, it is possible, though. A hermaphrodite can have one of it's set of reproductive organs be function, but not both.No, because slaves have always been human beings. Even under the constitution and Bill of Rights. The whites just refused to acknowlege this fact because of prejudice and the fact that it was cheaper to keep slaves than to actually pay someone a fair wage.Every person has a right to life in the USA, a fetus is not a person.

Laws against abortion are actually fairly recent, with the first laws against late-term abortions appearing in the 1820s, and most abortions only being outlawed in 1900. So abortion was only illegal for about 70 years, give or take.

Yes. Very good. That's irrelivent. The hermaphrodite is concieved with these organs; the mother isn't. Is the mother then, during pregnancies, a hermaphrodite? Nope. THey were 3/4 human, remember? Not fully human. Fetuses for the longest time were considered human beings, only recently have they not been considered humans. In fact, blacks throughout history have been considered lesser humans. Neither is a human who is unconscious, then.

Laws were pretty recent, that is correct. However, it was a Christian belief that abortion was wrong.

Don't make that sound as if it were some victory for you. It isn't. Which came firs, the chicken ot the egg? You are not understanding what is being said. I have a feeling that that is intentional. That was all based on ignorance and hatred of non-whites by whites. For centuries even the Church taught that a fetus wasn't a life until it drew its first breathe. In order to be unconscious you first must have a consciousness to be un from. A fetus doesn't. In other words consciousness is a function of the mind and since a fetus doesn't have one it can't be conscious, or unconscious. I've been unconscious. It was during surgery on my knee and I remember afterwards hearing the doctor talking and what he said. I even dreamed some.Sleep1. A natural and periodic state of rest during which consciousness of the world is suspendedYou're mind is at it most active when you are asleep (unconscious} since it is not being distracted by your body.

I'm not saying it's a victory- I'm saying it's good that we agree upon something. You're just annoyed. The Church orginally taught that the fetus wasn't human until a later stage in fetal life- not the first breath, because they got this tradition from the Jews. However, we didn't know as much about human life as we know now, and the church hadn't made an official doctrine until later. The egg came before the chicken.As I've stated earlier, there are levels of unconsciousness. Sleeping and being in a Coma are definately not the same thing.

We had never disagreed on this one point. All along we've said that a fetus was human, but not a human being.We were taught it wasn't a life until its first breathe and when my grandmother's last pregnancy ended in a still birth (the cord was wrapped around his neck and choked him before was delivered) The preist refused to baptize or even allow him to be buried on hallow ground since he never drew his first breathe.I may have mentioned this before, but there were monuments placed not too long ago in many of our cemetaries dedicated to aborted fetuses.

Don’t lie. Priests can’t do that. If he did that he is in serious mortal sin. Now, if the baby died, that’s different. Source? I highly doubt it.I went unconscious too when I broke my leg.

First of all, if a woman is raped by her uncle, it is still called incest. Another factor you dismiss is the psychological reasons why a woman might choose to have sex with that person willingly. Is a twelve year old girl really capable fo making those decisions...she sure is capable of conception. Maybe the kid wasn't strong enough to say no...and fight off a 300 lb grown man, but she was smart enough to know that if she did, he might kill her, or go after her even youger sister. Once again, you are guilty of not examining a situation you have no ability to understand.As for faulty birth control... you must be under the impression that people should never have sex unless it is for procreation. This is a ridiculous, unrealistic and ignorant view to have. And finally, in the case of rape..you think a woman who has suffered enough physical and mental trauma should have to endure even more because it would make YOU feel better? I'll bet a thousand dollars YOU have never had a bruised cervix, so why should YOU be able to determine that the best method of recovery would be to put a 10lb load on that cervix. Or are you of the opinion that this woman is not entitled to recovery?Why not? People think that the simple biological act of parenting a child makes them capable of making all other decisions for that child. this coming from a person who can't even use a normal dictionary!Okay, simpleton, let me just point out that an organism is the same organism throughout it's entire lifespan! It doesnt start out life as a snail, turn into a monkey, and end up a squid.see, a parasite is a parasite until it dies.....So unless you think that you're going to wake up tomorrow with the need for a good dose of nutrients through your umbilical cord.....Wake upand stop trying to use words you have no way of grasping.well, until it's cord is cut, it is still attached, right?Obviously YOU have never been a mother, or else you would not ask the question.would you prefer me to say kill? YOU- man of the big words is not comfortable with this one? You think I am not aware that there is a death involved in an abortion? I am completely aware of this fact.

I don’t see how women who commit incest are not responsible; they still had sex by their own decision. For faulty birth control, the woman should’ve known the risks, so yes she’s responsible. As for rape, she is not responsible for what happened, but she is still responsible to take care of the baby. Why when something happens we have to make it worse by killing a human being? Okay, so I can kill my children because “I made them!”? LOL.From a Medical Dictionary: Parasite: An organism that lives in or on and takes its nourishment from another organism. A parasite cannot live independently. Parasitic diseases include infections by protozoa, helminths, and arthropods: • Protozoa -- Malaria is caused by plasmodium, a protozoa, a single-cell organism that can only divide within its host organism. • Helminths -- Schistosomiasis, another set of very important parasitic diseases, is caused by a helminth (a worm). • Arthropods -- The arthropods include insects and arachnids (spiders, etc.), a number of which can act as vectors (carriers) of parasitic diseases. The term "parasite" came from the Greek "parasitos" (para-, along side of + sitos, food) meaning "eating at the side of, as at the same table." The sense of the term later changed to that of a poor friend or relative who lived at the expense of another. Not until the 18th century did "parasite" come into English as a biologic term. The study of parasites is parasitology. Yes, a fetus is a parasite, for at least the first 5 months of the pregnancy (this will change in time). Either way, the fetus is still a human being. It is NOT part of the mother! So, the newborn baby is also part of the mother? It’s called a type. ‘Terminate’ is used more for non-living beings, when the fetus is a living being. You’re not only terminating the pregnancy, you’re killing the fetus. What, in your opinion, is the fetus? Just make sure you understand that you WERE once a fetus. You were never a sperm and egg, you were, however, a fetus. I suppose one could say evolution is happening faster than we think!

It’s incestual rape. Not just incest. I don’t think we should use birth control at all, because it can act as an abortive pill. I do believe that people should be allowed to use condoms and other methods of contraception. I don’t admit to being raped or knowing anyone who has been. However, that doesn’t make my argument invalid; I’m sure you haven’t been raped, and bet you know few if any who were raped. Now, don’t get emotional, but if a woman was raped do you think she should be allowed to savagely kill the man who raped her? Of course not. Not only is that legally wrong, but morally it is as well. Why then, should she be allowed to kill somebody else who had nothing to do with the rape except that her existence came from it? What if she was born? Should you be allowed to kill her because every time you look at her she reminds you of something horrible? Of course not! There are many solutions to that problem. At any rate, rape only makes 1% of all abortions (30 abortions a day). Sure, you can make decisions, but that doesn’t mean you can’t kill it. I don’t go to my son and say “hold still I’m going to kill you. I can because me and your mom made you”. That’s ridiculous. Mande?Firstly, a parasite isn’t a species. It’s ANY organism that sucks from one being with no return. I’m a parasite to my parents. But the bold is very important- an organism is the SAME organism throughout it’s entire lifespan. You keep arguing that the fetus is human but not a human being, this proves that it is a human being. It’s ALWAYS a human being. It isn’t just at one point part of the mother and the next point it’s own being; it’s always one organism. [quote] see, a parasite is a parasite until it dies.....So unless you think that you're going to wake up tomorrow with the need for a good dose of nutrients through your umbilical cord.....Wake upand stop trying to use words you have no way of grasping.[/quoet]No, a Parasite is not a parasite until it dies. Tapeworms leave their hosts. Ticks leave their hosts. Many humans actually have a sort of umbilical cord- people on feeding tubes, respirators, et cetera. Are they part of the machine? Sure, it’s attached, just like an infant is attached to it’s mother when she drinks from the breasts. It’s also attached like people on feeding tubes. Does that mean the infant is part of the mother when it drinks, and the ill person is part of the machine when on a feeding tube? OF course not! If you were once a fetus, you’re saying you were once your mother. WTF? You don’t make any sense!

i'm not going to dither over your questionable grasp of semanticshmmmm, so contraception is not birth control? Again, your limited grasp of the language. Gee, thanks, I'm glad I get to keep my diaphragm.First of all, I think I should let you know that I am a woman (my screen name is just that, a screen name) And I have been raped. So much for the things you are sure about. No, I don't think I should have the right to kill my rapist. But the reason I don't want to kill him is not some moral ideal, it's that he is already going to spend the rest of his life in prison for other crimes, so I am quite happy with that idea.I have encountered dozens of rape victims. Along with several other projects, I have acted as a victim's advocate. In fact, scary thought, if something happens to you, someone like me may respond. Did you know that in the course of their life, one out of four women will be raped?But my question had nothing to do with her psychological condition. No, I don't think she should have an abortion because of some horrible memory- for that she needs counseling. My question is whether she should be forced to endure a pregnancy in her already traumatized body. Again you avoided the question, do you think she is entitled to recovery? I mean physical recovery, as her psychological one will probably never happen.And there aren't that many solutions to the problem- you either carry out the pregnancy or don't...that would be two options..two is not many.And as for your statistics...I will get my information from reliable resources, such as the people who counsel a woman in this predicament, and they have assured me the number of abortions chosen in light of rape is much higher.I will not get my statistics about abortion from someone fundamentally opposed to abortionduhWhat's ridiculous is your way of twisting every single word you encounter in your life to suit your needs. I am no suggesting anyone do anything of the sort.... Hello? You don't go to your fetus and say anything. We are not arguing the rights of a child, we are arguing the rights of a fetus.I have not once argued that a fetus is not a human being, Not once...I have never seen anyone else on this forum do so either. Just another example of your twisting people's words to fit your own needs. You need to think we said that so that you can make another ridiculous point... such as...ok, more grammar for the simple minded.at·tached ( P ) Pronunciation Key (-tcht)adj. Architecture. Joined to or by a wall, especially by sharing a wall with another building; not freestanding: a block of attached houses. Biology. Living in a permanently fixed state in the adult stage, as the barnacle. so, if you bother to learn the language, you might realize that attached does not apply to a baby breastfeeding. That's just like you and a soda straw...all you gotta do is open your mouth, and voila! To detach a child from it's mother's placenta....it takes a knife! And then stiches. Can you guess why this might be? Hint- it's that shared wall idea.[/quote]ummmm what? where in the heck do you get me being my mother from me being a fetus?

I'm not lying. This was what he told my grandparents.I can't seem to find one on the net. All I know is that the monuments have been removed from our Catholic cemeteries and that was the reason given.How do you know? A coma is just a deeper form of sleep. The mind doesn't disappear and then reappear later. It is still there. A fetus doesn't have a mind at all to actually be a difference between consciousness and un.consciousness. How can one be unconsciousness when it has never been consciousness to begin with?

I was responding to Parcums assertation that, in the scenerio you put forth, the incest would also be rape. (I know this is off topic, please forgive the deviation, but, I assert that ANY TIME an adult has sexual contact with a child, it is rape. Relatives included. Intercourse is not a requirement, only forced sexual contact. Because of the reasons you listed, I am sure you can see that other types of sexual activity are just as harmful.)That having been said, being a woman who has been the victim of "incestual rape" and "standard rape", I agree that the physical battery that can be involved in such an attack can require substantial recovery time. (My rapist infected me with a STD, which resulted in my being unable to ever conceive a child.) The very idea of having no choice as whether I had to maintain a pregnancy that resulted from that attack would be both physically and emotionally devistating. The very idea that a child who has never had to endure the pain and humiliation of being assulted in this way would strive to dictate how someone would be legally allowed to recover from a rape is outrageous. I have read in Parcum's other posts how he intends to "grow up" and be in a position of power...one can only hope that time will open this boy's mind to the reality of the world before he becomes truly dangerous.

OTHER METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION. I didn’t say methods of contraception, I said OTHER METHODS of contraception. Why are you trying to correct my grammar? It’s really a distraction from the debate. Don’t bring emotion into the debate. I could just as easily say “I am a woman and was raped” as well. I don’t really believe you (too many liars on this debate forum), but let’s pretend like you were really raped. So what? Does that mean only YOU understand this and only YOU can decide to kill your child? You’re punishing the child for a crime it’s father committed! Interesting statistics, but you don’t have to tell me how bad rape is. I already know. It does not, however, excuse the woman from killing her child. If I was raped that doesn’t mean I can do whatever I want, especially when somebody’s life is in risk. She isn’t being forced, it’s the only option. If the mother gave birth to this child, and she couldn’t give it up for adoption, should she kill it, because she’d have to endure the pain of caring for a child in her already traumatized state? No! These statistics come from  the liberal Alan Guttmacher Institute. The rights of a child and fetus are equal- both are human beings. As long as both of them are human beings, they have equal rights. Yes you did, I apologize. Quite a few people, however, have been arguing that the fetus is human but not a human being (Charchuk, Gilligan, et cetera). What gives the woman the right to kill her child? Tell me. Okay, so then, you understand the fetus is biologically independent, is a human being, feels pain from 12 weeks on (actually, 7, but we wont go there), and can think sometime later in pregnancy (second and third trimesters). What gives you the right to kill it? If it is human, it’s ALWAYS wrong to kill it. If it is not human, it’s never wrong to kill it. Make your pick. OF course. But that still doesn’t mean Incest is ALWAYS rape!

You're the one who likes to use emotional blackmail.It is more likely there is too much truth on the forum for you to handle.Only the person involved can understand. It is not up to you. A fetus is not a child, no more than you or I are children. (Though, I wonder about you.)No one else's life is at risk. If apples were oranges would pears be bananas?Wrong, under the law they are not equal since a fetus is not a human being, a person. A child is.Nothing. But a fetus is not a child. It is an early stage of developement.Wrong on two accounts. It is neither a human being, nor does it experience pain. Experience and feel and two difference things.You are still having trouble with the concept between the difference of being human and being a human being. From what I've seen here that is willful ignorance.But it is always a crime.

If I was raped that doesn’t mean I can do whatever I want, especially when somebody’s life is in risk. She isn’t being forced, it’s the only option. If the mother gave birth to this child, and she couldn’t give it up for adoption, should she kill it, because she’d have to endure the pain of caring for a child in her already traumatized state? No! These statistics come from  the liberal Alan Guttmacher Institute. The rights of a child and fetus are equal- both are human beings. As long as both of them are human beings, they have equal rights. Yes you did, I apologize. Quite a few people, however, have been arguing that the fetus is human but not a human being (Charchuk, Gilligan, et cetera). What gives the woman the right to kill her child? Tell me. Okay, so then, you understand the fetus is biologically independent, is a human being, feels pain from 12 weeks on (actually, 7, but we wont go there), and can think sometime later in pregnancy (second and third trimesters). What gives you the right to kill it? If it is human, it’s ALWAYS wrong to kill it. If it is not human, it’s never wrong to kill it. Make your pick. OF course. But that still doesn’t mean Incest is ALWAYS rape!

Your complete lack of empathy for another living human being exposes your claim to be arguing for compassion and human life as utterly false.I hope that you will at some later point in your life through increased experience and/or wisdom be able to look back at statements such as that with the appropriate amount of shame and regret.Clearly that is a lie.Nonsense. Abortion is not a "punishment". Not everyone in the world has a Biblical view of morality, you know. A woman who was impregnated when raped aborts the fetus because that is what is best for all concerned. She knows that she will not be able to care for and love the child, so she prevents it from becoming one. As you have never been pregnant, I doubt you could possibly understand. I realize this does not prevent you from feeling that you can judge others, however.She doesn't have a child yet. She is pregnant, and will have a child when it is born.Oh, I see. You try to avoid admitting that you were proven wrong by clumsily changing the subject. Besides, as I said, a fetus is not a child yet. An easy distinction Parcum has trouble with.Oh, I don't know. Some people say that sexual assault is one thing, rape another. Keep in mind that the term rape was invented for a different purpose than it is now used, which is why penetration was a necessary component. I tend to use the term "sexual assault" as the umbrella term, whereas "rape" is maybe more specific. Then again, if someone is having trouble feeling for themselves, a term like "rape" is useful, because it evokes such an emotional response. I also know that it is true that penetration is not a necessary factor in the level of trauma experienced through sexual assault, so I guess it's a matter of context and opinion.Very right, superbuddhaman. I think the only reason it would be a bad idea to kill a rapist is that you might end up getting caught and going to jail. I'd also like to say that as a fellow survivor I really appreciated your post, and I hope you will completely ignore Parcum's immature and ignorant response. :)

OTHER METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION. I didn’t say methods of contraception, I said OTHER METHODS of contraception. Why are you trying to correct my grammar? It’s really a distraction from the debate.

Sorry, but in the internet world, you really don’t know who’s lying and who’s telling the truth. How would you know? You don’t know me. I’m not the one bringing the bible into this- you’re the only one. Every single living person has the basic right to life. So can we kill infants? It’s better if they’re dead, because we don’t want them to suffer later in life. What about infants with Down’s Syndrome? Kill them! They’ll suffer later in life. Wasn’t there some fascist leader in Germany 60 years ago who believed this kind of stuff? With that definition, a child is above a toddler. A child is usually defined as any sort of offspring. When it isn’t defined like this, it’s usually aged 3-12. I said I was assuming she was believing one thing when she wasn’t. I apologized already. If I wanted to, I could post so many things in my life and things that have happened to friends that justify abortion, but I'm not going to, because that makes the debate emotional. Your logic:The fetus is in my body, therefore I can kill it. It doesn’t matter if it’s a human being, it doesn’t matter if it feels the entire surgical procedure, it’s in MY body, so I can kill it.That’s ridiculous. You are sick.

It doesn't matter. People lie in RT also. Human kindness would demand that you assume they are telling the truth, just in case. Even if you don't agree with the point they're trying to make.I know your opinion on abortion in the case of pregnancy caused by rape, and I know how you treated someone who told you they've been raped. From this I can gather a fairly good idea.You said "that's punishing a child for their father's crime". That's a Bible reference.Which she will have, when/if she gives birth. If she miscarries, is she considered to have had a child? No, she was pregnant, the child did not live to term.Pretty much. Although I would argue that it be a pain-free procedure, if possible. I don't think so. And you can't stop me.

Yours is a case of willful ignorance.

It’s very different with the internet. In the internet world, you can lie all you want- nobody’s going to find out if you’re lying or not. In real life, if you lie, your friends can tell the person you lied to the truth, et cetera. Further, if you lie in the internet world and get caught, you don’t care because it’s just the internet. Your idea is misinformed. As stated, there have been many events that have happened in my life that could be used to justify abortion. Will I use them? No. Emotion shouldn’t get into debates because it attempts to justify something that is unjustifiable. Really? I didn’t know that. Where is it? In some terms, yes, she did have a child. I’ve asked people if they’ve had children before, and they’ve said yes but they’ve all died during pregnancies. So let’s give infants a pain-free procedure. They’re invading my house. WOW. That’s a very powerful statement. “I’m going to kill this innocent human being and you can’t stop me”, the killing of innocent human beings is considered “homicide”, so ‘I’m going to commit homicide and you can’t stop me”. Wow.

bad grammar is equally distracting, especially when the grammar and vocabulary are so blatantly misused that reading your posts is en excercise in decoding. I am not bringing my emotions into this debate. All I am bringing to this debate is an opinion, a basic compassion for women, and a knowledge of where the law stands on the issue. A woman has the right to choose who she has sexual intercourse with, and when. She also has the right to decide who she wants to father her children. It obviously is of no consequence to you what the woman's mental capability might be in dealing with a pregnancy, or the raising of a child. You obviously don't have a clue about what a serious ordeal pregnancy is, nor what effects it might have on a body that was already brutalized and invaded.To you, a woman seems to have no value other than that of a vessel to carry a child you will have no interest in once it is born.You obviously have no idea what I was talking about. Rape is not bad, it is atrocious, leaving permanent scars on a woman's psyche, not to mention her body. Instead of caring for the victim and ensuring her safe recovery from this traumatic event, you would rather she act as an incubator? Sorry kiddo, but once again you have missed my point. My question was not the state of the mother after the birth of her child, but before it. Once again you have ignored the fact that pregancy is a very trying, depleting, painful and difficult state to be in, especially considering the physical trauma endure during rape. Apparently you have no concern for the woman's well being at all. Over and over you have voiced the typical opinion of an 18th century bourgois man. Pick up your dictionary and look up the word progress.Oh, right, the institute you dismissed because it's area of research is women's reproductive health, including the research of abortion. What is your problem with this institute anyway? Would you rather that no one ever did research on women's health, or just abortion? In your opinion, luckily, the government does not agree. I sincerely doubt that. Are you implying that they are arguing that it is a non-being, such as....what the heck is a non-being?waht gives her the right? Well...the government for one.Where are you getting this? Any source I have looked at has said that the fetus cannot feel pain until at least the 20th week. And, I might point out that we have no way of knowing that for fact, all we know is that the nervous system has developed sufficiently at that point, there is no way of knowing if it is actually functioning at that point.You say it can think later on in that pregnancy, well, let me point out one thing, without the ability to think, you do not have the ability to process the stimuli, therefore, cannot feel pain.[/quote]and, of course, it never means the victim is to blame as you have asserted.

The thing is, your mind is blocked now. You don’t understand both sides, you only understand one, and that is that you were completely taken advantage of and raped, and feel horrible. Hence, your only concept is that the only solution to your problem is abortion. You can’t remember before, about what happened before you were raped, what you would think of abortion. This knowledge is nessecary. Sure, I don’t fully understand what goes on with rape victims, but if my dad was an alcoholic, and I say that because only I understand that he was an alcoholic I can kill him, does that give me the right to kill him? Yes. She must. Once again, the woman must suffer so that another may live. Having an abortion isn’t going to erase the fact that you were pregnant- waiting a few months and delivering the baby won’t either. It’s not the baby’s fault. Again, if you gave birth to that child, would you have the right to kill it?The holocaust also killed homosexuals, and handicapped people- persons who weren’t born perfect. Remember Margaret Sanger? Remember her famous “Negro Project” plan? At any rate, women can have rights. Everyone can have rights. But some rights are limited. I cannot kill you. I cannot rape you. I cannot commit incest. I cannot steal. If I say women aren’t allowed to steal, am I trying to take away women’s rights? No. I’m trying to prevent them from doing wrong. Mothers often get sick when caring for their children- should we allow mothers to defend themselves by killing their children? Very good.Both equally have rights to life. It’s not denying life- it’s defending another’s life. Again, everyone has rights, but that doesn’t mean you should kill another life. AS for late term abortions, which I am assuming you’re talking about when the mother’s life is threatened (late term abortions are also allowed when the mother’s life is NOT threatened), the goal isn’t to kill one, the goal is to save both. Medical doctors CAN save both today. But in this case abortion should be allowed- but indirect abortion, meaning, the doctor killed the fetus in order to save the mother’s life, not to simply kill the fetus. In what way? Please tell me. The fetus is a human being. Fact. The fetus has it’s own circulatory system, it’s own blood type, it’s own GNA, it’s own organs, et cetera. The fetus is a being. The fetus can only be a human being because of biogenesis. What more is there to be explained? That statement was merely an insult- please, if you’re going to insult me, tell me why!Of course not. But if the government says it’s OK to kill Jews, and I asked a Jew into my home to fix my stereo, do I have a right to kill the Jew because he’s in my home? It’s my home, I can do whatever I want. Right?

It is true that the internet makes it easier to lie, but I think that's a gross exagerration. Either way, this does not mean that you are temporarily excused from having to treat others with basic human kindness.Why, were you lying?An absurd statement if I ever heard one. You cannot divorce yourself from your emotions, even if it were a good idea. Which it wouldn't be.I don't see it that way. Neither does the law, so using words like "homicide" is misleading. I'm not pregnant right now, so it doesn't matter either way. However, if I did at some point decide to have an abortion, I wouldn't give your opinion a millisecond's thought. I would probably immediately start with herbal emmenagogues and abortifacients, such as wild carrot seed (Queen Anne's Lace), and high doses of vitamin c and parsley.I would highly recommend to any woman certain she is terminating her pregnancy to start taking herbs right away. Of course one should always use appropriate caution, as these herbs (especially the stronger abortifacients) are powerful and thus must be used with caution. That said, using herbs early on can terminate the pregnancy before you even get an abortion consult, which is definitely IMO worth the trouble.

AS for late term abortions, which I am assuming you’re talking about when the mother’s life is threatened (late term abortions are also allowed when the mother’s life is NOT threatened), the goal isn’t to kill one, the goal is to save both. Medical doctors CAN save both today. But in this case abortion should be allowed- but indirect abortion, meaning, the doctor killed the fetus in order to save the mother’s life, not to simply kill the fetus. In what way? Please tell me. The fetus is a human being. Fact. The fetus has it’s own circulatory system, it’s own blood type, it’s own GNA, it’s own organs, et cetera. The fetus is a being. The fetus can only be a human being because of biogenesis. What more is there to be explained? That statement was merely an insult- please, if you’re going to insult me, tell me why!Of course not. But if the government says it’s OK to kill Jews, and I asked a Jew into my home to fix my stereo, do I have a right to kill the Jew because he’s in my home? It’s my home, I can do whatever I want. Right?

Thankyou once again for your misguided presumption. I do understand both sides of the argument, and I do understand why you might take the side you have. I do not feel horrible about what happened to me. Actually I feel very good about the way I went about my recovery, and feel that it is complete. The physical pain lasted much longer than the emotional in my case, for the simple fact that I was not to blame for his actions. I have a very good understanding of the motivations of a rapist, it is to have power over another, to harm their psyche by means of harming their body. And I assure you I can remember before, and my pro-choice opinion was very well founded long before that unfortunate event. In fact, if I had become pregnant at that point, I doubt I would have chosen abortion.Your example of an alcoholic father is, like most examples you use, irrelevant and confusing. If you were to kill him, it would be for the jury to decide your guilt, not me. Just like with abortion, there would obviously be aggregates of the situation that I was not privy to, and so I would be wrong to pass judgement.Why should the woman suffer? When a woman chooses to get pregnant, it is very unlikely to carry with it the physical repercussions of rape. You obviously have no concern for who this woman might be or her own personal medical history. Your only concern is your own moral view, that is wrong.You cannot do any of those things to me because the law has said you can't. Actually, you can, but then I have the legal recourse. As when you say a woman is not allowed to steal, you are again dismissing the specific circumstances of each case. What if she was stealing food to feed the child it was so important to you she have? Remember 'Les Miserables'? The lead character was imprisoned for stealing a loaf of bread. Pretty harsh sentence, but I must assume you would agree with the villains in that plot.Once again you are very confusing, but I will try again to decode your meaning. If the doctor can save both, without risking serious damage to either, he will. For years now it has been illegal for a woman to volunteer for such a procedure without medical reason. SO once again you gallantly flaunt your ignorance.Criminy!!!! yes, the fetus is a human being, yes it has is own DNA (unless you actually meant GNA whatever that might be) It has it's won blood type, etc. But once again you fail to realize that every single aggregate to that being was passed down genetically from either the father or the mother.Why do I insult you? LOLYou insult my intelligence every time you touch your keyboard.No, you can't do whatever you want because it's in your home. There are numerous laws limiting what exactly you can do in your home. This is obviously a metaphor for my body, right? Well, there are laws limiting what I can do with it too. Instead of listing numerous hypothetical situations like you would do, I will merely let you know that the most important law is that I can have an abortion, as long as I meet certain criteria.One disturbing law is that a woman cannot voluntarily have herself sterilized (in my state) until the age of 30. But is she is raped and happens to get pregnant, then if you had your way, she would have to carry the child. You dismiss whatever reasons she might have for not wanting to be a mother, such as the possibility that she has some genetic default that almost guarantees her child will be born retarded. A child such as this is very unlikely to ever be adopted, so unless she wants it to live as a ward of the state, she must raise it. That is a lifetime sentence for no crime. This child is sentenced by you as well, as your opinion that a life of pain and suffering is better than none at all. I will point out that yu have never existed in such a condition, so you would not know.

The thing is, your mind is blocked now. You don’t understand both sides, you only understand one, and that is that you were completely taken advantage of and raped, and feel horrible. Hence, your only concept is that the only solution to your problem is abortion. You can’t remember before, about what happened before you were raped, what you would think of abortion. This knowledge is nessecary. Sure, I don’t fully understand what goes on with rape victims, but if my dad was an alcoholic, and I say that because only I understand that he was an alcoholic I can kill him, does that give me the right to kill him? Yes. She must. Once again, the woman must suffer so that another may live. Having an abortion isn’t going to erase the fact that you were pregnant- waiting a few months and delivering the baby won’t either. It’s not the baby’s fault. Again, if you gave birth to that child, would you have the right to kill it?The holocaust also killed homosexuals, and handicapped people- persons who weren’t born perfect. Remember Margaret Sanger? Remember her famous “Negro Project” plan? At any rate, women can have rights. Everyone can have rights. But some rights are limited. I cannot kill you. I cannot rape you. I cannot commit incest. I cannot steal. If I say women aren’t allowed to steal, am I trying to take away women’s rights? No. I’m trying to prevent them from doing wrong. Mothers often get sick when caring for their children- should we allow mothers to defend themselves by killing their children? Very good.Both equally have rights to life. It’s not denying life- it’s defending another’s life. Again, everyone has rights, but that doesn’t mean you should kill another life.

It is true that the internet makes it easier to lie, but I think that's a gross exagerration. Either way, this does not mean that you are temporarily excused from having to treat others with basic human kindness.Why, were you lying?An absurd statement if I ever heard one. You cannot divorce yourself from your emotions, even if it were a good idea. Which it wouldn't be.I don't see it that way. Neither does the law, so using words like "homicide" is misleading. I'm not pregnant right now, so it doesn't matter either way. However, if I did at some point decide to have an abortion, I wouldn't give your opinion a millisecond's thought. I would probably immediately start with herbal emmenagogues and abortifacients, such as wild carrot seed (Queen Anne's Lace), and high doses of vitamin c and parsley.I would highly recommend to any woman certain she is terminating her pregnancy to start taking herbs right away. Of course one should always use appropriate caution, as these herbs (especially the stronger abortifacients) are powerful and thus must be used with caution. That said, using herbs early on can terminate the pregnancy before you even get an abortion consult, which is definitely IMO worth the trouble.

Basic human kindness? Why does it matter? You don’t even acknowledge basic human rights to life! Pardon?Of course not, but you definitely cannot replace logic with emotions. That’s horrible! You’re so bitter about having this right that you’ll do it with so much anger. “I don’t care what thousands of years of studying and science thinks. It’s in my body, I can kill it. And when I kill it, I’m going to make it as bad as I can”. Disgusting. Your entire post is so disgusting. You know the fetus is human, but you want to kill it anyway. Do you even know what the fetus looks like? Don’t you even care for somebody else’s life? If not, you are disgusting. Why should the fetus suffer?! Life is always more valuable than how somebody feels. Society today relies on feeling too much. We think because we feel bad we need a quick solution. However, we don’t acknowledge what this quick solution does. I’ll respond to the rest tomorrow, I just realized it’s 20 to twelve, and I need to get up at 5 tomorrow.

The difficulty responding to your posts is not the complexity or argumentation, but merely making sense of what you’re saying. Once again, what about slavery? Because slavery was legal, did that make it OK to whip slaves? Does that make it OK to give slaves a choice between cutting of their toe and penis (from the movie, Roots)? Slavery was one of the most embarrassing things in American History, and yet you’re saying because the government said it was OK, it always was OK. The woman 90% of the time would not be raising the child, and 99% of the time would not have to. We have 3 million couples waiting to adopt infants every year. In fact, there is such a great number of couples willing to adopt that people are put on waiting lists, such as several people I know. It took one family I know seven months to find an infant, and an additional 4 months for it to be born. Firstly, the thing about abortions is that they are expensive, and so the doctor (and abortionist) makes a lot of money by giving an abortion. Do you think an abortionist would deliver an infant? Of course not- he makes better money killing it before it’s born. With the medical technology that we have today, it is extremely rare for a woman to die from having an infant, and even more rare for a woman to not know about it early on. Allow me to elaborate in what I think about when the mother’s life is threatened- ectopic pregnancies. In this case, the fetus gets stuck in a tube and grows there, and if it stays there too long will explode, and both mother and fetus would die. In this case, you’re killing the fetus unintentionally, but it’s necessary to save the mother. Please elaborate. I have no idea what you’re talking about. What procedure? Abortion? What intelligence?! It takes me forever to respond to YOUR posts because it takes me forever to make sense out of them! You just said that they have a better grasp of biology than I do… and yet you agree with me, and I won the argument against them. WTF? What the hell are you talking about?1) But it’s legal to kill Jews, so I can kill one if it enters my house. Further, I can go into Jewish neighborhoods, kill their families, and take their money. I can do a lot of things with Jews! Interestingly enough, these sort of things happened in the past. Does that make them right? In Nazi Germany it was legal to exterminate 6 million Jews and 11 million Slavs… does that make it right? No!2) No, it’s not a metaphor for our bodies. The Jew goes onto my property, it’s legal to kill Jews, therefore I can kill the Jew. It’s very, very simple. And it’s not hypothetical either- much of this kind of stuff has and is happening throughout this world. In Assyria, which is in Northern Iraq, the Kurds were allowed to savagely murder Assyrians by the old Iraqi government. Why? Because the Assyrians were a minority and Muslims disagreed with them. Therefore, it is legal to kill them. What???3) Ah, but it’s legal, so it must be for the better. Right? Is the woman “forced” to give birth? Unfortunately, no. She’s allowed to kill her daughter or son. I dismiss all points; because if that child was born, would you kill it? Just because the infant isn’t perfect doesn’t mean you can kill it. Once again, in Nazi Germany, they sterilized woman and killed imperfect human beings- born and unborn. Does that make it right? No.

I would like to comment on your statement about the woman being entitled to recovery. By all means, the woman is entitled to recovery. But I must ask you to further explain your definition of "recovery". If you mean that by recovery the woman should scrape out the inside of her womb, then you have an extremely retarded viewpoint. please explain further.

i'm not going to dither over your questionable grasp of semanticshmmmm, so contraception is not birth control? Again, your limited grasp of the language. Gee, thanks, I'm glad I get to keep my diaphragm.First of all, I think I should let you know that I am a woman (my screen name is just that, a screen name) And I have been raped. So much for the things you are sure about. No, I don't think I should have the right to kill my rapist. But the reason I don't want to kill him is not some moral ideal, it's that he is already going to spend the rest of his life in prison for other crimes, so I am quite happy with that idea.I have encountered dozens of rape victims. Along with several other projects, I have acted as a victim's advocate. In fact, scary thought, if something happens to you, someone like me may respond. Did you know that in the course of their life, one out of four women will be raped?But my question had nothing to do with her psychological condition. No, I don't think she should have an abortion because of some horrible memory- for that she needs counseling. My question is whether she should be forced to endure a pregnancy in her already traumatized body. Again you avoided the question, do you think she is entitled to recovery? I mean physical recovery, as her psychological one will probably never happen.And there aren't that many solutions to the problem- you either carry out the pregnancy or don't...that would be two options..two is not many.And as for your statistics...I will get my information from reliable resources, such as the people who counsel a woman in this predicament, and they have assured me the number of abortions chosen in light of rape is much higher.I will not get my statistics about abortion from someone fundamentally opposed to abortionduhWhat's ridiculous is your way of twisting every single word you encounter in your life to suit your needs. I am no suggesting anyone do anything of the sort.... Hello? You don't go to your fetus and say anything. We are not arguing the rights of a child, we are arguing the rights of a fetus.I have not once argued that a fetus is not a human being, Not once...I have never seen anyone else on this forum do so either. Just another example of your twisting people's words to fit your own needs. You need to think we said that so that you can make another ridiculous point... such as...ok, more grammar for the simple minded.at·tached ( P ) Pronunciation Key (-tcht)adj. Architecture. Joined to or by a wall, especially by sharing a wall with another building; not freestanding: a block of attached houses. Biology. Living in a permanently fixed state in the adult stage, as the barnacle. so, if you bother to learn the language, you might realize that attached does not apply to a baby breastfeeding. That's just like you and a soda straw...all you gotta do is open your mouth, and voila! To detach a child from it's mother's placenta....it takes a knife! And then stiches. Can you guess why this might be? Hint- it's that shared wall idea.[/quote]ummmm what? where in the heck do you get me being my mother from me being a fetus? Is that another example of your faulty understanding?

Much obliged, my friend. ;)Do please make sure to refer them to the links I posted, and to do more research on their own. I am very much for taking charge of our own health, but this requires caution and knowledge. There are lots of books on the subject, and other resources. One significant danger, for example, is when the person using the herbs has an ectopic pregnancy. They may misinterpret the symptoms as effects of the herbs (which often cause cramping more severe than one's usual mentrual cramps). See this link  for more info.I have assisted a few friends with herbal abortions, and have had seen a much better success rate than the 45% usually believed. We also did guided meditations, and the women were very rigorous about the process, so I thnk that helped.At least you are honest about your cruelty, I suppose.Where did you read "anger" from that sentence? I just said I wouldn't give your opinion (or any other anti-choice zealot's) a millisecond's thought if I had to have an abortion. Neither would I think twice about your opinion before I elected to fornicate, blaspheme, or do anything else you disapprove of. It's not because of anger or bitterness. It's just dismissal. Actually, I said the opposite, didn't I? I also recommended herbal remedies, many of which prevent the embryo from attaching to the uterine wall, which would kill the blastocyst long before it would be old enough to abort. I guess you aren't interested in preventing harm to blastocyst embryos/fetuses at all, you just want to call women who assert control over their own bodies "disgusting".Do you?This is a human blastocyst.This is a human fetus at 12 weeks.non sequiturThese are born humans. They are not embryos/fetuses.I believe that by "recovery", they mean not having to have to further injure her cervix and/or vaginal canal by having a vaginal birth.

What an imagination you have. A blastocyst looks like a Ritz cracker, and the fetus has a tail. Neither resemble born humans very much at all. Not that that's a reason to kill them, but then when I look at a Ritz cracker I usually don't see a human being with a great future ahead.Face it, the embryo/fetus at this stage of development is very far from resembling a born person on every level- from how it looks to what it is able to "experience". You can't tell me that the lump of cells that is a blastocyst is having deep thoughts as it works hard dividing its cells.Ah, there's the rub.

Why don't you just be honest and say what you think- you think women who have abortions are sluts who should have to suffer for their sins.In passing, as I'm not pregnant and never have been, and no embryo is getting in the way of my sexual pleasure.

Of course not. But if you know that the ritz cracker will eventually grow up to look like you and me, I wouldn’t eat it. It doesn’t look like a born human being, sure, but it looks like a human being at that stage of development. Of course it’s not having deep thoughts- neither are infants. In fact, many infants are born with brain problems and have to have flat lines to perform surgery. Should we be allowed to kill them? Listen, I am never going to call women sluts for having abortions. I know too many people who have had abortions and have regretted it, and in doing so brought me to the pro-life movement. I know how society works in convincing women that they can kill their children- how? They don’t call it a child. They make it so it’s not your child, but a blob of tissue. The fact is it’s not just a blob of tissue, it’s growing up, it’s a human being. Most abortions are not choices, but pressure from family members and boyfriends. It can actually be dangerous to have sex during pregnancies, but whatever. The fact is that women cannot kill that life. If somebody dropped an infant at your doorstep, and because of the cold weather went unconscious, would you take it in, or let it out to die? It’s not conscious- it doesn’t feel anything, it doesn’t even have a mind. It’s not opinion, it’s fact. Even Planned Parenthood acknowledges that the fetus is a human being, at the first stage of development- as an infant is in the second stage, child in the third, adolescent in the fourth, adult in the fifth. What then, gives YOU the right to allow the death of another human? What makes you special to murder somebody?

I wasn't suggesting a change in diet. I'm just saying that at this point you are killing an organism with the complexity of the e. coli virus.Infants are already born.

Of course not. But if you know that the ritz cracker will eventually grow up to look like you and me, I wouldn’t eat it. It doesn’t look like a born human being, sure, but it looks like a human being at that stage of development. Of course it’s not having deep thoughts- neither are infants. In fact, many infants are born with brain problems and have to have flat lines to perform surgery. Should we be allowed to kill them? Listen, I am never going to call women sluts for having abortions. I know too many people who have had abortions and have regretted it, and in doing so brought me to the pro-life movement. I know how society works in convincing women that they can kill their children- how? They don’t call it a child. They make it so it’s not your child, but a blob of tissue. The fact is it’s not just a blob of tissue, it’s growing up, it’s a human being. Most abortions are not choices, but pressure from family members and boyfriends. It can actually be dangerous to have sex during pregnancies, but whatever. The fact is that women cannot kill that life. If somebody dropped an infant at your doorstep, and because of the cold weather went unconscious, would you take it in, or let it out to die? It’s not conscious- it doesn’t feel anything, it doesn’t even have a mind. It’s not opinion, it’s fact. Even Planned Parenthood acknowledges that the fetus is a human being, at the first stage of development- as an infant is in the second stage, child in the third, adolescent in the fourth, adult in the fifth. What then, gives YOU the right to allow the death of another human? What makes you special to murder somebody?

your problem might lie in your ability to make sense out of anythingI never said that slavery was right, or that those who abused their slaves were in the right, please stop implying that I have. I have used the fact that abortion is legal only to prove that as of right now, a woman has the right to this procedure. As for proving moral correctness, I have never even tried, as morality is always open to debate, is often based on religious beliefs, and I know that our versions of morality are very different.first of all, an abortion costs, on average, about $500 dollars, do you mean to imply that this would somehow be cheaper than the cost involved in carrying a child to term, and then raising it? LOLNext, as i have previously pointed out, abortion is not a specialty, it is just another duty assigned to an ob/gyn, and I hope I don't have to point out that these doctors do deliver babies. (and they make a lot more money from that, I assure you)And, as I have previously posted, the number of women who die in childbirth grossly outweighs the number who die during abortion. The last time more women died from abortion than childbirth was 1970, before Roe V Wade. You have deinied the source, but I am willing to provide similar stats from other sources if neccessary, and they too, will prove you wrong.And, in the case of ectopic pregnancies- I assure you that the doctor knows very well that he is killing the fetus, and so- it is intentional, though no less neccessary to save the mother.I was referring to late-term or 3rd trimester abortion. It has been years since a woman could have this done electively.I never said you won anything. A third grader has a better grasp of biology, of grammar, of vocabulary, and indeed compassion than you.I am going to dismiss your entire killing jews argument because it is irrelevant and totally perplexing.

The difficulty responding to your posts is not the complexity or argumentation, but merely making sense of what you’re saying. Once again, what about slavery? Because slavery was legal, did that make it OK to whip slaves? Does that make it OK to give slaves a choice between cutting of their toe and penis (from the movie, Roots)? Slavery was one of the most embarrassing things in American History, and yet you’re saying because the government said it was OK, it always was OK. The woman 90% of the time would not be raising the child, and 99% of the time would not have to. We have 3 million couples waiting to adopt infants every year. In fact, there is such a great number of couples willing to adopt that people are put on waiting lists, such as several people I know. It took one family I know seven months to find an infant, and an additional 4 months for it to be born. Firstly, the thing about abortions is that they are expensive, and so the doctor (and abortionist) makes a lot of money by giving an abortion. Do you think an abortionist would deliver an infant? Of course not- he makes better money killing it before it’s born. With the medical technology that we have today, it is extremely rare for a woman to die from having an infant, and even more rare for a woman to not know about it early on. Allow me to elaborate in what I think about when the mother’s life is threatened- ectopic pregnancies. In this case, the fetus gets stuck in a tube and grows there, and if it stays there too long will explode, and both mother and fetus would die. In this case, you’re killing the fetus unintentionally, but it’s necessary to save the mother. Please elaborate. I have no idea what you’re talking about. What procedure? Abortion? What intelligence?! It takes me forever to respond to YOUR posts because it takes me forever to make sense out of them! You just said that they have a better grasp of biology than I do… and yet you agree with me, and I won the argument against them. WTF? What the hell are you talking about?1) But it’s legal to kill Jews, so I can kill one if it enters my house. Further, I can go into Jewish neighborhoods, kill their families, and take their money. I can do a lot of things with Jews! Interestingly enough, these sort of things happened in the past. Does that make them right? In Nazi Germany it was legal to exterminate 6 million Jews and 11 million Slavs… does that make it right? No!2) No, it’s not a metaphor for our bodies. The Jew goes onto my property, it’s legal to kill Jews, therefore I can kill the Jew. It’s very, very simple. And it’s not hypothetical either- much of this kind of stuff has and is happening throughout this world. In Assyria, which is in Northern Iraq, the Kurds were allowed to savagely murder Assyrians by the old Iraqi government. Why? Because the Assyrians were a minority and Muslims disagreed with them. Therefore, it is legal to kill them. What???3) Ah, but it’s legal, so it must be for the better. Right? Is the woman “forced” to give birth? Unfortunately, no. She’s allowed to kill her daughter or son. I dismiss all points; because if that child was born, would you kill it? Just because the infant isn’t perfect doesn’t mean you can kill it. Once again, in Nazi Germany, they sterilized woman and killed imperfect human beings- born and unborn. Does that make it right? No.

But what is it? What is it growing up to be? It’s obviously not going to become a ritz cracker or virus, it’s going to be an adult. Many newborns are born with flat lines so doctors can perform surgery, or are born in comas, should we kill them? No.Some are born relying on machines to keep them alive. They have a 50/50 chance of dying, many times, and even more times are in comas. Should we kill them? What about infants in artificial wombs, like the ones they invented in England? Does the artificial womb (or rather, the scientists who run it) have a choice of killing it? Further, early on (before implantation) the fetus isn’t relying on the mother at all. Is it then not okay to kill it? I never said that the fetus isn’t a blob of tissue- we’re all blobs of tissue! Yes, a 9 month old fetus and newborn baby are almost identical- the only difference is that the fetus has an umbilical cord which is only there in the first place because of you. Ah, yes, but there are different kinds of unconsciousness. The most common is sleeping, we all sleep, but there are others where the only brain activity are brain waves- the mind is turned off. Brain waves are not the mind, in case you were wondering, brain waves are part of the nervous system. The mind, however, is a different entity. It’s impossible to find statistics for this, because most women can’t answer the question. Even so, a study done by Eliott Institute said the of women reporting problems after an abortion, 39% said that they felt pressured by friends and family to have the abortion, and 54% said they felt forced. In my experience, when doing sidewalk counseling towards women, trying to stop them from having an abortion, the woman is always interested, and doesn’t want to do it, but the boyfriend (or in my case, the father) yells at me and tells the daughter not to listen to me. Further, that same woman came out of the abortion clinic limping, and saying that she couldn’t believe she allowed her baby to be killed.There’s a difference between voluntary and involuntary killing. Your logic is extremely corrupt. You’re saying because death is everywhere, we can kill the fetus. Does that mean I can kill you too? Obviously not. I do care deeply for people who are dying on this earth, but it’s quite different; they aren’t dying from myths given by the organizations that they aren’t human, they are dying from corrupt governments. I’m in America now- I care about what’s going on in American soil. And what’s going on in American soil is horrible, and you most definitely cannot justify it by other’s sufferings. This is merely a red herring to the debate.

nature does not provide flat lines- as in cardiac arrest for doctors to perform surgery, you imbecile.

Again, if society legalized the killing of Jews, would that mean it’s okay?No, I’m not. I’m saying that Doctors make a ton of money giving abortions. They don’t make a lot of money delivering babies. Abortion isn’t a specialty because it’s usually very easy, but most doctors own clinics where they do abortions, and thus make a lot more money that from hospitals, because they get paid by the abortion. In hospitals, the doctor always gets paid the same. Since almost all delivery rooms are in hospitals (I believe it’s the law), doctors in hospitals really don’t make as much money, depending on the amounts of profits. Doctors usually have a fixed payment, while abortionists don’t.Before 1970, there were about 200-250 women who died annually from abortions. In 1972, the year before Roe V. Wade, only 65 women died in one year, and 24 of the abortions were legal. Further, in 1975 only seven women died from illegal abortions, and 26 from legal abortions, all according to Induced Abortion: A World View  done by The Population Council in New York. 450 women die annually from childbirth in the US today, and about 40 die from legal abortions. But abortion is a much simpler procedure, and is done by much less of the population. You think that those kinds of abortions are OK? That’s even more disgusting! You understand that this is what you’re killing, correct? You also understand this fetus fully feels everything and is aware of everything going on. It’s just as bad as killing an infant- except that you don’t have a good enough reason to kill the infant too. Why not just kill infants now? I don’t want it! It’s better if it just dies then.Not at all, you just refuse to answer it!Hello? XXXXX? Am I speaking to a four-year old? You’re still not making any sense! Flat lines still happen- whether they are natural or not are not an issue. Does that mean a person on a flat line is really not a human? I don’t see how you explaining this medical procedure is refuting my argument at all- you’re only helping it. And yes, there have been cases where the doctor needs to do surgery on the brain, he puts a flat line. The infant at this point is on life support while the doctor performs surgery on the infant’s brain. If the infant was born naturally with a flat line, it would be brain dead. However, this flat-line is put purposely on the fetus, as you’ve said, it isn’t a natural procedure. You were the one who had sex! If you were raped, honestly, that’s really sad, but that still doesn’t justify the killing of your child.Depends on the state. Californian law says that when the brain waves stop, that’s when death is. But it’s irrelevant, the brain waves that are used in people who are unconscious and the early fetus are not controlled by the mind (conscious is a synonym for mind). Should we, then, be able to kill them? Not unless I’m forcing her to speak to me, as in making physical contact, and if I’m on Planned Parenthood’s property. Actually we almost always have a security guard with us at all times. You’re telling me I’m taking advantage of vulnerable women? Her boyfriend is! Planned Parenthood is! The confident women don’t ignore me; the closed minded ones do.We do this with organizations such as ALL. Rock for Life, Survivors, et cetera. It’s completely legal. In fact, before we picket, we go through all the legality issues before picketing.

No, a 'real' counselor (by this you mean the ones who are employed by such places as clinics, planned parenthood, ) would never do such a thing as you suggest. there is not a single counselor I have ever met who thinks of abortion as anything but an unfortunate and tragic event. When a woman goes into a clinic (or doctor's office) and finds that she is pregnant, the doctor or counselor merely lays all of her options on the table. It is always her choice- they never try to sway her in any direction, knowing how extrmely personal this decision may be.Where are you getting this stuff? Are you just making assumptions based on your personal convictions, or have you actually been a pregnant woman in this predicament? I'm leaning toward the former.You should realize that if a woman felt she was pressured into having an abortion by an employee of the clinic, she would have legal recourse. I don't think one of these clinics would want to set themselves up for a lawsuit.as for having a right to speak your beliefs... this is true, but as you should know, the government has limited where and when you might be able to do that. For example, you are not allowed to advertise on any issue at a polling place during elections because you might influence the voters. Also, you are not allowed to go into a church and start screaming out that the worshipers are wrong, you can't walk into any establishment with a "no solicitation" sign posted and start telling people that they need to buy a kirby vacuum.And you can't come within 50 feet of any abortion clinic as a protestor. In fact, in many cases, unless you have an appointment, you can't enter the building at all for the exact same reason. I don't think that i have to point out that everyone has a right to safety, and to do what they want within the law. I also don't think I should have to point out examples of violence done to these women and the staff of the clinic. We need to try to prevent such violence in the future.Your rights to free speech are not intended to do harm to another person. There are laws protecting me from your speech and vice versa.

no, it would mean it was legal, and therefore I would have to protest in a lawful manner.No, I don't think they do make a lot money doing abortions. If the procedure costs $500, I doubt that does much more than pay for the materials. Shoot, when I went in to get a throat culture and flu shot, it cost me nearly that much! Do you think those doctors are "making a ton of money"?It is not the law that all delivery rooms be in hospitals. Have you never heard of midwifery? And for the record, abortionists do have a fixed payment, and it is very low. It's not like one day the procedure is $500 and the next it will be $2,000! But you don't know anything about any of this, do you? Do you want me to find statistics on that too, or will you just refute them when I do?Lookie^^^^ you just contradicted yourself. Don't you remember telling me how much more dangerous abortion is than chilbirth? Or do you just contradict everything, and expect people to have the same memory flaws as you? BTW, these numbers are much larger than any I have seen anywhere, but ok. I'm still right.no, i refuse to follow your link, even the address shows it is obviously biased and propagnadizing. I'll look to a medical reference book for my information, not "priests for life"And i do beleive that if the woman's life is in danger, she has every right to choose abortion.

It refers to the line seen on a heart monitor. When it is flat, the patient is in cardiac arrest. As far as I know, this is never neccessary for neuro surgery. If the child was born naturally with a flat line, they would try CPR. you have to be in cardiac arrest for a certain period of time (i think its 30 minutes or so) before you are considered brain dead. I said that nature does not provide a flat line, again that's cardiac arrest- in order to perform surgery as you implied. again you are intentionally misunderstanding me.I'm not going to dignify your chauvenism and ignorance with an answer.the brain waves are not controlled by the mind? What are they controlled by then? LOLYou should never be on planned parenthood's property- you are not a patient. You are in violation of the law, and you are not "counseling" anyone.

Further, in 1975 only seven women died from illegal abortions, and 26 from legal abortions, all according to Induced Abortion: A World View  done by The Population Council in New York. 450 women die annually from childbirth in the US today, and about 40 die from legal abortions. But abortion is a much simpler procedure, and is done by much less of the population. You think that those kinds of abortions are OK? That’s even more disgusting! You understand that this is what you’re killing, correct? You also understand this fetus fully feels everything and is aware of everything going on. It’s just as bad as killing an infant- except that you don’t have a good enough reason to kill the infant too. Why not just kill infants now? I don’t want it! It’s better if it just dies then.Not at all, you just refuse to answer it!Hello? XXXXX? Am I speaking to a four-year old? You’re still not making any sense! Flat lines still happen- whether they are natural or not are not an issue. Does that mean a person on a flat line is really not a human? I don’t see how you explaining this medical procedure is refuting my argument at all- you’re only helping it. And yes, there have been cases where the doctor needs to do surgery on the brain, he puts a flat line. The infant at this point is on life support while the doctor performs surgery on the infant’s brain. If the infant was born naturally with a flat line, it would be brain dead. However, this flat-line is put purposely on the fetus, as you’ve said, it isn’t a natural procedure. You were the one who had sex! If you were raped, honestly, that’s really sad, but that still doesn’t justify the killing of your child.Depends on the state. Californian law says that when the brain waves stop, that’s when death is. But it’s irrelevant, the brain waves that are used in people who are unconscious and the early fetus are not controlled by the mind (conscious is a synonym for mind). Should we, then, be able to kill them? Not unless I’m forcing her to speak to me, as in making physical contact, and if I’m on Planned Parenthood’s property. Actually we almost always have a security guard with us at all times. You’re telling me I’m taking advantage of vulnerable women? Her boyfriend is! Planned Parenthood is! The confident women don’t ignore me; the closed minded ones do.We do this with organizations such as ALL. Rock for Life, Survivors, et cetera. It’s completely legal. In fact, before we picket, we go through all the legality issues before picketing.

When will you people learn? You won't convince people through apologetics, especially on a moral issue--one of basic logic, maybe, but not one that involves religious and moral presuppositions. It's silly to talk about it. The same arguments surface over and over and over and over... Stop bitching about it and shut up.

no, it would mean it was legal, and therefore I would have to protest in a lawful manner.No, I don't think they do make a lot money doing abortions. If the procedure costs $500, I doubt that does much more than pay for the materials. Shoot, when I went in to get a throat culture and flu shot, it cost me nearly that much! Do you think those doctors are "making a ton of money"?It is not the law that all delivery rooms be in hospitals. Have you never heard of midwifery? And for the record, abortionists do have a fixed payment, and it is very low. It's not like one day the procedure is $500 and the next it will be $2,000! But you don't know anything about any of this, do you? Do you want me to find statistics on that too, or will you just refute them when I do?Lookie^^^^ you just contradicted yourself. Don't you remember telling me how much more dangerous abortion is than chilbirth? Or do you just contradict everything, and expect people to have the same memory flaws as you? BTW, these numbers are much larger than any I have seen anywhere, but ok. I'm still right.no, i refuse to follow your link, even the address shows it is obviously biased and propagnadizing. I'll look to a medical reference book for my information, not "priests for life"And i do beleive that if the woman's life is in danger, she has every right to choose abortion. I'm not saying she should, I'm just saying she has a right to the option.I'm disgusting? coming from you that is a complimentthank you[quote]Hello? XXXXX? Am I speaking to a four-year old?

It refers to the line seen on a heart monitor. When it is flat, the patient is in cardiac arrest. As far as I know, this is never neccessary for neuro surgery. If the child was born naturally with a flat line, they would try CPR. you have to be in cardiac arrest for a certain period of time (i think its 30 minutes or so) before you are considered brain dead. I said that nature does not provide a flat line, again that's cardiac arrest- in order to perform surgery as you implied. again you are intentionally misunderstanding me.I'm not going to dignify your chauvenism and ignorance with an answer.the brain waves are not controlled by the mind? What are they controlled by then? LOLYou should never be on planned parenthood's property- you are not a patient. You are in violation of the law, and you are not "counseling" anyone.

that may be true, but in alot of cases i have heard the doctor really pushes the woman having an abortion and tells her that it is the best solution to take care of the "problem"what stuff? my information? if thats what you mean then i get most of it from websites and books i read (wow, i read). i am not making assumptions. i have never been pregnant because i am merely a teenager who does not go throwing around her virginity to anybody. have YOU actually been a pregnant woman in that predicament? i dont think that a pregnant woman who has unexpectedly become pregnant and allowed herself to be pressured into an abortion would be smart enough to file a lawsuit. in many cases the woman only does it because of "friends" "supporting" her. some people need mental help.i completely agree. especially with laws protecting me from your speech.

No, a 'real' counselor (by this you mean the ones who are employed by such places as clinics, planned parenthood, ) would never do such a thing as you suggest. there is not a single counselor I have ever met who thinks of abortion as anything but an unfortunate and tragic event. When a woman goes into a clinic (or doctor's office) and finds that she is pregnant, the doctor or counselor merely lays all of her options on the table. It is always her choice- they never try to sway her in any direction, knowing how extrmely personal this decision may be.Where are you getting this stuff? Are you just making assumptions based on your personal convictions, or have you actually been a pregnant woman in this predicament? I'm leaning toward the former.You should realize that if a woman felt she was pressured into having an abortion by an employee of the clinic, she would have legal recourse. I don't think one of these clinics would want to set themselves up for a lawsuit.as for having a right to speak your beliefs... this is true, but as you should know, the government has limited where and when you might be able to do that. For example, you are not allowed to advertise on any issue at a polling place during elections because you might influence the voters. Also, you are not allowed to go into a church and start screaming out that the worshipers are wrong, you can't walk into any establishment with a "no solicitation" sign posted and start telling people that they need to buy a kirby vacuum.And you can't come within 50 feet of any abortion clinic as a protestor. In fact, in many cases, unless you have an appointment, you can't enter the building at all for the exact same reason. I don't think that i have to point out that everyone has a right to safety, and to do what they want within the law. I also don't think I should have to point out examples of violence done to these women and the staff of the clinic. We need to try to prevent such violence in the future.Your rights to free speech are not intended to do harm to another person. There are laws protecting me from your speech and vice versa.

What you have "heard" is wrong. We should not base our opinions on rumors.websites and books are only opinions, state your sources or leave them at the door.I don't care to discuss my medical history with a mere teenager who has no real concern for me. Let me just say that I have varied experience with this predicament, and I know from experience that the counselors at planned parenthood are helpful, caring people in a very difficult position. And if anything, they pressure you not to do anything without giving it serious thought.you are dismissing these women as being stupid. that is insulting. You have no idea of the mental state of women you have never met, and as a mere teenager, you have no right or reason to claim anyone needs mental help. Get a psychology degree, and then maybe you will. maybe.I assure you, the feeling is mutual. And if I ever break the laws regarding this matter, and you feel as if you have been harmed, feel free to contact your lawyer.

Should we treat a toddler like an adult because that is what they are going to be? No, what matters is what they are now. During an early herbal abortion you're talking about a blastocyst. That's what it is. Later it is a fetus. Not a born infant. They are different in many ways.Infants. Not blastocysts or fetuses.At 9 months, yes. Which is not when elective abortions are given.Hold the phone. You actually go up to women entering clinics and harrass them? And you call me disgusting...No sh!t, you @sshole. Nobody walks into an abortion clinic going "yay! I'm killing my fetus today!". But unless you're offering to painlessly transplant the fetus onto your uterus, you aren't offering these women any more choices than they already had when they made their decision. Leave them the hell alone.I'm saying that on the scale of world tragedies, abortion of blastocysts/fetuses just seems like an absurd thing to focus on. What about the millions of starving, and/or infured, and/or orphaned Iraqi children that result from the US's foreign policies? What about the Zapatistas getting massacred in Chiapas? What about the working conditions in the factories where everything you own gets made? There are many places you could expend your energy and truly ease human suffering in this world. Instead you go around yelling at pregnant women for destroying something that has the cellular complexity of a disease. I really hope he does.I've heard the moon is made of green cheese. Don't believe everything you hear.Why would they do that? What interest do you think they have in people having abortions? They want to make sure abortion is available and known as an option, but they are actually not allowed to try to sway the person either way.Actually, doctors often encourage people to have caesarians, because they get more money from that than delivery, which isn't a surgery and takes much longer. So don't worry about them, they do well anyway. What this has to do with abortion I don't know.You have been misinformed.If so where would the anti-abortion movement be? ;)

Exactly, so abortion is still WRONG. Your argument has no grounds. It is a lot of money. In fact, according to a retired abortionist, who used to hire new doctors from medical schools to do abortions, said that they would come once a week and would get paid $75,000- that’s a part time job, once a week. According to the interview: Brad: When you were involved in this industry, what was your annual income? Eric: When I walked away from the clinics, I walked away from everything. I left my ownership and my money there. I wanted nothing else to do with it. The average doctor who does abortions one day a week at a clinic averages 25-40 abortions. He will walk away in his pocket with an average of $l00,000-$125,000 a year. An average clinic that performs roughly around 8,000 abortions will gross approximately $1 million a year.I never said it was more dangerous than childbirth. You’re arguing against something never said. But even so, there are more childbirths than abortions, so of course the number of childbirth deaths is going to be greater than abortions. Closed-mindedness in action! It’s a picture of a six-month-old fetus- not an article. The picture can be found anywhere, that’s just the site I knew it was at. If her life is threatened, the point shouldn’t be to kill one, but to save both, as I’ve said several times. It should be INDIRECT abortion. If a mother and daughter were about to fall off a cliff, and one had to fall off first for the other to survive, what would your solution be? A) put a pillow at the bottom of the cliff, B) kill one? I only called you a XXXXX because you called me an imbecile. Allow me to rephrase- I said it incorrectly. The mind is separate from brainwaves. Brainwaves aren’t part of the mind- but simply activity within the brain. An 8-week-old fetus has brain waves- does that mean it has a mind? No. It’s not aware; it doesn’t think; it’s not conscious. We DIDN’T go on Planned Parents property, as I’ve already made quite clear. I never base my arguments on religion unless I’m debating religion. I debate abortion fully based on our medical and scientific knowledge, and logic. Sure, there’s some morality involved, and that morality is that it’s wrong to kill another innocent human being. No, you don’t treat a toddler like an adult- but what do you treat it as? You treat the child well. You protect it. Your natural obligation is to take care of the child- you don’t see animals having abortions- they care for their children. So? What makes them different? The infant doesn’t look like you and me- adult humans. It looks very different. In the same way, the fetus doesn’t look like how we perceive humans to look like. Not anymore, it used to be that way about three months ago.No, we don’t harass them; we beg them to reconsider. It’s not harassment- it’s trying to save innocent human lives. ROFLMAO.Enough of your insults; they’re very offensive. This is a mature debate, we’re not hating eachother. I’m trying to act as mature as I can but you continue to debate like a 14-year-old boy during puberty. Moving along, most women don’t realize they’re killing anything- they don’t think about it because nobody gives them a chance to. I’m sure you don’t tell women who are considering abortions that the fetus is a human being. Why? Because women will refuse to have abortions if they knew that! So I suppose we also should abandon debating this altogether, along with 90% of the things on this forum, right? LOL. You’re funny.That’s one example of why less abortions happen in hospitals- they usually happen in abortion clinics.

The toddler is undeveloped- it still has another 16 years or so to grow up. What about deformed children? Some of them don’t look human. Can we kill them? Remember the elephant man? People treated him as an animal, and he was sold like an animal, and forced to do tricks. At one point, a crowd of people chased after him, and he ran. He finally was trapped in an alley, and yelled out “I AM A HUMAN BEING”. Just because somebody doesn’t look like what you perceive as a human being, doesn’t mean isn’t one. Umm, yeah that’s what ALL is… so what? They offer post-abortion treatment centers too.

That doesn't matter. The infant doesn't have sperm, does that mean it doesn't have a right to live? The infant only weights about 7 lbs, verses an adult who weighs around 130. Does that mean it doesn't have rights either? Genetically, Down's syndrome patients are corrupt- they have too many or too little chromosones. Do they not have rights to life either? I mean, our cellular structure is ALWAYS different in the cycle of life, and further some defected humans have different cellular structures as well, does that mean that we can kill people of ONE kind of these structures?Well, I don't know too much about it, but I've heard that it does, though I also heard on the news last year that these were proven false, but only one aspect. From my understanding, the reason why abortion is dangerous is that you're prematurly opening the uterus to get the fetus ou and kill it, and the body is already on a 9-month cycle to take care of the fetus, and when you suddenly stop it like that it causes problems- just like premature births. I don't know too much about it though. Why are you asking me this?

Someone has been lying to you. But don't take my word for it (even though I know people who have found midwives to deliver their children and people to adopt them through "real" counsellors), do the research yourself.I already posted this, but you obviously didn't read it-**********If any place you go for counselling when pregnant tries to convince you to choose to abort or to have the baby/give it up for adoption LEAVE IMMEDIATELY. Go somewhere else. The person is either not a real counsellor (anti-abortion zealot) or just a bad counsellor. **********Planned Parenthood (I use them as an example because they are so often demonized) has several important information sections on their website which reflect the variety of their programming. Under Health Info they have- Nationwide Health Centres, Birth Control, Emergency Contraception, STIs and Safer Sex, Pregnancy and Parenting, Abortion, Teen Issues, Women's Health, Health FAQs, and a Nurse Practitioner Masters Degree program. Because, as I said, this organization distributes this false information in order to scare women into not having abortions. They are liars.You misunderstand. It's not about having a "different" cellular structure. It's about having a cellular structure that is simple and undeveloped, like bacteria, mold or mollusks. I don't feel that killing bacteria, mold or mollusks is "immoral". When humans are at that stage of development, they are as unaware and unconcious as mollusks- not because of injury but because that is all their development allows. They are fundamentally different from a born human.

ALL doesn't state that breast cancer is caused by abortion, they say it can be caused by abortion, which may be true. IT's certainly not a lie.

We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population, and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members."  — Margaret Sanger, letter to Clarence Gamble, Dec. 10,1939."Before eugenists and others who are laboring for racial betterment can succeed, they must first clear the way for Birth Control.

Birth Control Review, February 1919,"Those least fit to carry on the race are increasing most rapidly. … Funds that should be used to raise the standard of our civilization are diverted to maintenance of those who should never have been born."  —Margaret Sanger, Pivot of CivilizationThere are plenty of other quotes.

Someone has been lying to you. But don't take my word for it (even though I know people who have found midwives to deliver their children and people to adopt them through "real" counsellors), do the research yourself.I already posted this, but you obviously didn't read it-**********If any place you go for counselling when pregnant tries to convince you to choose to abort or to have the baby/give it up for adoption LEAVE IMMEDIATELY. Go somewhere else. The person is either not a real counsellor (anti-abortion zealot) or just a bad counsellor. **********Planned Parenthood (I use them as an example because they are so often demonized) has several important information sections on their website which reflect the variety of their programming. Under Health Info they have- Nationwide Health Centres, Birth Control, Emergency Contraception, STIs and Safer Sex, Pregnancy and Parenting, Abortion, Teen Issues, Women's Health, Health FAQs, and a Nurse Practitioner Masters Degree program. Because, as I said, this organization distributes this false information in order to scare women into not having abortions. They are liars.You misunderstand. It's not about having a "different" cellular structure. It's about having a cellular structure that is simple and undeveloped, like bacteria, mold or mollusks. I don't feel that killing bacteria, mold or mollusks is "immoral". When humans are at that stage of development, they are as unaware and unconcious as mollusks- not because of injury but because that is all their development allows. They are fundamentally different from a born human.

First of all, breast cancer has no one cause, so obviously abortion can't cause all breast cancer. About a billion things have been suspected as causes for cancer, there is no evidence that abortion is a factor in cancer prevalence any more than broccoli or tennis shoes.Second, more info from PP's website here All deliberately misinforms people, spreading fear in order to get people to comply with their political agenda. That is by definition terrorism.I haven't seen them say the fetus isn't human, neither have I seen them say anything about whether abortion is "religiously a sin" (sic). I already posted why the fetus won't feel it, the medical evidence is as conclusive as can be without getting sworn affadivits from fetuses. Do you even know anything about PP firsthand, or have you gotten all your info filtered through ALL? The picture you paint of Sanger is deliberately misleading- some of the quotes aren't even from her. Planned Parenthood's website is open about some questionable beliefs she had, and they also do not share these beliefs or policies which promote them.Unlike the Catholic Church, which is also racist, and has not changed in their racist beliefs and practices.As for your quotes and such-This is obviously, if you are paying attention, a quote from the same article you pulled a quote from, where she compares the movement for birth control to eugenicists. It is obvious if you read more that she disagreed with eugenicists. The fact that she helped Jewish people escape Hitler while the US gov't was turning them back by the thousands also adds to the case that she isn't as racist as anti-abortionists claim. I haven't heard of this book, but she was involved in the "Negro Project"-By the way, Sanger never said that anyone should have abortions. She only spoke of contraceptives.

ALL doesn't state that breast cancer is caused by abortion, they say it can be caused by abortion, which may be true. IT's certainly not a lie.

I don't know what you're talking about here. When did Planned Parenthood support the extermination of Black people and Jewish people?Anyway, Sanger supported access to birth control for everyone, not just people of color. She said about the clinics she set up in London and other places in Europe as well, "We cannot as occidentals, presume to ask the oriental races, of whom it is feared will overrun the earth, to decrease their population while we encourage a high birth rate among ourselves." That sounds to me like someone who sees the racism of her contemporaries and is openly speaking and acting out against them.Hotel Commodore, December 8, 1920. Typed Draft. Source of document: Margaret Sanger Papers, Library of Congress, (LCM 129:593-95).  As I said, though, I disagree with much of her beliefs. I won't argue that she wasn't racist. However, I think if you're going to critique someone's philosophy you should use quotes by them, not by other people. Read her writings yourself, and find me a place where she says that she wanted Black people's extermination. Also, you would have to explain why W.E.B. DuBois and Martin Luther King were friends with her, if she really believed in the extermination of Black people.Try starting with things she actually wrote or said herself- like browsing her writings here, here here and here Then there are your allegations that she was anti-semitic-For someone whom you claim advocated the extermination of all Jewish people, this is an odd sentiment. Even stranger is the fact that she embarked on a campaign to allow entry of Jewish refugees, despite the US gov't unwillingness to increase the "quota" given the situation in Europe.more info here So, either Sanger wasn't really an anti-semite (she was at least less anti-semitic than the US gov't at the time), or she enjoyed doing things which went against her own ideas. Then again, you have no evidence that anti-semitism was one of her ideas, so there you are.Yes, they are. I gave you the sources. Unless you can come up with a statement where Sanger says she believes in the extermination of people of color, you are just running off at the mouth to say so.I already refuted all your "quotes" point by point. You have to learn to start actually reading people's replies, and trying to argue against them with sources or logic, not just half-baked opinions.How am I supposed to accept the credibility of your  quotes? You are the one that is arguing that Sanger wanted people of color's extermination. You show the evidence. However, you may find that difficult, because I doubt there is any. Sanger was allied with the liberal wing of the eugenics movement. So were many other prominent persons of the day (if they weren't allied with the fascist wing of the same movement). She was born into a poor family and believed that poverty could be overcome partly by access to birth control for the poor (as the rich had access already). She also believed that healthy people should procreate and others shouldn't. This is obviously a problematic and outdated opinion. Still, she disagreed with the separation of access to birth control (and in fact disagreed with the separation of eugenics) along racial lines. All of her writings show that although she advocated "breeding for the fit", she did not consider fitness to be race-based.Furthermore, the past history of an organization is only relevant if that organization refuses to acknowledge their disagreement with these past actions/philosophies, and/or continues to practice this behavior. You have not demonstrated any evidence that Planned Parenthood advocates eugenics. So your point is moot. I notice you have nothing more to say about the terrorist organization you work with. That's probably wise, but this Sanger thing is such a transparent red herring.Edith Stein, the RCC, and the Nazis- There are just too many examples to quote, so I'll stop here.Oh, wait- then there was that little thing where they committed genocide against the First Nations of the Americas....

As I said, you have offered no evidence of this. This is just your interpretation of the consequences of thier beliefs. This is not reflected in their writings or their practices. If you can support this statement with anything PP say or do (besides offer abortions to all), then by all means, please do, because I am tired of trying to explain to you how debating is supposed to work.Again, you offered no evidence to support this.Perhaps, but certainly not by someone who advocated the extermination of any race. Either way, as I said, Planned Parenthood neither advocates or practices her beliefs at this time, and in fact openly condemns them. Can you not find anything wrong with PP presently?There is no evidence to support that statement.The website you quote is not against Sanger's racism in particular, but what the organizers feel is the inherent racism of many state contraceptive/abortion programs. However, for starters, they are a religious anti-abortion organization, and second they don't actually quote Sanger saying or doing anything particularly racist, but instead quote right-wing eugenicists or speak of abortion providers in general.This is another quote from the same website which makes it clear that Sanger never advocated the extermination of any particular race, as her idea of genetic "fitness" was not divided by race.The only real contention they have with Sanger (or PP in particular) is the argument that she seemed to target people of color in particular for her clinics. It may be true that Sanger and even PP target poor neighborhoods (which will inevitably due to racism often be people of color's neighborhoods), this arguably due to the fact that abortion access for the wealthy (in majority white) has never been a problem. That was the case even when abortion was illegal, in fact was even more so when abortion was illegal as the very fact that it was illegal made it cost-prohibitive.a) the sources you gave me were from biased web-sites and organizations as well,b) upon investigation, every one of your quotes was either taken out of context, inconclusive (ie showed she was for eugenics but not for the extermination of anyone), or a patently false invention.Um, what are talking about? The sources are right there in my quote, Perhaps if you read other people's posts thoroughly you would be less confused.None of your quotes from Margaret Sanger include her saying she believes in the extermination of any particular race.As I said before;"ALL deliberately misinforms people, spreading fear in order to get people to comply with their political agenda. That is by definition terrorism."Thank you for that consideration. emoticonXGood Which one? I provided two- one written by a Catholic and published by the Goan Overseas Digest ("a digest of issues for Goan & Asian diaspora"), one from an anti-racism site on a Jewish Christian webring.You still haven't addressed any of the issues I offered, citing instead information about other things that members of the Catholic Church may have done, as though this is conclusive evidence for your claim that "the Catholic Church is NOT racist". As though saying that enough times will make my points magically dissapear. Perhaps instead you should just click your heels three times saying "there's no place like Church". Then again, you could try actually debating.

Why would the church make itself neutral in such atrocities? Why would any aid given to the afflicted be made secret? And please refrain from using the "we" word, you weren't born for several decades, and I'm sure have no involvement in papal dictates even now. It's not like I would claim to have involvement in official american policy during the war.

They call Margaret Sanger a “hero” even though she was extremely racist!  "Margaret Sanger is responsible, more than anyone else, for keeping alive international racism."(Drogin, Elasah, Margaret Sanger: Father of Modern Society)Margaret Sanger, 1883-1966, the founder of Planned Parenthood of America and honorary president of International Planned Parenthood, edited the American Birth Control League's publication the Birth Control Review. (Drogin, Elasah. Margaret Sanger: Father of Modern Society. CUL Publications, New Hope KY, 1989. p. 11.)Sanger played the attractive hostess for racist thinkers all over the world. Organizing the First World Population Conference in Geneva in 1926, she invited Clarence C. Little, Edward A. East, Henry Pratt Fairchild, and Raymond Pearl -- all infamous racists. (Birth Control Review, November, 1926.)In 1931 Sanger founded the Population Association of America with Fairchild as its head. Fairchild, formerly the secretary-treasurer of the American Eugenics Society and the leading academic racist of the decade, wrote The Melting Pot Mistake which denigrated the Jews, referring to them as the inferior new immigrants who would threaten the native Nordic stock. (Allan Chase, The Legacy of Malthus, p. 656.) Edward A. East, a firm believer in Black inferiority, persuaded Mrs. Sanger to gather information about her clients at her Maternity Research Clinic that went beyond medical histories. She agreed to include information about the nationality, heredity, and religion of the patients and to make a "judgement" regarding the amount of racial intermixture of the patient, "whether the person was more or less pure Black, mulatto, quadroon, etc." (Linda Gordon, Woman's Body, Woman's Right, p. 287.)Lothrop Stoddart was on Sanger's board of directors for years. As previously mentioned, he had a personal interview with Adolf Hitler and was very impressed. His book, The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy, was written while he served on Sanger's board. Havelock Ellis, one of Sanger's extra-marital lovers, reviewed this abominable book favorably in The Birth Control Review. (Birth Control Review, October, 1920.In the 20s and 30s Sanger fearlessly carried on with these racists and many others, totally uninhibited. But when Adolf Hitler poisoned the air by politically carrying out her eugenics schemes, Mrs. Sanger and her crew made some changes. The term "birth control" had always been associated with eugenics, so the American Birth Control League changed its name to Planned Parenthood. The racist language changed with it. Such terms as "good or bad breeding stock" were changed to "class" or "income level". (Linda Gordon, Woman's Body, Woman's Rights, p. 347.)Eugenics is identical to racism because both believe that there are innately, irreversibly inferior groups of human beings. Eugenicist-racists believe in the inequality of the races and that by selective breeding the inferior race can be improved -- by "selective breeding" is meant that the inferior breeders of the population are somehow consistently eliminated.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PLANNED PARENTHOODThe classic comprehensive 1988 exposé of Planned Parenthood, Grand Illusions, The Legacy of Planned Parenthood, by George Grant, still provides valuable insights into the nature of that organization. Some highlights are:Planned Parenthood is the world’s oldest, largest, and best organized provider of abortion and birth control services. It now plays a strategic role in the health and social services community. It carries considerable political clout through lobbying, legislation, advocacy, campaigning, and litigation. It has brokered its abortion trade into a public image that is very nearly unassailable. It has a no-nonsense, tough-as-nails, down-to-earth, where-the-rubber-meets-the-road kind of reputation that has made it a glittering star in the grand constellation of the American social service field. All that glitters, however, is not gold:Planned Parenthood claims to advocate the freedom of women to choose if and when they will have children, without government interference. The truth is that from its very inception, Planned Parenthood has sought mandatory population control measures measures carefully designed to deny the freedom to choose. Over the years it has proposed that our government implement such things as ‘compulsory abortion for out-of-wedlock pregnancies,’ ‘compulsory sterilization for those who already have two children,’ and ‘tax penalties’ for existing large families. China has taken Planned Parenthood’s suggestions to heart, launching a brutal, no-holds-barred, one-child-per-couple policy. Planned Parenthood continues to maintain that the communist government’s genocidal approach to population control is a ‘model of efficiency.’ In a recent survey of women who had received abortions at Planned Parenthood, ninety-five percent of the women said that their Planned Parenthood counselors gave ‘little or no information about the potential health risks which might follow the surgery.’ And eighty-nine percent said that their counselor was ‘strongly biased in favor of the abortion.’ Planned Parenthood’s pose as a champion of the underprivileged is a cruel hoax foisted on the uninformed and unsuspecting. The truth is, Planned Parenthood appears to want to eliminate the poor, not serve them. Animosity toward the weak and lowly has been its hallmark from its earliest days. In fact, its entire program of family limitation was designed to foster an elitist program against the under classes. In 1927, Margaret Sanger, founder of Planned Parenthood, argued that organized attempts to help the poor were the surest sign that our civilization has bred, is breeding, and is perpetuating constantly increasing numbers of defectives, delinquents, and dependents. Planned Parenthood has always targeted minorities, the unwanted, and the disadvantaged for family limitation, contraception, abortion, and sterilization. More children from the fit, less from the unfit, Sanger pined, that is the chief issue of birth control. To this day, the trust of Planned Parenthood’s literature constantly devises new plans to penetrate Black, Hispanic, and ethnic communities with its crippling message of Eugenic racism. Planned Parenthood claims that it is in the forefront of the battle against sexually transmitted diseases. The truth is, Planned Parenthood’s efforts have been tragically counterproductive. It has become a veritable Typhoid Mary, actually encouraging the spread of syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, herpes, hepatitis, granuloma, chancroid, and even AIDS at an alarming rate. Besides the fact that it constantly exhorts youngsters to flaunt a ribald and irresponsible promiscuity, it continually promotes an alarmingly ‘unsafe’ exercise of that promiscuity. Instead of affording its fornicating disciples with the slim security of barrier devices, it primarily peddles the entirely unguarded prescription birth control methods. Eighty percent of Planned Parenthood’s clients receive non-barrier contraceptives, and eighty-eight percent of those who previously practiced ‘safe sex’ are dissuaded from continuing. Planned Parenthood claims that sex education is a necessary and effective means of preventing teen pregnancies. The truth is, Planned Parenthood’s sex education programs have backfired, actually increasing teen pregnancies. The conclusion, one that Planned Parenthood researchers have been unable to escape, is that sex education courses only exacerbate the teen pregnancy problem. [pages 24-30, footnotes omitted.]~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Sanger’s assistants gave Braun more pro-birth control literature and a copy of her autobiography, which he gave to his wife to read. Sanger’s message of preventing maternal and infant mortality stirred Braun’s wife. Now convinced of this need, Braun permitted a group of women to use his chapel for a birth-control talk. "[I was] moved by the number of prominent [black] Christians backing the proposition," Braun wrote in a letter to Sanger. "At first glance I had a horrible shock to the proposition because it seemed to me to be allied to abortion, but after thought and prayer, I have concluded that especially among many women, it is necessary both to save the lives of mothers and children [emphasis added]."By 1949, Sanger had hoodwinked black America’s best and brightest into believing birth control’s "life-saving benefits." In a monumental feat, she bewitched virtually an entire network of black social, professional and academic organizations into endorsing Planned Parenthood’s eugenic program.Sanger’s successful duplicity does not in any way suggest blacks were gullible. They certainly wanted to decrease maternal and infant mortality and improve the community’s overall health. They wholly accepted her message because it seemed to promise prosperity and social acceptance. Sanger used their vulnerabilities and their ignorance (of her deliberately hidden agenda) to her advantage. Aside from birth control, she offered no other medical or social solutions to their adversity. Surely, blacks would not have been such willing accomplices had they perceived her true intentions. Considering the role eugenics played in the early birth control movement–and Sanger’s embracing of that ideology–the notion of birth control as seemingly the only solution to the problems that plagued blacks should have been much more closely scrutinized."Scientific Racism"Planned Parenthood has gone to great lengths to repudiate the organization’s eugenic origins. It adamantly denies Sanger was a eugenicist or racist, despite evidence to the contrary. Because Sanger stopped editing The Birth Control Review in 1929, the organization tries to disassociate her from the eugenic and racist-oriented articles published after that date. However, a summary of an address Sanger gave in 1932, which appeared in the Review that year, revealed her continuing bent toward eugenics.In "A Plan for Peace," Sanger suggested Congress set up a special department to study population problems and appoint a "Parliament of Population." One of the main objectives of the "Population Congress" would be "to raise the level and increase the general intelligence of population." This would be accomplished by applying a "stern and rigid policy of sterilization and segregation [ in addition to tightening immigration laws] to that grade of population whose progeny is already tainted, or whose inheritance is such that objectionable traits may be transmitted to offspring."It’s reasonable to conclude that as the leader of Planned Parenthood–even after 1929–Sanger would not allow publication of ideas she didn’t support.Sanger’s defenders argue she only wanted to educate blacks about birth control’s "health benefits." However, she counted the very people she wanted to "educate" among the "unfit," whose numbers needed to be restricted.Grant presents other arguments Sanger’s supporters use to refute her racist roots:• blacks, Jews, Hispanics and other minorities are well represented in the • the former, high-profile president of the organization, Faye Wattleton, is a black woman; • "aggressive" minority hiring practices have been standard procedure for more than two decades; • the "vast majority of the nation’s ethnic leadership solidly and actively supports the work" of the organization. These justifications also fail because of what Grant calls "scientific racism." This form of racism is based on genes, rather than skin color or language. "The issue is not ‘color of skin’ or ‘dialect of tongue,’" Grant writes, "but ‘quality of genes [emphasis added].’" Therefore, "as long as blacks, Jews and Hispanics demonstrate ‘a good quality gene pool’–as long as they ‘act white and think white’–then they are esteemed equally with Aryans. As long as they are, as Margaret Sanger said, ‘the best of their race,’ then they can be [counted] as valuable citizens [emphasis added]." By the same token, "individual whites" who shoe "dysgenic traits" must also have their fertility "curbed right along with the other ‘inferiors and undesirables.’"In short, writes Grant, "Scientific racism is an equal opportunity discriminator [emphasis added]. Anyone with a ‘defective gene pool’ is suspect. And anyone who shows promise may be admitted to the ranks of the elite."The eugenic undertone is hard to miss. As Grant rightly comments, "The bottom line is that Planned Parenthood was self-consciously organized, in part, to promote and enforce White Supremacy. … It has been from its inception implicitly and explicitly racist.""There is no way to escape the implications," argues William L. Davis, a black financial analyst Grant quotes. "When an organization has a history of racism, when its literature is openly racist, when it goals are self-consciously racial, and when its programs invariably revolve around race, it doesn’t take an expert to realize that the organization is indeed racist."Sanger’s Legacy Its is impossible to sever Planned Parenthood’s past from its present. Its legacy of lies and propaganda continues to infiltrate the black community. This poison is even more venomous because, in addition to birth control, Planned Parenthood touts abortion as a solution to the economic and social problems that plague the community. In its wake is the loss of more than 12 million lives within the black community alone. Planned Parenthood’s own record reflect this. For example, a 1992 report revealed that 23.2 percent of women who obtained abortions at its affiliates were black---although blacks represent no more than 13 percent of the total population. In 1996, Planned Parenthood’s research arm reported: "Blacks, who make up 14 percent of all childbearing women, have 31 percent of all abortions and whites, who account for 81 percent of women of childbearing age, have 61 percent.""Abortion is the number-one killer of blacks in America," says Rev. Hunter of LEARN. "We’re losing our people at the rate of 1,452 a day. That’s just pure genocide. There’s no other word for it. [Sanger’s] influence and the whole mindset that Planned Parenthood has brought into the black community … say it’s okay to destroy your people. We bought into the lie; we bought into the propaganda."Some blacks have even made abortion "right" synonymous with civil rights."We’re destroying the destiny and purpose of others who should be here," Hunter laments. "Who knows the musicians we’ve lost? Who knows the great leaders the black community has really lost? Who knows what great minds of economic power people have lost? What great teachers?" He recites an old African proverb: "No one knows whose womb holds the chief."Hunter has personally observed the vestiges of Planned Parenthood’s eugenic past in the black community today. "When I travel around the country…I can only think of one abortion clinic [I’ve seen] in a predominantly white neighborhood. The majority of clinics are in black neighborhoods."Hunter noted the controversy that occurred tow years ago in Louisiana involving school-based health clinics. The racist undertone could not have been more evident. In the Baton Rouge district, officials were debating placing clinics in the high schools. Black state representative Sharon Weston Broome initially supported the idea. She later expressed concern about clinics providing contraceptives and abortion counseling. "Clinics should promote abstinence," she said. Upon learning officials wanted to put the clinics in black schools only, Hunter urged her to suggest they be placed in white schools as well. At Broome’s suggestion, however, proposals for t he school clinics were "dropped immediately," reported Hunter.Further, PP has never condemned the forced abortions going on in China. Planned Parenthood’s racism has spread so greatly, that now almost 40% of abortions are done by blacks. Planned Parenthood spreads lies, as shown above. Show me ONE source where PP condemns Margaret Sanger’s racism. Yes, there are a lot of problems with Planned Parenthood today. They recommended China to have abortions, and now forced abortions are being done on women, and PP hasn’t said anything about it. They have not regretted their racism in the past. They give biased opinions to women about their “options”. They brainwash teenage girls into having an abortion, and keep it secret from their parents. This is SICK.[quote] The website you quote is not against Sanger's racism in particular, but what the organizers feel is the inherent racism of many state contraceptive/abortion programs. However, for starters, they are a religious anti-abortion organization, and second they don't actually quote Sanger saying or doing anything particularly racist, but instead quote right-wing eugenicists or speak of abortion providers in general.[/quoet]Actually they quote Sanger a lot. Here, here, and I’m sure you can find other places. What?! Grant made it clear that Sanger was OK with non-whites who “acted” white. THAT IS STILL RACIST!My sources have sources in themselves- and if they don’t, I give you sources. You just give me articles written by third-party political scientists who provide no valid quotes. Only those who “act” like their race. If they act white, they’re OK! So let’s kill all Asians, Africans, and Hispanics, unless they act white, they’ve gotta go. Um, no it is not. Terrorism involves violence, pro-lifers (generally) do not use physical violence. There are some rare cases where people like the Army of God bomb abortion clinics, calling them “radical clinic bombers”, and even Feminists For Life offered a reward for the capture of a clinic bomber.Once source was from this site. Yes, very credible. The other was written by some figure who was a secretary for Catholic bishop’s conference, but we don’t know anything about the guy. Those things that the Catholic Church did were BY the PAPAL authority. THAT IS THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. For the same reason Switzerland, Spain, Sweden, Ireland, and other nations went neutral; so they wouldn’t be invaded. The Vatican was always supported by Italy, but when Italy went fascist, do you think that’s a smart move to make to ally yourself to people thousands of miles away? No. If they allied with Germany, they could have gotten benefits. However, instead they went neutral.

Why would the church make itself neutral in such atrocities? Why would any aid given to the afflicted be made secret? And please refrain from using the "we" word, you weren't born for several decades, and I'm sure have no involvement in papal dictates even now. It's not like I would claim to have involvement in official american policy during the war.

You want to talk about biased sources? First of all, you quote this person's opinion, not, say, a fact or anything like that, but worse, you quote a totally BS book.You can make allegations and quote opinions of people she associated with all you like, none of this proves anything I didn't say myself. You still haven't demonstated any evidence that Sanger herself advocated the elimination of any one race.Again, you quote pro-life people's opinions, none of whom are able to find any quotes of Sanger actually saying she believed in racial extermination. It doesn't seem to matter how many times I write something, you refuse to really read anyone else's posts. One more time; I never argued that Sanger wasn't racist, just that she never advocated (and in fact openly disagreed with) racial extermination, which was your contention.Look it up. I have two dictionaries, both use the terms "fear or force", neither imply that force is necessary. Maybe you should try finding out the definition of a word before you argue about it.As I said, the author is a Jewish Christian, and his site is on a Jewish Christian webring. Do you have to know the author personally now for them to be credible?Both sites are by Christians, one is a Catholic, but that isn't enough for you. Yet you can't find any anti-Sanger propaganda that isn't from an anti-abortion organization. It's becoming increasingly obvious that you only find sources "credible" if they agree with you.Exactly. In some cases helping individual Jewish people, in others making them easier to kill. I suppose to you, that is good enough. My moral standards are just a little higher, in particular from people who claim to speak for "God".

Terrorism involves violence, pro-lifers (generally) do not use physical violence. There are some rare cases where people like the Army of God bomb abortion clinics, calling them “radical clinic bombers”, and even Feminists For Life offered a reward for the capture of a clinic bomber.Once source was from this site. Yes, very credible. The other was written by some figure who was a secretary for Catholic bishop’s conference, but we don’t know anything about the guy. Those things that the Catholic Church did were BY the PAPAL authority. THAT IS THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. For the same reason Switzerland, Spain, Sweden, Ireland, and other nations went neutral; so they wouldn’t be invaded. The Vatican was always supported by Italy, but when Italy went fascist, do you think that’s a smart move to make to ally yourself to people thousands of miles away? No. If they allied with Germany, they could have gotten benefits. However, instead they went neutral.

Being racist doesn’t necessarily mean that you are for the extermination for a race, but just against the race itself. What gives you that impression?LOL! What a hypocrite! Just a little while ago you tried to DEFEND yourself for quoting people who SUPPORTED your argument, and now when I do it as well, you attack ME! Okay, why does that make it any worse? Margaret Sanger was a racist, period. Planned Parenthood doesn’t attack her for being racist, and instead denies it, period. By your definition of terrorism I can easily say Planned Parenthood terrorizes teenage girls into having abortions. Many Christians are anti-Catholic! That’s still not a credible source. YES!!!!One isn’t Catholic. Both sites are Christian, one is by a third party author. The site doesn’t even work. I can’t even go and find out WHO this guy is. Just because Eddie D’Sa met Richard Zipfel doesn’t mean he’s a Catholic, let alone valid! Protestants are generally anti-Catholic and often criticize the church for not condemning racism in the past, although we really weren’t racist (we banned slavery in the 1400s!)You’re just bullshooting again. The Pope did not support the killing of Jews. That is a lie. Many Catholics probably did- sure. Many protestants, atheist, agnostics, you named it also did. But the Pope himself was against it, and SAVED Jews from the Nazis.

You want to talk about biased sources? First of all, you quote this person's opinion, not, say, a fact or anything like that, but worse, you quote a totally BS book.You can make allegations and quote opinions of people she associated with all you like, none of this proves anything I didn't say myself. You still haven't demonstated any evidence that Sanger herself advocated the elimination of any one race.Again, you quote pro-life people's opinions, none of whom are able to find any quotes of Sanger actually saying she believed in racial extermination. It doesn't seem to matter how many times I write something, you refuse to really read anyone else's posts. One more time; I never argued that Sanger wasn't racist, just that she never advocated (and in fact openly disagreed with) racial extermination, which was your contention.Look it up. I have two dictionaries, both use the terms "fear or force", neither imply that force is necessary. Maybe you should try finding out the definition of a word before you argue about it.As I said, the author is a Jewish Christian, and his site is on a Jewish Christian webring. Do you have to know the author personally now for them to be credible?Both sites are by Christians, one is a Catholic, but that isn't enough for you. Yet you can't find any anti-Sanger propaganda that isn't from an anti-abortion organization. It's becoming increasingly obvious that you only find sources "credible" if they agree with you.Exactly. In some cases helping individual Jewish people, in others making them easier to kill. I suppose to you, that is good enough. My moral standards are just a little higher, in particular from people who claim to speak for "God".

I know. You have repeatedly stated that Sanger believed in the extermination of Jewish and Black people. Now you retreat and say she was racist even though she didn't believe the things you said she believed. I never argued she wasn't racist. So what are you going on about?I don't know. It might have to do with the alarming lack of evidence for the author's position. Why don't you quote some of her "evidence" instead of her opinions, and we will see if she has any based on fact.This sentence makes no sense. Are you saying I was defending myself by quoting people who supported my argument, or for quoting people who supported my argument. Of course I will use quotes which support my argument- that is the essence of debating. As for the other case, my quotes from PP included references to Sanger's published works, not mere opinion.Paranoia will destroy ya, Parcum. I hardly consider my response should be described as an "attack". They deny the absurd allegations of ALL (which you have repeated) and other anti-abortion groups that she was in favor of the extermination of any particular race. They openly disagree with her eugenicist ideas.You can say anything you like. However, as this is a debate, it's expected that you make an argument based on logic or fact to support your statements.As I expected. Your definition of credibility is absurd and precludes any opposition to your position.If you read the letter you will find that he states that he is Catholic. As for "valid", I suppose to you that means "agrees with Parcum", in which case he probably isn't. Parcum, for the sake of your credibility on these forums, and to save me the frustration of having to continue this non-debate, I would like to refer you to a post I placed on the General forum, about Debating. I think you are having trouble understanding what a debate is, what an "argument" is (in the debating sense), etc. Please read that post.

Someone has been lying to you. But don't take my word for it (even though I know people who have found midwives to deliver their children and people to adopt them through "real" counsellors), do the research yourself.I already posted this, but you obviously didn't read it-**********If any place you go for counselling when pregnant tries to convince you to choose to abort or to have the baby/give it up for adoption LEAVE IMMEDIATELY. Go somewhere else. The person is either not a real counsellor (anti-abortion zealot) or just a bad counsellor. **********Planned Parenthood (I use them as an example because they are so often demonized) has several important information sections on their website which reflect the variety of their programming. Under Health Info they have- Nationwide Health Centres, Birth Control, Emergency Contraception, STIs and Safer Sex, Pregnancy and Parenting, Abortion, Teen Issues, Women's Health, Health FAQs, and a Nurse Practitioner Masters Degree program. Because, as I said, this organization distributes this false information in order to scare women into not having abortions. They are liars.You misunderstand. It's not about having a "different" cellular structure. It's about having a cellular structure that is simple and undeveloped, like bacteria, mold or mollusks. I don't feel that killing bacteria, mold or mollusks is "immoral". When humans are at that stage of development, they are as unaware and unconcious as mollusks- not because of injury but because that is all their development allows. They are fundamentally different from a born human.

Though you didn’t admit that Sanger was racist till later, my point isn’t saying that she was racist and you are wrong, but that she was racist, PP adores her, and they don’t regret her being racist. It raises a lot of suspicion. I don’t know, that doesn’t sound biased at all. That sounds like a very UNBIASED source. You misunderstand quoting. Unlike what you’ve been doing (and I admit I’ve been doing the same recently, but only because you’ve been doing it), quoting is going to the actual sources and interpreting them. You don’t use sources that quote and interpret for you, and take their word for it.Oh, I assure you, it’s not paranoia. It’s annoyance. Planned Parenthood denies a lot of things. Actually, they deny that she was a racist, anti-semite, and that she was a eugenicist, period.  Margaret Sanger was not a racist, an anti-Semite, or a eugenicist.  hereIt certainly is true. I can just as much call Planned Parenthood Al-Quaida as you call ALL Hamas. Mizmax, it is absolutely essential you know the context of the written material. Are we to simply accept Mein Kamph as fact? No, we look at the context- in this case, an anti-Semitic Nazi wrote it. Are we simply supposed to accept everything CNN says as fact? No, we know that CNN is liberal, so we can’t always trust them. So? Margaret Sanger was a “Catholic”. Ted Kennedy is “Catholic”. However, both of them excommunicated themselves from the Church, and neither of them truly accept church teachings. Mizmax, I don’t need any of your recommendations. So far, your thesis has been based entirely on other person’s opinions, personal attacks, insults, and ridiculousness. It extremely difficult to respond to your post because I try so hard to make everything very clear, but only on rare occasions do you understand. It’s humorous that you post things that clearly are biased and expect me to accept them as fact. I continue to ask for sources, you give them to me. I ask for links, and with time you give them to me. I discover your quotes come from biased authors, and you attack me and defend the sources, such as “Catholic Ministries”, which is an anti-Catholic organization dedicated to “Saving” Catholics, and “Jewish Christians”, which is a Protestant-Jewish anti-Catholic website. You expect me to take these sources seriously? I hope you don’t. Obviously, you’ve been having difficulty finding sources to support your theses. If I may, I recommend you discover your thesis, research on it, and find your own answers before beginning to debate it, let alone act on it and tell others it is the truth, when clearly it isn’t.And thus I conclude this argument; Abortion is the killing (By definition) of an innocent (by definition), human being (by science), and therefore it is morally wrong to kill it. Abortion is homicide, murder, et cetera, infinitum, saecula, saeculorum. You can never tell somebody that their not a human because they don’t seem like one. You can never trick a woman into murdering somebody. Abortion is not only a disgrace to America, but a disgrace to humanity.

Are you going to start seeing Scary Mary serpents like rapture?I am surprised that you are able to even type this sentence without bursting into flames at the depth of the irony of it.You won't accept a source that isn't Catholic, and "truly accepts" church teachings, and agrees with you and ALL but you want to debate whether Sanger (who was very much targeted as an "enemy" by the RCC), the "founder" of PP (who the RCC hates) was actually a bad person.

Beginning in 1939, DuBois also served on the advisory council for Sanger's "Negro Project," which was a "unique experiment in race-building and humanitarian service to a race subjected to discrimination, hardship, and segregation" (Chesler, 1992). The Negro Project served African-Americans in the rural South. Other leaders of the African-American community who were involved in the project included Mary McLeod Bethune, founder of the National Council of Negro Women, and Adam Clayton Powell Jr., pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem. The Negro Project was also endorsed by prominent white Americans who were involved in social justice efforts at this time, including Eleanor Roosevelt, the most visible and compassionate supporter of racial equality in her era; and the medical philanthropists, Albert and Mary Lasker, whose financial support made the project possible –Planned ParenthoodUmmm… yes I did.

Either way, my argument was correct; Margaret Sanger did support abortion.No, that was an incorrect statement of mine.

Planned Parenthood has priest make quotes about abortion not being a sinRead what I said about Margaret Sanger supporting Fairchild’s book,  The Melting Pot Mistake, which said Jews were “diluting” the American population, and in his other book  Race and Nationality, he blamed the Jews for their own holocaust… hmm… nice person to ally with.

They're those wierd statements you throw in every now and again to try to steer the discussion off course.Um, I believe the title is meant to imply that "Modern Society" is "sinful" or something.Not one of your quotes proved anything. Many were never even said by Sanger, and are complete fabrications.Not every racist is a racist eugenicist. Besides, I never said that she was or wasn't racist. I said you haven't shown any evidence that she was an advocate of racist eugenics, and you haven't.What's wrong with quoting some smart priests? It sure improves the image of the Catholic Church to show that not all priests are anti-abortion zealots.If they'll lie about that, what tells you they don't lie about everything?Prove it.As much as anything can be, it has. I quoted the sources. This statement makes no sense. First, because no one has no bias. Second, (if I understand your unclear sentence construction) you are saying that no matter how accurate a source may be, you will not accept it if the person quoting the source is, in your estimation, biased. This is of course an ad hominem logical fallacy. No matter how biased someone is, you have to contend with the source itself. As a clarifying example, imagine a scenario where someone is against the idea of going outside for some reason. If they say "look out the window, the sky is full of dark clouds, it's going to rain", that may be a true statement. You can look outside and see that there are, indeed, rainclouds. The fact that the person who pointed them out is biased doesn't mean they aren't there. Which isn't the same thing as going on the word of a biased person. For example, in the same scenario, if you coudln't look out the window yourself, you would probably not believe the biased person's assertion that there are stormclouds. In this situation, what you are doing is the equivalent of looking out the window and refusing to believe your eyes, because the person who told you about the weather was biased. You are completely misunderstanding source validity and bias.Well, so long as you're feeling better. If you get more paranoid thoughts I suggest you keep them to yourself.

Here's support for the abortion - breast cancer link.This site has links to five medical organizations which recognize the link between abortion and breast cancer, an explantion for what causes the link, as well as the number of studies in support of the link, and the number which don't support it.http://www.abortionbreastcancer.com/edited to add this article(from abortionbreastcancer.com) :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------MATTERS OF LIFE AND DEATHAbortion doctor caves in lawsuitSettlement given to patient for not warning about breast-cancer risk--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Posted: October 23, 20031:00 a.m. EasternBy Diana Lynne© 2003 WorldNetDaily.com A Pennsylvania woman has won a landmark victory in her malpractice suit against an abortion provider and a New Jersey women's center, which anti-abortion advocates hail as a triumph in their efforts to expose a decades-old medical cover-up. On the eve of trial last Friday, Dr. Charles Benjamin and the Cherry Hill Women's Center in Cherry Hill, N.J., agreed to settle claims it violated parental-consent law and failed to inform its then-17-year-old patient about the emotional and physical risks of abortion – including increased risk of breast cancer. When the plaintiff, who goes by the fictitious name of "Sarah," got pregnant at the age of 16, her high-school guidance counselor facilitated her second-trimester abortion at the New Jersey clinic across the Delaware River without her parents' knowledge. New Jersey was chosen because it has no parental-consent laws regarding abortions for minors. The girl's home state of Pennsylvania, however, requires the consent of at least one parent. Sarah's parents successfully sued the high school in a separate lawsuit for violating their 14th Amendment rights to raise their child without interference by the public school. While the New Jersey clinic and provider cannot be criminally prosecuted for violating Pennsylvania law, they can be taken to task in the civil arena. This lawsuit makes it possible for the abortion providers to be sued for battery. "This case establishes abortion clinics can't escape civil penalties by aborting for kids from other states when they know the state where they come from has parental-consent statute," Sarah's attorney Joseph P. Stanton told WorldNetDaily. Abortion clinics in no-consent states like New Jersey and Illinois are known "dumping grounds" for abortions by out-of-state minors, say anti-abortion advocates. According to Stanton's statistics, an average of 43 women from Pennsylvania travel to New Jersey every month to have abortions. Ten of those are teens, some as young as 12. Stanton said one New Jersey clinic routinely promotes its "no parental consent" services in advertising to minors in Pennsylvania. Sarah is said to have suffered tremendously since having her abortion. Attorney Susan Marie Gertz, executive director of the Women's Injury Network, the national charity that covered Sarah's case expenses, reports she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress syndrome following the abortion. Gertz applauded the undisclosed settlement, which was based on Sarah's need for medical monitoring for early detection of breast cancer. Doctors estimated that cost to be $2,500 annually. The settlement also includes funding to cover future psychological counseling. "Abortion malpractice lawsuits help expose the deceptive practices of the abortion industry and hold doctors legally and financially accountable to the women they've harmed," Gertz said in a statement. Opened in 1978, the Cherry Hill Women's Center bills itself as "a safe place to make an important decision." According to its website, a specialized group of medical care providers help make the center "one of New Jersey's leading ambulatory surgical centers for women's health." A call for comment from the center's administrator was not returned, and Benjamin was unavailable. Proponents of the abortion-breast cancer link, known as the ABC link, also cheered the settlement, the first associated with the ABC link recorded in the U.S. Two others have been reached in Australia. "This settlement will teach the medical establishment that it can no longer profit by keeping women in the dark about the breast cancer risk," said Karen Malec, president of the Coalition on Abortion/Breast Cancer. Malec and others call the ABC link "the elephant in medicine's parlor." While medical experts privately admit abortion is one cause of breast cancer, the volatility of the issue prevents them from publicly acknowledging it. 'ABC link' WorldNetDaily has reported breast cancer is linked to reproductive hormones, particularly estrogen. Although science has yet to define specifically what causes breast cancer, it is uncontested – even among abortion providers – that the sooner a woman has her first child, the lower her risk of developing breast cancer. This is called the "protective" effect. According to Dr. Joel Brind, president of the Breast Cancer Prevention Institute and a leading ABC-link researcher, a woman's estrogen level increases hundreds of times above normal upon conceiving – and one of the first physical changes to the pregnant woman's body occurs in the breasts. That hormone surge leads to the growth of "undifferentiated" cells in the breast as the body prepares to produce milk for the coming baby. Undifferentiated cells are vulnerable to the effects of carcinogens, which can give rise to cancerous tumors later in life. In the final weeks of a full-term pregnancy, those cells are "terminally differentiated" through a still largely unknown process and are ready to produce milk. Differentiated cells are not vulnerable to carcinogens. However, should a pregnancy be terminated prior to cell differentiation, the woman is left with abnormally high numbers of undifferentiated cells, therefore increasing her risk of developing breast cancer. Since 1957, 29 out of 39 published studies on the subject worldwide and 13 out of 16 studies in the United States show a positive association between induced abortion and breast cancer. Seventeen of the 29 are statistically significant, which means there's a 95 percent certainty that the association is not by chance. Seven of these 17 report more than a two-fold risk increase. Five medical organizations recognize a link between abortion and breast cancer. They include the National Physicians Center for Family Resources, the Catholic Medical Association, the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Breast Cancer Prevention Institute and The Polycarp Research Institute. Groups such as Planned Parenthood attack the validity of Brind's and other researchers' studies and refuse to inform prospective abortion recipients of the existence, dismissing even the statistically significant findings as "misinformation" being used "as a weapon in the campaign against safe, legal abortion." "Undaunted by the absence of compelling evidence associating induced abortion with a woman's risk of developing breast cancer, anti-choice extremists insist on making the connection anyway," says Planned Parenthood on its website. Informed consent To combat the denial and protect women, Minnesota and Texas state legislators passed informed-consent legislation earlier this year, which requires abortion providers to tell prospective patients about the risk. Massachusetts is considering similar legislation. Linda Rosenthal, an attorney with the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy in New York, petitioned to participate as a lawyer in Sarah's case on the side of Benjamin and the clinic. CRLP is a national public interest law firm devoted to protecting the "constitutional rights" of women seeking abortions. "It's disturbing to have [Rosenthal] declaring women are not entitled to [risk] information. To me, being fully informed is a part of your reproductive rights," said Stanton. "It's disappointing they're willing to sacrifice women's lives because they're beholden to the abortion industry." "It's common sense," adds Malec. "Doctors should be erring on the side of caution and should be telling patients 'Yes, there is research going back 46 years that supports an abortion-breast cancer link.' That's the minimum owed to women."

They're those wierd statements you throw in every now and again to try to steer the discussion off course.Um, I believe the title is meant to imply that "Modern Society" is "sinful" or something.Not one of your quotes proved anything. Many were never even said by Sanger, and are complete fabrications.Not every racist is a racist eugenicist. Besides, I never said that she was or wasn't racist. I said you haven't shown any evidence that she was an advocate of racist eugenics, and you haven't.What's wrong with quoting some smart priests? It sure improves the image of the Catholic Church to show that not all priests are anti-abortion zealots.If they'll lie about that, what tells you they don't lie about everything?Prove it.As much as anything can be, it has. I quoted the sources. This statement makes no sense. First, because no one has no bias. Second, (if I understand your unclear sentence construction) you are saying that no matter how accurate a source may be, you will not accept it if the person quoting the source is, in your estimation, biased. This is of course an ad hominem logical fallacy. No matter how biased someone is, you have to contend with the source itself. As a clarifying example, imagine a scenario where someone is against the idea of going outside for some reason. If they say "look out the window, the sky is full of dark clouds, it's going to rain", that may be a true statement. You can look outside and see that there are, indeed, rainclouds. The fact that the person who pointed them out is biased doesn't mean they aren't there. Which isn't the same thing as going on the word of a biased person. For example, in the same scenario, if you coudln't look out the window yourself, you would probably not believe the biased person's assertion that there are stormclouds. In this situation, what you are doing is the equivalent of looking out the window and refusing to believe your eyes, because the person who told you about the weather was biased. You are completely misunderstanding source validity and bias.Well, so long as you're feeling better. If you get more paranoid thoughts I suggest you keep them to yourself.

Clarification- the organizations cited are anti-abortion lobbying associations, not "medical organizations".The Breast Cancer Prevention Institute, which despite it's professional-sounding moniker, only seems to focus on on possible breast cancer avoidance strategy- anti-abortion. All of their fact sheets are related to abortion, all their resources are about abortion, including booklets and brochures, videos, etc. Clearly this is an organization with a single agenda.Same for the "Polycarp Institute", whose only medical subjects covered were "Breast Cancer & Abortion, Breast Cancer & Oral Contraceptives, Postfertilization Effect of Emergency Contraception, Postfertilization Effect of Oral Contraceptives".National Physicians Center for Family Resources, the Catholic Medical Association, the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, are all right-wing, anti-abortion organizations.Also, the 'news source' for the article you posted, you should clarify, has a clear anti-abortion bias. WorldNetDaily.com a right-wing Christian news board, also offers such news items as "SPECIAL OFFER: When will Jesus return? Plug into ultimate prophecy."About the content of the abortion-breast cancer link-Breast Cancer Action, Newsletter #71–May/June 2002the American Cancer Society has this to say-The National Cancer Institute explains the results of this conference-Empirical scientific review of the data put forth by anti-abortion organizations finds it to be without merit.

Here's support for the abortion - breast cancer link.This site has links to five medical organizations which recognize the link between abortion and breast cancer, an explantion for what causes the link, as well as the number of studies in support of the link, and the number which don't support it.http://www.abortionbreastcancer.com/edited to add this article(from abortionbreastcancer.com) :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------MATTERS OF LIFE AND DEATHAbortion doctor caves in lawsuitSettlement given to patient for not warning about breast-cancer risk--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Posted: October 23, 20031:00 a.m. EasternBy Diana Lynne© 2003 WorldNetDaily.com A Pennsylvania woman has won a landmark victory in her malpractice suit against an abortion provider and a New Jersey women's center, which anti-abortion advocates hail as a triumph in their efforts to expose a decades-old medical cover-up. On the eve of trial last Friday, Dr. Charles Benjamin and the Cherry Hill Women's Center in Cherry Hill, N.J., agreed to settle claims it violated parental-consent law and failed to inform its then-17-year-old patient about the emotional and physical risks of abortion – including increased risk of breast cancer. When the plaintiff, who goes by the fictitious name of "Sarah," got pregnant at the age of 16, her high-school guidance counselor facilitated her second-trimester abortion at the New Jersey clinic across the Delaware River without her parents' knowledge. New Jersey was chosen because it has no parental-consent laws regarding abortions for minors. The girl's home state of Pennsylvania, however, requires the consent of at least one parent. Sarah's parents successfully sued the high school in a separate lawsuit for violating their 14th Amendment rights to raise their child without interference by the public school. While the New Jersey clinic and provider cannot be criminally prosecuted for violating Pennsylvania law, they can be taken to task in the civil arena. This lawsuit makes it possible for the abortion providers to be sued for battery. "This case establishes abortion clinics can't escape civil penalties by aborting for kids from other states when they know the state where they come from has parental-consent statute," Sarah's attorney Joseph P. Stanton told WorldNetDaily. Abortion clinics in no-consent states like New Jersey and Illinois are known "dumping grounds" for abortions by out-of-state minors, say anti-abortion advocates. According to Stanton's statistics, an average of 43 women from Pennsylvania travel to New Jersey every month to have abortions. Ten of those are teens, some as young as 12. Stanton said one New Jersey clinic routinely promotes its "no parental consent" services in advertising to minors in Pennsylvania. Sarah is said to have suffered tremendously since having her abortion. Attorney Susan Marie Gertz, executive director of the Women's Injury Network, the national charity that covered Sarah's case expenses, reports she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress syndrome following the abortion. Gertz applauded the undisclosed settlement, which was based on Sarah's need for medical monitoring for early detection of breast cancer. Doctors estimated that cost to be $2,500 annually. The settlement also includes funding to cover future psychological counseling. "Abortion malpractice lawsuits help expose the deceptive practices of the abortion industry and hold doctors legally and financially accountable to the women they've harmed," Gertz said in a statement. Opened in 1978, the Cherry Hill Women's Center bills itself as "a safe place to make an important decision." According to its website, a specialized group of medical care providers help make the center "one of New Jersey's leading ambulatory surgical centers for women's health." A call for comment from the center's administrator was not returned, and Benjamin was unavailable. Proponents of the abortion-breast cancer link, known as the ABC link, also cheered the settlement, the first associated with the ABC link recorded in the U.S. Two others have been reached in Australia. "This settlement will teach the medical establishment that it can no longer profit by keeping women in the dark about the breast cancer risk," said Karen Malec, president of the Coalition on Abortion/Breast Cancer.

There's probably about the same amount of risk in walking down any busy street and inhaling the fumes from passing cars.But on the other hand, if she carries out the pregnancy, she is way more likely to develop other conditions, like osteoperosis.

I didn't mean to argue against abortion on the basis that it causes cancer, although I realize that it must seem that way. I saw that Mizmaxx was arguing with Parcum about it, and decided to join in, since I had just read an article about it.My arguement is that abortion is morally wrong - unless the woman's life is at stake. I beleieve that the unborn child is a human being and has the right to life, just like us. Also, I beleive in informed choice. The woman deserves to know if there are risks involved. Otherwise, its not really pro-choice, is it?

Then, you have to realize that of all the things in the world that might give someone cancer, having an abortion is probably the least of her worries?There are many risks to having an abortion- sterility and even death might result, but just like cancer, the odds of any of these are very low. There's probably about the same amount of risk in walking down any busy street and inhaling the fumes from passing cars.But on the other hand, if she carries out the pregnancy, she is way more likely to develop other conditions, like osteoperosis.

Well, unfortunately, I can't access the rest of the article in the NEJM. All I can access are the first few sentences. However, I think it speaks for itself that the only people who believe there to be any A-BC link are anti-abortionists- none of the Cancer Societies or Medical organizations find there to be any merit to the idea whatsoever.

I didn't mean to argue against abortion on the basis that it causes cancer, although I realize that it must seem that way. I saw that Mizmaxx was arguing with Parcum about it, and decided to join in, since I had just read an article about it.My arguement is that abortion is morally wrong - unless the woman's life is at stake. I beleieve that the unborn child is a human being and has the right to life, just like us. Also, I beleive in informed choice. The woman deserves to know if there are risks involved. Otherwise, its not really pro-choice, is it?

I'm with you.If pro-choice means phisically killing a living being, then it's not pro-life. If your ideology causes death and killing for the sake of pro-choice, then you really are pro-death.Suppose that if the entire wold would accept the idea of pro-choice and allows abortions, even FORCES abortions, then in some time population will shrink, and people will just die out. Unless they come back to sences and repent and stop abortion. So on the global scale pro-choice is pro-death.

How can you think that a baby that isn't born yet a nonentity?yeah im only 15 and yet i know that what "abortionist's" say is a load of XXXX!! I feel sorry for you when i get older because im determined with all my heart to stop abortion! I believe God put me on this earth to stop you people from killing his creation! Hear my words i hate liberals and i will never change my mind about abortion. I try to love everyone but it's hard for me to love somebody who kills and innocent child.I am pro life!

This is a nonsence. Ok, you flush the ovum in the toilet - do you kill a child? NO!!! Because if you put it in a jar it will NOT become a baby in 9 months, whatever chemistry you put in the jar. It's just baby talk.It's attached to the Body and it's life is supported by the Body, but it's not a part of the body. It is quite independant even inside the womb. How can you have a Rhesus factor conflict with something that's a part of your body???It's not attacking people. It's attacking the idea, the concept, the worldview. I would not attack such a person EVER, because I DO know that they go through pain and guilt that follows them forever. Yeah, a teenage girl made a mistake, and wasn't ready to be a parent (and even more so her teenage boyfriend). This is still wrong, but I take it as their mistake, and I do know this girl will never forget this. I have pity, sympathy and compassion for this girl, and sure for the unborn baby as well.But some people who do abortions (I mean women, not doctors) do it on a regular basis, like brushing teeth or something, and they totally believe it's okay. Well this I can't accept, and in such case I don't have sympathy. I actually feel that such person is a murdeder and deserves punishment.

Ever been pregnant? Women have abortions for many reasons. I doubt you could possibly understand. However, if "loving homes" abounded I think less women would be forced to make the hard decision of having an abortion.Perhaps you should concentrate your efforts on creating loving homes. I think it would be a more efficient use of your time.

You are wrong and you don't know what you are talking about.We don't condemn people, and we don't have to judge in a way a court judge says that a person is guilty, because true, we are all guilty in some ways, but we can make judgments. We as christians know moral Right and Wrong, and we can judge what is morally right and what is morally wrong. I believe that stealing is wrong. Do I judge the guy who steals? No, It's a job of the court judge. Do I send him to hell? No, That's God's job. I just say that what he did was wrong. Does it make sence?

Margaret Sanger, founder of Planned Parenthood:"The most merciful thing that the large family does to one of its infant members is to kill it." -- Women and the New Race (New York: Brentano's, 1920) "We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population." -- Linda Gordon, Woman's Body, Woman's Right: Social History of Birth Control in America (New York, Grossman Publishers, 1976) p. 333. Sanger considered Blacks, Hispanics, and others to be "human weeds" and "a menace to civilization". Sanger herself proposed that dysgenic groups (those with "bad genes") be given their choice of sterilization or lifelong segregation (work camps). Margaret Sanger, Plan for Peace, Birth Control Review (April 1932), p. 107. -notice that these quotes are sited and are very simple to look up if you don't believe me. If you read these quotes and still disagree with Sanger being racist and a eugenicist then I have a real problem with your credibility in these debates.

I'm fifteen too, yet I share a completely different view of abortion. I think it's due to how we were brought up. I'm Jewish, and Judaism tells us that a baby isn't really a baby until the second that it's born and is breathing. I'm told that Christianity believes that a child become a child as soon as conception occurs. The fact that you won't hear what other's have to say about abortion is scary. You're closing your mind and becoming ignorant. You might want to try opening up your mind a little before you decide. We're both fifteen and have awhile to decide what believe in. I think it's great that you're so passionate about what you believe in, but don't close your mind up so tight that you can't listen to what other's have to say.

One should also be open minded with respect to one's religion as well, and I would think hard about the view that life begins right at conception, but I would think much, much harder about the view that a baby is not really a baby until it is born and breathing.

hey numbskull- the word is pregnantyour little statement displays such ignorance I can't beleive I am replying, but before you proclaim they rip off a child's limbs and cause trauma to your life, at least educate yourself on the matter. The gross majority of abortions performed are during the first few months, in which the fetus has not yet developed limbs, you might be talking about partial birth abortion, which has been characterized as abortion performed after the first trimester, although in many of these instances, it is the same procedure as the first kind I mentioned. To be exact, the type of abortion in which a child's limbs are "ripped off" for years has only been permitted in dire medical need, but because of people like you, this has recently been outlawed , meaning you take more consideration for the life of the unborn than that of the mother. Shameful. You also calim that an abortion causes trauma to your life- do you mean emotional trauma? In that case, I suggest you show a little compassion for these women, If you are talking about physical trauma, that is increased severely when you make the procedure illegal and women are forced to go to unclean and often inept "doctors" often causing serious complications and even death.

Astronomyfan -- Thank you for sharing your opinion with us. It seems that you are lumping a lot together for which it appears you may not have a solid foundation of understanding. The belief that an 'evolutionist' (who may also be Christian, BTW) or an atheist does not truly know "morals and ethics" has no basis in reality. Perhaps these individuals do not see things from the same perspective that you see them from, but that does not mean they cannot believe there is a standard for morality. Additionally, the statement that an atheist has no real respect for life also has no basis. I happen to know an atheist who has a much greater respect for life (in my opinion) than many Christians that I know.If you believe that evolution is the 'wrong' view of our history, then I encourage you to start a post in the 'Creation vs Evolution' forum that states the reasoning for this belief. If you have any evidence that supports the idea of a literal interpretation of Genesis, I encourage you to post it there.Consider the possibility that the view you hold of God is not the only possible view of God (assuming that an all-powerful God exists). It is entirely possible that your view of God is not even close to the way God is in reality. (Don't worry, God still loves us all anyway!)Anyway, for whatever it's worth... I encourage you to keep an open mind to hearing the Truth, rather than believing you already have the Truth all figured out.Peace,The Bootfitter

I'm afraid this is also untrue. People who do not believe in a god or your god can hold "absolute" moral standards. They just won't necessarily be the same as yours. For example, I have very set moral standards. I am very much in opposition to Christian morality, but my values are no less "absolute". I would say the main way my morality differs from a Christian morality, aside from our specific views which tend to be opposed, is that I believe that although certain actions in certain contexts are very clearly good or bad, I don't believe that an action itself outside any context is good or bad, neither do I believe that people themselves are good or bad. For example, if you were to ask me if I believed violence was wrong, I would say that it depends on the context. If you were to ask me if I felt Matthew Shepard's torture and murder was wrong, I would say "yes" absolutely.I think you are confusing the two; having unswerving, absolute moral values and having absolutist and reductivist moral values.

It makes perfect sense. I lie somewhere in the middle I suppose. I don't believe that a child is instantaneously a child as soon as conception occurs, but I wouldn't be able to go nine months without thinking of the potential person (if nothing goes wrong) inside me isn't really a person. When does it become a person? Aside from religion, how are we to decide when a baby is really a baby? Is it at conception or is it at some point between conception and nine months later? I've never been pregnant, so I don't know when a mother starts thinking of their child as a child. For me, the line separating a simple fetus and a child is hazy.

You are right that it is not easy to resolve the issue of when an embryo or fetus is a human. At conception, it does have all the genetic materials needed, but it lacks development. At a few weeks it has a heart beat and brain wave, but it takes a while longer before the fetus looks just like a baby. There is continuous developement with no obvious points that say decisively, "Now you are a human."But one idea that makes me hesistate to be pro-choice is an analogy. Imagine a hunter who sees something moving behind a bush. It could be a deer, it could be a human, or it could be something else. The hunter lacks the information to know for sure what is behind the bush. What is the ethical policy for a hunter in this situation? It seems clear to me: if you are not sure it's not human, don't kill it.

So if it's not human, we can kill it? But I dare say that's a different topic completely. Sorry, that was more along animal rights than abortion. Abortion is this for me: If the baby is going to endanger the mother's life as well as the baby, why endanger the baby and the mother? Sticking on the decided path, would you rather kill something you know is human, or something that you're not sure is human. It sounds a bit cruel and I didn't intend it to be that way at all.

This topic is one which seems to divide the majority of us into 2 very distinct camps. I'd have to say I fall in the middle though. Each case of an abortion should be individually asessed as to whether it is legal or not. I can accept an abortion being legal if a woman has been raped, sexually assaulted etc, where the conception of the fetus was not consentual. I couldn't possibly face a woman and tell her she must give birth to a baby whos father was the person that raped her. The emotional scarring of a crime such as rape can be extreme, but to force the woman to carry the fetus for 9 months and give birth? That, I belive, is impossible to ask. As for a woman who consents to, in most cases, unprotected sex, I don't believe an abortion should be legal. What ever happend to one taking responsibility for their own actions? In countries such as America and Australia, the father of a baby is forced to pay child support (Or so I've come to believe from watching Maury Povich and Jenny Jones), as well as other financial benefits being available. These factors, in my opinion, dispel the theory of not being able to "afford" a child. Abortion should not be used in cases where a woman enteres into consentual sex, and were either too lazy or didn't use their common sense to A) Use a contraceptive themselves or B) Not sleep with a man unless they use a condom.I have this belief this for the simple reason that abortion should only be used as a procedure to remove fetuses from rape victims. By only allowing an abortion for rape victims, the stigmatism associated with abortion could also disappear as people would immediately know and understand why an abortion is allowed to take place.Reading through many of the responses here, religion is noted throughout the debate. Personally, i think a law should not be passed because a particular religion says that it is wrong, for the simple fact that not everyone follows one religion. Laws should be passed on what is believed to be socially desirable at that point in time, not what a book written thousands of years ago says. To use the arguement of religion is pointless becasue the people you argue against do not belive in your God, let alone what that God has to say.*As a side note, do the anti-abortion writers on the forum also oppose contraception?

Child support owed does not mean child support paid. If the father is not working there is no income to be paid. Support amounts are frequently based on how much the father can pay, not how much is needed, leaving the mother to figure out how to get ends to meet. In many cases the father simply does not pay. My ex is suppose to give me 25% of his income, I have never seen one thin dime. And as he is "who knows where" there is nothing that the state I live in can do.And there is far more to parenting than money. A few hundred bucks a month is fine, but more precious is a positive male role model, a father who spends time - who also participates in doctors appointments, makes lunches, cares for the sniffles, attends recitals, kisses away tears, does fun things, helps with homework, disciplines. The work involved is immense. I know, I do it every day alone. And although I would never trade it for the world, and there is adoption as an option for someone unwilling to be a parent, your perception that a bit of cash will make bringing up a kid suddenly easy is extremely naive.Also - this is not a diss to all men. There are many wonderful fathers out there. This is only about dead-beat dads.What about incest and life/health of the mother?

I just hope that you curb some of that anger as you grow and mature. God would not want you to carry such anger around your entire life, would He?

How can you think that a baby that isn't born yet a nonentity?yeah im only 15 and yet i know that what "abortionist's" say is a load of XXXX!! I feel sorry for you when i get older because im determined with all my heart to stop abortion! I believe God put me on this earth to stop you people from killing his creation! Hear my words i hate liberals and i will never change my mind about abortion. I try to love everyone but it's hard for me to love somebody who kills and innocent child.I am pro life!

Can I jump in here?Intresting point Lady Q, and I agree somewhat. Let's tell them in love that they can't do this, that they're killing babies.....not hate. For what did Christ say, that he who hate's his brother has already killed him in his heart, and is guilty of sin? So let's be calm about this.....The only way that I would ever agree to alow abortioni, would be if the mothers life is at stake.....and even then I wouldn't believe it would be right. (The mother would be taking the cowards way out, sacraficing her baby so that she has a larger chance of living...cowardly)As for abortion in case of incest, I think that's rediculous. You know your not supposed to be doing that, and now you have to live with teh consequences. There's no easy way out. Tough luck.In any other case - well, you've been saturated with using a condom and birth control for the last couple decades! If you haven't gotton the point, and you have an unplanned pregnancy, well sorry, you've made a bad decision.....live with it.

How incredibly insensitive of you. How about the case that she has to "sacrafice" the fetus so she has *a* chance of living?A young girl doesn't really have a lot of choice against her older and bigger father, now does she? Not exactly rape, but not exactly consensual either.Do the crime, do the time, eh? I'm sorry, sex is *not* a crime, and pregnancy isn't, and shouldn't be, considered a punishment for anything.

[QUOTE=jitobear] And although I would never trade it for the world, and there is adoption as an option for someone unwilling to be a parent, your perception that a bit of cash will make bringing up a kid suddenly easy is extremely naive.QUOTE]I'm not sure where you came to the conclusion that I was saying that. I've read through the replies and some mention a mother not being able to financially afford a child. What I said in reply to that arguement was that child support should be paid, which in your case is not (sorry to hear), and other financial benefits for single low-income mothers are also available. This is what occurs in Australia and our social security system, is it the same in the US?I come from a family where a single parnet was forced to raise 3 children on her own, so I belive the arguement of not being able to financially afford a child is ludicrous. I can understand what you are saying, it is still difficult even with a little financial security, but you misunderstood the point i was trying to get across in my post. As for incest and life/health of the mother, yes I agree that abortion should be an option. My views on abortion are not fully set in stone as yet and are still being formed. Basically, I belive that abortion should not become a procedure where someone has unprotected sex thinking, "It's ok ill just poop down to outpatients and get an abortion." It's abusing a method which I believe should only be allowed in certain situations.

Child support owed does not mean child support paid. If the father is not working there is no income to be paid. Support amounts are frequently based on how much the father can pay, not how much is needed, leaving the mother to figure out how to get ends to meet. In many cases the father simply does not pay. My ex is suppose to give me 25% of his income, I have never seen one thin dime. And as he is "who knows where" there is nothing that the state I live in can do.And there is far more to parenting than money. A few hundred bucks a month is fine, but more precious is a positive male role model, a father who spends time - who also participates in doctors appointments, makes lunches, cares for the sniffles, attends recitals, kisses away tears, does fun things, helps with homework, disciplines. The work involved is immense. I know, I do it every day alone. And although I would never trade it for the world, and there is adoption as an option for someone unwilling to be a parent, your perception that a bit of cash will make bringing up a kid suddenly easy is extremely naive.Also - this is not a diss to all men. There are many wonderful fathers out there. This is only about dead-beat dads.What about incest and life/health of the mother?

To Mizmaxx:People who believe in a different god (s), may have "absolute morals" if it is written in their holy book. But for those who do not believe in a god do not have "absolute morals". They do not have some "higher" supernatural being who sets the rules, who sets the absolutes. The atheist gets to choose what they believe to be right and wrong, and hence, this is moral relativity. Every person has their own levels of morality, in other words what may seem right to one person may not necessarly be right to another one. But if there is a God out there, using the God of the Bible as an example, He has set the "absolutes" via the Ten Commandments. So He has told us what is morally right and morally wrong. If there is no God, then everyone gets to choose themselves how high or low their ethics and morals are.I think that you are missing the entire point that I was originally trying to make: * People + Higher supernatural being who sets the rules = absolute morality. God sets the rules and morality that govern everyone.* People + No supernatural being who sets the rules = relativity morality. People set the rules of morality that govern themselves. There is no "absolute" morality that applies to everyone, hence, relative.
attacks
I'm afraid this is also untrue. People who do not believe in a god or your god can hold "absolute" moral standards. They just won't necessarily be the same as yours. For example, I have very set moral standards. I am very much in opposition to Christian morality, but my values are no less "absolute". I would say the main way my morality differs from a Christian morality, aside from our specific views which tend to be opposed, is that I believe that although certain actions in certain contexts are very clearly good or bad, I don't believe that an action itself outside any context is good or bad, neither do I believe that people themselves are good or bad. For example, if you were to ask me if I believed violence was wrong, I would say that it depends on the context. If you were to ask me if I felt Matthew Shepard's torture and murder was wrong, I would say "yes" absolutely.I think you are confusing the two; having unswerving, absolute moral values and having absolutist and reductivist moral values.

The case you cite of the mother's life being endangered is an argument to keep abortion legal, and it is easy to see why. The truth though is that more than 95% of abortions have nothing to do with life or death, or things like rape or incest, but are done because the female is not married, or the father is not in her life, or she feels she is too poor, or does not want a child now, or has all the children she wants, things like that. Any discussion of abortion should recognize that these are the circumstances for the vast majority of cases.
attacks
So if it's not human, we can kill it? But I dare say that's a different topic completely. Sorry, that was more along animal rights than abortion. Abortion is this for me: If the baby is going to endanger the mother's life as well as the baby, why endanger the baby and the mother? Sticking on the decided path, would you rather kill something you know is human, or something that you're not sure is human. It sounds a bit cruel and I didn't intend it to be that way at all. It's just that one loss would hard enough, why make it two?

Astronomyfan -- Consider that even your first example does not equate to absolute morality. Because you could take two different sets of people with two different supernatural beings that they each believe exist, and there is the possibility for two different standards of morality. So, which one is the 'absolute morality' of which you speak?

Good point the bootfitter! emoticonXEmbarrassed I must commend you! I didn't even pick up on my own appearent contradiction! Fine, I'll rephase it. Let us just say that we have a group of people who practice "X" religion and a group of people who practice "Y" religion. For the people of X, they believe that their god is the only god and if their book says anything about standards of morality and what they should be, those standards of morality they would consider to be absolute. Now the same thing would happen for the people of Y. In this case you would be right, the morals would be absolute for that certain group of people, but relative to eachother.But if there is only one God, than there must only be one set of rules! I don't really want to take this to the extent of saying which God is the only true one, but I have my opinion as others have their own opinion. So to avoid any rather nasty replies we will say that this one true God is "P". Than that means that "P" has absolute authority and sets the absolutes. Even though X and Y don't believe in P they will be accountable to P when they die and will be judged according to P's absolutes and authority. No matter what others think, P will always have absolute authority and morality set in stone.Can you get what I'm talking about? Even though people may believe in different God (s), if there is only one God (as indeed I'm convinced that there is) than there is only one set of absolute morals and rules that comes from that one true God and covers and applies to all humans, no matter what they believe - even though they may not acknowledge that. I didn't make that very clear in my original message. Once agin, sorry about the inconvenience !astronomyfan87.

I find myself frequently pausing to witness the hypocrisy exhibited by people who proudly call themselves "Christian" but who clearly have no inhibitions about excluding others rather than including, and judging rather than accepting.

Yes, I have heard of adoption, and I encourage a woman's consideration of it when she is faced with this very difficult situation. But I also realize that not all women are comfortable with the idea of it, some women are afraid that they would not be able to part with a child after the bonding experience of pregnancy, beyond that, perhaps they are afraid their child would end up with the wrong people, people, perhaps like you, who lack an open mind! Selfish, you say? perhaps selfish would be the one who expects the rest of the world to adhere to their beliefs and ideas. Perhaps selfish is the one who is too concerned with some preconcieved notion to have compassion for their fellow being. The truth is, the law still stands that it is legal for a woman to choose, another truth is that the God you mention has repeatedly warned you against judging others.In response to your last sentence, I pray that the Buddha's wisdom will find a home within your MIND- my heart is not cold, it is quite warm I am sure, but it is merely a pump and nothing more.

To krissi:Not everyone is like that. We are all human, we make mistakes. It is in our nature. Just try not to be stereotypical though. Many Christians are kind and good people. Don't let a few spoil their reputation. If you want an example of a true man of God, take William Booth (the founder of the Salvation Army) for example. He took the "down and outers" (bums, drunkards, prostitutes, etc) of society into his Church, while many of the other Churches wouldn't take them. He was accepting of everyone. Another man of God is "Fighting" McKenzie. He stayed with his troops in WWI and saw many to the Kingdom of God. He risked his life for many and even went into the "storming of the enemy trench" runs with his ANZAC unit and mates. Fully trusting in God. An amazing man. You to are also being judgemental of Christians.

Which, by the way, could be considered to fall under 'moral relativism' on a macro scale.This assumes that there IS a God. It also assumes that there is only ONE God. It also assumes that this one God is concerned with the dual concepts of right and wrong and sets these concepts in stone. If all of these assumptions are true, then your conclusion may be accurate. Operating under these assumptions, it's easy to conclude that there is a universal and absolute morality. However, you only BELIEVE that these assumptions are true... You may believe it with all your heart that they are true, but you cannot KNOW. That's the uniqueness of faith. It requires acceptance of something without any way of knowing for certain whether it's true.Not everyone makes these same assumptions. And consider that if any of your assumptions do not reflect reality, then there may not be any absolute standards of morality.Of course I get it! :p And even though you are convinced there is only one God with one set of absolute morals that applies to all humans, this may not reflect reality -- no matter what you believe and whether or not you acknowledge that.Do you yet see how there can be more than one perspective regarding the issue? Accepting that there are multiple perspectives acknowledges that IF there is an absolute 'right' and an absolute 'wrong,' then you may be absolutely wrong!

Wow, that's a perfect reason right there, I'm impressed. Are you saying that the only kids adopted are white? If that's the case, you need to go outside and talk to more people, because I now a great deal of "colored" people who were adopted. "Sorry kid, the limit to the line is 100 and you're number 101 and WHITE so... sorry." It's so sickening it's beautiful. Are there bouncers that decide who gets to come into the world?
attacks
AwwwPoor people unwilling to adopt a child who isn't a healthy, white newborn.There are thousands upon thousands of kids stuck in the adoption system. We don't need more in there.

In my opinion - abortion should continue for victims of rape, sexual abuse, disability risks (erm I mean brain damage anything that means that the child would not be able to think in any way) because in my opinion this could lead to abuse from 'able-minded' people. I agree that there has been lots of 'sex education' and most people should be aware that there are contraceptives out there and unwanted pregencies should not easily take place. AND if you do forget a condom then there is always the morning after pill. There are also people who want children but shouldn't be allowed them. Peadophiles etc. These children are sometimes then taken into care where they are subject to even more abuse. Some people choose to adopt for sick fantasies etc. If I was pregnant but I suffered depression or something that may affect the way I brought up the child and then the child may be taken from me then maybe abortion is a way of protection? I'm not sure having never been in the situation where I have had to consider abortion - maybe sometimes you have to be there to know what thoughts go through a persons head. There are also many people who wish to adopt but because 'the authorities' say they can't then another child goes without a stable family. Some families that are turned down for adoption are perfectly fit and would make fantastic parents - again I have not been in this situation either. Perhaps it would be worth watching a film called 'IF THESE WALLS COULD TALK' - there are actually two of these films - one is about abortion and the other is about gay issues. The gay issues one discusses IVF treatment because adoption is out of the question for lesbian couples who actually would make great parents. If anyone has watched these films you may be able to explain what I mean better than I can. It's a tough subject for those involved directly and also those around watching on - but who gives a total outsider the right to make a decision for the family actually involved. If I was pregnant and considered an abortion - what would give 'prolife' or anyone the right to say what is right for me? I thought that we could make decisions ourselves? If given the right information, the pro's and the con's then surely if we are prepared to listen and take both sides in we can form the right decision depending on situation?I hope that all makes sense - sorry if I have missed a point or interrupted a thread.

But until it can live independently of the mother's body, it is a part of her body. I've yet to meet a person who has had an abortion who did not find the experience traumatic and had to grieve the loss. It is a terrible thing. Attacking people who go through that tragedy is cruel and misplaced.

I notice this concern for unadopted kids and I wonder if this concern ends at the color line.

I don't believe that you've had an opportunity to live through illegal abortion times...Abortion is not something that you can stop with a law. People still have abortions, just not safe, legal ones. More people die with illegal abortions than when abortions are legal...not only the fetus, but the mother sometimes dies as well.

I think Monty Python's work is satirical in nature.

Freedom_Fighter, I'm well aware of Monty Python's nature of work. I believe that is what CCR1994 was referencing when he quoted mizmaxx's posting from 11-3-03. No need to shake your finger of scolding at me. Also, what exactly would a man who masterbates be lusting after? Lust itself is not a noun, so it can't be the act itself. People tend to lust after something or someone. Now, maybe the attempt to draw this conversation away from the religious ilk was lost somewhere. I would hazzard that many of those who oppose abortion do so due to a religious belief system.

Just checking ;) According to Merriam-Webster lust is both a noun and a verb.Main Entry: 1lust Pronunciation: 'l&stFunction: nounEtymology: Middle English, from Old English; akin to Old High German lust pleasure and perhaps to Latin lascivus wanton1 obsolete a : PLEASURE, DELIGHT b : personal inclination : WISH2 : usually intense or unbridled sexual desire : LASCIVIOUSNESS3 a : an intense longing : CRAVING b : ENTHUSIASM, EAGERNESS Main Entry: 2lustFunction: intransitive verb: to have an intense desire or need : CRAVE; specifically : to have a sexual urge An unfortunate fact of the abortion debate is that other arguments besides religionous beliefs get passed over.

Freedom_Fighter, I'm well aware of Monty Python's nature of work. I believe that is what CCR1994 was referencing when he quoted mizmaxx's posting from 11-3-03. No need to shake your finger of scolding at me. Also, what exactly would a man who masterbates be lusting after? Lust itself is not a noun, so it can't be the act itself. People tend to lust after something or someone. Now, maybe the attempt to draw this conversation away from the religious ilk was lost somewhere. I would hazzard that many of those who oppose abortion do so due to a religious belief system.

Has it been suggested that masturbation is also the destruction of life? Of course the Catholic Church doesn't like it. They want their followers to "go forth and multiply" and multiply and multiply and multiply. No birth control either. And swear to raise all the kids Catholic. Obviously, they simply want to increase the number of Catholics. In my view, the Catholic Church is not the place to look for advice. They have an agenda - and not necessarily salvation.

the only problem here is that there are too many different situations to generalize, and to set a law will be to generalize the entire population of women who have, or are waiting for an aborition, so the only solution is to have a set of circumstance law. example below. 1. is the woman under 18? (go to 'a' if yes, 'b' if no)a. how old is the young woman, and did the parents know?b. was there protection used? if so, what percent of accuracy was the product?my theroy is that this, and only this, is the way abortion will work, because its not exactly a compromise, so no one is giving up any terms so both sides of the arguement are happy.ps, prolife, im also 15. the only diff betwen u an me is that i think bout who im ****** off at before i start blindly defending my case.

A source from a bliblical college? are you KIDDING? One word: bias. say it with me - BIAS.PASS is not recognised by any independent psychological health committee. It's a propoganda lie.Why don't you see this:"Low risk of psychological harm. Well-designed studies of psychological responses following abortion have consistently shown that risk of psychological harm is low. Some women experience psychological dysfunction following abortion, but post-abortion rates of distress and dysfunction are lower than pre-abortion rates. Moreover, the percentage of women who experience clinically relevant distress is small and appears to be no greater than in general samples of women of reproductive age. A recent study showed not only that rates of disorders, such as depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), were not elevated in a large sample of 442 women followed for two years post-abortion, but also that the incidence of PTSD was actually lower in women post-abortion than the rate in the general population (Adler et al., 2002).Positive functioning and educational attainment two years later. A study of adolescent abortion followed 360 adolescents over two years after they had been interviewed when seeking a pregnancy test. Some had a negative pregnancy test, some were pregnant and carried to term, and some were pregnant and aborted their pregnancy. The adolescents who chose abortion showed significant drops in anxiety and significant increases in self esteem and internal control in the period immediately following the abortion to two years later. They appeared to be functioning as well as, or even better than, adolescents who had a negative pregnancy test or had carried to term. They were also most likely to have higher economic well-being; most likely to be in high school (and performing at grade level) or to have graduated; and less likely to have a subsequent pregnancy (Zabin, Hirsch, & Emerson, 1989).Psychological measures within normal range. Available data show that mean scores on psychological measures are well within normal bounds for minors as well as for adults who have undergone an abortion. The data do not suggest that legal minors are at heightened risk of serious adverse psychological responses compared with adults following an abortion or with peers who have not undergone an abortion (Zabin et al., 1989).Positive emotions more often experienced. Freely chosen legal abortion, particularly in the first trimester, has not been found to be associated with severe psychological trauma, despite the fact that it occurs in the stressful context of unwanted pregnancy. The time of greatest stress is before the abortion. A woman’s emotional responses after experiencing an unwanted pregnancy terminated by abortion are complex and may involve a combination of positive and negative emotions. Positive emotions are more often experienced, and they are experienced more strongly than negative emotions, both immediately after the abortion and during the months following it (Russo & Zierk, 1992).Higher risk for psychopathology if pre-existing emotional problems. While there is little risk for severe post-abortion psychopathology for women in general, it is important to recognize that some women, particularly those with pre-existing emotional problems, are at higher risk for negative emotional responses after abortion due to their individual history than are other women (Russo & Zierk, 1992).Effects of stress are relative. Abortion may be a stressful experience, however, it may also reduce the stress resulting from an unwanted pregnancy and from the events that led to the pregnancy being unwanted. The effects of abortion cannot be separated from the effects of the experience of unwanted pregnancy and from the effects of the context in which the pregnancy occurred (Russo & Zierk, 1992). Circumstances must be taken into account. In studying responses to abortion, one needs to take into account the circumstances of the conception, as well as those following conception. If the conception is planned, the resulting pregnancy is likely to be wanted. However, changing circumstances (e.g., separation from one’s partner or adverse results of genetic testing) may cause an initially planned, intended, and wanted conception to become an unwanted pregnancy. The circumstances leading to this change may themselves be sources of stress and distress, and should be taken into account in evaluating a woman’s response following abortion. That is, in some cases, it is the unwanted pregnancy that is the source of stress, not necessarily the abortion (Adler, 1992).Poor social outcomes often arise for unwanted children, especially of teenage mothers. Unintended and unwanted childbearing has been linked with a variety of social problems, including divorce, poverty, child abuse, and juvenile delinquency. One study found that unwanted children were less likely to have a secure family life. As adults, they were more likely to engage in criminal behavior, be on welfare, and receive psychiatric services. Another study found that children who were unintended by their mothers had lower self esteem than their intended peers 23 years later. Research has shown that social and psychological problems persist, partially because the mothers are themselves from disadvantaged backgrounds with poor prospects for future education and employment. Children born to teenage mothers are more likely to have lower achievement scores, poorer school adjustment, and more problem behaviors than children born to older women (Russo & David, 2002).Negative outcomes persist in the best of circumstances. Longitudinal research has found that when abortion is denied, the resulting children are more likely to have a variety of social and psychological problems -- even when they are born to adult women who are healthy with intact marriages and adequate economic resources (Russo & David, 2002).

Post Abortive Stress Syndrome (PASS) (http://www.boundless.org/2000/features/a0000230.html)"Standard PTSD is a psychological dysfunction that often comes from threats or experiences of physical injury, sexual violation, and the witnessing of or participating in a violent death. It's the same as the "shell-shock" that veterans go through. The trauma makes the victim's defense mechanisms soar out of control. They take on a life of their own and cause alterations in personality and behavior. In technical terms, the results are hyper-arousal (extreme sensitivity, nervous agitation, sleeplessness, constant alert to danger); intrusion (the bad experience breaks into ordinary life, often in the form of nightmares) and constriction (inability to reach out to others and express emotions). The trauma in PASS comes from the pressure to abort from boyfriends or family, the anxiety over choosing the abortion, the physical pain of the procedure (despite anesthesia!) and, most obviously, guilt once the abortion has been performed. Some women have even said that an abortion feels like rape — a sexual violation performed by a complete stranger causing extraordinary pain. PASS is particularly virulent in women who have had chemical abortions, because these abortions produce a complete, perfect and dead child. One study found that at least 19 percent of women who have had abortions suffer from some form of PASS. In all likelihood, the rate is actually higher, because these studies have high drop-out rates — and generally from the women who suffer the most intensely. Dr. Wanda Franz, testifying before a congressional hearing on the impact of abortion in March of 1989, summarized the syndrome by saying that women "report horrible nightmares of children calling them from trash cans, of body parts and of blood ... they re-experienced it [the abortion] with terrible psychological pain ... they feel worthless and victimized because they failed at the most natural of human activities — the role of being a mother." It doesn't stop there. There are reports of sexual dysfunction, both of extreme revulsion to sex and extreme promiscuity. Many women contemplate suicide and a fair number of those attempt it; studies in England and Finland identify a definite link between abortion and suicide. Smoking, drinking and drug use all increase after abortions, as do eating disorders. Post-abortive women are more prone to divorce and chronic relationship problems; they find it difficult to bond with their children born after the abortion and many simply continue the pattern — by now, 45 percent of all abortions are repeat abortions. All these expressions of PASS can show up from minutes after the abortion to decades later. Often it takes five to ten years of denial before the memories and emotions begin to surface uncontrollably. The turmoil of PASS is probably best seen in the dreams of those suffering from it. The site afterabortion.org catalogs a number of these dreams. Here's a fairly representative one: My dream has been repeated so many times over the years ... I can wake myself up now. The dream starts in an old three-story house. Sometimes I'm in the back of the house, sometimes I'm just driving up, sometimes I am already in the house. Big, white, clean, hardwood floors, beautifully decorated. I always think that it is a good dream. Then I start up the beautiful winding stairs. I am apprehensive but I still go up the stairs. I finally make it to the room on the third floor. The room is completely empty. There is only a white box under the window across the room. I walk into the room. I am never alone, someone is always with me. That part is ironic considering the complete feelings of isolation I have had all these years. Anyway, I walk to the box. Sometimes I hear a baby crying and I quickly open the box only to find it empty. Other times I have opened the box to find baby clothes. Other times I have found a dead baby. Other times I have found my old bloody clothes. I stand over the box crying and the intensity wakes me up."Yup, us Pro-Lifers definately don't care about the woman. We are Patriarchial Men who are plotting ways to keep them upstart women under our thumb. We want to ruin women's lives. Our lives are driven by a compulsion to control. We don't really care that the unborn, which we believe to be human, is being murdered. No, that's just a front so's we can use compassionate people to unwittingly help us fulfill our neurotic need for power.

Yes they are usually done in the first few months, but at that point the fetus does have limbs. You can’t have an abortion without the fetus being a certain size. However, abortions are still done quite often at later stages. Any kind of abortion is legal up to 9 months. LOL! How ridiculous! It’s called Surgical Abortion and no it hasn’t been outlawed. If you go to a Planned Parenthood office they offer it. The Partial Birth Abortion is now illegal, but that’s when they take the entire fetus out except for the head, and stab the back of the fetus’ head. I was talking about both physical and emotional trauma. Both happen on legal abortions. There was a recent case about a woman in Los Angeles who died from a Planned Parenthood abortion- it was completely legal. She had two sons and a husband. Bad abortions are happening within the companies that do them. Robbie has already given you a link for PASS.

PASS does seem to exist, but seems to be a miniscule risk. The only women who had any detectable PASS symptoms are those who either felt coerced or rushed(by circumstances or other) into having an abortion or changed their belief about the fetus after the abortion occured.Depression does occur after an abortion, but the best indicator of psychological health afterward is what her psychological health was before the abortion.

There is a big differance in the real post partum depression and any post abortal deppression. The hormones that contribute to post partum depression are not there after and abortion. So I do not brlive that that would be a contributing factor. A womens psych condition before her pregnancy does have the most meaning as to how she will feel after no mater how the prenancy ends

I am pro-life but I suggest toning down a bit. Do not get angry against those who perpitrate evil but evil itself. Many people are blinded, although always know on some level what they are doing is wrong. At the end of the day what you've said rashly can be misused and probably will be. Don't give them ammunition for their false steryotypes. Study and get advice from people older and wiser than you who are pro-life. Isn't it Pro-abortionists that Inforce their Imorality on the unborn and society?If a country said 100% no to abortion do you think the IPPF wouldn't push it in anyway? They would and always have worked this way. The would aim to create a demand (weather intentionally or not) for it in that country.

I think Parcum needs to have a rethink. You need to know more about what you are talking about. Do you think that sarcasstic people will not use your mistakes?As for bias... I think Its the pro-abortion machine that is biased.Pas like many other things is intentionally ignored because it doesn't suite the pro-abortionist agenda.Sure we all make mistakes, just don't let them us them.

Ha ha ha ha!! The anti abortion propoganda industry have really got to you haevn't they? Abortion is only legal past 24 weeks for health reasons. And what is the medical name for this procedure? Here's something exciting for you: it's barely used, and usually used in health problem pregnancies.Sometimes yes, but far less than in pregnancy and birth.Yes, the lies about PASS were hilarious.i know they're old posts, but I just hate seeing AntiAbortion lies being spurted out.

I KNOW I would stay single....might even be tempted to try women....

I am pro-life but I suggest toning down a bit. Do not get angry against those who perpitrate evil but evil itself. Many people are blinded, although always know on some level what they are doing is wrong. At the end of the day what you've said rashly can be misused and probably will be. Don't give them ammunition for their false steryotypes. Study and get advice from people older and wiser than you who are pro-life. Isn't it Pro-abortionists that Inforce their Imorality on the unborn and society?If a country said 100% no to abortion do you think the IPPF wouldn't push it in anyway? They would and always have worked this way. The would aim to create a demand (weather intentionally or not) for it in that country.

I enjoy reading your posts. You are truly a class a debator. I agree with you here, I won't shoot you in your back if you don't shoot me in mine. But I believe there is a bit more to it, as I'm sure they were tying to get at, although I do not think it's for some great plan. Maybe our ability to think in the abstract, empathy...still selfish, I know...

Survival. My chances of living are greater if I have others around to help and protect me. You scratch my back I scratch yours. The barbarians are gone, civilization is still here. It works. It is called enlightened self-interest.

You are wrong [prolife]. As a respectful man, I must say that any woman's right shall forth before any child's right does. Putting children in adoption homes is useless. The mother takes care of the child, feeds him, gives him clothes, education, so she should also choose whether or not her body should continue to concieve that burden emoticonXWow

Yes they are usually done in the first few months, but at that point the fetus does have limbs. You can’t have an abortion without the fetus being a certain size. However, abortions are still done quite often at later stages. Any kind of abortion is legal up to 9 months. LOL! How ridiculous! It’s called Surgical Abortion and no it hasn’t been outlawed. If you go to a Planned Parenthood office they offer it. The Partial Birth Abortion is now illegal, but that’s when they take the entire fetus out except for the head, and stab the back of the fetus’ head. I was talking about both physical and emotional trauma. Both happen on legal abortions. There was a recent case about a woman in Los Angeles who died from a Planned Parenthood abortion- it was completely legal. She had two sons and a husband.

1) Sorry to burst your bubble but, there's no such thing as God.2) Women don't have abortions because their fetus are "guilty".3) You have no right to stand in any woman's way of getting an abortion unless you want to join the fetus on it's way back to heaven.

How can you think that a baby that isn't born yet a nonentity?yeah im only 15 and yet i know that what "abortionist's" say is a load of XXXX!! I feel sorry for you when i get older because im determined with all my heart to stop abortion! I believe God put me on this earth to stop you people from killing his creation! Hear my words i hate liberals and i will never change my mind about abortion. I try to love everyone but it's hard for me to love somebody who kills and innocent child.I am pro life!

Actually, many people's view of prolife are "colored" by their actions. In the extreme, the bombings and murders (yes, I know most prolife condemnn this, but some don't). To a lesser degree thet incessant lies on the prolife sites (I bet you are hard pressed to find a major anti-abortion site that doesn't claim abortion causes breast cancer, when this has cathegorically been disproved.)And then the ongoing denial of the woman as a person in her own right instead of chattel that can be forced to give of her bodily resources against her will.So no, a single silly outburst by one ignorant poster, be it a teen or not, is not going to change the opinion of PL much.

So you are pro-life and you hate liberals? Actually Republicans are being liberal in this case (liberal=bigger government, more laws). But I'll assume you mean Democrats on this. What if the baby is a democrat? If it's a democratic parent it's most likely it will grow up democratic and one more person to attempt to keep abortion legal.

My favorite part about this is that you say pro-lifers dont look beyond the abortion...I would respectfully disagree with this statement. Pro-life looks beyond the abortion in the sense that once the abortion is done what are the effects on the women. Many women have problems after abortion...mainly late term. Suicide rate is also much higher. You mention that the kid might not have loving parents if he/she was born but how do you know that? Maybe the kid would have grown up to cure cancer or maybe be president. The point is, no one is sure what the child would have done or been treated like. It would be impossible to determine which child would have a good life and which wouldnt. Not only that, you have to determine what a good life is. I hope this helps!Steve

My dear child, before you claim that you will stop abortion in its tracks, please prove to me that you will provide a loving, supportive homes for all the unwanted childrent the future holds. Your ignorant opinions about abortion do not impress me, nor do they affect the lives of the poor women who are put in the terrible position in which abortion becomes an option. The one thing I might agree with you upon is that it is a terrible thing, life should be treasured. But not a one of you "pro-lifers" has ever given consideration to a single moment past the time of the abortion. Have you ever considered what kind of a life a child would expect to have without the love of their parents? Another thing you might consider in your time off from misinterpreting the words of the bible is the term overpopulation. In China, they have such a problem, not only do you have to be given the nod from the government to have a child, if you do so without their consent, you are required to abort! Pretty picture, huh? Grow up, for God's sake, and try and understand the world you live in, not judge it.

I agree with the last statement. I just believe that it is stupid to argue like that. It is a big issue in this country and it probably should be solved once and for all. I think a discussion should really take place that presents all the facts. It is good to talk about the issue and lay down the facts without name calling or insults.

Unfortunately, there are no facts that really back up one argument or the other. The issue of "personhood" is a human constructed one. The issue of "souls" cannot be verified by science. The issue of "value of life" is subjective and cannot be verified by science.There is precious little in this issue that can be decided objectively, and so the debate rages.

I will respectfully disagree with this statement too. personhood is human constructed and one could argue that everything this...laws about murder for example. We have to define personhood or you could say that murder is ok because it wasnt a person. So if you don't know when personhood is, shouldn't you play it on the safe side and assume that it is a person? The issue of "value of life" I guess may not be verfiied by science...but when a life begins is...the basic belief in science is that life begins at conception.

But we do. Along with the rule of not murdering (murder being the illegal killing of a person), we also have definitions for personhood in that legal sense, one of them being that the unborn is not a person (Roe vs Wade, Sect. IX).Not at the expense of the woman's basic human right to control her own body. Unless you have a really good reason to favor nonsentient tissue over a woman, that is a no-go.Quite. Certainly, we don't value life enough to mandate blood donations, f.ex."Belief" Science is about facts and evidence, not beliefs. As such, there are not any "scientific belief" as what you describe. Scienece knows that life began somewhere around 3.8 bill years ago, and that all life since is merely a continuation. We also know that the sperm and the egg themselves are alive. And we know that there is no individual existence before birth.So when you are trying to claim "Science" stands behind your claim, then you better be able to prove it. Where is your scientific reference for your claim?Or would you like to retract your claim of what science "believes" (In itself a ridiculous notion)?

I know this, hence my statement about personhood being a human constructed one. You are agreeing with me, not disagreeing. I am fully aware that we can define the fetus as a "person" under the law. Murder is never ok, because it is always against the law. The definition is what changes.We do know where personhood begins. It begins at birth. Assigning at birth is logically sound, easy to mark and practical to enforce. No other arbitrary point, including conception, is all of these things.

I am going to respond to this one first and then the long one before this....When the last thing you said...personhood should be a birth. Science says it is a conception (based on DNA and what not). Never the less, if you say at birth then that means eventhough they kid is 2 inches from being born it is not yet a person. This really makes no sense to me. I don't understand how one can say 2 inches determines a person or not. If one says "well THAT would be a person" then we have a problem again of where to draw the line and thus the "safe" argument would come back. If you don't know if it is murder....play it safe so that way you know for sure you didn't murder. One last thing...if birth is the logical sound easy way to say it is a kid why can't conception be?

As for Seen's statementBesides from Roe vs Wade not being law no where in their conclusions do they make a claim of when life begins (section IX simple says that the 14th amendment doesn't say what a person is). We must understand that courts do not make laws. We still dont know when life begins is kind of where we are. I will correct myself by saying that genetic science thinks life begins at conception.http://www.devbio.com/printer.php?ch=21&id=162So then one claims that if we dont know it is a human you should still protect the womens "rights". Well One thing this country is based on is equal rights for ALL. Keep that in mind. So we don't know when a person is. We have to know when a person begins so we are sure we are not killing others. If you don't know then I could say anyone is not a person based on say...their color of skin. Since we have to define personhoob it would be in the best interest to default it at the earliest safest time until we know otherwise. If not, then you have a chance that you are killing someone which goes against the very basis of this country (that all are created equal). Ok, so it is a person, I still think the mother should be able to do what she wants with her own property aka body. This statement is false if you go by all men are created equal. If the unborn is a person they have the exact same rights as anyone else. Being attached to someone else does not change this (such as conjoined twins). So she can do what she wants to her own body as long as it does not violate the other persons rights. I don't believe a mother has special rights just because she is pregnant.As for the donating blood thing. Our country is set up to prevent people from violating each others rights...No where does the government have a responsibility is force one to help someone else.

Wrong. Science does not determine "personhood". That is a legal construct. "DNA and what not" does not help with this.Honestly, you do not know the difference? Let me see if I can lay it out for you. On one side of the "2 inches" it is inside another creature (the woman for the slow among us). When it is inside the woman it is living off of her organs and life-processes. In essence, it does not have a functioning body because most of it's own organs do not function correctly (as it would after it is born) or at all.Once it is born, it is independent in terms of life-processes. It's bodily processes are no longer being completely and totally supported by the woman's body. They can be separated from each other with no ill effects (physically, at least). Until that happens, the woman has complete and total say in whether or not she will continue to participate in the life-support function she is involved in.The line is drawn at birth.I know it isn't murder.Because conception is generally never known, not even by the woman. If we apply the laws at that point, if we apply citizenship at that point (for if the laws protect it, it must be a citizen right?) how in the world would we enforce that? How will we investigate the deaths of all these little people? 1/3 of all pregnancies end in natural miscarriages, what do we do about them? They are protected under the law, should we not make sure that we do everything in our power to make sure they survive?What will we do with women who continue to do activities that they could do when not pregnant and risk losing their "little citizens" inside them? Jail them? Chain them up perhaps until they give birth? Make them into nice little baby-ovens, eh?Pfft.Arbitrary points just don't make sense. Why not one day earlier or later? Birth makes the most sense, in every way.

You wish to create "personhood" for the fetus, and then you think everything will go back the way it was before? Why in the world will it stop there in the name of "protecting the unborn"?!You do realize that abortions happened in massive numbers before abortion was legal, do you not? In fact, various studies suggest that the number of abortions did not change significantly between the time it was illegal to the time it was legal. They just became a damn sight safer.

Yeah not even close to the number today....This logic is the same as saying all drugs should be legal so there would not no more drug crimes....Also how many died by illegal abortions...not many, 32 in 1972 as an example.READ THE ROE VS WADE CASE!!!

Good post. Acceptable logic and biological facts. I'm sure belief system advocates will counter by responding with the standard statements from mythical oracles.

Several decisions by the Supreme Court indicate that personhood does not apply to the "unborn".There are many physiological changes that happen to the fetus the moment it exits the birth canal and takes it's first breath, and again when the umbilical cord is cut. I am not about to give you a lesson in natal care, or basic biology. A couple changes that are significant are that the lungs of a fetus are collapsed in the womb. They are basically a solid mass of tissue that have no function. All nutrients and oxygen is recieved by the mother through the cord, all waste is passed to the mother through the cord. When the baby is born and takes it's first breath, the lungs inflate for the first time. That is why that first breath is so crucial. Another related change is the heart. The fetal heart does not beat as yours and mine do. There is a special hole, a valve that allows the blood to pass directly through, bypassing the lungs (since the lungs are non-functioning in the womb). The blood is oxygenated directly from the mother. When the lungs inflate, the valve snaps shut in the heart, and blood begins to be directed towards the lungs. Also, the cutting of the cord is the signal for many functions in the babies body to begin.Um... ok? Unless you do some massive damage to the woman, I don't believe this is possible. I'm not about to change my argument around to accomodate your extreme and frankly twisted examples.lol, you cannot with any certainty count the number of deaths due to illegal abortions because illegal abortions were not tracked. The way the studies I mentioned tracked the difference in the number of abortions between it being illegal to it being legal was watching the birth rates. They remained virtually unchanged, indicating that there were no more women having abortions than before.haha, trimesters existed before roe v wade. The Judges used pre-existing measurements.If you wish to make outrageous statements, please back them up.:p You are one of the more amusing pro-lifers.

What if the baby came out all the way and then the doctor put it back in for a second, would it lose personhood which you defined as when the baby is born eventhough you said it should be done by the law?Abortions happened in MASSIVE NUMBERS before it was legal....another bad fact. Yeah not even close to the number today....This logic is the same as saying all drugs should be legal so there would not no more drug crimes....Also how many died by illegal abortions...not many, 32 in 1972 as an example.READ THE ROE VS WADE CASE!!! Trimesters were created by judge Blackmun was the one that delivered the opinion of the Court in which he created the concept of trimesters.Wow I cant even go on...I feel like im talking to a brick wall

AHHH but Supreme court cases are not laws are they?While I am at a loss for the article I do believe there have been cases of the women dieing but the baby still alive inside of her....point being the baby is still inside yet not supported by the mother.Yeah, but there are cases of that happening where the baby is put back in a little bit in order to preform a partial birth abortion.Do you wish for me to post the whole roe vs wade case? While the word "trimester" exisited before the idea of applying it to how we know now was formed in this case. Trimester was similiar to Semester before hand. It means 3 months.You can count the number of deaths for illegal abortions in a given year the same way we determine the number of deaths caused by cancer. And they were tracked....atleast in 1972 :p

Several decisions by the Supreme Court indicate that personhood does not apply to the "unborn".There are many physiological changes that happen to the fetus the moment it exits the birth canal and takes it's first breath, and again when the umbilical cord is cut. I am not about to give you a lesson in natal care, or basic biology. A couple changes that are significant are that the lungs of a fetus are collapsed in the womb. They are basically a solid mass of tissue that have no function. All nutrients and oxygen is recieved by the mother through the cord, all waste is passed to the mother through the cord. When the baby is born and takes it's first breath, the lungs inflate for the first time. That is why that first breath is so crucial. Another related change is the heart. The fetal heart does not beat as yours and mine do. There is a special hole, a valve that allows the blood to pass directly through, bypassing the lungs (since the lungs are non-functioning in the womb). The blood is oxygenated directly from the mother. When the lungs inflate, the valve snaps shut in the heart, and blood begins to be directed towards the lungs. Also, the cutting of the cord is the signal for many functions in the babies body to begin.Um... ok? Unless you do some massive damage to the woman, I don't believe this is possible. I'm not about to change my argument around to accomodate your extreme and frankly twisted examples.lol, you cannot with any certainty count the number of deaths due to illegal abortions because illegal abortions were not tracked. The way the studies I mentioned tracked the difference in the number of abortions between it being illegal to it being legal was watching the birth rates. They remained virtually unchanged, indicating that there were no more women having abortions than before.haha, trimesters existed before roe v wade. The Judges used pre-existing measurements.If you wish to make outrageous statements, please back them up.:p You are one of the more amusing pro-lifers.

It depends on how you look at it. In one sense, no they are merely precedents. In another sense, they determine the direction the law takes. A fine line.It obviously depends on how close to birth it is, and if there is immediate medical attention. Then there are 1 in a trillion miracles.Oh? Care to cite sources?Trimester, in the obstetric sense, has been around a lot longer than Roe V Wade. Trust me, I know what it means.There was no way to track them before it was legal because illegal abortions were generally not reported. Any numbers are pure speculation.

yes i do care to site sources!! but not at 1am in the morning....thats called getting tired.Im not sure why the trimester thing is important anymore....I think you misunderstood me. I said deaths or the mother caused by illegal abortions. Those you can track because the mother dies and that is normally reported as most dead people are.

Really? "Science says" so? Science is about the evidence, so I am sure that you can provide the scientific evidence that supports your absolutist claim? Or are you one of those who try to lend credence to a personal belief and subjective claim by calling it "scientific"? How does "DNA and whatnot" prove scientifically that personhood begins at birth? (And for that matter, please document that "personhood" is a scientific concept to begin with.That is correct. The legal term "Person" specifically is defined to not include the unborn. That is not our fault :) Ah, but then nobody are saying that anyway, as the law is clear. Read Roe vs Wade, Sect.IX. It provides clear legal proof that the unborn is not a person (It states it just that way, BTW).Ah, but I AM sure it is not murder. And I don't believe that it is to "play it safe" to enslave women just because you can't be sure.or the formation of the gametes themselves for that matter, or even. Why should we deliberately pick a time that involves enslaving women? The only reason I can see it that this is actually a ploy by prolifers to oppress women in the best patriarchal, misogynistic style.

I am going to respond to this one first and then the long one before this....When the last thing you said...personhood should be a birth. Science says it is a conception (based on DNA and what not). Never the less, if you say at birth then that means eventhough they kid is 2 inches from being born it is not yet a person. This really makes no sense to me. I don't understand how one can say 2 inches determines a person or not. If one says "well THAT would be a person" then we have a problem again of where to draw the line and thus the "safe" argument would come back. If you don't know if it is murder....play it safe so that way you know for sure you didn't murder. One last thing...if birth is the logical sound easy way to say it is a kid why can't conception be?

DNA science says so....They believe the DNA is the basis of life. So when the egg and sperm meet the DNA is formed.....also I should say personhood is life to me...so human life and personhood are the same.Where is person defined in law by the way? Granted I am talking about US law.That is not our fault?????? Its over now....Slavery is legal, well, not our fault. They wasnt right back in 1850 was it?You then get into Roe vs Wade again..Which I will remind you is not law. Courts dont make laws. You are wrong in saying that is what it said. It said that an unborn is not a person as the word person is used in the 14th amendment...They never said it wasn't a person.Why does everyone say "enslaving" women. You make it seem like they were forced to get pregnant. Her body "makes" babies!!!! You can't change that. If males had the womb same rules apply. When she had sex she did an act which creates babies. A life is made at that point and its life cannot be taken away even if the mother does not want it there. If she wishes to not make a baby, then don't have sex!! Its that easy. (dont reply to this with rape...that is different).

But your rules for the raped woman are the same. In your view a woman has no voice in her pregnancy, regardless of whether she willfully had sex or not. And by the way - there are other options - birth control, sterilization, etc.

Who?Ah, but it is. You should have listened in civics. When the US Supreme Court makes a ruling, they provide current interpretation and application of the existing US Constitution (Which very much is law). As such, their ruling is merely a clarification for how the law applies to the specific case in question. What they rule **IS** the law. I am sorry that you weren't aware of this already. But I am glad that I could help you with this civics lesson, even though I am an immigrant.Sigh, you can't even get THAT right. Sect 14 "doesn't say what a person is," other than citing how "person” **IS** applied in the law. And then it notably (I guess you missed that part) points out that the unborn is NOT a person regardless. Either you need to read that stuff more closely, or you must stop your distortions of this, whichever is the case (I hope it is the first, as the second would imply outright dishonesty).Rather, they clarify what is already the law.Sure we do. “life” itself began about 3.8 bill years ago. The cells that make up the individual body had its start with the gametes, of which the sperm typically came into existence somewhere around 14 days before conception and the egg was laid down when the woman was still a fetus herself.”think”? Are you sure? What makes you say that they don’t believe that the sperm and egg are alive?http://www.devbio.com/printer.php?ch=21&id=162Interestingly enough, that sites states this:“The "answer" is fluid, in that it has been changing throughout history, because any answer about when human life begins is deeply integrated with the beliefs, values and social constructs of the community or individual that drew the conclusion. Throughout history there have been several "answers" to the question of when human life begins, but the only consistency among the answers is that they are always changing as social contexts change, religious morals fluctuate, or new knowledge about the process of embryo development is obtained.”So that doesn’t exactly show that your claim is true, does it now. Perhaps you need a less absolutist claim here.Hmm, I hope that the mixing of terminology was accidental and not a deliberate deception. Being “human” is a species designation. “A human” is the description of an individual. The embryo or fetus are not individuals, and as such that claim is false.Except for the time when slaves, women or whoever didn’t have such rights. Minor detail to you, but important to a lot of people.That claim is false. We know the “when” is at birth. Roe vs. Wade and some of the Amendments to the US Constitution shows this clearly, that persons are born and that the unborn are not persons. SO we **DO** know that the “when” of personhood is birth, your evasions none withstanding.And that’s at birth, so there is no problem here and certainly no problem with abortions.It already is defined. And if you want it as early as possible, then the sperm are persons and masturbation is murder. After all, what if you claim they are not, and you are wrong?See <snicker> how silly your argument gets?No it isn’t. Your postulation in the face of facts doesn’t make you right.Well, isn’t that gracious of you, particularly given that you insist on that same right yourself. I am sure you refuse to have your bodily resources used against your will, even to sustain another person’s life, right?Because otherwise, you agree to mandatory giving blood and to have your extra kidney surgically removed against your will and given to a person dying from kidney failure. Until you do so, you certainly don’t have any right to say that the woman should give of HER body against her will (unless you want to come across as extremely hypocritical).But they are not. Your speculation to this is directly disproved by facts in legal rulings and in the US Constitution. Yes, you can elaborate on your fantasy “what-if,” but that doesn’t change reality, that your fantasy is not real.So you are saying that preservation of bodily resources are not allowed if they are needed to keep another person alive. Hmm, you just agreed to mandatory kidney extraction. Please present at your local hospital tomorrow morning to have your kidney removed, so a life can be saved.AH, but you just said that the woman can be forced to help the fetus. Were you lying? OR is this some hypocritical “I want to force her, but I sure don’t want to be subject to that myself” kind of evasion? That last statement about what our country is set up for, that completely contradicts every argument you have made against abortion.

As for Seen's statementBesides from Roe vs Wade not being law no where in their conclusions do they make a claim of when life begins (section IX simple says that the 14th amendment doesn't say what a person is). We must understand that courts do not make laws. We still dont know when life begins is kind of where we are. I will correct myself by saying that genetic science thinks life begins at conception.http://www.devbio.com/printer.php?ch=21&id=162So then one claims that if we dont know it is a human you should still protect the womens "rights". Well One thing this country is based on is equal rights for ALL. Keep that in mind. So we don't know when a person is. We have to know when a person begins so we are sure we are not killing others. If you don't know then I could say anyone is not a person based on say...their color of skin. Since we have to define personhoob it would be in the best interest to default it at the earliest safest time until we know otherwise. If not, then you have a chance that you are killing someone which goes against the very basis of this country (that all are created equal). Ok, so it is a person, I still think the mother should be able to do what she wants with her own property aka body. This statement is false if you go by all men are created equal. If the unborn is a person they have the exact same rights as anyone else. Being attached to someone else does not change this (such as conjoined twins). So she can do what she wants to her own body as long as it does not violate the other persons rights. I don't believe a mother has special rights just because she is pregnant.As for the donating blood thing. Our country is set up to prevent people from violating each others rights...No where does the government have a responsibility is force one to help someone else.

Congress makes laws....no one else doesRoe vs Wade is not a law...that would imply Congress made it because Congress makes laws...No where does it say abortion is legal in any law.

No you didn’t, stop your misrepresentations. You claimed that science had an answer, but what you provided had nothing to do with scientific proof, instead being only your subjective belief. As such, you are bearing false witness.Personhood is a legal construct, and as such, the law defines it.”A few months,” eh? That means that you are talking about an abortion (presumably by D&X by your description) at 32 weeks. For one, there virtually are **NO** abortions at 32 weeks, and they certainly are not done by D&X.So whatever it is you are trying to say here, it is outright dishonest. What you claim is an outright lie.Uhum. When you are trying to use political, biased sites for scientific medical information, then you are not getting the facts. I would recommend that you stop using prolife propaganda lie sites.The picture is of a fetus, not a baby, that is correct. Perhaps you need to study up on developmental stages before making any more such claims?The trimester concept has been used in pregnancies for hundreds of years and they are not arbitrary, as specific changes in the effect of the pregnancy happens at each stage. Your claim is silly and outright ignorant. Now, please, if you have to make such claims, at least research it first so you know what you are talking about. Because now you just seems silly and ignorant, as if you have all this moral fervor but no actual knowledge of what you are talking about. That doesn’t help your credibility.

Someone was asking about the science of it so I gave them the science answer. If science doesn't determine who a person is then who does?Ok, so 2 inches of the head is still inside the womb...it is not a kid because it is functioning off the women? Actually it is not at that point, in fact it could have lived on its own for a few months at that point. It has a functioning body.http://www.gospelbillboard.com/abortion.htmlSo that was never a baby huh? (note: just the picture not the content of the site)You claim they can be citizens at conception then thats fine with me although just a title. It is a person and has the rights of the rest of us (for the most part...no drinking little man). Investigations don't have to be done by the way. People forget that abortion was illegal in most states prior to 1973....you didnt see massive investigations then why would you expect them if it were banned again?Conception is not an arbitary point by the way. It is the point when the sperm meets with the egg. Trimesters are arbitary points...these were created by judges.

nope steen...someone wanted the Science answer so I gave it. Don't believe me, look it up.The rest of your text is wrong because you don't even read what I write....you referred to the site where I clearly stated LOOK ONLY AT THE PICTURE and yet you seem to think I meant look at the whole site.Oh, and it was the picture of a dead baby.Since you aren't a big fan of science we can look at it the law way.

There very much is a law for personhood, your denial and misrepresentation to the contrary. I went over that in an earlier post.Actually no, as a baby doesn't have an umbilical cord anymore.There is no "child 2 inches in the womb." It is not a child until it is finally born, your misrepresentation and prolife revisionist linguistics none withstanding.They couldn’t. You obviously never witnessed a contracting uterus. Your claim is silly and stupid. Amazing how weird your “what-ifs” have to be to even justifying you continuing to discuss this subject. Obviously you are far gone from reality, now having to resort to fantasy and silliness to make a point.Well, it is a REAL fact. Facts in themselves are not “bad.”Actually quite close to what happens today, though around 80-82 there was a peak where your claim could be justified.and 115 in 1969. in 1958 360 died from illegal and spontaneous abortions (They didn’t separate the stats back then)You are still lying. Blackmun merely applied a concept that has been used in obstetrics for centuries. Please learn what you talk about before making silly claims.Well, I can understand that it is frustrating that we won’t accept your false and ignorant claims, but the problem is not with us, but rather with your knowledge of the issue, or lack thereof.

Yeah not even close to the number today....This logic is the same as saying all drugs should be legal so there would not no more drug crimes....Also how many died by illegal abortions...not many, 32 in 1972 as an example.READ THE ROE VS WADE CASE!!!

AHHH but Supreme court cases are not laws are they?While I am at a loss for the article I do believe there have been cases of the women dieing but the baby still alive inside of her....point being the baby is still inside yet not supported by the mother.Yeah, but there are cases of that happening where the baby is put back in a little bit in order to preform a partial birth abortion.Do you wish for me to post the whole roe vs wade case? While the word "trimester" exisited before the idea of applying it to how we know now was formed in this case. Trimester was similiar to Semester before hand. It means 3 months.You can count the number of deaths for illegal abortions in a given year the same way we determine the number of deaths caused by cancer. And they were tracked....atleast in 1972 :p

DNA science says so....They believe the DNA is the basis of life. So when the egg and sperm meet the DNA is formed.....also I should say personhood is life to me...so human life and personhood are the same.Where is person defined in law by the way? Granted I am talking about US law.That is not our fault?????? Its over now....Slavery is legal, well, not our fault. They wasnt right back in 1850 was it?You then get into Roe vs Wade again..Which I will remind you is not law. Courts dont make laws. You are wrong in saying that is what it said. It said that an unborn is not a person as the word person is used in the 14th amendment...They never said it wasn't a person.Why does everyone say "enslaving" women. You make it seem like they were forced to get pregnant. Her body "makes" babies!!!! You can't change that. If males had the womb same rules apply. When she had sex she did an act which creates babies. A life is made at that point and its life cannot be taken away even if the mother does not want it there. If she wishes to not make a baby, then don't have sex!! Its that easy. (dont reply to this with rape...that is different).

Quite. But court rulings are the application of that law. As such, the law is carried out the way the courts clarify the law. As such, court rulings are law. Your civics understanding seems at diminished capacity.Well, I am beginning to lose patients with your whining silliness.NITWIT, Congress made the law that includes the Roe vs Wade ruling. The ruling is part of that law.The US Supreme Court judges say that you are wrong. They say that the law as it is written does give abortion as a guaranteed right to women. You really need to get a course in law before making any more ignorant and silly claims.BINGO. You seem to be getting it, finally.But then you show how you aren't getting it after all. The US Supreme Court has shown that the right to an abortion is included in the rights provided through the US Constitution. The US Constitution also doesn't say that you have the right to type on a computer. That doesn't mean that it is not legal to do so.And you are again lying. A person is what the law and the US Supreme Court say that it is.Did it now? Please prove that claim.:) I am not at all surprised. emoticonXRolleyes Actually sperm does have unique DNA, so why don't you get a biology course to figure that out.And, by the way, the hydatidiform mole is a result of human conception with its own unique DNA. I doubt you would call that a person.TRANSLATION: “I can't come up with an argument against it, so I will pretend that it doesn't fit. If I ignore it, it goes away”The person defines a person as "BORN" and specifically EXCLUDES THE UNBORN fro being persons. This has been shown here before, and really cannot be pointed out to you any more clearly. If you refuse to see that, then you have the right to reject factual evidence, certainly, but it will also show you as outright dishonest

The Dred Scott decision was about whether slaves could be recaptured after living as free men above the Mason-Dixon line, whether they were CITIZENS.

The decision is filled with references to this point, see for yourself:http://www.tourolaw.edu/patch/Scott/In fact, the Dred Scott decision was not that different than the law today that unless you are born in the US, you are not a citizen until such status is granted you.

For the purpose of counting the census. That is the tidbit of that law that the US Supreme Court cited in the Derd Scott decision, a decision that was not about the 3/5th rule (That law was in process before) but rather about whether Dred Scott was a Citizen, merely by having escaped and living like a free man. THAT was the issue that was clarified in the Dredd Scott decision. Tye census laws were not being challenged or ruled on in that decision.So the Dred Scott decision did not MAKE any rules about slaves being 3/5th of a person. Neither did any other law.

I beg to differ. As has already been stated, the Constitution of the United States condoned the institution of slavery by only counting slaves as 3/5 of a person. Even if this was only for census purposes, it still claimed an enslaved black person was a partial person, not a complete person. Incidentally, Dred Scot v Sandford actually extended "partial-person principal" to all blacks, free or slave.We all know that slaves weren't treated as human beings by people. But, by virtue of their ineligibility to enjoy any rights under law (complements of Dred Scot v Sandford) , the law did not recognize the slave as a person either.

Not when we are talking about constitutional issues, they don't. They then only matter in that the US Supreme Court accept them or reject them. So it still comes down to the US Supreme Court.Certainly sometimes, what is law is stuff we disagree with. However, the original issue (besides your evasions about "scientific" evidence you were going to provide and your claims that a picture of a fetus really was taht of a baby, merely because you claim it is) was whether "person" was defined in the law or not. As I pointed out, it is, and it is defined per clarifications of the law, to not include the unborn.So I am not sure what the benefit of this tangent is.

AH, but not per the Dred Scott decision. And the counting of census numbers where slaves were counted as 3/5th of a non-slave person did NOT say anything about the actual personhood of the slaves themselves in the eye of the law.The Dred Scott decision was about citizenship, not personhood."complete person" in what context? Are you talkign census data or the view of individual personhood? If you claim the latter, then you are wrong. Dred Scott was an atrocity, but not per the claims you guys are making.How so? The Dred Scott decision did not make any claim about how census numbers were to be counted, so I am not sure what you are trying to say here.Yes, THAT we know. You still have to prove that Dred Scot removed the assignement of personhood from either enslaved or free African-Americans.

Certainly there are some court rulings I do not agree with and think are wrong. If, for example, Roe V Wade were overturned, I would think that is the wrong decision.Slavery was later decided to be wrong. Disallowing abortion was later decided to be wrong as well.

so sigma, law is not a good thing to base what is right or wrong on right?I still...everything put aside about whether abortion is right or not...that roe vs wade was a case that was beyond the courts power. i believe they kinda overstepped their power as judges....I believe that judges do not determine what someones thoughts were in writting an amendment but rather they are supposed to look at the laws already written and see if they apply to the case. In the example of Roe vs. Wade...the judges decided that the writers of the 14th amendement and other amendments were really talking about privacy and how you have that right. This was not the intent of the 14th amendment as written. Therefore the judges should have said "this is not something we can decide on because it doesnt mention it in the constitution." So to overturn it based on the fact that it was made "illegally" (for lack of better word) I believe is true aside from how I feel about abortion. For that matter there are a few other cases I feel the same way about eventhough I agree with the outcome of the case.

No, because "right" and "wrong" are subjective. All the law is good for is what is "legal" and "illegal".The Supreme Court's job is to decide what the Constitution means. They would have been overstepping their powers only if they actually re-wrote the law. They did not. They said "this is what the Constitution means, and this is how it applies to this case" which is well within their power.Do you really believe the framer of the 14th amendment would not have written it differently if it was only meant to apply in one particular situation? No, the framer might not have predicted situations in the future, but it was phrased in a way to apply more generally, not in any one particular situation. The Supreme Court interpreted it to apply in this situation as well.Er, no. There are new situations and new cases all the time; the Supreme Court has to look at the Constitution (the framers of which could never have predicted the complicated situations of today) and decide how it applies in the case presented to them. Whether they are a strict constuctionist or not, they still have to interprete the Constitution to apply it to the case presented to them. They do not say "oh this wasn't specifically mentioned by name so we can't decide on it". Regardless, your premise is incorrect.

I mean exactly that...like every other amendment...the 19th amendment was created so women can vote...nothign else....14th was made for slavery purposes....They have no power to assume where else is applies because that would be rewritting law as you say. To give an example of what I mean: Say we have a law that says you can't run a stop sign. If there is a court case about someone running a red light the court can't say "the law about the stop sign really applies to all forms of intersection control". There job is not to apply lies to different areas but rather to see if someone has broken an existing law.

They wouldnt have the right to extend it to stop lights because the law says "stop signs" (obviously someone woulda made that law by then though :-p). It said "you cant run a stop sign"....There is no reason the court could extend that law to stop lights because it becomes what they believe the law should be and not what it is. Maybe congress really wanted it so you could run stop lights...who knows.....until a law is made the court can't say you can't run stop lights.

It said "you cant run a stop sign"....There is no reason the court could extend that law to stop lights because it becomes what they believe the law should be and not what it is. Maybe congress really wanted it so you could run stop lights...who knows.....until a law is made the court can't say you can't run stop lights.

They do and should have the power to do that. Until Congress makes a law specifically for that, the original intent (as you seem to love so much) of the stop sign law was to govern intersection traffic.

Thus shielding them from political fallout. The concept being that they will judge according to what they believe is constitutional, not what will get them re-elected.

The Constitution limits powers as well. I'll ask you a question, what powers does the Constitution give the Supreme Court?And lets look at this power that's got you panties in a twist. Lets say that Congress passes a bill that conflicts with the Constitution (and trust me, they can). Lets say there's an XXX of a President who allows a Bill to pass and a Republican senate that allows agencies to monitor citizens without their knowledge, accuse and arrest without a requirement to produce evidence, hold without bail and without anyone elses knowledge and away from council, and have no requirement to set that citizen free after a certain amount of time. Such a bill would conflict with Constitutional Rights, would it not? Now, lets say that someone protests it and it goes before the Supreme Court. Now, the Supreme Court rules based on the Constitution, not current laws. Lets say they judge that this citizen cannot be arrested, held, etc because it violates the Constitution. What happens to the unconstitutional law? It gets struck down. Doesn't that make sense? When judges rule according to the constitution, the unconstitutional law is struck down. How is this such a bad thing and so far out of the Courts power, according to you?

Correct. Article III is the only place that it mentions the creation of the Supreme Court. It does not spell out it's powers or responsiblities, only that the entire judiciary shall be vested in that one Court.Isn't judiciary review what we're talking about? The concept of judges striking down laws that Congress makes. It is part of the larger picture. The judges look at the Constitution and decide how it applies to the case. They looked at the Constitution, as it is written, and decided what the intent was and applied it to abortion. The intent was about freedom.

What do you mean "halo"? They interpret what the constitution means, and what the intent was. That is their job. I don't understand your objection. If they cannot decide cases based on their interpretation of the Constitution, what are they supposed to decide cases on?All powers they have were given to themselves. There are no powers spelled out in the Constitution, so everything they do was taken upon themselves. It is a natural outcropping of the ability to judge on the constitutionality of cases.

They looked at the constitution and decided the original intent was a right to privacy. That’s their job.No, they look at the Constitution and decide what is legal or illegal. If current laws conflict, those laws are struck down as unconstitutional.

Do you disagree that if they decide the case based on the Constitution and it conflicts with current laws that the law in question is unconstitutional?If the Constitution gives them supreme judicial power, the power of judicial review is included in that. What else can they do if the Constitution (which they base their decisions on) is in conflict with current law? The must have that power in order to do their job of judging according to the Constitution. Their job is to interpret the Constitution and rule based on that. What exactly can you disagree with? Do you disagree that judges rule according to the Constitution? Do you disagree that current law that conflict with their interpretation of the Constitution should be struck down? Do you disagree that judges determine what the Constitution means to cases presented?I think you listen to Rush too often. Don’t. He’s an egotistical fool who twists facts to suit his own ideology and demonizes anyone that he labels “liberal” because their liberal. He reminds me a lot of Ann Coulter.I have seen PP downplay facts, but I have never seen them blatantly lie as I have seen National Right to Life do. There is little to support the pro-life position, factually, so they tend to lie more often.

I don’t think you understand. In order to apply the Constitution to a case, they have to define what it means. They have to say “this is what this passage means, and this is how it applies to this case”.They cannot create new laws, they can only create precedents on how the Constitution is applied in certain types of cases.And to do that they have to define what the Constitution sayslol, I should have been more specific… what does “judicial power” mean in terms of the Supreme Court? How do they not administer justice atm? Simply posting the definition and saying “that’s their power” means nothing. Apply it to the Supreme Court. The definition gave no insight into judicial power.You’re insulted by me suggesting that you shouldn’t listen to Rush? That’s interesting. Rush has been saying some of the same things recently regarding the Supreme Court, so I assumed you had gotten some of your erroneous statements from him. If not, I still cannot see how you would be insulted by me suggesting you don’t listen to a pompous windbag such as Rush.Such as?“Pro-abortion”?! You wanted to force women to have abortions? That’s as bad as forcing women to be pregnant.There are very few people who are pro-abortion. Most of us are pro-choice.I think the question is… why would I care?

Over 1.3 million children were killed in America in 1997 alone and no one did anything about it. Over one million were killed last year and over one million will be killed this year. Between 1973 and 1997 more than 35 million killings of innocent children were performed, legally. Abortion has become very simple these days; it is almost as easy a putting on a pair of boots. The killing of innocent children is so prevalent that our culture has become desensitized, and we have accepted it as way of life. Abortion should not be a way of life, as it has become the sanctioned genocide of our own people. Pro-choice advocates cite the right for a woman to choose if she wants to have a baby. However, that choice ceased upon the union of the sperm and egg, a baby was formed, and that baby has the right to live. There are many methods available to avoid pregnancy and abortion is not one of those methods, it does not fall under the category of contraceptives. The act of abortion is an act of violence committed on the most defenseless of our society. Polls conducted have found that the majority of women who had abortions feared that a child would interfere with responsibilities such as school, work or other responsibilities. Some said that they couldn't afford a child. This reveals that not only are abortions criminal but most of result because the mother is too selfish to promote the life she created.

Continue to demonize women facing unwanted pregnancy and/or continue to trivialize the things they face and you will not do a damned thing to help anyone - born or not. There is not a single pregnancy that can succeed without the mother's cooperation - and no abortion law that can guarantee it.

You kinda showed how it is selfish...how do they support THEMSELVES...THEY need to work, THEY need to make money....anything you do only for yourself is selfish. When one has sex and gets pregnant (assuming sex for their pleasure) they have done a selfish act again. Now if one wishes to be selfish thats fine as long as they do not hurt someone else....in this case they made a choice and now they want to kill someone in order for them to live their lives. That is selfishness that I don't tolerate. Why can't one take responsibilites for their actions, If I get a girl pregnant I am gonna take care of that kid until the day I die because I made that choice and I will take responsibility for what I did rather than look for the easy fix.

Yup, just like the PL are to selfish to adopt a kid that needs a home. How many children have YOU adopted? None? Only one? Why so slefish? You are not hypocritical, are you?

Over 1.3 million children were killed in America in 1997 alone and no one did anything about it. Over one million were killed last year and over one million will be killed this year. Between 1973 and 1997 more than 35 million killings of innocent children were performed, legally. Abortion has become very simple these days; it is almost as easy a putting on a pair of boots. The killing of innocent children is so prevalent that our culture has become desensitized, and we have accepted it as way of life. Abortion should not be a way of life, as it has become the sanctioned genocide of our own people. Pro-choice advocates cite the right for a woman to choose if she wants to have a baby. However, that choice ceased upon the union of the sperm and egg, a baby was formed, and that baby has the right to live. There are many methods available to avoid pregnancy and abortion is not one of those methods, it does not fall under the category of contraceptives. The act of abortion is an act of violence committed on the most defenseless of our society. Polls conducted have found that the majority of women who had abortions feared that a child would interfere with responsibilities such as school, work or other responsibilities. Some said that they couldn't afford a child. This reveals that not only are abortions criminal but most of result because the mother is too selfish to promote the life she created.

How many kids have you adopted? How many hours a week are you spending in the Big brother/Big Sister program? How many hours are you spending teaching kids and adults to read? How many hours are you spending with "meals on Wheels"? None? How selfish of you.But then just about ANY act is selfish, so your hypocricy in ignoring all the other acts merely shows the moral bancrupcy of the prolife arguments.

You kinda showed how it is selfish...how do they support THEMSELVES...THEY need to work, THEY need to make money....anything you do only for yourself is selfish. When one has sex and gets pregnant (assuming sex for their pleasure) they have done a selfish act again. Now if one wishes to be selfish thats fine as long as they do not hurt someone else....in this case they made a choice and now they want to kill someone in order for them to live their lives. That is selfishness that I don't tolerate. Why can't one take responsibilites for their actions, If I get a girl pregnant I am gonna take care of that kid until the day I die because I made that choice and I will take responsibility for what I did rather than look for the easy fix.

We aren't debating my life here now are we?And of course a lot of things people do are selfish. I just said when it hurts or in the case abortion kills, for selfish reasons then it not ok.....In other words, they want to harm someone for selfish reasons...this is a far cry from helping someone for selfish reasons or having fun for selfish reasons.

Do you have any argument besides emotionally charged words here? IMO, if you have to use emotional words to prop up your argument, you have no argument.Hardly. No matter the method, the hormones of the abortion pill or the invasivness of surgery, abortions are not "almost as easy a putting on a pair of boots". Especially afterwards, as the body attempts to adjust to the absence in the womb.Regardless, how does the ease of an abortion help any argument? You are still trying to use emotion to sway others to your side, and that is dishonest in an intellectual debate.In what way is our culture desensitized because of abortion? Are we desensitized to the killings in Iraq because of abortion? Are we desensitized to serial killers because of abortion? Such outrageous claims need to be backed up... where is your evidence?You cannot lay all of the world's evil at the doorstep of abortion. Unwanted pregnancies and abortions are a symptom of problems in society, not the cause.How is it a way of life? Again, you are using emotionally charged words with no basis. There is no genocide happening; we are far from being wiped out.But it hasn't. Abortion is legal, so the choice remains. Even if abortion is illegal, many women would kill the fetus if their situations were bad enough. All you would prevent is the woman being under the care of a physician in a clinical, safe setting.Absolutely right. Abortion is not a contraceptive.No, I'm sorry but a fetus has no place in society, and I cannot forsee how it possibly could be. Until it is separate from the mother, it has no place and should have no place.You have made a rather strange logical jump here. How in the world does that reveal that abortions are criminal? Being selfish is no crime. You are right that it is selfish to think of oneself first; in fact I believe that those are selfish reasons (generally anyway, however they can be selfless reasons such as the desire to care for existing children). However, a woman has a right to be selfish, to want to do things for herself. She can choose to be selfless, and the gov't should not have the power to force her to be selfless (for would forced selflessness really be selfless?).If you have nothing but emotionally charged words to make your argument, then you have no argument.

Are you aware a malnourished or starving mother can't have a healthy pregnancy? How about not being able to access medical care? Having a home? It is not selfish to need these things - they are critical - ESPECIALLY when pregnant. And what if the woman is supporting other children? Does everybody get to starve so you can demonize that slut and offer her no recourse or assistance?This is a false argument from you. The women's consent is irrelevant to you in the case of whether a pregnancy continues or not. You have stated openly that pregnancy is a owman's responsibility whether she consented to it or not.There are those that argue getting an abortion IS taking responsibility if one can not have a safe and healthy pregnancy.Goody for you - but the numbers on deadbeat dads don't give most women faced with unplanned pregnancy any reason to trust that the fathers will come through. Not to mention we are talking about pregnancy - not parenting.

You should use the quote /quote tags. It's a bit difficult to follow who you are quoting and who you are replying to.Financial problems come in many flavors, not all of which are cut and dry as you seem to believe. You are also under the impression that a woman can put a fetus up for adoption and it will no longer be under her care. A born child won't necessarily be "provided for one way or another" but a born child certainly has the ability to be taken care of by others, while a fetus cannot.You are trying to compare very different situations, that of a born child and of a fetus.Steve was saying that he does not tolerate the selfishness of a woman in the case they made a choice and now they want to kill someone in order for them to live their lives. However, he has already said that it doesn't matter whether or not they made that choice to be pregnant.It was valid to point that out.The rape itself doesn't justify destroying the life of the fetus. The circumstances of pregnancy does.You blatantly ignored the fact that she was arguing from a particular angle of the issue rather than the issue as a whole ;)Those are the same choice, not to have an abortion emoticonXConfused What was your point?I believe it is right to not force women to continue their pregnancies. If my mother had aborted me I would not be around to argue, this is true. However, I still would never want my mother to be forced to continue a pregnancy and bear a child against her will and without her consent.Perhaps they should have thought of the possible consequences. I do believe that is irresponsible to ignore possible consequences to your actions. However, pregnancy and motherhood should not be used as a punishment for irresponsible behavior. That is more immoral than any abortion.There is no law stating that one must accept any consequence of your action if you can change it. Lets take an analogy. You come home drunk, open the door and stumble upstairs into bed. However, you left your front door ajar; more, you left your keys in your door! A criminal wandering by sees this and just walks inside your house. Suddenly, in your drunken stupor you wake to the noise of him stealing your stuff and call the police, do the police on the other end say "you were irresponsible for drinking and leaving your keys in your door. You must accept the consequences of your actions. We will not help"?Adoption is a parenting choice, not a pregnancy choice. A fetus cannot be put up for adoption.Perhaps their purpose is to be aborted. How are you to know, or to judge?Perhaps, perhaps not. Tell me, is the gov't forcing selflessness really being selfless?Agreed. Until women get the support (financial and otherwise) they need, however, abortion should remain a choice. Once they get that support, I doubt abortion would be much of an issue.

I was very nearly denied medical care when I was pregnant. It took some fanagling and a little fibbing on the part of a state worker to get me medical care. Medicaire, medicaid and local prgrams get cute more and more every year, leaving more and more people without insurance benefits.Child support will help support a child after it is born. It will not support the woman - during the pregnancy or after, nor will it support other children that may already be born. She still needs a livlihood. And child support awarded does not mean child support paid. My friend's ex only pays when and if he feels like working. I was awarded child support seven years ago and have never seen one thin dime.Adoption is an option for a woman who is able and willing to carry a pregnancy to term only.I have been arguing with Steeve for some time. His policy for pregnant women is accross the board, thereofore their consent or level of responsibility is irrelevant to him.Yes she does.It has nothing to do with the fetus. It has to do with the fact that women are not baby making chattel. You don't get to use their bodies to make babies without their consent. You do not get put her life, livlihood, health or anything else on the line without her input.Careful what you say about my mother. She is the one who taught me to demand repect and ownership of my own body. She watched her own mother go through ELEVEN pregnancies, married to an abusive man who would not work to support his kids, at a time when my grandmother had no recourse and was denied birth control without his consent. When my mother was pregnant with my brother, the pregnancy went badly, he nearly died. She decided she was done having children - her doctor had to LIE to my father to get him to agree to her getting her tubes tied. She had to seek permission from a man who would walk out on his kids ten years later.I have been a rape victim and I was married to an abuser. This body is mine, and nobody but me makes to decisions for it but me. Ever. And any law that stands be damned.I am a 35 year old, capable responsible woman who is more than aware of her own circumstances and I can make the best decisions for myself. I am safe, and now have my tubes tied, but if I were ever to become pregnant by rape, or were facing a pregnancy that was a threat to my health or livlihood I would end it in a heartbeat.Why are you ambiguous in the first sentence. Let's be honest - this is what you are saying; "Two people make the decision to have a child. If THE FATHER fails to take responsibility then the MOTHER must. There is no exceptions to that. Only men can walk away from a pregnancy.It's necesary. When a 12 year old girl is pregnant by her father - it's necesary for her to have that option. When a woman is raped - it's necesary for her to have that option. When a pregnancy will hurt the woman - it's necesary for her to have that option. Simply because woman are not property - it's necesary for them to have the option.

Now if one wishes to be selfish thats fine as long as they do not hurt someone else....in this case they made a choice and now they want to kill someone in order for them to live their lives. That is selfishness that I don't tolerate.This is a false argument from you. The women's consent is irrelevant to you in the case of whether a pregnancy continues or not. You have stated openly that pregnancy is a owman's responsibility whether she consented to it or not.You blatantly ignored the fact that he was arguing from a particular angle of the issue rather than the issue as a whole. The debate would get no nearer to the end if you didn't split it up from simple black and white terms which you seem to wish to argue from. Yes, the woman may have been raped. This does not give her the justification to destroy the childs life. This is making the assumption that the child deserves to die because of the wrong actions that someone took. Does someone deserve to be judged by what their parents did or does that person deserve the chance at life?Quote:Originally Posted by SteeeeveWhy can't one take responsibilites for their actions,There are those that argue getting an abortion IS taking responsibility if one can not have a safe and healthy pregnancy.What you seem to be doing here is saying that abortion is only morally right if a safe and healthy pregnancy can't occur. In many cases it will be said that if the mother doesn't have an abortion she will die and when she choses not to have an abortion both the mother and child end up perfectly healthy. If the mother had chosen to have an abortion these children would not have had the chance at life. If your parents had chosen to abort you, you would not be here to debate this issue. How then can you believe that it is right?Quote:Originally Posted by SteeeeveIf I get a girl pregnant I am gonna take care of that kid until the day I die because I made that choice and I will take responsibility for what I did rather than look for the easy fix.Goody for you - but the numbers on deadbeat dads don't give most women faced with unplanned pregnancy any reason to trust that the fathers will come through. Not to mention we are talking about pregnancy - not parenting.Two people make the decision to have a child. If one fails to take responsibility then the other must. They should have thought about that before deciding they were responsible enough to accept the consequences of any given situation that might occur from having sex protected or not. Again, there is always the option of adoption so abortion is completely uncalled for in every case. I know you'll probably retaliate with something concerning third world countries which don't have welfare and such things. Well personally i believe that everyone has a purpose and if these children are getting slaughtered before their purposes are fulfilled how is development ever to take place in such countries. We have such luxiouries in the West. We have enough to provide support for these children, and educate them so they can learn to support themselves. I think the problems in the world are stemming from our own selfishness. Abortion is completely unnecessary, but the only way to open peoples eyes to that is to offer them support and other ways out of the situation they have got themselves in. Alot of pro-life campaigners get too extreme, instead of showing them other ways they are overly critical, and don't take into account that everyone makes mistakes, even them.

Be realistic. 98.2%- The percentage of households with at least one TV in 2001 in the US, and you’re suggesting that people can’t afford to have a child when they have so many unessential things such as TV’s? Financially able? Yes. I don’t think that the woman has the will to do whatever she wants with her life. I think she should be forced into doing some things against her will. Especially if her own selfish will to do something affects the will of another human. Yes, she gets to destroy life because her own has been destroyed by someone else? That’s a very immature and selfish view to take.And I suppose you see it as right to do precisely that to an unborn child all because they can’t defend themselves by speaking up as the woman can?I have nothing against you making decisions about what to do with your own body, but I don’t think anyone should stand by while you make a decision to end the life of an unborn child. Concerning children conceived of rape, I think it’s wrong for the mother to suddenly feel she has the right to kill the unborn child. Sure, she went through a tough experience but that doesn’t give her the right to put the child through a worse experience.I’ve already said what I thought of abortions as a result of rape above. I think that in the cases where it might affect the mother’s health that she often has to accept the consequences of her actions. She decided not to use protection, not the child. The question that always comes up is; ‘Whose life is more important?’ I think that it is for God to decide who lives and who dies and not people, and that the pregnancy should go on and not be aborted.That’s a pretty narrow minded view. What about the father’s rights to let the child live? You seem to think you want equality, but in actual fact you’re not taking into account that some men do want to live up to their responsibility. Women quite clearly walk away from pregnancy all the time by having abortions, which the father has no say in.It’s unnecessary. 1. Not necessary: not essential, needed, or required .You’ve made quite a few statements there but not extended it by using points to back it up.

I was very nearly denied medical care when I was pregnant. It took some fanagling and a little fibbing on the part of a state worker to get me medical care. Medicaire, medicaid and local prgrams get cute more and more every year, leaving more and more people without insurance benefits.Child support will help support a child after it is born. It will not support the woman - during the pregnancy or after, nor will it support other children that may already be born. She still needs a livlihood. And child support awarded does not mean child support paid. My friend's ex only pays when and if he feels like working. I was awarded child support seven years ago and have never seen one thin dime.Adoption is an option for a woman who is able and willing to carry a pregnancy to term only.I have been arguing with Steeve for some time. His policy for pregnant women is accross the board, thereofore their consent or level of responsibility is irrelevant to him.Yes she does.It has nothing to do with the fetus. It has to do with the fact that women are not baby making chattel. You don't get to use their bodies to make babies without their consent. You do not get put her life, livlihood, health or anything else on the line without her input.Careful what you say about my mother. She is the one who taught me to demand repect and ownership of my own body. She watched her own mother go through ELEVEN pregnancies, married to an abusive man who would not work to support his kids, at a time when my grandmother had no recourse and was denied birth control without his consent. When my mother was pregnant with my brother, the pregnancy went badly, he nearly died. She decided she was done having children - her doctor had to LIE to my father to get him to agree to her getting her tubes tied. She had to seek permission from a man who would walk out on his kids ten years later.I have been a rape victim and I was married to an abuser. This body is mine, and nobody but me makes to decisions for it but me. Ever. And any law that stands be damned.I am a 35 year old, capable responsible woman who is more than aware of her own circumstances and I can make the best decisions for myself. I am safe, and now have my tubes tied, but if I were ever to become pregnant by rape, or were facing a pregnancy that was a threat to my health or livlihood I would end it in a heartbeat.Why are you ambiguous in the first sentence. Let's be honest - this is what you are saying; "Two people make the decision to have a child. If THE FATHER fails to take responsibility then the MOTHER must. There is no exceptions to that. Only men can walk away from a pregnancy.It's necesary. When a 12 year old girl is pregnant by her father - it's necesary for her to have that option. When a woman is raped - it's necesary for her to have that option. When a pregnancy will hurt the woman - it's necesary for her to have that option. Simply because woman are not property - it's necesary for them to have the option.

Spoken like a person who has no clue what a pregnancy entails.A TV - even the most expensive one will cost but a few hundred dollars.Medical care for a pregnancy costs thousands. Food, rent, clothes, utilities, etc. are on-going expenses that cost tens of thousands of dollars a year (meaning she needs a livlihood).Now that's just the pregnancy. You want a run down on the cost of kid - food, housing, medical care, day care, etc? I have owned several TVs in my life, and I am single mother. I know which costs more.Thank you for stating plainly that lifers are all about controling women.And you might want to rephrase that first sentence - for this woman has the will to do what she wants in her life - and does.Women are people. They have jobs, families, medical conditions, plans, dreams, things that have worked hard to acheive, children to support, all sorts of stuff going on. Their lives and bodies are not up for grabs just because they are biologically capable of getting pregnant. Pregnancies are hugely impactful. It's not like storing a bike in your garage for nine months. It changes your body and your physical and mental health. It costs MONEY. It demands changes to your lifestyle. When I was pregnant with my son, I had to stop working at five months. As the SOLE support for my son now, stopping work for half a year is absolutely out of the question, I would end the pregnancy before letting either he or I come to harm.There are children out there who need a kidney to live. I can't DEMAND you give them one against your will. Why should you be able to demand it of a pregnant woman - ESPECIALLY when she did not consent to the pregnancy?Nope. I am pretty sure I explained quite clearly why I am pro-choice. If you aren't going to bother to read what I say, don't debate me.No you don't - or you would understand that a rape victim has the right to retain her bodily autonomy.This is so insulting. Can you possibly hate women more? It's childish and selfish to not give up everything in her life for a year to a violent crime? You think women are all just sitting around being taken care of and waiting to be pregnant? No circumstance in their life is ever valid? Do you even know any women?Well - when you say a life threatening pregnancy should go on regardless - YOU are playing God - with a total stranger's life.Your plan would leave my son an orphan (as well as the new baby should it survive).What are you blathering on about? This started with your responding to a comment I made about dead beat dads. I pointed out the number of them - to which you said that if one parent fails then the other must step up to the plate and I simply asked to speak a little more honestly and clearly. "If Dad bails Mom must step up." Face it, you hold woman much mroe accountable to children than men.Your as willing to dismiss the lives of women as you seem to think women who choose abortion are to dismiss the lives of the fetuses they abort. You are equally guilty - unless women's lives just aren't that important to you. Time to fess up - one way or another.

That is what I would like to see it come to. But I will fight hard seeing that happen via the demonizing of women facing unplanned pregnancy and the complete disregard of their circumstances.We need to to find ways to address the things that lead to unwanted pregnancy. We need to help women find ways to deal with the circumstances they face once pregnant. We need to teach our girls that the world does not revolve around men. Girls are bred to make men their focus from day one. Now there is nothing wrong with having a good relationship or marriage with a man, but it needs to be balanced out with her own needs and desires. How many young women hear "when are going to settle down" rather than "how is your career going"? How often I have been labeled unsuccessful as a person simply because I am single. I tell people I am divorced and the automatic assumption is "what did you do to make him leave?" (I do love answering this tho - I threw his sorry XXX out and filed for divorce - HA!). Anyway - my point is, if we train women to make men their focus - it will lead to sex and all that goes with that.And we also need to make men more accountable. Child support barely touches it. So many don't pay. And when they do it's based on their income rather than the child's needs - leaving the custodial parent (usually mom) figuring out how to make ends meet. And can we teach them to value women more? We do not hold men's reputations as accountable to promiscuity as we do women's. Women are whores, men are studs.All these things and more play a part.And we will never, ever fix this and really reduce abortion, until lifers understand that woman can make choices for themselves. And that sometimes a pregnancy will need to end. If you can't get to the point where you understand that sometimes the woman does come first, women will never be able to be empowered to make the right choices.

well, now we got the medical definitions, that is cleared up pretty fast.Therefore we can conclude the morning after bill is abortion

A pregnancy begins with conception, when a sperm from a fertile male joins with an ovum (egg) of a fertile female. Source: Southwest Washington Medical Center A pregnancy begins with conception, when a sperm from a fertile male joins with an ovum (egg) of a fertile female. Source: University of Maryland Medical CenterYour pregnancy begins when one of your eggs is fertilized by a man's sperm in the fallopian tube. During the next few days, the fused egg and sperm move through the fallopian tube to the lining of the uterus. There it implants and starts to grow. Source: Rockingham Memorial Hospital

HOORAH! I completely agree with you except for the part where you said you "hate" liberals, lol. I don't find anything wrong with disliking, but I don't like the word hate. Other than that, stick to your ways! But actually, you must also think about what you can do for all of the children that the parents are going to reject, because if you stop abortion, someone has to take care of those children as the mother and/or father. So, if someone goes and completely shuts down abortion, part of their responsibility should be helping those children find a home ready to adopt a child. Anyway, that was totally awesome. HOORAH!

How can you think that a baby that isn't born yet a nonentity?yeah im only 15 and yet i know that what "abortionist's" say is a load of XXXX!! I feel sorry for you when i get older because im determined with all my heart to stop abortion! I believe God put me on this earth to stop you people from killing his creation! Hear my words i hate liberals and i will never change my mind about abortion. I try to love everyone but it's hard for me to love somebody who kills and innocent child.I am pro life!

Sure, she has a right to her own body. But just because the child is an inconvenience, does that give her a right to be so selfish as to take the child's life away? The fetus is a body of its own, and that child deserves the right to make his or her own choices as well. But who has the right to snuff out one of the few innocent things left in this world, and take those other rights away from the child before he/she even knows what they are?And how about this: If you were paralyzed and couldn't defend yourself in anyway, and were an inconvenience to your family, would you want them to kill you?

Cost of TV: $100-500Cost of raising child: $60,000-100,000Of course not. Misogynists also don't think so. And in the past, the slavers didn't think that slaves had the will to do whatever they wanted with their lives.Fascinating. So if somebody's life depends on it, they can force others to give of their bodily resources, then. Thanks for clarifying your position.Actually, the REALLY IMMATURE AND SELFISH position is to think that you can enslave another woman just because you don't like what she does."Unborn child"? Ah, like a pre-dead corpse. Ok, you are trying for revisionist linguistics and emotional imagery instead of looking at the woman as a person with a right to her own body. Hmm, no surprise there; that is how the prolifers must make their argument.And as such you DO insist on imposing your moral beliefs on another person's body. Guess you think that's OK. Hmm, wonder what things I can then force YOU to do?Concerning children conceived of rape, I think it’s wrong for the mother to suddenly feel she has the right to kill the unborn child.[/quote]Hmm, so rights are based on your prolife revisionist linguistics. Guess then, as you are a pre-dead corpse, and corpses have no rights, you have no rights at all.But then, the embryo is not a child, your revisionist linguistics none withstanding, that point is irrelevant.That aside, I noticed the dishonest claim you make about how the embryo or fetus being able to "experience" the abortion. That is, of course, a well-known prolife lie, and I am saddened that you so gullibly repeat it.Well, that's nice if you are a Christian who have decided to follow the fundamentalist and Catholic perversion of God's word to mean that God is against abortions (Yes, shocking that prolifers would lie like that). But otherwise, that is an irrelevant, as laws of the US certainly are not allowed to be made on the foundation of Biblical interpretation (Which you already know as you have read the 1st Amendment to the US Constitution).Again, there is no child. That aside, unless you want to force him to control her body, enslaving her. If he can get pregnant, he gets to control the pregnancy. Otherwise, per biology, he is out of luck.

I think Linus might actually be right about something :pI think the hate that many pro-lifers do have is not getting us anywhere. I will not say that all of us have hate but many do. Many are frustrated and mad at people that support killing a baby. I understand them getting mad however it doesn't help the cause one bit. For example (of a group not hating), there is this one group that stands in front of the supreme court with red tape on their mouth with the word LIFE. This group gets yelled at all the time by NOW and maybe other groups and they just stand there (with one person available to answer questions). This group has gained the respect of the guards at the Supreme court and many Senaters who go out there with them. So I gotta think that when someone goes up there and sees one group yelling and one group standing for a cause that the group yelling is not going to win over the outside viewers.So pro-lifers! Listen up. Don't be mad and don't hate. If you are pro-life you respect all life and shouldn't put down people. Gain respect not hate.

Every human life has value regardless of the "burden" it might place on others. No doubt a newborn infant places a significant burden on its parents. Yet, the parents never get the right to neglect it unto death. No doubt children who are mentally impaired might place a "burden" on other people. Yet, we ought not, by virtue of a subjective definition of "burden," have authority to determine who should live and who should not. Suppose an infant was born paralyzed from the first day it was born. This will obviously place a tremendous burden on its parents, but that fact alone does not give the parents, family, government, etc. the right to decide it should be executed. If undo burden on society was the standard, the social security debate would be solved immediately...we would simply get rid of it. Then, if the elderly are unable to sustain themselves, they would be executed because to keep them alive is to place an undo burden upon society. As soon as one starts determining the "quality of life" one person must attain to in order to be considered a person worthy of being protected, he/she has become a bigot.

There is no desire to execute anyone. The desire is to remove the fetus from the woman's care. You can indeed remove that infant from your care in a myriad of ways. You cannot compare the case of an infant and a fetus in this sense.ETA, I don't know if this exactly relates what you were talking about, but I did want to say something. This issue is not like social security where you could say "You technically do not have any right to the money so the gov't can take it away". You cannot say "You technically have no right to your own body so the gov't can use it or have it used as it sees fit" (well you can say it but it would show you to be fascist even more so than your pro-life philosophy currently does).No-one has a legal right over your organ and life-processes other than yourself. I do not have the right to live attached to another, you do not have that right, the President does not have that right and the fetus does not have that right. Even if the President was here in front of me and absolutely needed to attach himself to me in order to contiue living, I would have every legal right to refuse, and every legal right to smile and giggle while doing so. I would probably do both, as I detest the man. He would have no Constitutional authority to order nor would Congress be able to legislate a law stating "The President (or any other) has a right to live attached to Sigma's body against Sigma's will".Even the lowest convict who, theoretically, tortured and sexually molested hundreds of little girls and then killed them in the most horribly way imaginable would have every right to refuse having his organs harvested to save another's life, or to refuse to become the life-support system for another no matter who it is. Yet this is exactly what you wish to legislate for women, that they must provide the life-support system for another. It does not matter whether the fetus is considered a 'person' legally or a human 'being' philosophically, no-one has any right to live off of another's organs and life-processes against that person's will. Do you comprehend yet the horror that pro-choice people view your philosophy with? The disgust? This alone should give you pause, or you have no place saying you have "respect for life". There is no respect by any standard I have ever seen.There are some things the gov't cannot and should not be able to do.

Firstly, abortion has not been around since the beginning of mankind, although it’s been around for a while. Secondly, murder (which abortion is), has been around since the beginning of mankind. Now it’s a very dangerous procedure; you could be arrested or suffer death penalty. You seem to be quite ignorant about abortion. What exactly is abortion “eliminating”? What is being “eliminated”? You’re not answering my question. I’m not asking why she makes this choice; I’m asking what the choice does. Be very specific. Since when is it her body? Since when does a woman have a penis or two vaginas? And also, since when is it the mother’s choice whether her child should live or painfully die? Again, be specific.

My comparison was not between a fetus/infant, it was between a paralyzed infant/paralyzed adult. Jitobear said the government should not intervene in personal family affairs. But I disagree with the view that a parent/sibling/child can justafiably kill someone they deem an "inconvience" or undue "burden" on them. I think if you re-read what I said, it will be clear that this was the comparison I was making.What does that mean?Name calling is unbecoming of you... Suppose I grant that a right to own one's body actually exists. Yet we know this right is not always absolute. You obviously can be forced to serve in the military via a draft (wait, only men can be forced to do this...seems a bit unfair don't you agree?). Thus, in the case of military service, we see that the government can use one's body as it sees fit.Even granting that a right to abortion exists, it can obviously be revoked by due process (14th Amendment).Just as a point of clarification, the Supreme Court, who you hold as the absolute authority on everything, disagrees with you on this point. If the fetus is considered a person, it has the constitutional right to life that must be protected. Justice Blackmun wrote, "If [the] suggestion of personhood is established, the appellant's case, of course, collapses, for the fetus' right to life would then be guaranteed specifically by the Amendment." The Supreme Court obviously believes that if the fetus is proved to be a person, it has a right to life guaranteed by the Constitution. A right so strong, that Roe's case (the case arguing for the permissability of abortion) would collapse.I understand how they have come to a different conclusion than me, but I obviously disagree with them. Why do you feel the need to attack my personal character? It goes without saying that I have never accused you of not having a "respect for life" even though I fundamentally disagree with you. I do not debate your character; I simply disagree with your view. I don't call you a fascist; I simply disagree with your view. I don't spend all my waking hours dreaming up ways that I can opress women; I simply disagree with your view.

There is little reason to make the comparison with an infant in the way you suggest, especially in an abortion debate."Edited to add"It isn't "the right to do whatever one wants with ones body" it's the desire to not have others do things to your body.

No Sigma, I was not drawing a comparison between the infant and the fetus. I never said the word fetus or unborn or any other word that would apply to a fetus. But if you read it that way, I must not have been clear. So please allow me to clarify what I said.Jitobear was asked this questionShe responded withI was trying to say that the government has full right to step in in the case of the defenseless paralyzed adult human person. Even if such a person was a tremendous burden on their family, drew tremendous resources and finances from them, they still cannot kill this person. Hence we have laws preventing them from doing so. Thus, what I was trying to say to Jitobear was that you cannot determine what quality of life a person must attain to in order to have its life protected (notice I did not make the claim that a fetus is a person, thus this claim did not apply to a fetus).Then I gave another example that I hoped would strengthen my point: the one day old infant who was born paralyzed. I said:In essence I was simply making the claim that a paralyzed adult or infant has the same moral standing as you or I, and thus the government must protect its rights in the same manner it protects yours or mine, i.e., it must protect it from being killed. If the one's inherent worth is outweighed by a "burden" it places on someone, then it would be permissable for the social security problem to be solved in the way I described. I sure hope this clarifies what I was saying to Jitobear. If not, I'll give it another go.I will assume that pregnancy constitutes a forced donation of one's organs against their will and without their consent. The U.S. Military, however, regulates abortions on military bases in the following manner:Suppose a military servicewoman desires to have an abortion, but the only medical facility in which she could obtain one was in a military hospital. But, barring the cases of mother endangerment, rape, or incest, she would not be able to get an abortion. Here we see a clear example that a woman would be forced by the military (via U.S. Federal Law) to do that which you say she cannot be forced to do: "donate [her] organs against [her] will [seeing how she desires an abortion] and without her consent."I was speaking of a Constitutional Amendment as part of a "due proces" process. Thus, I think we agree on this.I know you disagree with them, but I was simply pointing out that the Supreme Court unanimously disagrees with your position here. I know you don't care, I just thought it would be a point of interest.I don't agree here either.What do you mean by "abandon this way of opressing women?" I don't understand what you are trying to say.

As in the Constitution, any powers not specifically limited to the Federal Gov't belong to us. They don't need to be specified.Again, you misrepresent what the pro-choice argument is. It is a desire to prevent something from happening to ones body, not to use it in anything a woman desires. A similar argument would be to refuse drugs that would save ones own life.
