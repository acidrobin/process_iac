And yet, just days after the Dover, PA trial about the introduction of ID into public schools as science has concluded, every single one of the incumbents on the Dover school board has been defeated in today's election. As chance would have it, all of them voted in favor of replacing science with the fable of IDcreationism in public schools.Kansas did it before, and now Dover, PA has done it. But still, the US District Court will give a decision that can be used as a precedent by the people of Kansas as they undergo their second attack by creationists against science.

I am sure the publiicity of the trial and the exposed motivations of the board members who voted to teach ID was an important part of the process. Even if they agree with ID, I am sure they thought that the board members did the Dover School District no favor in trying to push it.

Here's an excerpt from the article:The new standards say high school students must understand major evolutionary concepts. But they also declare that the basic Darwinian theory that all life had a common origin and that natural chemical processes created the building blocks of life have been challenged in recent years by fossil evidence and molecular biology.Walking-fish:The falsity of this statement about the challenge to Darwinism is subtle, and might go under some people's radar. It is true that there is scant evidence for a single common ancestor for all living organisms, but there are many well documented instances of common ancestry for certain taxons (cynodonts for mammals / theropod dinosaurs for birds / Choanoflagellates for sponges). However, the fossil evidence does not challenge common ancestry in any way; it is merely incomplete - an important distinction. Also, molecular biology, by the same token does not challenge abiogenesis; it only brings to light some unsolved problems. The big obfuscation here is to misrepresent the incompleteness of data in the fields of paleontology & molecular biology, by characterizing this as a "challenge" to the theory. That's like saying the controversy over whether Crispus Attucks was really the first person to die in the Boston Massacre poses a "challenge" to the existence this historical event.

The changes to the board of education standards will NOT materially change the way evolution is taught in Kansas, nor does it allow the teaching of creationism or intelligent design in our classrooms.Our districts scientific advisory board says the changes to the curriculum make it "more factually accurate", and even the folks who drafted the original curriculum could find no factual fault with the new draft.

According to most news reports, the board rewrote the definition of science, so that it is no longer limited to the search for natural explanations of phenomena.I have read the Findings of the Kansas State Department OF Education. In my cursory reading I found the following additions to the earlier versions.Science studies natural phenomena by formulating explanations that can be tested against the natural world. Some scientific concepts and theories (e.g., blood transfusion, human sexuality, nervous system role in consciousness, cosmological and biological evolution, etc.) may differ from the teachings of a student’s religious community or their cultural beliefs. Compelling student belief is inconsistent with the goal of education.There is then a statement that is not made about any other established scientific theory. “The view that living things in all the major kingdoms are modified descendants of a common ancestor (described in the pattern of a branching tree) has been challenged in recent years…”If your “board” laughed, they should revisit the story of the Jews in Germany in the early 1930’s, or France's Maginot line.

They laughed at that specifically ebcuase that wording was not chosen by the ID crowd, but by the dinosaur hunters. That is apparently a debate between some of the dino boys and the biologists. Apparently (and it was news to me), many dino hunters feel that the fossil record does not support the "common anscestor" thoery as well as it supports a multiple ancestor theory, more akin to a forest than a single branching tree.As it was explained to me, there are some who believe that instead of life evolving from a single life form, multiple life forms actually came into being, and not all of them evolved at the same rate or in the same direction. Hawking actually supports this theory based on the fact that life showed up on earth realtively early in the planets history. He theorizes that the beginnings of life are not as complex as many tend to believe, based on the fact that life showed up relatively early in teh history of the planet. Essentially, the planet became able to support life, and BOOM, there was life. Since the odds of a given event occuring generally increase as you increase the time span, it is reasonable to assume that if the generation of life was actually as complex as thought, it is unlikely that it would have occured so early. This is the same argument he makes for the possible existance of life on other planets. We know mathematically that there MUST be other planets capableof supporting life. HE argues that in absence of real evidence as to how life began, we must go with the most mathematically probable conclusion, and based on the short time span that it took for life to evolve on earth, and the resiliancy that life has shown, it is most probably that at least some of these other planets contain life.

With most of the other stuff, teaching the controversey is part of the overall subject matter. With evolution, it was not, and the prior language of some of the curriculem essentially prohibited the teaching of other theories. The problem is that you have inflexible nutters on both sides. On the ID side, they will not be happy unless you teach the "jesus made it happen" approach. Many on the other side will not be happy unless you teach a strict, straight line evolutionary theory. We had a biology teacher in Salina who was teaching the theory of punctuated equlibrium and some hard liner didn't like it (biology side). There was a hissy fit.My personal view on this is to teach what we KNOW, make sure the kids know what we are POSTULATING, and leave the ego out of it.Relistically, I don't believe the ID folks are right, and I don't think that the hard line evolutionists are right. I think there are some pieces missing that they are glossing over. I think that as we come to understand genetics better, and make more fossile discoveries, and come up with a better understanding of the mechanism that creates life, we will find that both sides are wrong. While we certainly have enough evidence to form several theories, we do not have nearly enough to draw a concrete conslusion, or to fully support the theory.

Is evolution the only VALID scientific theory about the origin of species? That depends on the meaning of the word valid.

That is EXACTLY my point. Kansas is now using the same definition of "science" as 36 other states. That is another one that was NOT penned by the ID folks, it is widely used.

Knowledge is a small part of who a person is, and what kind of a job he'll do. The job he does will also be determined by his motivations and goals. If he feels accountable only to man, he knows he can do things that can go undetected by man. If he feels acountable to God, he believes nothing he does goes undetected by God. Suppose your six year old is in the hospital needing serious, but not life threatening foot surgury. Down the hall is another six year old who needs a heart transplant, and has very rich parents. Word is discreetly getting around that the first doctor that comes up with a healthy 6 year old heart will never have to work again. Do you want a doctor who is only worried about accountability to man eyeing your childs chest? "We're sorry, but your child DIED during surgury, and I have malpractice insurance."Now I know it's not really that way, doctors C A R E about their patients. Yeah right, just like the auto parts man cares about the fenders and doors on all his cars. The doctor who believes everything happens by chance, is going to be more ethical than a doctor who believes in the Christian belief of purpose?

If he feels accountable only to man, he knows he can do things that can go undetected by man. If he feels acountable to God, he believes nothing he does goes undetected by God. Suppose your six year old is in the hospital needing serious, but not life threatening foot surgury. Down the hall is another six year old who needs a heart transplant, and has very rich parents. Word is discreetly getting around that the first doctor that comes up with a healthy 6 year old heart will never have to work again. Do you want a doctor who is only worried about accountability to man eyeing your childs chest? "We're sorry, but your child DIED during surgury, and I have malpractice insurance."Now I know it's not really that way, doctors C A R E about their patients. Yeah right, just like the auto parts man cares about the fenders and doors on all his cars. The doctor who believes everything happens by chance, is going to be more ethical than a doctor who believes in the Christian belief of purpose?

I really pity you Marc. Your life has been in the hands of atheists and agnostics and non-Christians many times without your knowing and here you are. Show a little class.

That is just sickening. You disgust me

I did not avoid it at all. As I said before, teaching different theories that meet the evidence at hand is inherent in the other subjects. In fact, in most cases, multiple theories are outlined in the subject matter. The previous guidlines involving the teaching of evolution essentially prohibited teaching any other theory or form of the theory. I even gave an example (teacher in Salina including punctuated equalibrium in his coursework).I am on the local schoolboard. I have the official copy sitting on the corner of my desk. I got twice daily updates, including trascripts, of the entire mess. I have probably fielded 200 phone calls on this, and spent upwards of 50 hours in meetings with the state board of education, various science advisory boards, and representative groups from all sides of the issue. I have been up to my eyeballs in this mess since the very start. I will admit that I am a little hostile towards this entire argument because frankly it is just plain stupid. Even those opposing the changes, when asked, were unable to point out any part of the changes that were factually inaccurate or that gave the impression that there was any kind of intelligent design at play. We consulted with some of the best biologists on the planet on this, and not a single one of them was able to point to any factual errors. In fact, when asked "As a percentage, how certain are you that the facts as they are outlined in the current curriculum are correct". The higest number any of them gave was 70%. Most answered 50-60% (oddly enough, most of the high school teachers we asked said they were 99% certain that the current mainstream theory was correct).What this tells me is that:A. The theory we were mandating being taught has some holes in itB. There must be some evidence to the contrary, or at least evidence that cannot be explained using the current modelsc. The better versed you are in biology, the better chance you have of understanding the problemsD. High school biology teachers are pretty poor judges of such things (which is important when you look around at the folks who are offering the most resistnace to this, you see a LOT of high school biology teachers)No, neither of those is a hypothesis, both are valid theories supported by physical evidence. Both are exceptionally well documented.I am not an ID nutter, I am just a school board member who has exhaustively researched this issue, been up to my eyeballs in it from day one, and am tired of jackasses making mountains out of molehills. I fully understand the scientific issues at stake, they have been explained to me by some of the best scientific minds on the planet, and they are negligible. The changes are NOTHING. They absolutly DO NOT allow or promote the teaching of ID. That is NOT allowed, nor will it ever be, and any teacher who tries it WILL be fired, first offence no warning.

Nobody said they were teaching creationism in schools – and, you totally avoided my question. Why is the “teach aspects of a theory that are under attack” clause limited to the Theory of Evolution? Why not germ theory – which also has issues with some scientists? Why not the Wave theory of sound? Why limit it to evolution?I add one other question: What is your source for the definition of “Science” used by the Kansas Board of Ed?And, by the way, the two things you are calling "theories' are actually hypotheses. Should we teach every hypothesis that might challenge a valid theory should that hypothesis meet the criteria of a valid scientific theory – in grade school? No, you are obviously a proponent of ID who has no understanding of the scientific issues at stake.

Please explain what you think punctuated equilibrium is. Please explain what the teacher was presenting as punctuated equilibrium.I suspect that it was not actually the theory of punctuated equilibrium but some form of saltationism that he called punctuated equilibrium. I also suspect that you don't know what it is either.

There are no valid scientific theories that refute the basics of evolutionary theory. If you read the Kansas School Board Conclusions, you would have seen the following: “The view that living things in all the major kingdoms are modified descendants of a common ancestor (described in the pattern of a branching tree) has been challenged in recent years…” There has been no valid scientific theory that has withstood peer review and challenged the evolutionary theory of common ancestry: not the theory of punctuated equilibrium or the theory of multiple origins of life. The only challenge has been from the proponents of ID. Why is that clause in there and only in there in reference to evolution?

Is evolution the only VALID scientific theory about the origin of species? That depends on the meaning of the word valid. I have no problem exploring other scientific theories, but the key word there is SCIENTIFIC. We study evolution because right now it is the only theory with not just some, but AMPLE evidence supporing it. ID is not a scientific theory, it is a religious theory that people are trying to use science to justify.I'm open to exploring many different scientific theories about the origin of species and I think we should give serious examination of intelligent design theories...just not in science class.

And that is the basis of my question of Daewoo above. He claims that a teacher was censured for teaching the theory of punctuated equilibria. I strongly suspect that Daewoo actually doesn't know what the theory of punk eek is, and I further suspect that the teacher was teaching some form of a discredited theory of saltationism. Such remarks are typical of Daewoo, where he claims knowledge and then demonstrates ignorance.

Too bad so many schoolboard officials are influenced by religion and anti-science. I hope all communities vote for schoolboard representatives the way Dover PA did. But the citiziens in more religious regions of the US - like just about anywhere in Kansas - are dumber, and not as likely to do so. It's a shame.

As it was explained to me (and remember I am not a biologist, nor do I have any particular interest in the subject), the theory essentially holds that, instead of the long, slow changes that darwinism proposes, Evolution instead happens as a series of "jumps". YOu have a long period of little or no evolutionary activity, followed by a virtual explosion of evolutionary change in a species (or multiple species), where new species crop up and old ones die out in a realtiviely short period of time (a few hundred thousand or a few million years). Saltationism holds that changes occur as a single step. That is just silly.

That is what YOU are missing. Our prvious standards were so stringent that the teaching of punctuated equilibrium or multiple origins were taboo. The previous standards were written by folks whose primary goal was to wipe out the possibililty of intelligent design. In doing so, they wiped out the possibilities inherint in many theories that are quite compatible with darwinism.The problem with wiping out the possibility of intelligent design is that in order to do so, you have to be able to say "we know EXACTLY what happened, how it happened, when it happened, and where it happened". We are far from being able to do that, but that is essentially the way we had things laid out in the past. We had, bar none, the most restrictive curriculum anywhere in the country when it comes to evolution. Now we have loosened it up a little. Our curriculum is STILL more restrictive than most states. We are now using the EXACT same definiton of "science" as MOST other states. What many here don't seem to grasp, is that I could care less what our kids think about evolution. It really does not matter to me. All I care about is how they test against other kids in other schools. That is where our ranking comes from, and that is what parents look at. The state school board cares about the same thing. Under the old guidelines, Kansas kids fell from 4th in the nation in biology to 12th, and in reviewing the subject matter it was clear that our curriculum was too strict, and our kids were not learning enough to test well.I could absolutly care less what any teacher, or individual parent, has to say about all this. What I care about is that our kids will graduate understanding concepts like puncuated equilibrium, multiple origins of life, etc... as opposed to learning the single theory previously taught which is that at one point proteins came together in a single place, life started, and every bit of life on this earth evolved from those proteins in a slow, predictable manner for the next several millenia. I do not know what the future holds for the state school board. Unfortunatly, they do not have the advantage of local school boards, which is the ability to call a big meeting and explain what is going on, so a lot of folks in kansas are in the same position as a lot of folks on this board....thowing their hands in the air yelling "the sky is falling" when in reality, the changes are minimal, probably for the better, and in NO WAY allow for the teaching of intelligent design or even the MENTION of intelligent design in our classrooms. It is funny, usually I class the ID nutters as the ignorant fools in debates like this. I am finding, now that I am in the middle of such a debate on a daily basis, that the real ignorant fools are the commentators. Most of the people I have seen comment on this, and not just here, have absolutly NO IDEA what the changes were, have absolutly NO IDEA how our standards compare to those of other states, and have absolutly NO IDEA that ID is still ataboo concept in our classrooms. I actually saw some idiot the other day arguing that kansas is now requiring teachers to teach Intelligent Design. I suppose a teacher could try it, but since at the end of their first day they would be fired, they had better figure out a way to come up with an incredibly fast, hard hitting lesson.BTW, my definiiton of science is coming directly from my copy of the standards that came from the state. It is entitled "academic standards of excellence, 2006" and is on pg 641 (there are 1100 pages). The version I have is distributed to school boards and school administrators. They have a different version available for the public for a modest fee ($4). I would suggest that those of you who are up in arms order it.

Do they mention such a note of caution about compelling student belief in regard to teaching how relativity theory dispensed with the "Ether theory" of space, or how the periodic table may contradict the alchemical theory of "Four Elements" for Wiccans etc... Modern biology & geology completely dismiss the YEC belief in a 6,000 year old Earth. There is no way you can teach the facts of science without completely debunking some (but not all) religious & philosophical beliefs. That caveat is there only to cast doubt on the validity of well substantiated facts in biology, in general, and evolution in particular.

Compelling student belief is inconsistent with the goal of education."That is from an earlier draft. The thing still has not been finalized. As far as I know, the definition I gave was the latest one that actually made it through comitee, though there may be another one out there that I am unaware of. What the school board has approved thus far are NOT changes that will go out to the schools/teachers. Those changes are still in the works. What has been changed thus far is essentially the basic outline, the underlying materials are still in the works.

Do they mention such a note of caution about compelling student belief in regard to teaching how relativity theory dispensed with the "Ether theory" of space, or how the periodic table may contradict the alchemical theory of "Four Elements" for Wiccans etc... Modern biology & geology completely dismiss the YEC belief in a 6,000 year old Earth. There is no way you can teach the facts of science without completely debunking some (but not all) religious & philosophical beliefs. That caveat is there only to cast doubt on the validity of well substantiated facts in biology, in general, and evolution in particular.

The controversial Kansas Science Education Standards were approved by the Kansas State Board of Education on November 8, 2005. The copy I have is from attorneys studying the legal ramifications. I suggest that you get a copy before posting further. On page ix, in the section titled “Nature of Science”, it defines science as follows: “Science is a systematic method of continuing investigation that uses observation, hypothesis testing, measurement, experimentation, logical argument and theory building to lead to more adequate explanations of natural phenomena.” Compare that with the accepted definition of science which you posted and erroneously stated was the definition used by the Kansas State board of Education. It reads: “Science is a human activity of systematically seeking natural explanations for what we observe in the world around us.”As has been accurately reported, the School Board rewrote the definition of science so that it is no longer limited to the search for natural explanations of phenomena.If you don’t see that as a major problem, and if you really do sit on a school board, you should resign your position.

The ones I have were published oct 27, 2005. Where did you get yours? We are obviosly not looking at the same book. I did not even know that they published a version that was ONLY for science. Exactly what definition of "science" does your copy have? Is it hard copy, or electronic? Finally, what is the revision number on it? If it is newer, and different, from mine, I would like to dig up a copy of it for review.

Your version is, indeed, newer than mine. I will probably get the update in mondays mail.Lets look at how some other states define "science" before we decide how important the "natural" is:In fact, the only state that has a definition that contains wording even similar to the wording of the prior definiton that kansas used was Mass:Nine states offer no explanation or definition of science. Which state do you live in? Odds are, you REALLY need to start working on your own state school board before you start worrying about ours here in Kansas. Our schools are rated in the top 10 in the coutnry in all categories. They will continue to do so. I am sorry about citing an old work, and thank you fro the correction. I admit I was a little confused, because the definition in my copy was MUCH longer than definition I had for other states, yet just last week I was assured that the definition we were using was compatible or nearly identical to definitions used in 37 other states, and VERY similar to definitions used in 3 more. That put on par with 40 states. Good enough for me. It was not until just now that I happened to look at the handout from that meeting that I noticed that of the 10 states that we did not closely mirror in our definition, 9 of them HAVE no definition to offer.I stand by my position. I have yet to see anybody offer any substantial reason or evidence that the changes are factually inaccurate or improper in any way. Reall,y Howard, what state are you in? What about you, Pandion? Lets see how your states stack up.

Those state's definitions of science can be scary when compared to standards of less than 100 years ago. In 1925, the ACLU advertised for a teacher who would be willing to challange the state of Tennessee's Butler Act, which prohibited teaching the theory of evolution in state public schools and UNIVERSITIES.Times do change.

I have just been informed that the handout we got is available online at http://www.ksde.org/outcomes/scepttestimonywells1.pdfIt includes links to every states definition of science (I wish I had known this before, it would have saved me a lot of trouble). Again, What state are you in? Lets see what your states definition of "science" is. You REALLY need to take a look at some of the other states standards and you will understand why we are in the top 10 nationwide for our schools. Resign? Why? So I can be replaced by some reactionary idiot? People elected me because they were tired of reactionary XXXXXX. I admit I have not stayed as up to date as I should have for the last few months. Why? Because in Kansas, local school board decide curriculum, not the state board of education. Our curriculum will not be changing at all. As far as I know, there are only a handful (less than 20) school districts in the entire state that adopt the state boards curriculum verbatim. I would be surprised if the changes make ANY difference at all. The biggest component of the controversy seems to be out of state XXXXXX with no idea what they are talking about, and no idea how things work here, making ridiculous accusations as far as the states board of education curriculum goes.You said that you were studying the legal ramifications of the changes. What could those ramifications possibly be, since the odds of them actually making any material difference in the classroom at all are almost zero, and no material changes to how evolution is taught were made?Again, I stand by my original position. The changes are non issues. The curriculum is less limiting, but still does not allow for the teaching of ID. Again, exactly which portions of the changes do you find offensive or feel are outside of the norm? Which are factually inaccurate? I ahve made this challenge here at elast a half dozen times in different threads, and have yet to have anybody really respond. The closest anybody has come are the same lame objections you have made to the changing of the definition of science.

Why scary? The world has moved on. I simply don't understand why we are taking all this XXXX in kansas when what we have effectively done is joined the rest of the country in our definition of "science", and we operate some of the best schools in the country.

Because you can’t even acknowledge the difference between two different definitions of science, that is why. Your claim that it is no big deal is disingenuous at best. Please explain to me what the purpose is in redefining science so that it is no longer limited to the search for natural explanations of phenomena? Don’t you think that you have a responsibility to answer that question?

Why? We are talking about teaching FACTS. You cannot teach ID without asking people to make huge leaps of faith. Faith belongs in church, not in school. In school, we pass on facts.

That is because in reality, there is none. Could supernatural explanations be included under the current definition? Of course, as long as they include "observation, hypothesis testing, measurement, experimentation, logical argument and theory building to lead to more adequate explanations of natural phenomena".I don't think that we are any real danger there. Then again, that is what science does, it turns the supernatural to the mundane. At one time, people were mystified by the miracle of spontaneous generation. People have marveled at the obviously supernatural force of photosynthesis. Purely political. Again, who cares? We are now marching in lockstep with 40 other states. We still have some of the best schools in the country, and our kids will ocntinue to excell in science, including biology. If anything, our new standards, while still the strictest in the nation, open the door for more aspects of evolutionary theory to be taught. That is something else that people here seem to fail to grasp. SOmetimes, you make political decisions. If you can get a noisy group by the fundies off your back wihtout doing any damage anywhere else, you do it. The state school board threw them a bone. Now they will go back to their corner. I don't know if you have caught this or not, but as Americans become more fearful about the world we live in (terrorism, economy, etc...) religous lunacy is sweeping the country.In truth, the State board of education did what good politicians should do. They had a group of constituents who wanted a change. They analyzed the change and recognized that the change would not cost anything. It would not hurt any other group. It would not damage the education of the states children (which is theoretically the responsibility of that group of politicians), and it does nto infringe on anybodies rights. So, they made the change. There were absolutly no negatives, no down side, to the changes. The up side, however, is that while no ID is still a taboo topic, the funides are back in their corner, and the curriculum involving evolution actually has more depth than it previously did. Unfortunatly, the whole thing has become a circus. The media, looking for a juicy story, has proclaimed such idiotic things as "Kansas has cleared the way for the teaching of intelligent design". People are wandering around mortified at the fact that they removed the word "natural" from the definition of science, when what they have done puts in the same category as the definition of "science" in 40 other states.

Daewoo:Your academic principles and your educational values are very disappointing. Your defense of your state board of education – right or wrong – is troubling to witness. As a member of a school board, I would think that your position would be that you would want a definition of science (or any academic discipline) that you are going to teach your students to be of the highest standard. This settling for the mediocre (in my opinion inferior) does not set a good example for any one last of all the students whose interest should be the primary concern.A state board of education settling on something for political reasons and not because it is in the best interests of the students is a most egregious act of duplicity. Sanctioning that act is aiding and abetting that act. It is extremely distressing. In my opinion, it is grounds enough to vote a school board member out of office if they do not have the moral fiber to resign.It appears that in Kansas neither the state board of ed nor the local school boards are willing to stand up for the best interests of the students. That is why there is this “circus” you lament. Someone has to stand up for the best interests of the students and the sounder the definition of science is and the school curriculum is, the better for the students.It is a shame that you cannot see that the Kansas Board of Education took a step backwards on November 8, 2005.

How is it inferior? AS I said above:If supernatural explanations can meet that criteria, then so be it. Maybe the day will come that we discover that our planet was seeded by aliens, or that we are all descended from bacteria left behind when an alien stoppoed off to take a dump. Who knows? Until we have all th answers, ruling things out completely is foolish. Maybe, though some bizarre twist in spacetime, we are all descended from other humans or animals that dropped through a wormhole from an alternate earth. Who knows? Maybe the ID folks are right. Maybe the entire universe is nothing bu an experiment in a petri dish in the lab of some enormous creature (probably more likely than the "invisible man in the sky" theory that most ID types hold). Who knows? As I said before, science turns the supernatural into the mundane. That is more or less its job. The monk who discredited spontaneous generation was trying to prove creationism. He did not suceed, but his line of study led to several breakthroughs in biology. The new definition is only "inferior" if you are not a creationist, and not an evolutionist, but that twisted third option....and anti creationist. Anti creationists tend to be more interested in stamping out the theory of creation or intelligent design than they are in passing on valid scientific fact. The SOLE purpose of the "natural" that was to take a jab ot the creationist/ID crowd and tick them off. Including it in no way strengthens the definition. It ever should have been in there. I was talking about the politics of the thing before. In that case, you ahd one crowd pushing for the inclusion of something that ticked off the rest of the folks, and for no good reason. There was no reason to include it. It was a bad decision. Theose who made it are no longer on the school board. Welcome to the real world. Our board of education is elected. When you take an elected post, you play politics,m or you do not stay in that post for very long. Our current board has gotten increased funding for our schools, instituted more stringent guidelines regarding literacy and literacy testing, and has done a GREAT job of getting state assistance for poor school districts to help get their programs up to speed with the rest fo the state. The primary accomplishment of the last bunch was to tick off a bunch of religous fundies. They did nothing positive their entire time in office becuase they spent all their time fighting off attacks due to their stupidity in handling the matter. You still have not managed to expalin to me HOW. HOW does the removal of the word "natural" have any material effect on the definition, especially since the requirements laid out in the rest of the definition absolutly deny any supernatural rediculousness? ONE other state contained anything approaching similar language, and theirs comes after a small novel explaining science. Anything that will meet the requirements of the rest of the defintion MUST be natural, even if it is somthing that is currently considered supernatural. There is NO possibility that all of the other requirements could be met, and you come to a supernatural conclusion, becuase the other requirements specifically bars the supernatural.What supernatural phenomenon can you measure?What supernatural phenomenon can you accurately test a hypothesis on?What supernatural hypothesis allows you to build a solid theory?What supernatural phenomenon allows you to take th above and build a logical argument around it?NONE,.All that has been odne is redundancy is removed. You have yet to show how this is really a step backward or show any way that this is going to hurt our children, or their educations. Go ahead, make your case, make me a believer.

How is it inferior?In your opinion both definitions are the same because you think that you can prophesy how they will be implemented in the future. You think that you can foresee all the unintended consequences. Well, the fact is: you can’t. That is why we should do what is right, not what is politically expedient. One definition allows for the possibility of theories other than those based on nature and the other specifically says scientific theories are based in nature. The fact that you cannot see that is stunning.In the first place, the condescension is not necessary or appropriate.Just because an erroneous decision is arrived at for political reasons does not mean that everyone should just accept it. People need to speak up. Declaring a slave to be sixth tenths of a human being in our Constitution was also a political compromise, using your way of thinking, it was no big deal and nobody should have made a ruckus about it.The rest of your post is just a pathetic defense of mediocrity -- especially since you have not even read the standards in question that were passed on November 8. You’d think that you would have the self-respect to wait until you had read the standards in question before voicing an opinion, especially since the definition does not limit the criteria for establishing acceptable subject matter to be taught in a science class the way you claim it does (without having read it).Once you remove the phrase “seeking natural explanations”, then observation is not limited to observation of natural phenomena, logical argument does not have to postulate natural phenomena, hypotheses do not have to be based on natural phenomena, and theories do not have to be built on natural phenomena. Don’t you get it?

This is essentially an unfounded, unsupported, slippery slope argument. This is essentially the same definition being used by FORTY states. If you look at the time frames on the links to the definitions used by individual states, and many cases, the defintion has remained unchanged for FORTY or more years. In all that time, in all those cases, surely you can produce a few cases where lack of the word "natural" in relation to the explanaiton caused some grievous harm. You cannot even produce for my a HYPOTHETICAL situation where the difference in wording will cause problems. WRONG. Apparently you missed the part where I said it was the right thing to do because:A. People wanted itB. Nobodies rights were infringed by granting itC. No reasonable justification could be given for withholding the changedD. the changes do not in any way harm or hamper the education of the kids, which is the primary responsibility of that board.Declarin a slave to be 6/10 of a person does not meet the above criteria.I have now read it. It came in Thursdays amil and I just hadn't bpothered to open it yet. Lets look at the WHOLE paragraph you cite from, not just the first sentence:I do get it. this is a bunch of idealogical garbage. Unless you can come up with an example of a time when standards from those other 39 states have led to a problem, or even a realistic hypothetical situtation where the omission could lead to an actual problem, I think I am done here. You are simply making yourself look like a fanatic and a fool. The criteria set forth in the definiiton of science clearly excludes any type fo supernatural mumbo jumbo.

How is it inferior?In your opinion both definitions are the same because you think that you can prophesy how they will be implemented in the future. You think that you can foresee all the unintended consequences. Well, the fact is: you can’t. That is why we should do what is right, not what is politically expedient. One definition allows for the possibility of theories other than those based on nature and the other specifically says scientific theories are based in nature. The fact that you cannot see that is stunning.In the first place, the condescension is not necessary or appropriate.Just because an erroneous decision is arrived at for political reasons does not mean that everyone should just accept it. People need to speak up. Declaring a slave to be sixth tenths of a human being in our Constitution was also a political compromise, using your way of thinking, it was no big deal and nobody should have made a ruckus about it.The rest of your post is just a pathetic defense of mediocrity -- especially since you have not even read the standards in question that were passed on November 8. You’d think that you would have the self-respect to wait until you had read the standards in question before voicing an opinion, especially since the definition does not limit the criteria for establishing acceptable subject matter to be taught in a science class the way you claim it does (without having read it).Once you remove the phrase “seeking natural explanations”, then observation is not limited to observation of natural phenomena, logical argument does not have to postulate natural phenomena, hypotheses do not have to be based on natural phenomena, and theories do not have to be built on natural phenomena. Don’t you get it?

Daewoo:Your verbose diatribe said little other than “show me the how this is a step backwards.” I have shown you what happens if you remove the phrase “seeking natural explanations” from the definition of science. You are so blinded that you will not acknowledge that it changes the definition in any way. I have shown you how it does. You believe that no longer limiting science to seeking natural explanations is no big deal. Anyone who understands language, especially governmental and legal word usage knows differently. I suggest you take the old Kansas Board of Ed definition of science and the new one to a contracts attorney and ask his opinion as to whether taking the phrase “seeking natural explanations” out of the definition affect the definition. I think it is your responsibility.

This is essentially an unfounded, unsupported, slippery slope argument. This is essentially the same definition being used by FORTY states. If you look at the time frames on the links to the definitions used by individual states, and many cases, the defintion has remained unchanged for FORTY or more years. In all that time, in all those cases, surely you can produce a few cases where lack of the word "natural" in relation to the explanaiton caused some grievous harm. You cannot even produce for my a HYPOTHETICAL situation where the difference in wording will cause problems. WRONG. Apparently you missed the part where I said it was the right thing to do because:A. People wanted itB. Nobodies rights were infringed by granting itC. No reasonable justification could be given for withholding the changedD. the changes do not in any way harm or hamper the education of the kids, which is the primary responsibility of that board.Declarin a slave to be 6/10 of a person does not meet the above criteria.I have now read it. It came in Thursdays amil and I just hadn't bpothered to open it yet. Lets look at the WHOLE paragraph you cite from, not just the first sentence:I do get it. this is a bunch of idealogical garbage. Unless you can come up with an example of a time when standards from those other 39 states have led to a problem, or even a realistic hypothetical situtation where the omission could lead to an actual problem, I think I am done here. You are simply making yourself look like a fanatic and a fool. The criteria set forth in the definiiton of science clearly excludes any type fo supernatural mumbo jumbo. If they conditions set forth do NOT exclude supernatural mumbo jumbo, then it cannot be supernatural mumbo jumbo, it MUST be natural, and just not well understood.Lets look at the ENTIRE section under "Nature of Science" (gotta love OCR) instead of just the first sentence.Those who have advised us on this are some of the best scientists on the planet.

No, you need to show that it does. I have laid out my argument as to why it does not, namely because the rest of the definition is so stringent that removal of the word "natural" in no way changes the basic scope of the definition. Why would I take it to a contract attorney? It is not a legal document.I will take this as your concession. Obviously, despite your blustering, you are unable to find a single case to cite where a definiton of "science" not worded to specifically include "natural" as the former Kansas defintion did caused a leap to the realm of the supernatural, depsite the fact that 39 other states use similar defintions and in most cases have for years. You are not even able to formulate a hypothetical case.

Creationists like Daewoo need to remove references to science seeking "naturalistic explanations" from the definition so that they can introduce spiritualism as part of science. This opens the door, and no matter how much they claim otherwise, this definition allows them to pretend that supernatural claims are legitimate science. Since "creation science" didn't work and got thrown out by the courts, the new attack is to try to create gaps in real science where they can cram their god.

The fact that you believe that one definition limits exploration to “natural explanations” and the other does not and thereby opens the door to explanations other than natural ones, says it all. I cannot make someone open their mind, I can only request that. You decline the request. That is your prerogative.Why? Because you might learn something. But that is another thing you have declined to de. Obviously, you believe that you have little to learn. It is your right to believe whatever you chose to and to decline the opportunity to learn more than you already know.You can take it as whatever you chose. You seem to have a unique understanding of words.I have shown you that deleting the phrase “seeking natural explanations” opens the door for explanations other than natural. There is also no specific reference to the scientific method. Let us try to take it step by step..The definition of science approved by the Kansas Board of Ed is: “Science is a systematic method of continuing investigation that uses observation, hypothesis testing, measurement, experimentation, logical argument and theory building to lead to more adequate explanations of natural phenomena.”  My position is that: There is no requirement that the “observation, hypothesis testing, measurement, experimentation, logical argument and theory building” mentioned in the definition be based on nature or natural law.  Do you agree that the statement is bold is an accurate finding based on the definition of science of the KBoE (Kansas Board of Education) with regards to the characterization of the explanations that are permitted under that definition?

No, I do not. The rest of the statement, “observation, hypothesis testing, measurement, experimentation, logical argument and theory building” disqualifies the supernatural.

This means that tens, if not hundreds, of millions of children have been taught using a very similar defintion of science. Th simple fact of the matter is that you are focusing on two words while ignoring the rest of the statement, and the implications of that statement, and you are dead wrong in your conclusion.On your advise, I emailed a copy of this to my attorney. He is a former senator and one of the top business lawyers in the country (never pays to skimp on your attorney).

I said I was done, unless you could provide an example, which you have not. Just to clear this up for you.Is there such a thing as a spiritual hypothesis? Of course there is. Now, you explain to me what kind of observations you would include in order to validate that hypothesis. What kind of testing? Measurement? whoops, does not fit the criteria.Of course there are, and what those people are doing is trying to bring paranormal investigation into the realm of "science". As far as I know, none have yet suceeded, becasue they lack the other components, including repeatable tests. ixNoter it does not give the opition of picking and choosing which components you wish to use, as you have tried to do in your juvenile outburst above.Strict empirical standardsMUST MEET CETAIN CRITERIA. There are a few of them. Here is another one:Wow. Must meet criteria that govern repeatablitly of observations and experiments. why?Is that enough? Again, until you come back with an example, I am done here.

But that is the point. The IDers and the folks from the Discovery Institute claim that they are doing exactly that. The point is that they are claiming that ID should be presented as an alternative scientific theory. They have several bogus hypotheses and have developed algorythms by which they claim that they can detect design. Of course, all of this is about 10 years old and we have seen nothing new in several years, and no real scientific research at all. Nevertheless, IDers claim that supernatural explanations should be taught because they claim that they can detect the intervention of a supernatural being in biology.But you knew that, didn't you?

Ahhh, but you have led to an entirely different problem. IF they can come up with "proof" that actually meets that criteria, whether the worn "natural" is there or not will make no difference, because obviously if they can come up with an explanation that fits within that framework, it is obviously natural, even if it does involve god, aliens, or flying spaghetti monsters. That is because "natural" is a term that can be bent to suit almost any purpose. Gunpowder is "natural", it is sulphur, carbon, and saltpeter. All natural substances. Plastic is "natural" it is made out of oil, which comes right out of mother earth. What could possibly be more natural than that?If they want to try to "prove" intelligent design, let them try. The guy who disproved spontaneous generation was trying to prove that god was implanting the creatures there. Where would we be if he had not? The fricitonless air bearings we have today are bsed on the design of a guy who was trying to sell a perpetual motion machine. Whether the word "natural" is included or not is irrelevant to the argument.Besides, pandion, it seems liek you shoud REALLY be working to change the defintion of "science" in your home state bfore you declare that kansas is full of XXXXXX for lightening up ours.

Sorry, Daewoo, for a subject to be discussed in Kansas science classroom, there is no requirement of “proof” of any kind in the KBoE science standards. If I am wrong, site the paragraph and page number where “proof” is required.However the KBoE science standards does not state that science seeks natural explanations and there is no place in the publication that supports what you say.The same can be said if aspects of evolution. Some cannot be proven either. That is why it is a scientific theory, not a scientific fact. When you expand the definition of science beyond the seeking of natural explanations, then theories that seek other explanations can be introduced.If science does not seek “natural explanations”, it leaves open the possibility of explanations that are not natural, beyond natural, supernatural, etc.Perhaps he is. Perhaps he is not on a school board as you claim to be.

Sure: Resolved:In the definition of Science on page ix of the Science Standards adopted by the Kansas Board of Education on November 8, 2005, there is no requirement that science seek “natural solutions” or that the “observation, hypothesis testing, measurement, experimentation, logical argument and theory building” be based on nature, natural phenomena or natural law.Or you could simply reply to my previous post and answer my questions and show me wrong.

Hi there! Upon reading this thread I decided to sign in an post some information. There's a slim chance I might return to this site, but probably not. I think it's a good idea to post some things that might clear things up on this thread or it might make it even more confusing. The new Kansas School Board standards does exclude the term "natural explanations" as seen on page 10. A newsletter sent out by state School Board member, Connie Morris, seems to indicate that the new standards are in response to the teaching of evolution and would also lead one to believe that the motivations behind the change are religious. William Demski calls the recent ruling in Kansas The evolution ruling and also says that there is progress in Kansas for ID since evolution had a "setback."Daewoo's argument on this issue seems to mirror that of the Discovery Institute. This is a very interesting case for me. So far, I can't decide if it really is just media sensationalism or since the changes in the Kansas standards are indeed religioulsy motivated, that there is more to it than that.
