Yea, and so is gardening. Both are "murdering" living things. Both do not mentally exist. A strand of DNA is the only difference, which isn't very much.

Does the baby mentally exist? Is it a person? I need more info.And? Ignoring your absurd claim that an embryo can choose its location, why does it matter. There is nobody living inside of the baby, it is not mentally existing. It would be the equivalent of chopping someone's head off and calling the body a person.

Speaking of chopping heads off...what would you say if the mother of this child, having delivered it at 22 weeks, decided she did not want to care for it anymore (or was really mad at it for coming so early), and therefore she wanted to chop its head off. What would you say of this scenario, considering that a fetus/child at 22 weeks does not possess the magic trump card of "mental existence"?

How much did it cost to bring this child to a point of viability outside the hospital?And, are we, as a largely repulsively Republican pennypinching society, ready to expend the funds for every such birth?Was this child white?Would we spend a similar amount on a black child?Are the monies where the mouths are?

This is the pro-choice worldview at its finest.You're right. We should go ahead and throw every such child in the trash. They are too much of a burden on society at large. Come to think of it, most of the elderly are a burden on society much in the same way. Let's go ahead and off them too.

Nobody on the pro-choice side is arguing for killing a fetus once it is born as a baby (this being the official definition of baby) since there would be no reason for killing it. The rights of the woman over her own body would no longer be involved and it is those rights which pro-choice proponents wish to protect.The problem arises if you claim that, since this one premature baby was able to survive at 21 weeks, then no woman should be allowed to abort because the fetus MIGHT survive at 21 weeks. The reality of the situation is that, if such a law were introduced, then the great majority of women with unwanted pregnancies would still have to carry that pregnancy against their will since they or society could not afford for all of those unwanted pregnancies to result in premature birth at 21 weeks. So, we would be left with the same situation that we are currently faced with. Namely, do we value the woman's rights over her own body more or do we value the rights of that fetus (which is still in her body) at 21 weeks of development? Without a mental existence in that fetus, most of us on the pro-choice side would take the side of the woman in that case.

While this is true, the number of abortions at or after 21 weeks is not insignificant. According to the Guttemacher Institute, 1.2% of abortions occur at or after 21 weeks. That translates into about 15,480 abortions. This thread, of course, is talking specifically about those 15,480 abortions.

Though, I often wonder how a woman could get so far along a pregnancy without knowing or thinking she could be pregnant. I'm not sure I'm entirely happy with abortions at this late stage, though I am pro-choice -- it seems bizarre to me that anyone could get beyond the first trimester without wondering when she last had a period and taking a test.

Quite honestly, I did not notice this thread having any one particular point. However, perhaps I misinterpreted, but there seemed to be statements thrown around suggesting that it is evil to abort a fetus at 21 weeks because it could survive outside the womb at 21 weeks. My post was mostly in response to such sentiments.As for viability arguements, there are a few points that I would bring up:1. Once the fetus is living outside the womb - ex. in premature birth - then nobody on the pro-choice side (to my knowledge) would advocate killing it since there is no reason to do so - there is no competition between rights.2. Roe vs Wade uses that viability arguement in allowing states to outlaw abortion (exception for risks to a mother's health or life) once the fetus becomes viable. I am personally currently comfortable with that stance since it coincides fairly closely in time with my own critical criteria of the possible emergence of a mental existence - also roughly at the start of the third trimester. However, I agree with you that viability is not a strong arguement to use. For example, if someday artificial wombs would be developed which could sustain an embryo after, say, a few weeks, then do we call that embryo viable and prevent all women from having abortions at that stage? I would say no.

I've also wondered about this. The great majority of abortions are indeed performed in the first trimester - some statistics from http://www.policyalmanac.org/culture...atistics.shtml :57% of abortions occur at <8 weeks of gestation87% of abortions occur at <13 weeks of gestation4.3% were at 16--20 weeks of gestation1.4% were at >21 weeksThis shows that the great majority of women do discover their pregnancies fairly quickly and choose and carry out their abortions also fairly quickly.My understanding from other sources are that those that occur around the third trimester are almost exclusively for reasons related to risks to the mother's life or health. Though I don't have the time to find some backup material, I would assume that most abortions performed in the first trimester are done by choice for reasons other than risks to life or health and that this fraction goes down as you move away from first trimester into the second and then third trimester. It would be a rare woman woman who does not realize that she is pregnant until many months into a pregnancy. However, I did hear of a humorous story once of a very obese woman who was surprised to give birth to a baby since she didn't realize that she was pregnant.

Your point? Most doctors won't perform brain surgery. Do they have moral objections?

As I have said in other threads, I do value the fetus prior to mental existence for its potential to grow into more but I place less value on that potential than I do on a woman's right to her own body. Take away the issue of the woman's right over her own body (as in this case, since the fetus is already born) and what you have left is the value of the potential of that fetus. That new baby is not hurting anyone so why kill it?It is fairly close but my concern is that, if future technologies arise which might sustain an embryo after, say, a few weeks, then arguements would be presented that such an embryo would be viable and that abortions from that time on should be outlawed. My arguement is basically against the idea that viability = rights to life because it is not viability that I find critical but mental existence. I recognize that Roe vs Wade uses the viability arguement which is the one thing that I find personally wrong with Roe vs Wade. Otherwise, I don't have much problem with Roe vs Wade as it currently stands since currently the time of viability roughly corresponds to the time when mental existence could occur.The newborn premature baby at 22 weeks might be at the same developmental stage as an aborted fetus at 22 weeks, but what exactly is that stage and what characteristics did both possess? Neither possessed a mental existence at that stage. Just because the fetus is out of the womb doesn't mean that it mentally exists so any image you have of feelings, suffering, etc. of that newborn are just in your imagination. It may look like a baby as we normally think of one, but there is still "nobody home" yet - soon but not yet. Looks can therefore be deceiving.Perhaps I am missing your point, but I think you are thinking of that extremely premature newborn in the same way that you are thinking of a regular newborn and that you are sympathizing with that very premature newborn and attaching to it a personality where there is none. I may value it for its potential to grow into more, just as I value the same fetus still in the womb, but I know that it makes no scientific sense to think that there is "somebody home" at that stage - despite appearances.

And quite clearly, the trimester framework was not protected by the Constitution.I fear that you are leaning toward the position that this child, born at 22 weeks, is not a person, and therefore, it has no rights. Since there is "nobody home," I think your view cannot make a distinction between (to borrow Shooter's analogy), chopping this baby's head off on the one hand, and chopping down a weed with a weed eater on the other.

I would not call it murder until there is a mental existence involved since I do not believe that a person exists until a mental existence starts. Would I personally consider it immoral to kill it un-necessarily - yes, but to a much lesser extent than it would be to kill it once it had mental existence. The reasons that you stated for her to kill the newborn are not compelling reasons since she has other choices that do not impose on her own valued rights as a person (ex. her right to her own body). If all we did in this forum is debate the legality of abortion, then we would have nothing to really debate since its legality is ultimately determined by which party is voted in which can create anti-abortion laws and which also can pick justices for the Supreme Court. Most of us here, including myself, are interested in the general moral and/or philosophical reasons for being for or against abortion rights. From that point of view, we are certainly free to express our opinions on whether a particular ruling is morally right, in our view. Our opinions here are worthless where the law is concerned. The only power that we have on this issue where the law is concerned is in our vote, and I will continue to vote for pro-choice candidates.I have already said that I do not believe that it should be killed if there is no compelling reason to kill it since I do value that pre-mentally existing fetus or newborn baby for its potential to gain that mental existence. Also, compelling reasons include killing it only if that cannot be avoided without imposing on important rights of a real mentally-existing person.Well, we have different standards of morality. Mine is based on empathy which leads to a standard of treating others as I would have myself be treated. Yours may or may not be based on some arbitrary religious code. Of course, each of us consider our own moral code superior and will not convince the other.

Take a look at this.. abortion is probably costing just as much... but since this child is black i thought id just put this on here.."With 1/3 of all abortions performed on Black women, the abortion industry has received over 4,000,000,000 (yes, billion) dollars from the Black community."

We eat cows, pigs, chickens, fish, and various other sentient animals every day, so why would not having the sentience make a difference?

No, not "any". Even non-sentient creatures mentally exist. An example: A cat mentally exists, a door nob doesn't.I mean, I don't think its right to go around eating babies, who are non sentient. I also do not believe it is right to eat an animal if it belongs to someone else. However, we, by nature, are not a cannabalistic species. We are omnivores though, therefore it would be OK to eat deer but not babies.

It really depends on how you define sentience, and what value you place on the sentience of each species. I would definately agree that most animals are not even close to the level of sentience of humans. Some that come close are the apes (our close ancestors) and dolphins (who are quite sentient).

The basis of rights in the United States is expressed in the Declaration of Independence. According to the Declaration, you have more rights than your cat because you were given them by the Creator, and your cat was not. That is really not the point, however. You said the basis of rights is sentience. My only point is that you are not correct, and that has been affirmed multiple times in the nation's history.Why does the percentage matter? It turns out that 1.2% of the 1.2 million abortions occur at or after 21 weeks. That translates into 15,480. That is not an insignificant number. I feel like you are avoiding the issue. I fail to see how the fact that "only" 15,480 abortions (again, not an insignificant number) occur at or after 21 weeks remedies the contradiction that this child, born at 22 weeks, has its right to life guaranteed by law, while an equally (or even further) developed child's life can be terminated in the next hospital room.

Ok, what consequences (if any) would you propose the mother receive if she were to walk into the room and kill that baby at 22 weeks?
attacks
I would not call it murder until there is a mental existence involved since I do not believe that a person exists until a mental existence starts. Would I personally consider it immoral to kill it un-necessarily - yes, but to a much lesser extent than it would be to kill it once it had mental existence. The reasons that you stated for her to kill the newborn are not compelling reasons since she has other choices that do not impose on her own valued rights as a person (ex. her right to her own body). If all we did in this forum is debate the legality of abortion, then we would have nothing to really debate since its legality is ultimately determined by which party is voted in which can create anti-abortion laws and which also can pick justices for the Supreme Court. Most of us here, including myself, are interested in the general moral and/or philosophical reasons for being for or against abortion rights. From that point of view, we are certainly free to express our opinions on whether a particular ruling is morally right, in our view. Our opinions here are worthless where the law is concerned. The only power that we have on this issue where the law is concerned is in our vote, and I will continue to vote for pro-choice candidates.I have already said that I do not believe that it should be killed if there is no compelling reason to kill it since I do value that pre-mentally existing fetus or newborn baby for its potential to gain that mental existence. Also, compelling reasons include killing it only if that cannot be avoided without imposing on important rights of a real mentally-existing person.Well, we have different standards of morality. Mine is based on empathy which leads to a standard of treating others as I would have myself be treated. Yours may or may not be based on some arbitrary religious code. Of course, each of us consider our own moral code superior and will not convince the other.

I have no skill in determining any specific punishments - I leave that up to judges, assuming that their motivation is not one of vengeance (the vengeance motivation being an issue under discussion in the Crimes forum refering to the death penalty). I have no idea - probably some jail time but I wouldn't put it above a few years.

Um...the basis of rights is actually codified in our Constitution, not in the Declaration of Independence. The Declaration of Independence was simply a document telling the English monarchy that we no longer want to be under their control, and outlining the reasons why not.As for the Constitution, it never clearly stated whether those rights begin pre-birth or afterwards since it never gave completely clear outlines of who gets these rights. Considering that, for nearly the first hundred years of its use, blacks were not considered as worthy of these rights, I seriously doubt that the framers of the Constitution had the picture in mind which encompased all human life - from zygote on. Also, there were many abortions done during colonial times which continued afterward. Indeed, there were apparently no laws regarding abortion until the 1820s and most states afterwards allowed for abortion within the first four months (see http://womenshistory.about.com/od/ab...a/abortion.htm ) The movement against abortion at all stages happened much later in our history. That is another indication that the Constitution was not originally intended to protect the rights of zygotes.

Once the being becomes a person - i.e. gains mental existence - then killing them should be treated in the same way as killing any other person, with a scale determined by the motivation and intent of the crime (i.e. first, second and third degree murder). Of course, if there are two people's lives at stake, then a balance of rights need to be made. For example, I believe that people should be able to kill others in self defense. Also, if the mentally existing fetus within a woman is posing a severe risk to her life or health, then killing it would be a type of self defense - also allowed in my view.

No, the Constitution primarily establishes the processes by which government will operate, and secondarily declares what some of our rights are. The Declaration of independence provides the basis for the existence of rights. The view that rights are given by God and not by men was the prevailing thought when the Constitution was ratified, and for many years after that.I have never claimed that the Constitution was intended to protect the unborn from the point of conception. I have questioned, however, whether the Constitution intended to give a woman a right to terminate the pregnancy. Your review of history confirms one thing: that until 1973 nobody thought that abortion was a Constitutional right. Hence, it was a policy issue addressed by state legislatures, which incidentally allows the law to keep up with scientific knowledge.

Assuming that we are talking about what rights we LEGALLY have, it is the Constitution that is critical. To my knowledge, the Declaration of Independence has no legal power. We admire it, just like we might admire certain passages of the Bible, or Lincoln's Gettysburg address, etc. but it has no legal standing. Until 1900, there was no question of the woman's right to an abortion in the first four months of pregancy. Once this issue came up, then the debate must have grown about what the Constitution would have intended and there are obvious differences in interpretation of that Constitution. People have been apparently grappling for ages with the question of when we begin our real lives. It used to spoken of in religious terms - i.e. when the soul enters the body - which varied from conception through quickening at various points in history. The various legislative and court decisions on abortion reflect some of those differences in thought as these views changed when more scientific data showed itself.

Again, I never said that the Declaration of Independence has legal force.

I am merely trying to point out to Shooter that "mental existence" is not the basis of rights.I think you would have to agree with this as well, because even if the Constitution is the basis of our rights (rather then just declaring what rights have been recognized), it could be amended to afford rights to trees. Therefore, mental existence is not the basis of rights.Pulling specific rights out of general provisions of the Constitution seems to me to be, in the very least, hard to justify, and at worst, illegitimate. For example, the due process provision of the 14th Amendment says that a person shall not be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. It seems hard to justify that the due process provisions in the Constitution establish specific rights which cannot be revoked even with due process of law. Such an interpretation contradicts the text itself, and it is precisely this view of due process that was used in Roe.I can agree with you here. However, the point I would make is that a legislature is better able and equipped to keep society up to date than a judiciary is.

wait a second. Are you saying this baby has every right as you and I because it is born? This standard is getting ever complicated. Now we have rights dependent on location, development, and on other people in general. This is getting cfazy.So is the born baby in the news story not a person yet?

Nobody on the pro-choice side is arguing for killing a fetus once it is born as a baby (this being the official definition of baby) since there would be no reason for killing it. The rights of the woman over her own body would no longer be involved and it is those rights which pro-choice proponents wish to protect.The problem arises if you claim that, since this one premature baby was able to survive at 21 weeks, then no woman should be allowed to abort because the fetus MIGHT survive at 21 weeks. The reality of the situation is that, if such a law were introduced, then the great majority of women with unwanted pregnancies would still have to carry that pregnancy against their will since they or society could not afford for all of those unwanted pregnancies to result in premature birth at 21 weeks. So, we would be left with the same situation that we are currently faced with. Namely, do we value the woman's rights over her own body more or do we value the rights of that fetus (which is still in her body) at 21 weeks of development? Without a mental existence in that fetus, most of us on the pro-choice side would take the side of the woman in that case.

I don't know how things are in other counties, but here we have a scan at 12 wks, blood test at 15 wks to test for probability for Downs Syndrome, then after the results of this test a recommendation of whether to have an Amniocentesis (sp?), and a scan at 18 wks. I don't know how it works in that situation, but I wonder how someone could go over 20 weeks and then choose an abortion when those tests (which I would assume indicate the health problems or abnormalities) are carried out within the earlier second trimester. LOL, she must have been lucky... When I was pregnant with my daughter I was sick several times a day from 4 weeks to 18 weeks gestation and felt ill for the rest of it. emoticonXFrazzled

I've also wondered about this. The great majority of abortions are indeed performed in the first trimester - some statistics from http://www.policyalmanac.org/culture...atistics.shtml :57% of abortions occur at <8 weeks of gestation87% of abortions occur at <13 weeks of gestation4.3% were at 16--20 weeks of gestation1.4% were at >21 weeksThis shows that the great majority of women do discover their pregnancies fairly quickly and choose and carry out their abortions also fairly quickly.My understanding from other sources are that those that occur around the third trimester are almost exclusively for reasons related to risks to the mother's life or health. Though I don't have the time to find some backup material, I would assume that most abortions performed in the first trimester are done by choice for reasons other than risks to life or health and that this fraction goes down as you move away from first trimester into the second and then third trimester. It would be a rare woman woman who does not realize that she is pregnant until many months into a pregnancy. However, I did hear of a humorous story once of a very obese woman who was surprised to give birth to a baby since she didn't realize that she was pregnant.

I am not saying that the baby has rights as you and me. However, I think that, once it is out of the womb, the state can claim a right to protect that life because of its potential to become a person and, critically, because the protection of that life would, at that point, not violate the critical right of any actual person. Remember, in the abortion debate, the main motivation of pro-choice proponents is protection of the mother's rights over her own body.Though it may sounds strange to you - no, it is not a person yet, just like the frozen embryos out of the womb are not people. In my view, it is not a person until it gains mental existence. This is a situation where looks deceive us since what we see is a tiny version of a baby out of the womb so we might psychologically attach the same type of characteristics to it as we attach to a normal baby. If we do that, then we are fooling ourselves since there is one very important characteristic missing from that 22 week old - mental existence. We may think that we are looking at a person - mental existence at all - but all we are looking at, at that stage, is a living body. I can understand the emotional reaction that people would have to that 22 week old and I would probably have it to. But, where laws are concerned, we cannot go by gut reactions alone, we have to analyze the situation to see what is really happening. That 22 week old is still just a body without a mind at that stage. I think it has a value because it will soon become a real person - mind and all, but it doesn't automatically become a person by being out of the womb. Embryos from in-vitro fertilization are not automatically people because they are out of the womb. The 22 week old is simply MUCH closer to the critical stage than is an embryo out of the womb so I would place more value in it, but certainly less than in one that already mentally existed.

Like I said before, I have no personal interest in discussing such differences since (1) such details of legal theory simply bore me and (2) nothing we say will make a difference anyway - our power is in our vote. Either way, I would rather place the ultimate say in the hands of judges who are well educated and relatively free from political pressures and corruption than I would in legislatures who are at the whim of uninformed popular whims as well as corrupting money interests.

I am not well enough informed in these medical procedures to say, but my guess is that many of these women might not have done the proper tests early on to determine such health risks. Otherwise, perhaps there are health risks that only arise late in pregnancy.I think she thought that she was having gastro-intestinal pain. That would have been one heck of a stomache ache :)

A right I deny exists (and as do you when this "being" is defined as a person by you). So to clarify, if someone were to kill this born baby then a person has not been killed and it would be as morally wrong (towards the baby that is) as if someone punched the mother and caused a miscarriage. I assume a punishment would that of killing a dog or something.I don't think mental existence is a requirement as it makes no sense to be one. Anyway, lets go over this evolving standard of when a baby/fetus/embryo/being/human/person or whatever actually has rights as you and I:First we look at the "being" and decide if this undefined term "mental existence" exists. If yes then we assume this to be a person and the mother has no right to kill another person. If no then the mother may still have the right to kill this "being" (by the way..only the mother? what happens if someone else kills it...car accident for example?). So now we look at whether or not the burden of the "being" is too great and overwhelms the so called "right" to ones own body. At this point we accept this to be a human being I suppose since there is an admission of something imposing on another. But this human being is only a "potential person" which means the rights are limited to some unknown list of pre-person rights of which life is not one of them absolutely. So now we look to location to determine if this "right to life" exists or not. If the location is in the womb then the burden is deemed to be too high...I guess due to discomfort and other various things. Even here, only one person has the right to terminate as I suppose this pre-person is property of the mother? However, if outside the womb then pre-persons rights have somehow changed since the burdens once had by the mother are now gone (although new ones might exist). So pre-person's rights are not really rights naturally had but rather rights granted by the mother. We therefore can have a 21wk old baby outside the womb whom no one (including the mother) can kill because pre-persons outside the womb have different rights from pre-persons inside the womb. This is getting way to confusing. Rights are granted based upon location, development and are given by the mother.

There were many discussions and documents on rights. The Declaration of Independence was just one document mentioning rights. There were many discussions outlined in the Federalist Papers which also explored rights. You are the first person that I have ever heard claim that the Declaration of Independence as the one core document to go to when questioning rights. It is an inspiring document, to be sure, because of the tyranny that it contradicted and because it is our first proclamation as a separate nation. That is why it is often quoted. However, I see no validity to your claim that it forms the basis on which our legal rights are based. And again, if you are not claiming that it forms any basis to legal rights, then why should we care? It would then just represent yet another opinion.The system that I described is precisely the system that we have - well educated justices interpreting the Constitution, which sets limits to the laws which the people's representatives can introduce. If our founders put full trust in the people's wisdom, then there would never have been sections of the Constitution dealing with rights. Indeed, I have heard that one of the reasons that the Bill of Rights was introduced was that some founders did have trust that the people would never vote out those rights so they left such a list of rights out of the Constitution but Thomas Jefferson thought it safer to codify them so he introduced the Bill of Rights (first 10 Amendments). I, for one, am very glad that many of our rights are thus codified in the Constitution - especially during these times of the so-called War on Terrorism, when more of these rights might come into jeopardy. If you think it is elitist to protect the people from themselves in having rights outlined in a Constitution, then you seem to be against the very structure of our government.

I am not interested in having the elitists govern society. I am not interested in any argument that suggests that the people have no right to govern themselves. This is such an argument.

Let's recap. Shooter told me that I knew the basis of rights is "mental existence." My only point is that he is wrong. I am in no mood to discuss the Declaration or prevailing views at the founding with you further because they are not important to my point. And besides that, you don't seem interested and you don't seem like you care.So, "mental existence" is not the basis of our rights. That is my point, and it is correct.I have no quarrel with having rights specified in the Constitution. What I object to is investing the power in a court to draw specific rights out of general provisions. This interpretation, as I said earlier, blatantly violates the text itself.

There were many discussions and documents on rights. The Declaration of Independence was just one document mentioning rights. There were many discussions outlined in the Federalist Papers which also explored rights. You are the first person that I have ever heard claim that the Declaration of Independence as the one core document to go to when questioning rights. It is an inspiring document, to be sure, because of the tyranny that it contradicted and because it is our first proclamation as a separate nation. That is why it is often quoted. However, I see no validity to your claim that it forms the basis on which our legal rights are based. And again, if you are not claiming that it forms any basis to legal rights, then why should we care? It would then just represent yet another opinion.The system that I described is precisely the system that we have - well educated justices interpreting the Constitution, which sets limits to the laws which the people's representatives can introduce. If our founders put full trust in the people's wisdom, then there would never have been sections of the Constitution dealing with rights. Indeed, I have heard that one of the reasons that the Bill of Rights was introduced was that some founders did have trust that the people would never vote out those rights so they left such a list of rights out of the Constitution but Thomas Jefferson thought it safer to codify them so he introduced the Bill of Rights (first 10 Amendments). I, for one, am very glad that many of our rights are thus codified in the Constitution - especially during these times of the so-called War on Terrorism, when more of these rights might come into jeopardy. If you think it is elitist to protect the people from themselves in having rights outlined in a Constitution, then you seem to be against the very structure of our government.

The example of someone causing a miscarriage in the mother at 22 weeks has its own complications (ex. the mothers right over her own body as well) but I think that it would be similar - the loss would be similar. If someone else kills it, then not only has he violated the mother's rights but has killed something of value for which she should be recompensed and he punished. Indeed, in case you are interested, I have heard of a passage in the Old Testament (one of very few passages in the Bible hinting at life prior to birth) that designates that the punishment for precisely that type of killing is that the perpetrator should pay a fine for that action. Not that I think that people should follow the Old Testament but I would think that would be relevant from your point of view since your morality is one based on Biblical teaching. (I am willing to find and quote the passage, but would not be willing to go into a full discussion of that, if that is what you would get into.).It is actually quite simple. The question is "When can a woman kill the fetus?". I would say that, if it is out of her body, then none of her critical rights are being violated and she has no right to kill it. If it is in her body, then it depends on its stage of development:1) Prior to mental existence, it has value but no rights and that value is less important than the mother's rights to her own body, so she can abort it.2) After mental existence, it has rights and the woman cannot abort unless it is an issue of self protection (its life is a big risk to her life or health).

A right I deny exists (and as do you when this "being" is defined as a person by you). So to clarify, if someone were to kill this born baby then a person has not been killed and it would be as morally wrong (towards the baby that is) as if someone punched the mother and caused a miscarriage. I assume a punishment would that of killing a dog or something.I don't think mental existence is a requirement as it makes no sense to be one. Anyway, lets go over this evolving standard of when a baby/fetus/embryo/being/human/person or whatever actually has rights as you and I:First we look at the "being" and decide if this undefined term "mental existence" exists. If yes then we assume this to be a person and the mother has no right to kill another person. If no then the mother may still have the right to kill this "being" (by the way..only the mother? what happens if someone else kills it...car accident for example?). So now we look at whether or not the burden of the "being" is too great and overwhelms the so called "right" to ones own body. At this point we accept this to be a human being I suppose since there is an admission of something imposing on another. But this human being is only a "potential person" which means the rights are limited to some unknown list of pre-person rights of which life is not one of them absolutely. So now we look to location to determine if this "right to life" exists or not. If the location is in the womb then the burden is deemed to be too high...I guess due to discomfort and other various things. Even here, only one person has the right to terminate as I suppose this pre-person is property of the mother? However, if outside the womb then pre-persons rights have somehow changed since the burdens once had by the mother are now gone (although new ones might exist). So pre-person's rights are not really rights naturally had but rather rights granted by the mother. We therefore can have a 21wk old baby outside the womb whom no one (including the mother) can kill because pre-persons outside the womb have different rights from pre-persons inside the womb. This is getting way to confusing. Rights are granted based upon location, development and are given by the mother.

Well, neither I nor Shooter nor anyone else can claim that mental existence is a criteria for rights in some absolute moral stance that everyone should follow because it is the only right one. Mental existence is the critical criteria for the moral stance that we and many others (possibly most) follow. You have other criteria since you have another moral stance. The conflict comes in when one group tries to impose its morality on another group (usually in the form of the far right imposing its morality on everyone else). Then, that group has to give very sound reasons for that morality and those reasons cannot be based on religion alone if they are to be put into law. Ultimately, even if both sides base their arguements on sound non-religious reasons, then we still might not agree and ultimately the law is decided by a combination of popular vote and Constitutional safeguards.

Using the criteria of "mental existence"--a term I have yet to be seen defined (I have not read this entire thread so maybe it has been defined and please let me know if it has)--is troubling to me.I can imagine people outside of the womb who may be considered to not have a mental existence.

Legal rights and laws are what we have to live with because that is what our society forces on us. We may or may not agree with those legal rights and laws based on our own moral stances and views. Mental existence determines my own moral stance and that of many (possibly most) others. However, that is not currently codified into law in the constitution. Indeed, the Constitution doesn't directly address the issue of when a human life gains the rights that it outlines, so none of our views are directly supported by the Constitution. There are judicial arguments, which you obviously disagree with, that do support a woman's right to her body. However, those are obviously also contested. Basically, this is an issue that has no single clear judicial answer which is why the issue of right to life prior to birth is a contested one, largely determined by the parties voted into power and which Supreme Court Justices those parties can appoint. Bottom line - there is no single clear legal view of when rights begin so none of our views of the basis of rights are absolutely correct from a legal point of view. We just have our own opinions and our own morality and mental existence is the one that I follow.There is, however, freedom of practice of religion protected by the Constitution and the implied (I know you hate that term) separation of Church and State. A majority cannot impose its religion on a minority.

What people do you have in mind? The only humans outside of the womb without a mental existence that I know of are the embryos left over from in-vitro fertilization and that 22 week old prematurely born baby that started this thread. Besides, nobody here (I think) is claiming that any human - with or without mental existence - should be terminated if it is outside of the womb.Mental existence, to me (and I coined the term in this forum), means that we have the very beginnings of mind - be it only a sense of self, or rudimentary emotions, thoughts, etc. - either conscious or subconscious. This cannot happen until the cerebral cortex starts to function (which needs neural interconnections, etc.) - sometime around the beginning of the third trimester.

Someone in a coma has no sense of self, emotions, thoughts, etc. Based on this definition, these people can legitimately be killed. This is why using "mental existence" to determine when it is acceptable or not to have an abortion is highly problematic at best and, in my mind, illegitemate.

My understanding of comas is that there is still brain activity in the cerebral cortex indicative of some mental processes - subconscious ones. Just because a person is not conscious does not mean that there is no longer some level of mind still at work there. Indeed, there are people who recover from comas and recount various mental dream-like experiences which they had while in coma. Bottom line - people in comas still have mental existences just not conscious and not particularly active. For many, it is like being in a very deep sleep.

Well if sentience isn't the basis for rights, then what is?I think you're dancing around the facts. 1.2% is a very small number, let me remind you.An inanimate object, or a non-sentient being does not share the same rights as us. Period.

The basis of rights in the United States is expressed in the Declaration of Independence. According to the Declaration, you have more rights than your cat because you were given them by the Creator, and your cat was not. That is really not the point, however. You said the basis of rights is sentience. My only point is that you are not correct, and that has been affirmed multiple times in the nation's history.Why does the percentage matter? It turns out that 1.2% of the 1.2 million abortions occur at or after 21 weeks. That translates into 15,480. That is not an insignificant number. I feel like you are avoiding the issue. I fail to see how the fact that "only" 15,480 abortions (again, not an insignificant number) occur at or after 21 weeks remedies the contradiction that this child, born at 22 weeks, has its right to life guaranteed by law, while an equally (or even further) developed child's life can be terminated in the next hospital room.

This is my criteria since I view mental existence as the core of what we are as people. My moral stance is based on empathy toward others with an approach to treat others as I would have myself be treated. You cannot have empathy toward living entities without mental existence. I do not think we acquire rights until we mentally exist - at which point we have the minimum of what I view as people with rights.

I just refuse to say that 15,500 abortions at 21 weeks or after is an insignificant number, something you can't seem to agree with.Ok, so you have joined the club that says that killing this baby at 22 weeks is of very little consequence.

I mentioned in my first sentence of my post that I view mental existence as the core of what we are as people. That is the basis around which the other arguements are constructed, so I will go more fully into that. Namely, when I observe myself and contemplate what functions or aspects one could take away and still have me exist - all I have left is that mental existence. Though I would be pretty unhappy about it, I would still feel like I exist if my legs or arms were taken away, if I became blind, deaf, etc. It is mental existence that is at the core of what I am. If we were to suffer such sever brain damage that no mental existence was left in our bodies, then I would say that we as people have, at that point, died. Therefore, mental existence is a critical characteristic of people and we don't acquire rights as people until we gain mental existence and lose them once our mental existences end because outside of either end of that scale, all you have left is a human body - not a person.Why does empathy require a mental existence? By the very definition of empathy.From the on-line Merriam Webster dictionary: http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/empathyMain Entry: em·pa·thy 1 : the imaginative projection of a subjective state into an object so that the object appears to be infused with it2 : the action of understanding, being aware of, being sensitive to, and vicariously experiencing the feelings, thoughts, and experience of another of either the past or present without having the feelings, thoughts, and experience fully communicated in an objectively explicit manner; also : the capacity for this The use of the term which I am referring to is definition 2, which requires that the others have "feelings, thoughts, and experience" - requiring a mental existence. As for definition 1, that feeling is based purely on *imagination* - i.e. it is not based on reality. Children might feel empathy for dolls that are mangled but that does not mean that those dolls are suffering. We might feel empathy when we see a painting of someone being tortured, but that is just paint we are looking at - not a real person suffering.Empathy drives my approach of treating others as I expect myself to be treated. I would not have expected my mother to have been forced to carry me prior to my mental existence since "I" wouldn't have been around yet so nobody would have been hurt, whereas she would have been hurt if she were forced against her will to carry me. The same is true for all others. Prior to mental existence, the only person I can empathize with in a pregnancy is the mother.

I covered this in another thread but will repeat it here. There are at least two major reasons why I favor humans over animals and don't give them equal rights. The first is that I favor my own species - in a us vs them type of way. It is clear to me that, if we were to stringently try to adhere to having the same standards for rights for humans vs animals, then we would not be able to survive as a species. We need to have animals for food or at least for supplying food (eggs, milk). We need to kill pest species to be able to grow our own food, prevent desease spread by rats, etc. We no longer need to completely struggle for survival as a species (except what we might do to ourselves) but, if we made human vs animal rights equal, then our survival would once again be in jeopardy. I unabashedly favor our species to thrive vs. the survival of other species.The second reason is based on my moral approach based of a moral consensus - I will try to treat others as I would expect myself to be treated. Animals cannot take part in a moral consensus. That said, I do support laws against animal cruelty - and not just for pet animals but for other situations. For example, I only recently realized that food animals are not always killed instantaneously and humanely - I would support laws forcing humane killing of food animals.

Firstly you don’t need to kill other animals to survive, millions of people are vegetarians and live healthier lives than meat eaters. The reason we inflict so much damage and suffering on other species is due to the fact that we have already overpopulated the planet and we continue to do so at the expense as I said of our fellow beings, the rest of the animal kingdom, one thing is to thrive another to become a pest, and we have become a pest.Saying: “I prefer my own kind” is not a moral statement, it is simply a preference.Well, animals treat us better than we treat them, they do not torture us, they do not behave sadistically or cruelly towards, they do not experiment with us, they do not butcher us in masse for food. So yes, you have the moral imperative to treat them the same.But your second reason is absurd, for what you are saying is that if another being can not reciprocate your behavior then it would mean you don’t need to be charitable to those in need for obviously they will never be able to pay you back. Babies can not take part in a moral consensus, neither can mentally retarded people. Would you treat them as animals as well?

You are entitled to your opinion of the human race being a pest. If you think we are pests then do you advocate our mass extermination to bring our population to levels more manageable with nature? I don't. I advocate for family planning to keep our population growth under control, and I advocate for safe havens for wild animals in terms of protected territories where people would not encroach, except for park rangers and controlled nature tours.And, though we might get away with not eating meat, we would not get away with not killing pest species or killing animals that might compete for the same foods. Also, before we became the dominant species, we were treated as a food source just as much as any other animal was. Indeed, there are still isolated cases throughout the world where people in remote areas are attacked by anything from mountain lions to crocodiles and eaten. Our technology and numbers make us much less vulnerable than we once were. It is not that animals suddenly became kindhearted and moral. I am a human. Therefore, my loyalty lies with the human species when there is a competition for resources. I advocate for humane treatment of animals, but would certainly not advocate for animals having equal rights. We simply would not survive as a species if we took that seriously. I was once a baby and we are all just a bad head injury away from having severe mental limitations. I would have expected others to treat me well in those situations so I treat others well in those situations. The moral consensus is at a group level - the group of human beings. Are you seriously advocating that humans and animals get the same rights ?!?! If not, then what are YOUR reasons for favoring humans over animals?

I don't think you ever gave specific criteria (in the discussions we've had) except to say it starts at conception.Is there other criteria that you set for personhood outside of having a unique set of DNA?

Yet he was responding to a statement I said about "unique set of DNA". You can't claim your arm has a unique set of DNA from you body when it doesn't.It is not a criteria for "personhood" (whatever that means). The only requirement for being a person is to actually be a person. DNA is a pretty good way to figure this out but there are other ways im sure. Conjoined twins have the same DNA but I doubt many would say they are not 2 different people.By the way, that brings up a point about whether or not you support the "violinist" argument often discussed in abortion forums. The situation involves 2 people with "mental existence" as defined by you and from all accounts you feel that one this point is reached then a right to life is to be maintained (thus disallowing third trimester abortions generally). Would your argument change for the violinist?

What he meant was that every cell in your body, including cells in your arms, have your entire set of DNA.But I believe you knew this already.

Saying "being a person is to actually be a person" means nothing if you do not define what specific characteristics define a person. I define person as (1) mentally existing and (2) of the human species. In the development of a human, it is the onset of mental existence that I find critical because that mental existence is at the core of what I view as a person. Apparently, for you, something happens to an unfertilized egg that transforms it from a non-person to a person. I am just trying to see what characteristics reside in a newly fertilized egg that do not reside in an unfertilized one - a characteristic that suddenly makes it a person worthy of rights in your view.I don't think someone can just grab a person off the street and force them to support someone else without their agreement. In a pregnancy, the woman has about six months to decide whether to keep the child, knowing full well that a deadline for decision is approaching. If the deadline passes and she still hasn't decided then tough luck, she has to continue the pregnancy to term (unless exceptions such as risk to her life or major health risk, etc. come up). She HAD a choice and didn't decide in time to use it.In the violinist arguement, if she were just grabbed off the street and plugged to a machine supporting him, I think he has no right to force her to support him and she could disconnect. It would be a matter of self defense. I would think of that situation as being somewhat analogous to rape. However, in a modified version of the violinist arguement, if she was plugged into a machine and he would be connected at a later date (say a few months down the line), then she could disconnect anytime until he would be connected. At that point, it would have been her choice not to disconnect so, if she waits with her decision too long, she has to support him. Note: this assumes that the support would be temporary, as it is in a pregnancy.

Have you deceived yourself into thinking you have established a humane and objective position in the treatment of human life? What good is empathy if it is not merciful enough, caring enough, encompassing enough to embrace the most vulnerable, most innocent, most helpless, most weak of human life? I believe your empathy to be as rudimentary as the youngsters' if it cannot embrace a fetus weeks earlier than a line of conjecture drawn at the 3rd trimester.Your position is based on how you wish others to treat you? How would it feel to be chemically burned to death or violently torn apart? Rudimentary indeed.I have read that a fetus has brain waves at 40 days. It experiences REM sleep (when we have dreams) at 17 weeks. It often responds to sounds and the mother's voice in the womb. So how do you know when a mental existence begins? If you are wrong, is it worth millions dying?2 year olds definitely have a mental existence. My doubt is that they can feel true empathy at that point. They most often mimic what an adult does without having a true idea of what they are doing. So if they pat their sad friend or family on the back when they are crying it is because they model what others do or someone told them to do it. It can be seen when they play with a baby doll and they cradle it, care for it, and then all of a sudden throw it on the ground as part of their play--they don't have a true sense of empathy and can't feel what it would have been like to be a real baby thrown on the ground. So if empathy is your criterion then I think you must move your line of protection of life back quite a bit and many will be victims of your line of reasoning.

Empathy is the main driving force behind my standard of treating others as I would expect myself to be treated. Mental existence is the very starting point of that moral stance since (1) my self-observation has lead me to determine that the core of us is our mental existence, and (2) you can't have empathy without that mental existence.I can't even imagine any 2 year olds that don't have a mental existence (assuming that is what you meant by your comment about 2 year olds and empathy). I have no idea what you have in mind there. As I have already said in this thread, mental existence is the most rudimentary of minds - be it even a sense of self, rudimentary thoughts and emotions, etc. - which we apparently gain the possibility of having around the third trimester of pregnancy.

And why not? The mother is a human life also, entitled to her rights. You can't just yank them away from her on the basis that an embryo is weak or "helpless".It is illegal to chemically burn people. "He" didn't exist untill somewhere around the third trimester. The embryo was just his body, not him. If the embryo was disposed of that does not mean that "he" or any people were, because there was no person inside of the embryo.How can you hold us accountable if we do not have sufficient informations to form a logical hypothesis?A two year old is without doubt a person. A human being with mental existence. An embryo is not a two year old.

Most of what I have read about the mind is that thoughts of any sort (emotion, analysis, etc.) are centered in the cerebral cortex, whose connections do not sufficiently develop until the beginning of the third trimester. Before that, there is no mind in any way that we recognize it. Therefore, until that time, all there is (where a embryo/fetus is concerned) is a developing body with "nobody home". I cannot have empathy with bodies - I have empathy with the suffering. emotions, experiences of a mind. Of course I would not like to be chemically burned to death or violently torn apart. Why? Because I would suffer, feel the emotions of fear and loss, etc. A fetus prior to gaining mental existence is incapable of suffering, having any emotions, etc. - it is JUST A BODY with NOBODY HOME. The empathy/sympathy that you feel towards that embryo is just based on your IMAGINATION of that embryo suffering. I base my morality on reality.Here are a couple of links which describe the neurological view of a mind not existing before the third trimester:Part 4 of http://www.2think.org/abortion.shtml http://7e.devbio.com/article.php?ch=21&id=162If you have links describing REM sleep in embryos, please provide them. My guess would be that you misinterpreted and that the REM sleep was measured in late term fetuses, not early term embryos.You are missing the point. I am not saying that I think 2 year olds deserve rights because THEY can feel empathy. I am saying that *I* feel empathy toward the two year olds, just as I can feel empathy toward any mentally existing being that can suffer, feel emotions, etc. It is largely MY empathy that drives me to treat others better - that coupled with the expectation that I would be treated better if I were in their situation as well. You are simply misunderstanding my views. [Note: I was away on a business trip - thus the delay in my response.]
