The next logical step would be marriage to multiple people. This step is not all that different from the step being taken right now as it will be a specialized form of marriage for those with a different sort of lifestyle than the average person. There really is not good reason to believe that you cannot be married to a person of the same sex nor is there a good reason to believe that you cannot have two wives or more. Marriage is whatever we want it to be and it may become more complicated in the near future.

It would lead ultimately down the road to a marriage bill for polygamists. That is why the current push for a Constitutional Amendment to ban gay marriage also contains a provision banning polygamous marriage as well.Hmm....some opposition to the petition...More left wing ideology at work.

Whats wrong with polygamy? Who cares what multiple consenting adults do with their bodies? Who are we to legislate morality?For thousands of years polygamy has been a natual and accepted form of marriage in many cultures.In nature, the majority of species are polygamist.Many of the same arguements used to support homosexuality are even stronger for polygamy. I don't see what the big deal about polygamy is, if we are going to accept homosexuality. Polygamy has been far more common, perhaps even more than monogamy, in history.

King David having multiple wives was under Old Testament practice. Jesus himself stated that divorce laws were granted by Moses and allowed by God because of the hardness of the people hearts. Jesus said a man shall leave his father and mother and be cleaved to his WIFE, Not WIVES. BTW, its called serial MONOGAMY. If its 'right wing' to support a ban on homosexual/polygamous marriage than its 'left wing' to oppose a ban on homosexual/polygamous marriage.

I was showing an example of how arguments for homosexuality apply to polygamy. I didn't really mean it, but I'll see if I can back it up...Yes, according to one arguement used to support homosexuality (who cares what consenting adults choose to do) I do beleive crack cocaine, bestiality, and whatever would be acceptable... or at least 'none of our business'.And yes, who are we to prevent two consenting adults who happen to be cousins from doing what they choose with their own bodies... As for the commonness of polygamy, I don't know, which is why I made it an ambigous statement... but I'll look for some stuff:- in the Old Testement (I'll elaborate if you like)http://www.directory.net/Society/Rel...yles/Polygamy/(this is a collection of pro-polygamy sites)I don't have much time, but I think you could find something about how 'historically, polygamy has been accepted'It looks like there's a few people out there advocating polygamy.

I didn't mean to assert homosexuality isn't normal (although I beleive so) That's why I put it in the little quotes, sorry for the confusion. My point was, people fight hard to get homosexuality accepted as 'normal', and if you look at polygamy, it's much closer to what we call normal. I was responding to Jake's assertion that saying polygamy will follow homosexuality is a 'scare tactic'.

Did I ever say that we were headed down the 'slippery slope' towards legalizing pedophilia which NAMBLA wants? No. What I intended with that post was to show that everbody cannot have everything they want. We surely do not want to legalize Man-Boy relations, do we? No, that is sick behavior. If the majority can decide in cases of behavior like NAMBLA, then it can decide in others as well.

I was basing that on your previous statementIn other words, anything that is opposed to one wing must be the opposite so I don’t see how it’s absurd unless you want to call your original statement absurd.This is obviously not the thread for this discussion but I will reply this time and see where it takes us.You didn’t state what you considered to be “numerous” nor did you supply anything to back up that statement. However deficits depend on both increased spending and lower revenues. Bush has done both with large tax cuts and large discretionary spending increases. And even the conservatives are beginning to criticize him for being a big spending president. Over the past 23 years, ‘conservative’ administrations have increased the deficits and ‘liberal’ administrations have decreased the deficits. So yeah it looks to me like left wing is against deficits and right wing is for deficits.

The Constitution gives the people the right to implement a Constitutional Amendment to, as in this case, keep the notion of traditional marriage being takem away from the majority of Americans who oppose gay marriage.

I don't agree with these analogies to pedophile and polygamist issues.Pedophila and polygamy are both criminal acts. Being in a gay or lesbian relationship is not a criminal act. Polygamy and pedophila exploit women and children, unlike gay and lesbian relationships.There is extremely little support for decriminalizing pedophilia and polygamy. There is even much less support for legally recognizing those relationships in any way shape or form. In fact, I don't know of any major national polls done on these issues, if any have been done. I suppose this is because it is so obvious there would be very miniscule support for pedophiles or polygamists, either no one does the polls, or the polls are not widely reported on because they represent no change in attitudes.Gay marriage has much more support. I don't believe it has to be a 50% plus one majority. The poll numbers are taken often, and change often. But the general trend is much different than any trend in support of decriminalizing polygamy or pedophilia or legally recognizing such relationships. Otherwise, gay marriage wouldn't even be an issue.

I agree that comparing gay marriage to pedophilia is probably over the top.Yet polygamy has been a traditionally accepted and 'natural' practice. Historically, there has been far more support for polygamy than homosexuality. It seems a lot more 'normal' to me. Besides, who are we to say what consenting adults do with their bodies? Right?

I don't think they have a problem with you voicing your opinion, the problem comes when you want to force those beliefs upon the rest of society. Two people have the right to enter into wedlock with one another if they wish, regardless of gender. By allowing gay marriages we still allow straight marriages.

America has a little something called minority rights, where the minority will not suffer a loss of freedoms due to the majority. Gay marriage will not become mandatory, you will not find yourself forced into it by a majority or minority. Gay marriages exist as a choice between two people of the same sex who care deeply for one another and wish to express their love through matrimony. Their choices for entering marriage aren't mush different than heterosexuals' choices for doing the same thing.The legalization of gay marriage would take nothing away from the majority. They could still marry with the opposite sex if they wished, and they could still tell everyone about the wrongs of homosexuals and homosexual marriage.What if the majority believed we should execute all homoesexuals?

No. When the choices get made all sides of the argument should be kept in mind, but the choice that continues to protect the freedoms and equality of all, and does not bring harm upon others should be the choice made.Please excuse me for any words cames I might have unkowningly played.

I'm shocked that you agree with him!!!!I'd be equally shocked if Charchump agreed with him also!!!! Come on, you two and Rank are all intellectually dishonest. You all basically support stifling free speech when that speech is opposed to gay marriage, etc...That's why you and Charchump inject the words bigot, homophobe, etc...People like you and Charchump slur others and try and label them when people post stuff that runs counter to what you want. Conservatives like myself don't do this, and that is why liberals consistently have been getting their butts kicked in the elections since 1994, and they will also in 2004. People are tired of liberal meanspiritedness. You want liberal free speech, and anyone reading your posts can see this. At least Rank only resorts to playing word games and games of semantics.

I’m sorry Traveler I had no idea I was supposed to know what you ‘meant’ by your post. I assumed you meant what you said in your post.If this is a place for adults, why are you responding like this?I have only been posting here a few months and although I’m neither an atheist or an agnostic, I have found that the atheist and agnostics are usually civil in a debate until the other person starts with the insults and name-calling. Is there some rule that fundamentalist Christians have that says you have to leave your decency at the front door when you join them?BTW at this point I am opposed to gay marriages although I haven’t heard all the rationale from each side so I’m open to changing my mind. I was simply pointing out the inconsistencies of your particular points.

How was I intellectually dishonest?If you didn’t write what you meant, why didn’t you? Actually I did a very good job of refuting your points and it’s evident by the fact that you didn’t respond to anything I said. You simply got bent out of shape. That’s what happens when you get your butt kicked in a debate, you respond with insults instead of rational replies.I’m assuming that you intentionally misspelled my name as sarcasm. It’s actually pretty good sarcasm if you intended it. However as I’m sure you are aware, if you continue, I will respond in kind. And I can think of some pretty good variations on ‘Traveler’. LOL

I would like to point out one thing. I’m not an attorney but I think legalization of gay marriage is not correct. We have freedoms unless the government explicitly takes them away. So it’s not a matter of legalizing gay marriages, it’s a matter of not making them illegal. I do know that in Texas where I live, they changed the marriage laws in 1997 to explicitly state that a marriage was only between a man and a woman. So in effect they were saying, oops if we don’t say it’s illegal, it will be legal.

"Gays are just like anyone else."That's where you are wrong.In the Gay Report by Jay and Young,one of the laregest surveys ever conducted of homosexual sex practices, these homosexual researchers found that: 91% had anal intercourse. 83% engaged in rimming(mouth to anus contact). 22% had done fisting (insertion of the hand and arm into the rectum), 23% admitted to participating in golden showers. 76% admitted to having sex with boys, and 4% admitted to eating feces.Dr. Gisela L.P. Macphail, a physician at the University of Calgary in Canada, described the serious health risks of homosexual behavior ina a letter to the Calgary Board of Education in September in 1996. She is an epidemiologist and regularly treats AIDS victims. She states "Any practice which facilitates direct or indirect oral-rectal contact will enable the spread of fecal and rectal microorganisms to the sexual partner. Thus anilingus9rimming0, a common practice among homosexual men allows direct spread of pathogens such as Giardia, Entamoeba histolyica, and Herpes A ."

The men were questioned if they at one time had sex with boys 13-17 or younger. A 17 year old could have sex with another 17 year old, then be asked 20 years later if he had had sex with a 17 year old, and this does not mean that a 37 year old had sex with a 17 year old. The gay bashing sites such as the Family Research Institute and the Free Republic even admit that this study asked if the men surveyed at sometime had or had had sexual relations with those age groups.<<and 4% admitted to eating feces.>>And the thing about this study, is that it was done in 1979. Sexual customs really can change in a quarter of a century. Also I'd like to know something about the sample, was it taken from gay bars or gay sex clubs like other earlier studies?

I'm curious about how people feel about this. Over 800,000 have already signed the petition that will be sent to Congress.Petition is at http://www.nogaymarriage.com

I fully support Gay Marriage AND Polygamy. Why?Because it's none of my damn business.If people want to have a same sex relationship, more power to them.If a man wants to marry multiple women, or a woman marry multiple men, that also is their choice, but I can't see very many doing this. Whatever makes you happy and doesn't harm others is in my opinion something you should be able to do. Possibly not allowing someone to take their own life in some circumstances is also advisable, but not always.

<<I agree that comparing gay marriage to pedophilia is probably over the top.Yet polygamy has been a traditionally accepted and 'natural' practice. Historically, there has been far more support for polygamy than homosexuality. It seems a lot more 'normal' to me.>>How many hundreds of years ago was polygamy accepted? Of course there would have been support for polygamy in past societies where women were not treated as equal to men. <<Besides, who are we to say what consenting adults do with their bodies? Right?>>Too broad again. The issue is not just about consent. Heterosexual relationships can be described as consentual, unless rape is involved. However, I question just how much choice is involved in polygamous relationships. The wives are often very young. It is very difficult for a woman to leave this type of relationship. Sometimes a daughter is promised to a father.

might i just make an point regarding the harms principle? Because I think it solves for alot of the issues brought up towards the middle (the polygamy/pedophilia/crack point).The harms principle (explained by J.S. Mill) basically states that your freedom is absolute up until the point where it violates the freedom of others (my right to wave my fist ends at your nose). This is perhaps the clearest moral standard that can be created for justifiable govt. action, combining both liberal "rights expansion" and conservative limited govt.. The harms principle holds that, unless an action violates the right of someone, the action is outside the realm of jurisdiction of the government. Social Contract theory states that we give up some of our liberties to the government to safeguard the rest. From this, it is only logical that the minimum amount of freedom should be given up to maintain those basic protections, and beyond that all freedoms are reserved to the individual. Hence, the harms principle. This is enshrined currently in our own system of govt. via the 9th amendment.It should be noted that a change in the discourse or orthodoxy is not considered a "harm" by Mill. Thus, saying that a certain action, or speech, makes one uncomfortable, or "devalues" another institution in an abstract (rather than concrete) manner, is not a harm per se.now, let's apply the harms principle to each of the "slippory slope" examples brought up.Pedophilia: violates rights of children, who legally can't "consent"Bestiality: animals can't consent eitherPolygamy: admissable. So now tell me why its wrong.Crack: this ones tricky, but i do think it can be banned. Because drugs so fundamentally effect ones decision making abilities and can be reasonably be assumed to add to the propensity of rights violation in the future.Cannibalism: Violation of rights. Again, this ones a little tough, but I don't think one can violate his/her own rights either (can u sell ureself into slavery?)Homosexuality, therefore, ought to be protected under the harms principle.

The harms principle is, at heart, a weighing mechanism. The entire system depends on people respecting others freedoms. Drugs are one of the rare cases where a definite cause-effect chain can be made between an indirect action and future harmful conduct. Admittedly, the rarity of the situation makes this "tough" as I stated. But the absolute necessity of having a society where people are making free, rational decisions (which indeed is what the Harms principle is about) means that in this rare instance, an action can be banned that will likely lead to future ills.As with other drugs, again, we weigh. The positive implications of medicinal drugs, in my view, shift the equation back to the other side.Out of curiousity, do u oppose the harms principle theory or merely my interpretation of it RE: drugs?

First, I don't mean polygamy per se, I mean mutliple men/women. Please note that I said Adult, which should rule out the 'very young'. Again, incest would still be against the law (although I imagine that might eventually be legalized for consenting adults). And the people involved are not forced. It seems to me that your objections are based on what happened in some patriarchial societies which are not like ours.The sites I saw in support of polygamy seemed pretty current and even vibrant. I was very suprised, and a little worried.

My tendency towards libertarianism makes the principle sound pretty good. I’m just wondering why you picked out one drug. Why not alcohol or nicotine or caffeine or pot? Are you saying they don’t affect your judgement?In addition if you are going to weigh the harm/benefit ratio, how much harm is done via the drug trade being illegal?

DsaDevil,Let me point out a flaw in your arguement. HIV/AIDS infected people are allowed to do as they wish. Laws have been passed to PROTECT them and their rights, which is fine, however, they present a viable and substantial threat to everyone, gay or heterosexual, through blood or sex related induction. There are no actual legal stipulations regarding HIV patients having sex, particularily with non-HIV people, which may as well be considered murder.I don't understand how your analogous doctrine holds any substance regarding gays when there are clearly more harmful exceptions.Leviathan

Robbie:Multiple husbands for one woman are very rare, and this is referred to as polyandry.One can find anything on the net.Here is something from a polygmist living in the U.K. who cites what he calls the "benefits" of polygamy for women......Automatic childcare in a sexist society gives women more effective choice to have a career without devaluing the role of homemaker. (Jake: Unless you're the wife stuck looking after all those kids!)Being able to marry men who are already married means that women can marry men who have already proved themselves, therefore minimising their risk. Being able to marry the men who attract most women means they don't have to settle just for what's left after other women have the best pickings. (Jake: Right, those men are the big prized studs for being able to attract all those women!) Having the possibility that a husband can remarry without divorce extends practical security to a woman. She needn't worry about losing her husband and income as she loses her looks, because if her husband is attracted by a younger woman, he doesn't even have to think about leaving his wife. (Jake: Wow, he's so considerate of his first wife! A wife is not allowed to marry younger, more handsome men of course. This is not exactly a situation of equality, and not a situation a significant number of women today would tolerate.)Polygamy removes the pressure on a husband to commit adultery, and removes damaging deceit from a marriage.

hank: the harms principle is the basis for libertarianism. Check it out, in John Stuart Mill's "On Liberty." Its an easy read, and he's really sharp. For the record, I used crack as an example b/c it was brought up earlier as an example of restricting someone's action which "only effects themself."That doesn't negate the principle though. At best, if you're right, its an example of the principle being applied incorrectly. Furthermore, I'm missing the solvency aspect. Are you saying that there SHOULD be a law prohibiting hiv positive folks from having sex with non-pos folks (which would be permissable under the harms principle?). If yes, then that's fine, b/c the action is, as u say, a threat to other's rights. If not, then you are making a broader interp of the harms principle than me (which would certainly affirm regarding what we both agree is a less extreme example).

Why would there have to be specific laws re: HIV? Reckless endangerment and criminal assault laws already exist- it wouldn't make sense to have a new law for every transmissible illness.Also, only penetrative intercourse without a condom is a high-risk sexual activity. Otherwise the risk of contracting HIV is very low. Not to mention that HIV is no longer considered necessarily fatal.

see, that's where I disagree. The Harms Principle rests upon the premise that men are free moral agents, can make rational decisions on how to live there own lives (based on their own paradigms, not the governments) and thus, when they violate the rights of others, they can be punished, because as free agents they should know better. Crack affects one abilities to make rational decisions, thus throwing the system for a loop.However, this debate is ancilliary to the topic at hand. Regardless of whether banning crack is admissable via the harms principle, the principle itself hasn't been challenged, and so far its been universally agreed that gay rights falls under it.

again, its about weighing. With regards to alcohol, I think that the govt. CAN ban it under the harms principle, though I would recommend against it on other policy considerations. It should definitely be noted that just because something CAN be banned under the harms principle doesn't mean it HAS to be. There is room for policy and commonsense considerations. And in evaluation ofcommon sense, in my opinion (solely my own), I would hold that crack should be banned and alcohol shouldn't. But that's just me.

a couple of considerations.1) Crack harms to a more severe degree2) The prohibition problem with alcohol also is more severe than with crack. Since no one really considers alcohol to be illegal, people would just flagrently violate any laws against it (prohibition example). Now, I know u are about to say the drug war has amounted to the same thing re: crack. But, again, in terms of degree, it hasn't been as bad, mostly because the average american considers crack use to be an illegal activity. Its hard to draw a precise line, and I admit i am using a rather subjective moral calculus here. But unfortunately, crack and alcohol are both in the grey area, and grey areas tend to yield fuzzy reasoning concerning distinctions.

Do you have some evidence to back that up? And what do you mean by a ‘more severe degree’?Well you are right about that part. With the money wasted on trying to stop drugs, the law enforcement that is corrupted because of the huge amount of money involved, the innocent people that are caught up in this war, and the waste of people and money in prisons, I’m not sure how it can get more severe. I guess you might have an argument if prohibition was making some progress. But every year more and more judges and saying it’s getting worse in every category. If someone is so addicted to a drug that they will sell themselves into prostitution to get it, why do you think a law would make any difference?So it’s not a gray area for me. I don’t like it that some people are addicted to anything that ruins their health. But I don’t think the government should be telling people what to do with their bodies as long as they are not hurting others.

1. Harms whom? Crack I would say harms the individual far more than alcohol. However, alcohol leads to harm in innocent victims far more often than crack. When it comes to crackheads smoking too much and having their hearts explode, I say go for it. When it comes to drunks getting behind the wheel and wiping out families of 6, I start to have a problem. 2. When you look at it though, I would still say crack is far worse a problem than alcohol. There are many people who drink alcohol in moderation without causing significant harm to themselves or others. On the other hand, you will be hard pressed to find almost anyone who uses crack in moderation. A rather slippery slope type argument, first crack, then booze, then smokes, then coffee, then artificial sweetners...etc. There are many things which cause harm to people, banning all is not practicle, nor is it possible.

hmm...interesting points. I've kind of implicitly assumed that Crack is more intoxicating than alcohol, but come to think of it, my school's DARE program isn't a particularly reliable source.However, the key issues still stand. Both, in my view COULD be banned under the harms principle, based on the above. The reason i support a ban on crack but not beer is that i think its more feasible. The drug war is failing b/c we are adapting an idiotic "incarcerate first, ask questions later" strategy that doesn't have any long term solvency. A strategy that a) focus' on undercutting demand while b) making treatment widely available and cheap would work much better. Sundowner's second point is excellent.

Hmm. Interesting that you should bring up the topic of polegamy. The OT is a frequently used as a basis for condemnation of homosexuality. So let us consider what the OT has to say on the topic of polygamy. This morning in my scripture reading I happened across the story of Jacob and his search for a wife, after cheating Esau out of his birth right (Genesis 29 & 30). If you will recall, Jacob was attracted to his first cousin Rachel, but he was tricked by his Uncle Laban into marrying his first cousin Leah. When Jacob discovered he had been had, he insisted on having Rachel as well. So not only did Jacob enter into a polygamous marriage, but his wives were sisters who also happened to be close relatives. When Rachel turned out to be barren she gave her maid to Jacob saying," Here is my maid Bilah, go into her , that she may bear on my knees, that through her I too may have children." So Rachel's maid sits on her lap through labor and childbirth and Rachel pretends she is giving birth. Not to be outdone, in chapter 30 verse 9 Leah gaves her maid Zilpah to Jacob for sexual intercourse and she bears him a child. I don't know about anyone else but this whole arrangement strikes me as pretty icky. It would break numerous cultural taboos in the US yet it was clearly acceptable to God. God did not punish Jacob for this marriage and for having sex with his wife's maid but rather blesses him (See verse 25) In Genesis Chapter 30 verses 18-20 Leah says that God specifically blessed her for sending her maid into Jacob.Just some quick thoughts and queries.1. In light of the aforementioned arrangement a monogamous marriage between two loving people of the same sex seems down right conservative.2. No where in the OT is female homosexuality forbidden. Why would female homosexuality be acceptable in the OT but forbidden in the NT?3.The NT reference in I Corinthians 6:9 that many translate as homosexual are the words, Malakos (soft, fine or feminine) and Arsenokoites (literally Arsen- man man Koites - couch) The NT reference in Timothy is also Arseokoites. No mention of female homosexuality in either of these two verses.4. Romans 1: 26-27, Paul is addressing the pagan temple sex rituals that heterosexuals are engaging in as a form of idolatry. In this context it is heterosexuals engaging in orgiastic homosexual sexual acts for the purpose of worshiping false Gods that Paul is addressing, not faithful monogamous gay couples. These verses are a far cry from a clear prohibition on monogamous homosexual relationships. 5. You cannot ban gay marriage as long as any pastor is willing to peform the ceremony. You can only ban recognition of gay marriage by a government entity. 6. Christ said that , "whomever divorces his wife, except for immorality and marries another woman commits adultry. I wonder how many of the 800 signatures on your pettion are people who are on their second marriage. How many heterosexual people do you know who are on their second marriage? If you want to protect the sanctity of heterosexual marriage why not a petition for a constitutional ban on divorce except for immorality and/ or a constitutional ban on adultry?9. Matt 7:5 "You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye."

It would lead ultimately down the road to a marriage bill for polygamists. That is why the current push for a Constitutional Amendment to ban gay marriage also contains a provision banning polygamous marriage as well.Hmm....some opposition to the petition...More left wing ideology at work.

When Rachel turned out to be barren she gave her maid to Jacob saying," Here is my maid Bilah, go into her , that she may bear on my knees, that through her I too may have children." So Rachel's maid sits on her lap through labor and childbirth and Rachel pretends she is giving birth. Not to be outdone, in chapter 30 verse 9 Leah gaves her maid Zilpah to Jacob for sexual intercourse and she bears him a child. I don't know about anyone else but this whole arrangement strikes me as pretty icky. It would break numerous cultural taboos in the US yet it was clearly acceptable to God. God did not punish Jacob for this marriage and for having sex with his wife's maid but rather blesses him (See verse 25) In Genesis Chapter 30 verses 18-20 Leah says that God specifically blessed her for sending her maid into Jacob.Just some quick thoughts and queries.1. In light of the aforementioned arrangement a monogamous marriage between two loving people of the same sex seems down right conservative.2. No where in the OT is female homosexuality forbidden. Why would female homosexuality be acceptable in the OT but forbidden in the NT?3.The NT reference in I Corinthians 6:9 that many translate as homosexual are the words, Malakos (soft, fine or feminine) and Arsenokoites (literally Arsen- man man Koites - couch) The NT reference in Timothy is also Arseokoites. No mention of female homosexuality in either of these two verses.4. Romans 1: 26-27, Paul is addressing the pagan temple sex rituals that heterosexuals are engaging in as a form of idolatry. In this context it is heterosexuals engaging in orgiastic homosexual sexual acts for the purpose of worshiping false Gods that Paul is addressing, not faithful monogamous gay couples. These verses are a far cry from a clear prohibition on monogamous homosexual relationships. 5. You cannot ban gay marriage as long as any pastor is willing to peform the ceremony. You can only ban recognition of gay marriage by a government entity. 6. Christ said that , "whomever divorces his wife, except for immorality and marries another woman commits adultry. I wonder how many of the 800 signatures on your pettion are people who are on their second marriage. How many heterosexual people do you know who are on their second marriage? If you want to protect the sanctity of heterosexual marriage why not a petition for a constitutional ban on divorce except for immorality and/ or a constitutional ban on adultry?9. Matt 7:5 "You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye."

Anyway.....Back to the topic at hand.Will you sign the nogaymarriage petition?It has gained SIGNIFICANT momentum in the past month. There are now over 1 MILLION people who have signed it. As well, there are now 38 states that have banned gay marriage within their borders. All that would be needed in addition to these 38 states ratifying the amendment within their state would be the approval of 2/3 of Congress.Send a message to Congress. Sign the petition....emoticonXGood

As for the Medical Institute, well, their conservative agenda is quite obvious...Driven by medical, educational and other scientific data, The Medical Institute informs, educates, and provides solutions to medical professionals, educators, government officials, parents and the media about problems associated with sexually transmitted disease and nonmarital pregnancy. Indeed, the Medical Institute is at the forefront of these issues. Because the problems associated with these twin epidemics are so substantial The Medical Institute believes we must actively promote risk elimination, rather than just risk reduction. The Medical Institute believes there is a new sexual revolution underway - one based on science, built on character and bridged through education.http://www.medinstitute.org/about/whatis.htm

So...Going back to the original question - will I sign?NO.-peace=================================

First of all you don't know me and you are making a false accusation. Are you aware of what the Bible says about falsely accusing your brother (er, sister in this case).Are you aware siblings actually married in the Bible. It was also common practice in royal families up until just a few hundred years ago.Yes, I think incest is icky. I also don't see a plethera of siblings demanding marriage rights, so the idea that gay marriage will lead to it is a ridiculous argument and will get little more than ridiculous answers out of me.Secondly - just because I may feel a certain way about something from a religious perspective does not mean I think it has any business being forced on others. They may not share my faith. And they don't have to. God gave all of us free will. Stop trying to control other people - especially if they aren't hurting you. And gay people getting married won't do a dang thing to you. Mind your own business.I still think government can just but out of marriage all together.

Its amazing that we are even asking this question!! For more than 200 years in this country "everyone" knew the difference of right from wrong - and those that chose to do wrong were too ashamed to admit it. All of a sudden in the last 10 years they are trying to convice us that homosexuality is not "wrong" its a "choice" By that logic, some day murder will be a free choice (actually it already is in the case of abortion) They are doing a fine job of trying to convince all of us that their behavior is "normal". TV shows, movies, magazines, etc. are loaded with gay characters as an agenda to make you accept them. Don't buy it! Write to the media and tell them you won't stand for it.If we allow such thigs as gay marriage, other things will follow. (including polagamy, and marriage of children) Yes, its shocking, but these things seep in little by little. Imagine how shocked our founding fathers would be to read this discussion we have here!Homosexuals dont need to mess with marriage. If they want to be together, they can call it something else. Marriage is the union of one MAN and one WOMAN. (isnt it obvious - if you cant create a child together - its abnormal!)Homosexuals cant stay together anyway. the average is HUNDREDS of partners in a lifetime! So why would they want this when most will divorce soon afterward as they have already proven!!Every child needs a mom and dad if at all possible. Research has proven this.

Ohhh- like slave owners, and people who burned "witches", and lynched blacks and massacred Native Americans and/or ran them off there land, and put Japanese Americans in concentration camps knew right from wrong?Actually the majority of homosexuals will tell you it's not a choice. And I, being the wacky gal I am, have a tendency to believe the word of homosexuals on that particular subject over the word of straight neonazicons.Murder creates victims. One could even make that argument for abortion. You can't for homosexuality. Laws against gay marriage protect nothing but your sensibilities. Actually I really don't depend on the entertainment industry to give me a realistic picture of anything. I highly recommend you don't, either. What I know about gay people is from knowing gay people.What is shocking is your willingness to buy into fallacy. Marriage to children/sexual molestation of children creates victims. Pologamy - as long as everyone is a consenting adult I really don't care. I know what is and is not my business.Marriage is and has been many things - depending on what people at any given period of time found convenient.What in the hell does that have to do with it? Must all married people reproduce like bunnies? And, I am can ASSURE you, marriage is not required for procreation.All that is proven here is your prejudice. I bet you don't even know gay people. Sure there are promiscious gays. Same as straight folk. If the sexual exploits of Dennis Rodman and the Gene Simmonds do not keep us from barring committed heterosexuals to marry, why should the acts of promiscious gays bar marriage to committed homosexuals?My son's mentor and his partner have been committed for 18 years. I know another gay couple who have been together for five, and two lesbian couples who have been together for about 12-15 years.You might want to consider talking to the children of gay people about their parents. You could start with mine. When he hears arguments like yours - his response "shame on them." He's 11, but he gets it, and finds your point of view as repulsive as racism.

Well if there can be a Constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, why not to remove marrriage from the federal government? Where do they get that power Constitutionally? So that would mean states can choose not to recognize any marriage Constitutionally. I think that marriage is a church issue. Let gays, straights, everyone get civil unions to be recognized legally. But leave marriage to the churches.

Judging by your extremely prejudiced remarks and your overuse of exlclamation points, it would be a wise decision for any and everyone to disregard these statements as rubbish. I highly doubt romansten knows any homosexuals at all; I also suspect that he/she believes everything the TV says about us.

What a horrible mean spirited stance to take. You mean to tell me that that I have to live my life according to your standards? That your marriage and family are superior to mine? That my family, feelings, and right to live as I choose do not matter and should be dictated by your beliefs? No it is not obvious that marriage is between one man and one woman. What if the situation were reversed and it was gays and lesbians who were out with petition drives to deny heterosexuals marriage rights? How would you feel if it were your family was under attack by people you do not know because of religious beliefs you do not hold?BTW 2 men will very soon be able to, though stem cells, create a child genetically related to both of them and be able to carry the child ectopicly.The process is that a sperm stem cell is taken from one man then forced to become an egg then is fertilized in vitro then implanted ectopiclly in one of them.

King David having multiple wives was under Old Testament practice. Jesus himself stated that divorce laws were granted by Moses and allowed by God because of the hardness of the people hearts. Jesus said a man shall leave his father and mother and be cleaved to his WIFE, Not WIVES. BTW, its called serial MONOGAMY. If its 'right wing' to support a ban on homosexual/polygamous marriage than its 'left wing' to oppose a ban on homosexual/polygamous marriage.

And 2 men can't have a perfectly healthy, loving, stable marriage? Why not?Honey, every country collapses eventually. It's a cycle. An empire rises, reaches it's peak, and falls. Every single one.
