Why gun control won't work

Oh my God. We need to ban brains. It only requires half a brain the be able to build a homemade firearm. Thus people who have a full brain are 2X as dangerous.

You must be joking. I'm sure that making a gun is quite a bit more complicated than making a paper airplane.Then why do nations which ban guns have a much lower gun crime rate than the US? If what you say is true then we would expect to see the same amount of gun crime in nations which ban guns as in the US, but we don't.

Another example of misinformation from the VOR. Your tabel counts the private ownership of firearms. The assault rifles kept by militia members are not private firearms."Special Regulations for Military Firearms, Sporting and Hunting GunsDue to the long tradition and the special organization of the Swiss armed forces as a militia army, special rules are applicable for army weapons. Between their regular annual service of two or three weeks per year, Swiss soldiers and officers keep their personal weapons at home. After they have left the army, they may keep those arms in order to continue practicing at rifle or pistol ranges managed by local communities. Special rules also govern hunting or sporting rifles."http://www.eda.admin.ch/washington_e...ct/gunown.htmlThis Swiss are armed to the teeth!

Hey, I can do math. According http://www.handgunfree.org/HFAMain/r...comparison.htm 41% of US households have guns in them. According to Lambert at most 23% of households have assault rifles in them in Switzerland.1/5 of 41% is 8.2%So if we take away 8.2% from 41% we get 32.8%. Let's turn all the guns into assault rifles. So 32.8% of American homes would have assault rifles- more than 23% of households in Switzerland having assault rifle. You'd have to take away close to 1/2 of American guns. You certainly have my vote.

Let's just face it, the availability of guns has nothing to do with the crime rate. You can quote statistics 'til your faces turn blue and the other side will still have a statistic that says the opposite.The reason they have high crime rates in the US is because their culture and media glorifies violence and makes criminals public figures. If you want to be famous in the US the easiest way is to kill a lot of people, you don't even have to use a gun, most serial killers use other methods. Crime is a cultural problem but politicians don't like solutions that require insight, long-term planning and expert knowledge. Politicians are just interested in what will help them get reelected, quick fixes that look like they help even if they do nothing in the long run. Making another anti-gun law is like spitting in the faces of the victims of crime, "We could'nt protect you last time but we're gonna make sure you can't protect yourself next time" That's what they are really saying. If guns become outlawed, then I guess I'd like it better as an outlaw than a victim of stupid politics. And guns, well they are not hard to make at all, there are lots of plans and blueprints available on the internet so that any normal handyman can make a gun in only a few days.In fact I'm making my own blueprints for a 45 calibre submachine gun that will take less than 24 hours to make using only welding equipment and simple handtools you could find in any garage. Even the materials can be found at the local junkyard. Now tell me, how is gun control going to stop people from making their own? Are they going to outlaw hacksaws, files and drills next?

I bet you think that statistics is just a game. Pro-gunners say that statistics is just a game because they know the statistics prove them wrong. It didn't take me very long to figure that out.

Your NEJM article clearly says that the reduction of firearms will reduce firearm sucide and murder. No argument against that. You do not need gun control to reduce firearm sucide and murder. Sucide is a mental health issue. Gun control fails to address ALL the sucides. You can address ALL the sucides with mental health. Gun control excludes all the people who will kill themselves without firearms. Mental health will help both people who want to kill themselves with firearms and those who do not want to kill themselves with firearms.This country has a probelm with violence. Address violence and you begin to address all murders with knives, bats, crowbars, bare hands, and guns. Gun control will only solve the problem with murder with guns.Gun control will do a good job of "helping" people who don't need it, don't want it, and don't care for it.

First of all, I don't trust statistics and the reason is very simple. You can get exactly the answers you want by asking the right question. The questions are multi-choice which is a system that is notoriously easy to bias through the wording of the question and the possible answers.Example:What do you think would be the most effective way to keep guns out of our schools?A) Impose stricter gun laws.B) Ban all guns.C) Teach small children to handle assualt rifles in a responsible manner.D) Close your eyes and pretend the problem dosn't excist.Conclusion: 92% of the people questioned thought that imposing stricter gun laws would reduce the number of guns in the schools.8% favored banning all guns.Don't you see the deliberatly missleading sentence here? Homicide and suicides without guns did not decline? Okay, were they unchanged or did they increase? I'm only hearing half the truth here and I'm expected to fill in the blanks myself? I think the decline in gun-related deaths was because people killed themselves and others by other methods/weapons. This is typical anti-gun tactics. It's not a blatant lie but it's not the whole truth either.Voiceofreason, please let me explain some things to you as logic is not your strongest trait. Of course there is a connection between guns and shooting someone, no one is denying that. But there is no cause-effect relationship between guns ownership and murder or any other crime for that matter. Besides, there is no connection between having a brain and being able to think logically.Poverty, unemployment, lack of education, social injustice and Hollywood-violence-worshipping-movies are the problem, but these are social and cultural problems that are harder to do something with. It costs loads of money to solve these problems.But gun control is fairly cheap, has good PR value, it dosn't do anything about crime but what the heck, I only have to look like I'm doing something about crime, the only issue I care about is getting reelected.That's politician logic!!

I don't think that you're making a valid comparison. Alcohol and guns are two different things. The US repealed prohibition (the 18th amendment) after only 13 years. Are nations that ban guns thinking of repealing their laws? I don't think so. They know that they have a much lower gun death rate than the US. They look at the US as an example of what happens when you don't have enough gun-control. It might be hard for someone to understand that who has been brainwashed by so much pro-gun propaganda.As for cars, banning cars would certainly lower the drunk driving rate, but we obviously need cars for transportation. Consequently, nobody is suggesting banning cars.Cars, guns, and alcohol are all differents things. Viking is just introducing a bunch of irrelevant arguments and trying to confuse people about the issue so that he can advance his own agenda.

how come the anit-gunners are only concerned with gun crime rate? Why do they not care about the violent crime rate? Yes Washington DC may have lower gun crime, but if I am not mistaken, it is probably one of the most dangerous cities in the USA. My sister-in-law lived there for a while, she loves it, but said you don't want to be going anywhere by yourself. So it seems to the ant-gunners that as long as we dont have guns its good, even if more people are being rape, beat and murdered, right? If I am wrong then someone please explain to me the resoning behind it all. Here is an example of how guns protect people. I grew up in the supposedly worst, and most feared part of Ogden. Where most the gang members lived. I lived there 19 years, you know how many gun deaths there was? 5, yes I said 5 in 19 years, and do you know why? Everybody had guns. all the gang members went into the more posh areas of town to commit their crimes. I actually feel more safe out in little Mexico as it is called, then up on the east bench where me and my wife live now. So please explain to me how guns hurt more people in that instance?

Texas's crime rate went down while Bush was governor. Why? Because Bush got a concealed carry law passed. Now the criminals knew that anyone, anywhere could have a gun, and they thought twice about committing a crime in public.Also, name one major city that has a crime rate higher than Washington DC's.

That's nice. A drop in crime due to what? I don't know and I can't tell from your numbers. Your statistics don't know and you don't too. No where in your fbi crime reports gives credit to the drop in crime is due to gun control.I am absolutely sure you don't read your own sources. Examples:1) Department of Justice Assault rifle study2) Washington Times law suit for DC gun ban3) and now the FBI crime report.

Kelvin,Apparently, you don't read my posts very carefully. Nowhere did I say that the drop of the general crime rate in DC in the FBI Uniform Crime Report was due to the gun ban. But my New England Journal of Medicine article concluded that the gun ban led to a drop in the homicide rate. And you should be fair. It doesn't say the drop in the overall crime rate in DC was due to the gun ban in the FBI report, but where in the UK report does it say that the rise in gun crime is due to the gun ban? -Voice of Reason

Sorry I did jump to conclusions, but that post was also very vague.You are right that gun bans do reduce homicide rates, but it does not protect people who are not killed by guns. They still get killed anyhow. Murder is a violence problem. Cure violence and you cure both forms of murder: firearm and non-firearms murder; and you do it without punishing law abiding citizens. Gun control will not help people who are killed with a knife, but it will surely disarm people who need to protect themselves. I think you need to read your own post carefully. Historically you have shown a very gross ineptitude of posting pro-gun articles.

Those reports point out a crime rate that was already declining, there is nothing to indicate that the gun bans had anything to do with crime at all in those, go look at the average persons income in state and compare it to the crime rate there, you will find almost predictable outcome. And the UK report was not supposed to find the cause of the rising crime rate, it was just supposed to point it out, I do find it strange though that the Crime rate (which was declining) started to go up in the same year as guns were banned. The same thing happened in Australia as well.

From cbs.com and the 60 minutes website, I learned something new today.The single most common form of firearm death broken down by race and gender, is:White men by sucide.Not crime and not by accident. Take the deaths by crime for white women and black men and women (6897), and you will almost total deaths by white men by sucide (13,214).So if you want to stop gun deaths, then you focus your effort on white men who want to kill themselves. Interesting.

That was in 1997.Did you forget that the UK was recently slammed in Jan 2003 for:Counting multiple attackers as a single attack.(In the USA multiple attackers are counted each as separate attack.)A crime is not counted unless there is a conviction in the UK.(In the USA a crime is counted, even when no gulty party is found. In other words in the UK a dead body is not a murder until they convict the murderer. No conviction, no murder, eventhough there is a dead body.)A string of crimes committed by the same party is counted as 1 crime.I am suprised you forgot all about that. We had a very lengthy posting session regarding the false reporting of UK statistics in another thread. Sorry for pointing the finger, I myself am guilty of selective memory.

You must be joking. I'm sure that making a gun is quite a bit more complicated than making a paper airplane.Then why do nations which ban guns have a much lower gun crime rate than the US? If what you say is true then we would expect to see the same amount of gun crime in nations which ban guns as in the US, but we don't.

They have very few gun crimes relative to the US. So it appears that the laws are working for the most part. Who is saying that taking away guns will make people stop being criminals?

Even though your car analogy has already been shown to be wrong, I would like to use it to prove a separate point.I will admit, I drive over the speed limit all the time. Do I know that I am breaking the law? Yes. Do I know that I can get in trouble for doing it? Yes. Do I know that it could increase my chances of having an accident? Yes. Do I drive slower despite the fact that I know all these? No.If you institute gun-control, criminals also won't care that they are breaking the law by having a gun. Just like I still drive over the speed limit despite all the reasons I posted why I should not do so, criminals will still use guns even if you make it illegal.

Sound great to me. You know what? The anti-gunners don't care what you think.I don't know what legal doctrine they use to justify keeping guns away from good people, but the concept of a blanket to restrict the rights of both guilty and innocent together is fundamentally wrong. It violates all notions of personal responsibility. Punishment is the restriction of rights. Gun control is fundamentally wrong when it restricts both guilty and innocent together.

I know this is an old posting, but I thought I would add to it. I have built several 1911 clones. Press forge the frame (and slide, sometimes), then mill the parts. I use a CNC mill (about $750,000). A lot fo guys, though, use a $300 minimill from harbor freight. A setup for press forging the parts (press forging is the better modern alternative to drop forging) will set you back less than $200, if you are a good scrounger.Gun building is probably a more common hobby than you might think. It is hard to tell exactly how many people are doing it, because a homebuilt gun requires no registration, permit to build, or any of that other XXXX (unless you are building an NFA firearm, which is a machine gun). There is even a yahoo group about building your own gun. Fro the faint of heart (those who don't want to forge or cast theri own reciver/frame) there are a bunch of places that will sell you an 80% finished reciever, which doesn't count as a firearm from a legal viewpoint. I always buy my barrels since it is too much work to do the rifling. In a pinch, it could be done, it just wouldn't be a competition grade barrel. Of course, most firearms you buy don't come with a stock competition grade barrel.

I don't know about you, but I know I could, and I will assume that you could, also. It really a very simple thing to do. Plans, scaled blueprints and a couple of good books on metlaworking would get you right in business. I think that a realistic number for seting up a shop to turn out your own guns is probably about $1000. This would include a milling machine, a hydraulic press (actually, a 25,000 ton bottle and some steel beams, you would have to put the thig together yourself......it is good practice). This would prety much give you the ability to build your own forged frames and slides. Everything else on most guns can bemilled (hammers, slide locks, safeties, etc...)I started building my own because I wanted some stuff included that wasn't offered from a manufaturer. I wrtoe a letter to the ATF asking about the legality of building your own gun. They said you can build your own gun, as long as you are not building it for resale, you don't need a permit, serial numbers, or any of that other XXXX. I have sold a couple of guns I have built. According to the ATF, as long as the primary consideration of building the gun is NOT to sell it, you are OK doing this.I have several dozen handguns I have built myself. It is not worth doing if you are just going to build a 1911 clone or a p228 (these are my 2 favorite guns) to factory specs. If you want to build something "special" though, it is the only way to go. An example:I just finished a p228 today with a blasted stainless frame. The slide rails (both on the frame and the slide) are graphite imprgnated so you never have to worry about lubrication. Trigger, slide, and hammer are damascus consisting of 1045 steel and nickle sheet. When you etch this, you end up with a dark grey "background" with silver inlays (I prefer either a ladder pattern or amiden hair pattern).You can't pick something like that up down at your local Gun Den. People don't think about this kind of thing. They go "that would be far too complicated". This is a load of XXXX. You could set up an operation that turned out 75-100 guns a day for probably 10 grand, and you would only need about 5 guys to staff it. Just one more reason that gun control won't work........

Interesting.I got a point to hash out?If the anti-gunners ban buying guns? Then can we just make our own?

A very weak argument against gun control. According to that logic the UK should have about as many gun deaths as the US because you say that if people can't legally access guns then they will just make their own guns. But wait a minute, the gun death rate in the UK is much lower.

I don't know about you, but I know I could, and I will assume that you could, also. It really a very simple thing to do. Plans, scaled blueprints and a couple of good books on metlaworking would get you right in business. I think that a realistic number for seting up a shop to turn out your own guns is probably about $1000. This would include a milling machine, a hydraulic press (actually, a 25,000 ton bottle and some steel beams, you would have to put the thig together yourself......it is good practice).

First off are you an American or British? If you are claiming gun control works in the UK because of fewer gun deaths you are wrong. Which citizens in the UK are obeying the gun bans there? Are the criminals obeying the gun bans? Are law-abiding citizens obeying the gun bans? It is clear all the gun bans did in the UK was to prevent law-abiding citizens from having guns!Another reason for not comparing the US to the UK on the 2nd amend is that the UK does not have a right like the 2nd amend. So there is nothing to compare. This is also why the UK can ban guns and the US cannot.

Having been to the UK, and having a couple of associates there who are somewhat less than reputable, I happen to know that you don't need to make your own. They are not THAT hard to come by. Of course, I have also been told "you don't really need a gun over here. The people are such a bunch of babies that theres really no point to it."Making weapons is a last resort. We would most likely never have to build our own. They already import drugs by the ton into the US, and I am told that smuggling guns is even easier becasue they don't have gun sniffing dogs.

i agree with that, they are, i have met someone who is a friend of my grandma's that lives there and me and my dad are hunters, and when we mentioned that we go hunting, he asked if we had are weapons with us and of course we did at that time, we just got bac from hunting, and he completly fliped, he wouldn't talk to us if it was just my father, him, and me, but if my grandma was in the room than he was ok, i know that you might say that he thinks gunowner's are bad, but my grandma says that guns scare anyone that comes from that area where he lives.

I had a british guy and his family (wife, 2 kids) move in down the road from me (about 1/2 mile). I have a pretty decent firing range set up behind the house, and have people over pretty often to do some shooting. Drove the poor guy nuts. They moved after only 3 months. Every time anybody would be out there shooting, they would call the sheriffs department. Sheriffs department finally charged the guy with false police reports or false 911 calls or something. He came down right before he moved to tell me that he was moving somehere "safer". I hope he moves somewhere really safe where guns are illegal. I am thinking he would enjoy New York, or Compton.

daewoo....do you think this is why there is a lower death rate in the UK than in the US? Because of how chicken all the UK people are (No offense meant to any) or is there another reason?

I personally don't know enough folks from the UK to say. When I said they were big babies, I was quoting some friends who have lived there for quite a while. The guy up the road, well, I don't consider him a wimp, just an idiot who has been brainwashed by the socialists.When you say the death rate is lower, do you mean death due to crime? If that is the case, I think the death rate is lower because of the lower rates of violent crime. I think the "gun" problem in America is really a sociological problem that has nothing at all to do with guns.

"FROM MY COLD, DEAD HANDS!!!!!!"

Good theory, rarely practiced. Personally, I am pretty sure that if they passed a law tommorow banning all guns, the majority of gun owners would be standing in line by 5:00 PM to turn in their guns. There would be some holdouts, but not as many as we would like to think.

Well I say less than half.. Even the spineless canadians are refusing...http://proliberty.com/observer/20010115.htmlets say for arguments sake that 50% of the people have guns in the us... Out of that 50% just 1% decide to resist.... How many is that?

More liberal claptrap? Sorry, Charlie.. if that were to happen, the MAJORITY would be those NOT turning them in! You obviously don't know what you're talking about. Like the other poster stated, even the majority of Canadian gun-owners are refusing to comply with their Nazi-like confiscation program that has already cost their tax-payers something like $1 billion.

Patrick Henry, first of all, you have taken the name of a great man. Frankly, you barely deserve the right to speak the name, much less use it to identify yourself. Patrick Henry was a thoughful man who spoke rarely, but when he did, every word was carefully chosen. He once said "I prefer the written word, as it leaves no doubts as to intention.....". I seriously doubt that he would appreciate his name being used to identify somebody who shoots their mouth off without forethought or reason.This is the second time you have spewed off about what a liberal I am. First, you obviously have not read many of the older messages, or you would know better. When it comes to people being good little subjects and doing what they are told, based on what we have seen in califonia, the number of folks who are more than willing to turn in their guns for $50 and a slice of pizza at the gun buyback programs, and the estimates of gun ownership in cities where they are heavily regulated, I feel comletely confident in saying that the majority of gun owners would fall ito line like the good little subjects they are.I spoke today with a friend of mine who is a congressional aide. We were specifically talking about the riders that have been attached to the bill which would protect gunmakers from frivilous lawsuits. The riders in question would essentially close down gun shows and extend the assault weapons ban indefinatly. This has been a fairly hot topic in gun groups lately. Do you know how many letters that congressman has recieved from his constituents about the issue? TWO. Mine was one of them. The other was a letter supporting re-enactment of the ban. People aren't willing to get up off their butts and write a letter, but they are more than happy to complain when the ban passes. Do you really think that these same folks, who can't be bothered to write a letter to defend their rights are going to be willing to commit a felony by keeping their guns?Another thing comes to mind on this issue. It was a study conducted at (I believe) Harvard. They pulled 20 people off the street and put them in front of a panel fo buttons that were numbered between 1 and 10. The 11th button said "DANGER....LETHAL". They were told that they were going to be administering electrical shocks to a person in the next room as part of a study in pain.They pushed the buttons one at a time, starting at 1. When thay got to button number five, a person in the other room began to moan (nobody was hooked up, of course, the box was a fake). By button number 9, the person in the other room was screaming their head off and begging for it to stop. After button number 10, the participants were told to push the button marked as lethal.Do you know how many of those good, upstanding americans refused? Not a damn one of them. Not a single person refused to go any further when the guy was screaming, and not a single one of them refused to send the "lethal" shock. At this point in the experiment, somebody came in from the other room an pronounced the "subject" dead and the real subjects reaction was observed. Of the 20, only 2 showed any visible signs of remorse. The most prevelant reaction wa something along the lines of "I did do it right didn't I?"Interestingly enough, this study has been repeated multiple times, in multiple countries now. After multiple repititions, we have found that less than 1% of Americans refused to deliver the lethal shock. In mexico, less than half the people were willing. In Denmark, NOBODY was willing. In London, 100% of the people were willing. NOBODY in Canada was willing.Do you really think that the same brainwashed CATTLE (americans) who are willing to deliver a lethal shock to somebody on the say so of some guy they have never met before, but that they percieve to be in a position of authority, are going to refuse to turn in their guns?I think the bigger problem would be staffing the turn in points adequetly to handle the rush to get them turned in. Americans are taught form an early age to respect authority, real or percieved. Americans don't question, we follow orders. As sickening as it is, there are not enough independant thinkers left in the whole country to really make a difference. We have 2 political parties. On the one side, you have the socialists, on the other, the fascists, and we are fine with this. Political activism anymore means siting at home on your couch and complaining about how things are done, or logging onto the internet and whining in a chat room.DO you know what most congressional offices consider an "large influx" of letters on an issue? TEN. If ten original letters on a single issue arrive in the same week, the issue is flagged as important to the constituency. Do you know what happens to E-mails that get sent to congreesman? A constituent rep reads them, sends a canned reply, and deletes it. Same thing goes for form letters (the ones that end with "cut and past this then print it and mail it"). They figure that if a person can't take the time to sit down and write an actual letter, they don't care that much. Personally, I agree with them. Do you really expect them to believe that you are going to vote for someone else because of an issue that you can't be bothered to spend 10 minutes on?Besides, who else are you going to vote for? We have a two party system.

A copy of the service contract is posted annually, including contact information, through just about any federal publication listing federal bid packages.Hmmm...Again, no point, babbling and name calling because you can't refute. Are you sure you are not a liberal? You don't find it even the slightest bit disturbing that 100% of Americans tested were willing to kill a stranger because somebody else told them to?You need to do a LOT more research on socialism and fascism. They are entirely different. Thee is a thread on one of the other forums where I lay down a brief compare and contrast between democracy, socialism, communism. Read that, then look up fascism.I am not a moderate, either. If anything, I would have to say I am a borderline anarchist. I want as little government and as few laws as we can get. Your representative never saw your letter. It went to a constituent rep, who researched it and wrote you a reply. What, in a paragraph where I encourage people to write their congressman in order to ensure that their voice is heard, leads you to believe I hate America? You are not making sense (of course, this seems to be the norm). Of course, you did just prove my point about the effectiveness of writing a letter. Agin, though, you need to go back to political science 101 and take a look at socialism and fascism. They are mutually exclusive.Actually, last time around I supported Buchanan. I just couldn't bring myself to be a bush supporter. People like you are why we have gun control. If we could present a logical argument/debate to the antigunners there would not be such a problem. Instead, yu can debate gun control and they go home and go "I met this drooling lunatic tonight who was pro gun. We should DEFINATLY pass laws to keep people like that from having firearms." You need to CALM DOWN just a bit. Back your arguments up with logic, anecdotal evidence and research, and you get a lot better reception. Your views will be held in much higher regard. The only people who base a debate on name calling and innuendo are little kids and hard core liberals. This is why they are not taken seriously.Of course, as it stands now, I have interesing messages to print out and pass around at lunch for a little levity.

More personal attacks from sombody with no case to make.This is what is called a "source" it is what those of us who actually do research use to prove our point. If you would like a copy of the source, all you have to do is contact the department of justice. Send them a letter with 35 cents (they charge a nickle a page for photocopies, front and back, and the report is 7 pages). It is a very simple matter. Alterantively, you coud subscribe to some of their newsletters. They print results of reports like that in their newsletters as soon as they are completed, and they send them to you for free. A "source" is where research has been done, or a study has been done, and they publish the results. There are a lot of differnet places out there that you can pick up materials.Where is your first hand proof?

YOu can obtain copies by contacting the government printing office. There is a small charge for having a printed copy delivered. I think it is available online as well, but can't say for certain because I get a copy in the mail so I have never bothered to look. This is another one of those pesky "sources".By my count, I have listed at least 2 sources that are verifiable and publicly available, and you have listed exactly 0. I did not say I supported gun buy back programs. I don't, I think they are a terrible idea. I used them as an example of the fact that people do not cling tot heir guns as tightly as you have asserted. Do you even understand what we are debating?While a do realise that you most likely are not intelligent enough to understand the experiment I explained, suffice it to say that it was a scientific experiment based entirely on documentable, observable action carried out by a test subject. Usually when people refer to "psycho babble" they are talking about soft science type experiments with non observable results that require a certain amount of theoretical interpetation. THis is not the case with the study I cited. The study I cited involved measuring a physical reaction (pushing a button) in response to a verbal stimuli (being told to push the button). Results, Americans pushed the button every time. As far as "luke warm" support for the second amendment goes, I have one of only 97 concealed carry permits in my sate that have been issued to private citizens. I also hold the ONLY class 2 license.

The postings where I refered to gun buyback programs indicated no support whatsoever for them. Again, you are aparrently too ignorant to not only remeber what we were debating, you also cannot read a simple statement and understand the context in which it is made. I have seen you reference hitler several times in some of your posts.

I own a company that does quite a bit of work for the federal government (including the DOD). I have gotten to know a lot of congressmen, I know how they do things. Even NAtional Socialism is incompatible with fascism. Did you look up a decent definition of fascism? There is an excelent book called "Political systems: A difinitive comparison" By a guy named Roscheck. I would suggest you take a look at it. It is kind of long (roughly 1500 pages) but worth the read. There are about 300 pages on fascism. I am certain you would find it informative.Nope, I am absolutly against gun buyback programs, and have never said anything to the contrary. I fully support the second amendment (especially since I have one hell of a lot of money wrapped up in a large gun collection.You seem to have trouble remeberign what we are debating.

The second is that you see yourself as an incredibly bright person. In either case you are, of course, wrong. You come across as a jackass. YOu, of course, don't have to answer the question. I am just tryint to understand the logic of somebody who jumps my butt for only supplying 2 sources, when they have provided none at all in this debate. I am one of thos folks that is driven by logic, as opposed to knee jerk emotional responses. You are apparently the opposite. I find it interesting that you come down on the side of the gun control debate that you do. I have found that in general, it is the people who are rooted in facts and logic that opposed gun control, and the emotional types that are anti gun. In your case, it seems to be the exact opposite. You apparently know no facts, and are incapable of making arguments based in logic, but you are a pro gunner. Interesting.

I can't decide if you are kidding, if you are a a lunatic, or if you are just not bright enough to follow the debates here. I do see that you are apparently not bright enough to QUOTE messages so they are easily read/followed, although the 16 yr old kids here don't seem to have any trouble with it. I also notice that your post is big on name calling and inuendo, but very light on content.There is one line in all that XXXX that was probably worth typeing, the one about voing democrat at every election. The rest is just raving by somebody who can't come up with a decent point. I haven't voted democrat yet. You might also do a "view source" to see how the whole quoting thing is done.According to department of justice "Gun buyback program summary, 2001", the majority of guns turned in at gun buyback programs are not stolen, and the average value of the weapons is $320. They don't list how they get the estimated value. Personally, I doubt the truthfullness of your assertation. The guns that are purchased in buyback programs are generally turned over to either the ATF or the FBI (when there is not an ATF office available locally). They are diassembeled and sold to Temp and Company steel and melted down for scrap under a service contract awarded to them in 2000, and renewed every year since.

I would have agree with JustAnotherGuy and not just cause I'm a conservitive bush supporter. But because the facts do seem support him. Lets look at some places with stringent gun laws.National Center for Policy Analysis 2001 said:If gun control laws have any effect, it may be to increase crime. For instance: New Jersey adopted what sponsors described as "the most stringent gun law" in the nation in 1966; two years later, the murder rate was up 46 percent and the reported robbery rate had nearly doubled.In 1968, Hawaii imposed a series of increasingly harsh measures and its murder rate, then a low 2.4 per 100,000 per year, tripled to 7.2 by 1977.In 1976, Washington, D.C., enacted one of the most restrictive gun control laws in the nation. Since then, the city's murder rate has risen 134 percent while the national murder rate has dropped 2 percent.British crimeBBC News Online (July 16, 2001)handgun crime in the United Kingdom rose by 40% in the two years after it passed its draconian gun ban in 1997.Australian crime.USA Today (May 9, 2002)"Since Australia's 1996 laws banning most guns and making it a crime to use a gun defensively, armed robberies rose by 51%, unarmed robberies by 37%, assaults by 24% and kidnappings by 43%."Canadian crime.The Fraser Institute, November 2003 After enacting stringent gun control laws in 1991 and 1995, Canada has not made its citizens any safer. "The contrast between the criminal violence rates in the United States and in Canada is dramatic," says Canadian criminologist Gary Mauser. "Over the past decade, the rate of violent crime in Canada has increased while in the United States the violent crime rate has plummeted."Now lets look at some places with lax gun laws.The Washington Times (March 28, 2000).the media highly publicized a safety course which taught Orlando women how to use guns. The result: Orlando's rape rate dropped 88% in 1967, whereas the rape rate remained constant in the rest of Florida and the nation.FBI Uniform Crime Reports, (1988)Vermont: is one of the five safest states in the country. In Vermont, citizens can carry a firearm without getting permission . . . without paying a fee . . . or without going through any kind of government-imposed waiting period. And yet for ten years in a row, Vermont has remained one of the top-five, safest states in the union having three times received the "Safest State Award."FBI Uniform Crime Reports, (1988)Florida: concealed carry helps slash the murder rate in the state. In the fifteen years following the passage of Florida's concealed carry law in 1987, over 800,000 permits to carry firearms were issued to people in the state. FBI reports show that the homicide rate in Florida, which in 1987 was much higher than the national average, fell 52% during that 15-year period thus putting the Florida rate below the national average.FBI Uniform Crime Reports, (1988)Kennesaw, GA. In 1982, this suburb of Atlanta passed a law requiring heads of households to keep at least one firearm in the house. The residential burglary rate subsequently dropped 89% in Kennesaw, compared to the modest 10.4% drop in Georgia as a whole.So you see, if you want reduce crime, (which would resul in safer places to live)then what you need is less gun controll laws. Rather than folowing down the faulty path of gun bans and ending up like:New JerseyHawaiiWashington, D.C.Britin Australia and,canadaI hope you see my point.(I can bring up further evidence if needed),and please excuse my awfull spelling.

You are absolutely correct!Why should criminals care if guns are illegal -- especially if they are already outlaws?! :PUS States that concealed weapons actually have lower crime rates. Do you know why? It's because the criminals know that their "victim" could potentially defend him/herself.

All the laws in the world won't work, criminals will always be able to get guns. If they can't buy them, smuggle them in or steal them, they will make them. Criminals have even made guns inside maximum security prisons.Follow the link.GUN-MAKING AS A COTTAGE INDUSTRY
