Wednesday, July 23, 2003 By Sam KastensmidtA recent study of Dutch homosexual men found that homosexual unions simply do not last. The study found that the average homosexual relationship lasts only 1-½ years. By comparison, more than two-thirds of heterosexual marriages in America last longer than ten years. Dr. Maria Xiridou, of the Amsterdam Municipal Health Service, conducted the survey, which was published in the May edition of the AIDS Journal. Not only did her research indicate the failed longevity of homosexual relationships, it showed that rampant promiscuity that exists in homosexual unions. Dr. Xiridou’s research found that “men in homosexual relationships, on average, have eight partners a year outside those relationships.”Earlier studies have also indicated that the gay community has difficulty with monogamy. In 1984, authors David P. McWhirter and Andrew M. Mattison surveyed 156 gay males, who were involved in homosexual relationships that had lasted between one and thirty-seven years. Their study found that every single couple that had been together more than five years had incorporated a provision for outside sexual activity. “Fidelity is not defined in terms of sexual behavior, but rather by their emotional commitment to each other,” the authors wrote. David Smith, a spokesperson for the Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest gay activist group, strongly disagreed, “Most gay people I know have been in relationships many, many years, and they’re absolutely monogamous.” He declared any survey that points to homosexual promiscuity as “wild charges.”However, Anne Peplau, a psychology professor at the University of California at Los Angeles, acknowledges that homosexuals are far more commonly involved in infidelity, which she justifies by claiming it is not harmful in an open relationship.“There is clear evidence that gay men are less likely to have sexually exclusive relationships than other people, but this is not typically harmful to their relationships because partners agree that it’s acceptable,” Peplau stated. The Human Rights Campaign has desperately attempted to project the image that homosexual relationships are wholesome, pure, principled, and monogamous, but the facts are simply not on their side. The Advocate, America’s largest gay magazine, published the results of their own survey in the August 1994 edition. Their research found: Fifty-seven percent of gay readers claimed more than thirty sexual partners during their lifetime. Thirty-five percent claimed more than one hundred sexual partners in their lifetime. Forty-eight percent admitted having a “three-way” sexual encounter during the past five years.Twenty-nine percent admitted to meeting their partners in a bathhouse or a sex club.While these statistics compiled from homosexuals are far from reflecting the “normal” lifestyle associated with a heterosexual relationship, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) voted to “normalize” the homosexual lifestyle in 1973. A closer inspection of the 1973 decision reveals that the vote included only roughly one-third of the members of the APA. Four years later, when the journal, Medical Aspects of Human Sexuality, conducted a survey of psychiatrists, the study showed that 69 percent of psychiatrists disagreed with the APA’s vote. When presented with the facts, it becomes apparent that the actions of the APA were, at a minimum, not representative of the psychiatric field as a whole.

Wow, look at me! I also can find sites that discuss studies, just like Jaaaman. Mine show that gay men are less promiscuous or close to equal in promiscuity, in comparison to heterosexual men...b) In a study of sexual behavior in homosexuals and heterosexuals, the researchers found that of gay and bisexual men, 24% had one male partner in their lifetime, 45% had 2-4 male partners, 13% had 5-9 male partners, and 18% had 10 or more sexual partners, which produces a mean of less than 6 partners. (The statistics I did by myself using the data presented, which is presented as a percentage of total males interviewed, both gay and straight (p. 345)--they can be verified yourself by looking at the numbers given in the paper)(Fay; n=97 gay males of 1450 males total). In a parallel study, a random sample of primarily straight men (n=3111 males who had had vaginal intercourse; of the total sample of n=3224 males, only 2.3% had indicated having had sex with both men and women), the mean number of sexual partners was 7.3, with 28.2% having 1-3 partners, and 23.3% having greater than 19 partners (Billy). This data indicates that gay men may have fewer number of sexual partners than heterosexuals. J Billy-1993: Family Planning Perspectives 25:52-60 R Fay-1989, Science 243:338-348 In another set of studies, the first (n=2664) showed that gay men had an average of 6.5 sexual partners in the past 5 years. In fact, the authors of this paper report that "homosexual and bisexual men are much more likely than heterosexual men to be celibate" given the data in the table below, which compares their data to a second, parallel study of only heterosexual men (n=1235, age=18-49 yrs). The table indicates the percentage of men having the given number of sexual partners in the previous year [top row: Binson; bottom row: Dolcini]: orientation no partners 1 partner 2+ partners gay 24 % 41 % 35 % straight 8 % 80 % 12 % D Binson-1995: Journal of Sex Research 32: 245-54.M Dolcini-1993: Family Planning Perspectives 25: 208-14.http://www.jeramyt.org/gay/gayhealth.html

I wonder how many married heterosexual men have had affairs?and I bet there is no study that will have accurate numbers because so many would never admit to it.Men are promiscuous more than women.. That's a fact.I am sure there are men that would never admit to it, maybe not even act on it but in their minds somewhere they are always looking for "strange"So IMHO that is a weak argument against a gay union, simply because that will exist in all unions gay or straight.What is your point Jaaaman?Problems that exist in marriage are going to exist in any union, no one is perfect.

Gays and Lesbians are a hidden population. It is hard to get acurate data on hidden populations. If you want to find gays and lesbians you have to go to pride festivals or bars. Most happily coupled gays and lesbians don't go to these things. So where did they find the subjects for these studies? Bars, bath houses, festivals. Does it reflect any happily coupled gays and lesbians. What was the methodolgy?Some studies widely used by the right wing said that most homosexuals were promiscuos (weinberg and bell) that catch of that study is that the subjects were all found in bath houses, so of course they were. It wasn't a random sample of data.Another study showed gays tended to be alcoholics, but further investigation showed all of the study subjects were surveyed in bars. Well duh! Of course the study found lots of alcoholics.Statistics do not lie...statisticians do....Jaaman tend to do everything he can to make gays look bad, it doesn't work because it is not a christian thing to do.

Below are the conclusions from the "Meet the Neighbors" study done in RHode Island on the GLBT population. THE RESULTS OF THIS COMMUNITY SCAN are based on a survey of 371 individual community members, four focus groups with targeted populations, a survey of 16 separate organizations, and key informant interviews with 18 different community leaders. These are the finding on Relationships and Families.Rhode Island LGBTQ individuals have created lasting relationships and families. Fifty-three percent of all respondents reported being in monogamous relation-ships, with the average length of relationship being 7.25 years (range: one month to more than 39 years). Eighteen percent had previously been in a male-female marriage, and four percent were currently heterosexually married. Forty-five percent reported currently living with an LGBTQ partner (40% with partner, 5% with partner and children). According to the U.S. Census, 65% of the general Rhode Island population report living in a family household, with 48% living as married partners, and 31% living with children under 18.8On the whole, expanding recognition and rights of LGBTQ partnerships and families was ranked as one of the top community issues. LGBTQ relationships are treated differently than heterosexual partnerships, lacking privileges and benefits afforded to heterosexual couples by law. When asked about benefits accompanying legally-sanctioned marriage, 81% of all respondents indicated they would want domestic partnership coverage, 77% are in favor of civil unions, and 67% want legal marriage as an option. Eleven percent of respondents reported they have had a commitment ceremony or wedding with their partner.ON RELATIONSHIPS AND FAMILIES“I am a typical Rhode Islander. My primary connections are to my family. I spend Saturday and Sundays with my family. Being a part of the LGBTQ community is just a slice of my life.”7A full-length portrait of Rhode Island’s LGBTQ individuals · Overall FindingsThe presence of children in LGBTQ-led families has been surveyed in several other LGBTQ needs assessments, and each has found one fifth to one quarter of respondents indicating they are parents, often biological.9,10,11,12 In the present study, 22% indicated they were parents. Of these, 71% reported being a biolog-ical parent, 6% had adopted, 26% shared parenting with a current or previous partner, 14% were stepparents and 11% were grandparents. (Note: Participants could choose more than one category, thus percentages do not total 100%.) Nearly one out of every four respondents indicated they intended to have children in the future. While most (44%) were not yet sure what method they would choose, adoption (26%) and alternative insemination (17%) were the top two choices among available options.http://www.rifoundation.org/equity_a..._Neighbors.pdf

Good point. We lesbians tend to have longer lasting relationships. Not to mention that we also tend to date our friends, our friends ex's, our ex's ex's, our ex's friends...eventually we'll end up dating ourselves. Just kidding.

My experience is similar to spevacek's--the two committed gay couples in my circle have also been together for 10+ years. Both couples wear rings and at least one of them had a commitment ceremony. Amazingly, the institution of marriage survived long enough for both couples to attend our (straight) wedding.

There is also this factoid from http://www.buddybuddy.com/factoids.html:In a random, national polling in 1989, The San Francisco Examiner found that:60 percent of 287 gay men were currently involved in a relationship.64 percent of 113 lesbians were currently involved in a relationship.In their San Francisco Bay Area sample:58 percent of 299 gay men were currently involved in a relationship.81 percent of 101 lesbians were currently involved in a relationship.The poll was published in their “Gay in America” series, in which they state:“Contrary to the stereotype that gays are prone to unstable relationships, The Examiner poll shows that half the current gay relationships nationally and two out of three in the Bay Area have endured for more than two years. The median is 2.3 years nationally, 2.9 in the Bay Area.”Aside from the above, however, isn't marriage supposed to be the time-horored antidote  for promiscuity?How can people in good conscience accuse gays of promiscuity on the one hand while denying them access to legal instruments of commitment on the other?

The entire premise of your statement and your subject title are absurd and misleading. You are attempting to compare married hetrosexual fidelity to unmarried homosexual sexual encounters; hardly the same basis of defining a "relationship".One valid study would be a comparison of sexual fidelity between married male hetrosexuals and male homosexuals in legally recognized marriges. That's kind of hard to do right now, isn't it? Where will you get your data?Or how about longevity of relationships between unmarried male hetrosexuals and unmarried male homosexuals. Where is your research study on that?The Dutch study you cited was based on the MEDICAL RECORDS of male homosexuals (read the study itself) and published in an AIDS journal. Medical records? AIDS journal? That would lead to the conclusion that the individuals involved in the study had some sort of medical problem (STD? AIDS?). What about homosexuals WITHOUT medical problems? Could one not conclude that homosexual males with STD's or AIDS were more likely to be sexually promiscious than homosexual males without medical problems? Could one not also conclude that hetrosexual males with STD's or AIDS were more likely to be sexually promiscious than hetrosexual males without medical problems? Where is your research study on that?I also find it amusing that your source reference for THE ADVOCATE study is not from THE ADVOCATE itself, but from the Catholic Family Association of America. Hardly an unbisaed reference source.Your conclusions fail any measure of credibility.

AIDS journal? That would lead to the conclusion that the individuals involved in the study had some sort of medical problem (STD? AIDS?). What about homosexuals WITHOUT medical problems? Could one not conclude that homosexual males with STD's or AIDS were more likely to be sexually promiscious than homosexual males without medical problems? Could one not also conclude that hetrosexual males with STD's or AIDS were more likely to be sexually promiscious than hetrosexual males without medical problems? Where is your research study on that?I also find it amusing that your source reference for THE ADVOCATE study is not from THE ADVOCATE itself, but from the Catholic Family Association of America. Hardly an unbisaed reference source.Your conclusions fail any measure of credibility.

Again, instead of dealing with the issues someone raises, you respond with wild, unsupported allegations and personal prejudices, not unbiased facts. How do you know there aren't MANY homosexuals without STD's or AIDS? I happend to be a 54 year old homosexual and have never had either. Neither has my partner. Neither of us are promiscious.You are just making inflamitory remarks.Sodomy? Homosexuals hardly have a monopoly on any sex act, be it with a penis or a "foreign object"; be it anal or oral.Again, you simply lack any credibility.

Not too many homosexuals out there without std's or aids...... And not too many that aren't promiscous in some way..... making it all the more likely they will further health problems down the road.Anyway, sodomy is a dangerous pastime........ Foreign objects and penis's do not belong in ones rectum...... We are designed a certain way for a reason and that is not part of the design. emoticonXIdea

The 1995 book, Sex in America, by Gina Kolata, Edward Laumann, and Robert T Michael, which summarizes the results of the last comprehensive nationwide sex survey in this country, reveals that as many as a fifth of the women surveyed practiced anal sex. (The Kinsey Institute New Report on Sex (1991) puts the percentage even higher.)I think it's logical to assume that the overwhelming majority of these women were neither lesbians nor performing the act by themselves, but with male partners. The figure can therefore safely be extended to the population at large, give or take a few percentage points.Given that most conservative estimates place the entire gay population of the U.S. at 3-5% (some ultra-right groups place it even lower), taken with the uncontestable facts that 1) few lesbians indulge in penetrative anal sex, and 2) a significant portion of gay men don't either, it becomes clear that, in raw numbers, the number of heterosexuals who are having anal sex far surpasses the number of gay people doing the same.

Here's the kicker: the ONLY time I have EVER contracted an STD was from my LEGAL HUSBAND! I'm female, just incase you had forgotten.Also, that would mean my HUSBAND went OUTSIDE the marriage and brought home an STD to me! This means he: 1) Lacked ability to curtail his infidelity2) Was dishonest3) Was promiscuous~ Needless to say, because of his infidelity and thusly "killing" our marriage, we divorced shortly thereafter. I took my vows seriously. Obviously he lacked the emotional maturity to do the same.Please note, I was his SECOND wife and after me he married two more times! He has six biological children. He once threatened to taken our son from me. I laughed at him and pointed these facts out to him. He never mentioned it again.My partner and I have been together eight years. She has NEVER contracted an STD. She has also NEVER had relations with a man! Neither of us have HIV/AIDS. Neither of us has ever strayed outside of our current relationship.Turning our attention to the idea that "foreign objects don't belong in one's rectum." May I alert you to such things as sopositories, thermometers, gloved fingers of doctors and medical surgical tools. These things are used in/on the rectum without any political or populous out-cry.This also does not mention those heterosexual couples who actually ENJOY anal intercourse! :p

I guess we can assume people are going to stop using their feet to walk with, if such a notion is so ludicrous. But for some reason, I just never see very many people walking down the sidewalk on their hands. Not that it's not possible, of course. Yet somehow it certainly seems more plausible that the feet evolved for walking rather than the hands.

The implication of the post being responded to was that our body parts (the anus was the example) were designed for one specific function, and to use them for other purposes was in violation of some sort of natural law.If that were so, the mouth could only be used to take in food, and speaking, breathing through it, spitting, whistling, kissing, etc. would be disallowed.The assertion is ludicrous.

Better yet, how about simply making it between heterosexuals who claim they are married, and homosexuals who claim they are married? I see no reason to based such a comparison only on marriages that are 'legally recognized' as opposed to simply taking people at their word that they have made a commitment of monogamy (which is a marriage commitment). After all, gay people don't have to wait on the govt. to make such commitments. A commitment is a commitment regardless of govt. benefits, right?

The entire premise of your statement and your subject title are absurd and misleading. You are attempting to compare married hetrosexual fidelity to unmarried homosexual sexual encounters; hardly the same basis of defining a "relationship".One valid study would be a comparison of sexual fidelity between married male hetrosexuals and male homosexuals in legally recognized marriges.

I thought the general "feel" of the right wing was that homosexuals don't make these commitments because we are out rucking around with every guy we see while taking antibiotics for all our STD's. We couldn't possibly have committed monogomous relationships that look like a marriage {/sarcasm}

You win! emoticonXAgree IMO, gay men seem to have an in-born propensity for discovering the true purposes of body parts previously thought useless... the prostate, for instance. :) I wonder which purpose, BTW, the female breast is considered primarily intended for: feeding the young or attracting mates. Seems to me "chicken or egg" argument that pretty much screws up the "one intended purpose" theory.And of course, if some of our primordial ancestors hadn't tried using their fins to crawl out of the ocean ("Hey, those are meant to swim  with, you pervert!"), it's possible we would never have gotten to "feet."

I'll take that is a "yes," as that is pretty much what I was trying to say (which you undoubtedly realized).To answer your question, it's true that there are parts of the body with no apparent purpose (or "function" as you prefer to put it in a more secularized way). Your example was one such part. I wouldn't claim that every part of the body has a function, but there are certainly plenty that do. As the original conversation were about sexual organs, I would say they fall into that catagory.

To the contrary. Your question was phrased in such a way as it imply a) a "purpose" that stands apart from what we, as individual humans, may choose to use our body parts for, and b) but one of those. Neither of which I agree with. We are free to use virtually any part of our body for any number of "purposes," any and all of which can be seen as a result of the ongoing evolution of our species.

Hey, lets not forget that the male penis has several functions as well. It's function is NOT soley for sexual intercorse with a female. It also serves as the urine outlet. I'm amazed that EVERYONE here has flat out IGNORED that FACT.{sarcasm point of no return}From what I hear they make halfway decent hat racks too.I can only take what I have heard as I have limited experience in the matter and have NEVER once attempted to demonstrate this. AND THEN....I'm curious, if sex and marriage serve only to ensure procreation, what of elderly couples or post-menopausal women who marry? It's not like they're going to be having kids anytime soon. emoticonXRolleyes

One thing I find interesting, and somewhat disturbing, is that people tend to identify an individual as either heterosexual or homosexual based on their sexual activity. For me, and many other homosexual people that I know personally, this "sexual activity" is only one of many aspects that is part of who and what we are. The relationship I share with my husband (yes, we consider ourselves that, be it legal or otherwise) is in no way based solely on sexual activity. It is based on love, trust, compassion, commitment, and truly caring about each other. Any sexual activity is merely an outgrowth of these feelings. To us, it is sharing this depth of feeling with a person of the same gender that makes us homosexuals, not just some sex act we may or may not perform in the privacy of our bedroom. I ran across this in a novel I am currently reading:
