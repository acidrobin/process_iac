Hello all. I am new here.I've been lurking a bit and wondered why homosexuality is even an issue for heteros? Is it because it's been hated or "taboo" for so long (a learned reaction perhaps)? As a heterosexual, how has homosexuality hurt or affected your life in any way? As a heterosexual, what gives you the right to dictate how homosexual people live?What if you have a non-christian living here in America (that would be me)...do you require them to live their lives the Christian way? Please explain.Thanks,LadywolfPS: To my fellow homos, is this board really as hostile as I've seen here? There is an awful lot of hate from heterosexuals than I've ever been exposed to before.

Why is This Even An Issue for Hetero's Anyway?!

First off worldwide Christians are the most tolerant.In other Islamic, Jewish, Hindu, Shinto, Buddist, and every other religous country homosexualtiy is not tolerated. You only see homosexuality mainly in Christian majority countries.Also it affects us becaue we need to draw a line between what we find acceptable in society. We as a scoiety determine if pornography, public nudity, drug use, and all other activity is acceptable to us as a society. How does pornography use affect me if I never use it? How does bigamy or polygamy affect me? How does stock manipulation affect me? How does prayer in school affect me if I choose not to participate? There is no behavior that doesn't affect us in some way. Society is affected by all behavior either in good ways or bad.

I support gay rights but sorry I don't agree. I think the majority here support gay rights (not necessarily marriage). This board tends to be more liberal than conservative.

The more we seek to redefine marriage, and chip away at God’s original design for the home, the more we put our families and our nation at risk.This debate about gay marriage is really just the latest outgrowth of a culture that for decades has been drifting from biblical standards of truth and morality. The sexual revolution, for example, sought to bring legitimacy to sex outside of marriage. The women’s liberation movement worked to revolutionize the roles of men and women in marriage and in our society. Throw in a rising emphasis on materialism and personal happiness, and you end up with a dramatically new way of looking at marriage.When millions of Americans view marriage from the mindset of “What’s in it for me?” concepts like responsibility, self-sacrifice, and lifelong commitment become secondary. Is it any wonder that our divorce rate is so high? Or that the number of children born outside of marriage continues to rise? Or that an increasing number of couples are opting to live together instead of marrying?And now the push for gay marriage seeks to redefine marriage even further. From the moment God created marriage, it was designed with a man and woman in mind. God designed two sexes male and female—He did not create four sexes. Homosexual marriage cannot fulfill God’s purposes for marriage.I realize we are not all Christians here. However, this issue of gay marriage transends all of society and it will have a negative effect on all of us. JMHO.

Well, I'm straight, and the reason it's an issue for me is that I hate repression and intolerance, and I think people have a moral obligation to stand up to it, evenif it doesn't effect them directly.Which is to say I support gay rights as a matter of principle, in case that wan't clear.

I disagree. It is the west that is on the whole more tolerant, in spite of, not because of, christianity. If you go to some of the African Christian countries you will find it to be just as oppressive as Islamic/other countries.As much as I don't like to do it, I do agree here ( :p ). Homosexual marriage doesn't technically affect me either, being heterosexual. That doesn't stop the fact it is a very important issue to me.

Whoa, gotta disagree here. While quite a few are pro gay rights (not that sure how you can be pro rights and not marriage) I'd say this board is very right wing on the whole, much more than I'm used to.

Hey and welcome. Unfortunately whilst most on the board do seem to have a more moderate view on this issue, those who are against it are quite vocal, hence your initial impression.In the end almost the entirety of the anti-homosexuality opinion appears to be religious based. Sure they do make arguments that are not founded on religion, yet every single anti-gay supported appears to be coincidentally also a devout Xtian. Personally I believe that is the source of the prejudice, and therefore if you believe something to be 'against god' that is justification enough for imposing his view on others.

My thoughts exactly.A few here have tried to object on non-religious grounds, (money) and IMHO, for the most part, have been completely unsuccessful in their attempts.IMHO, the strong opposition on this board boils down to the high number of religious posters.Waxy

I thought in poll after poll we found this board to be more conservative than liberal.Even conservatives don't wish to oppress gay people. Sure they are not in favor of gay marriage and wish to keep in with the more traditional definition of marriage but that is not to say that they are going to take away their fundamental rights.

I don't think you can say that marriage is such a high and lofty ideal in a society that includes celebrities that marry and divorce almost every year, uses marriage in reality TV, and has TV sitcoms such as Friends where the main characters marry and divorce each other at a whim. The only religious vestiges the institution of marriage holds is where the actual word "marriage" is derived from. Marriages can just as easily be done by a judge instead of a priest, rabbi, etc. Why not let gays join in on the fun?
supports

The problem is, IMHO, religion (LOL, when do I ever say any problem is anything else?). Marriage is still primarily a religious ceremony. The Bible is against homosexuality. Therefore homosexual marriage not only condones sin, but uses the very institution of the bible to do it.Of course I don't see how this would be a problem if civil unions, with all the rights of marriage, were enacted. But this seems to be a point not discussed much.What annoys me the most about this whole debate is the half-baked theories people post to justify homosexual prejudice on non-religious grounds. If it is your religion that is the reason you disapprove, then bloody well say so. Don't concoct flimsy arguments to somehow try to give it secular legitimacy as well.

I'm heterosexual... It's an issue to me though. I don't know, I guess I just don't like seeing other people pushed around for the way they are. I'm not black either, but I don't want people pushing around black people just because of the fact that they're black. I'm not a woman, but I don't want to see women being abused. @phuntingMarriage has nothing to do with religion. Marriage has been a business transaction for YEARS before the thought of "holy matrimony". People have been pairing up since the dawn of man. It's kind of silly to think that any one particular religion invented the idea.

Of course not, but when has actual historical truth had anything to do with 'tradition'? The point is in the recent past (ie few centuries) marriage and religion have become intrinsically connected, which makes people believe that it is a tradition dating back to pre-historic times. The point is here and now people link marriage with religion, hence the problem. And I never claimed any specific religion invented anything, but instead living in a Judo-Christian society as we do it is the Christian church that is seen as the basis of matrimony, regardless of if it is or not.

Hi Ladywolf,I am also new here. I am normal (straight), and I am a christian. I don't hate homos because I have pity for them. Let me explain.I see how there are 3 groups of homos, and it also relates to other people as well, like drug addicts, etc.1st group - they are homos, and live with their partners and are faithful to their partners (like you are), but they don't show off and often times you don't even realize that these 2 persons are gays.2d group - a person is gay and he realizes that it is not normal, that it is a perversion, and he's trying to deal with it.3d group - a person is a gay and he's proud of it, he's showing it off, goes to gay parades, leads TV shows, organizes gay websites and is actively promoting gay lifestyle.Okay, in all 3 cases a person is gay. In cases 1 and 2, his own lifestyle more or less is not affecting me. Right, these people can be very good and have virtues, and be otherwise morally good people, but they are gay, that's their problem, and they know they are different so they try to deal with it or at least not show it off.Now, 3d case is what we see everywhere, and we see more and more of it each year. This is becoming a problem. This is sick. I don't see parades for hetero families. I wish they were, though. But the fact that there are gay parades prove to me that this group of people active and want to challenge the society. Nobody would be that antagonistic to them if they didn't show off like that and actively display their sexual orientation. That's what causing the counteraction. So what's the problem with you, gays? Why do you want to propagade your lifestyle and why do you impose your thinking on everyone? If you just lived your life and didn't make it a big deal, like heteros don't make it a big deal, maybe you'd have less resistance.As for christian tolerance -- maybe you have a misconception of what it is for christians. There's no tolerance to sin. But there's love for the person. I say that I agree to talk with gays and be around with them, and if they asked me for help (other then help directly related to they gay actions), I'd render help as to any other person, but no, I would never agree with the concept of homosexuality, and I judge it, because I have this right. I don't condemn you, but I am telling you -- return to the human nature.

You gave the explanation in your own post. You, and bigots like you, can "deal" with gays as long as they stay in the closet and you don't even have to acknowledge they exist. But if they should slip up and, say, hold hands in public, then out comes the outrage, the firings, the baseball bats. I don't know how old you are, but not too long ago in some parts of America, being seen holding hands with another man was as good as a death sentence. Clearly this had to change, and wishful thinking from inside the closet wasn't going to do it. Thus, Gay Pride Parades. If you don't like them, you have only yourself to blame. If you showed as much tolerance for gays as you do for hets, the parades woudln't be neccesary. As long as people like you get on your soapboxes and rant about the evils of sodomy, the parades will continue. The choice is yours.

America has better things to be proud of then gay parades. And so with your life. There are things you can be proud of and some you shouldn't be proud of. I know there is a lot of rage. I don't excuse it and don't say that it's right, but one reason, is that it is a reaction to morals decay.

In both cases we have one side advocating restriction of marriage that has absolutely no affect on them, and said restriction only serves to impede the happiness of others for the justification of their own morals.

I'm a married woman to a lovely danish man. We've been married for eight months now, and it has been a very very difficult process. INS is a hard thing to tangle with, and there are a lot of restrictions on this kind of thing. We have to be very careful about planning and traveling and taxes. However, I am very happy I just have the right as a citizen to marry whomever I wish. I think that this needs to be a right for everyone, not just straights. To me marriage is not about procreation...maybe once upon a time it was. However, if you look back on the history of marriage, it used to be simply about social connections and money. Now people view it as a way to express love for one another and show the world that they have made an honest commitment that will hopefully last a life time. Marriage has gone through several changes: Once marrying someone of a different religion, color, whatever, was taboo. It simply was never done, and those that tried were ostracized. They still are. However, people are learning and changing, and those types of relationships are becoming much more accepted, but we need to do more.The minute we say that one type of relationship is unacceptable, we proceed to shut the door on many other things. Many try to say condoning homosexuality is like condoning beastiality. These are stupid people grasping at straws to protect their ignorant fears. That's like saying that allowing freespeech is like condoning Nazism. To ban gay marriage is to make way for more restrictions to be made. What's next? You can't marry someone if you don't reach a certain IQ?And...also, look at the fact that..despite people's beliefs, America is not the most liberal of countries. Other places are doing a far better job of making things more free for their citizens. Quite a few parts of the European world have had Gay marriage for a long time, without ill results. Heck, Look at Denmark. A magazine ( I believe Time) rated Denmark as one of the least corrupt countries in the world. They have lower crime, and are more likely to slam companies for dishonesty, and work to keep their people equal. They also have gay marriage and protect their rights. If America truly wants to tout itself as land of the free, it best start comparing itself to the countries doing a better job of it before bragging.A Cynical American.

That's like saying that allowing freespeech is like condoning Nazism. To ban gay marriage is to make way for more restrictions to be made. What's next?

Other places are doing a far better job of making things more free for their citizens. Quite a few parts of the European world have had Gay marriage for a long time, without ill results. Heck, Look at Denmark. A magazine ( I believe Time) rated Denmark as one of the least corrupt countries in the world. They have lower crime, and are more likely to slam companies for dishonesty, and work to keep their people equal. They also have gay marriage and protect their rights. If America truly wants to tout itself as land of the free, it best start comparing itself to the countries doing a better job of it before bragging.A Cynical American.

Wow, it sounds like the people that don't agree that gay people should be able to marry their life partner are really super angry about this issue. They are strongly against same sex marriages. So in reviewing the replies I see a few others stating their opinions and giving support. The ones that are against it seem a lot more emotional than other oppositional issues. That's interesting. It's like they are directly affected by gay people's lives and I guess I just don't see the reasons they are so angry.

Unfortunately most Americans couldn't find Denmark on a map of the World.I share your sentiment.

Well Ladywolf, that is really more of an argument than it is an honest question. If marriage was truly a private affair that impacted nobody outside the couple themselves, then, yes, that question would be valid. But that is a very shallow understanding and a very uninformed understanding of the nature of marriage, because marriage is just as much — if not more so — about the community as it is about the couple themselves. But it's not the community that gets married.No, it's not the community that gets married, but it's the community that enforces marriage and develops marriage. We need to understand that marriage is just as much a social norm — a social ideal — of the kind of behavior that we expect and need for a healthy vibrant society; as much as it is about the emotional commitment of two people.One of the biggest issues is the social role of marriage. Marriage domesticates men. Men who are not attached permanently to a woman are men that will practice and engage in socially unhealthy behaviors at a much higher level. How will same-sex marriage effect the concept of "marriage"? Marriage becomes reduced down to nothing, because the moral argument for same-sex marriage is the same moral argument for group marriage, for polygamy, and it is going to be impossible to deny polygamous groups — and group marriage people — who come forth in all sincerity and say, "If you can't restrict marriage to only couples of opposite sex, then you can't restrict marriage to only two people." They are all very much interwoven.The three things that you lose are: 1) the domesticating influence of marriage on men; 2) the protective influence of marriage upon women from being victimized and objectified by men; and 3) it provides mothers and fathers for children. When monogamy is lost as an ideal, the idea that a man should commit himself and forego all other sexual relationships but (the one with) his wife, then women become commodities to be used and collected by men. When committing yourself to a woman and subjugating your sexual desires for the sake of that woman — when that becomes just one lifestyle choice among many, it is devastating to a culture.Same-sex "marriage" also denies every child it touches access to either a mother or father. It is never compassionate to intentionally deny a child either a mother or father.

Hello all. I am new here.I've been lurking a bit and wondered why homosexuality is even an issue for heteros? Is it because it's been hated or "taboo" for so long (a learned reaction perhaps)? As a heterosexual, how has homosexuality hurt or affected your life in any way? As a heterosexual, what gives you the right to dictate how homosexual people live?What if you have a non-christian living here in America (that would be me)...do you require them to live their lives the Christian way? Please explain.Thanks,LadywolfPS: To my fellow homos, is this board really as hostile as I've seen here? There is an awful lot of hate from heterosexuals than I've ever been exposed to before.

Not that I neccessarily agree with your reasoning, but let's look at your conclusions. 1) If this is true, than gay marriage is actually a plus. Two men pacified in one ceremony! WooHoo!2) Same argument for lesbians.3) You do realize that you won't be required to marry someone your own gender, don't you? Lots of hets will still be getting married and breeding. I don't think we'll be running out of children any time soon.Your last point is really the only one that may be quasi-valid. There may be some benefit to a child having both a mother and a father, I'm not really sure one way or the other. However, I am sure the two parents of any gender is better than one. So if you're really concerned about child welfare stop wasting your time with gay marriage and do something about the appaling divorce rate.

IMO those who vehemently oppose same sex marriages and consider gays sexually abnormal are merely voicing rhetorical dogma interpreted from within their mythological belief systems, echoing contemporary peer group ignorance or climbing on the widespread US oppression recently publicized by our standing president until his handlers finally told him to back off or lose lots of votes. Or, that infamous insecurity of possibly being gay is haunting them. I view them (opposed) in the same light as people who condemn anything 'foreign' to their intellectually dark patch of existence. I have yet to read or hear any valid opposition containg reason to same sex relationships or marriage. I lived in San Francisco two different times, the last in the mid-80s when one of three of your gay male acquaintances/friends were dead or dying of AIDs. And if you did live in the city as a straight without male and female gay friends and or social/business acquaintances, believe me, it had to be under a rock or on a military installation. And, as most people who are familiar with the gay community can tell you, many people would be in absolute shock at the number of practicing gays who are still in the closet due to business, social and family circumstances, especially in small towns and medium sized cities where public opinion tends to dominate economic and social structures. The land of the free is at times almost as big a joke as our foreign policy.

“Don’t you interfere with my family and I won’t interfere with yours.” I'm sorry, but what gay activists really want is a new national policy saying that no longer is a mom and a dad any better than two moms or two dads. That policy would turn some very important principles upside down:Marriage would become merely an emotional relationship that is flexible enough to include any grouping of loving adults. If it is fair for two men or two women to marry, why not three, or five, or 17? The terms “husband” and “wife” would become merely words with no meaning.Parenthood would consist of any number of emotionally attached people who care for kids. “Mother” and “father” would become only words.Gender would become nothing. The same-sex proposition cannot tolerate the idea that any real, deep and necessary differences exist between the sexes. It must rest on a “Mister Potato Head theory” of gender difference (same core, just interchangeable body parts). If real differences did exist, then men would need women and women would need men. Our children would learn that sexual differences are like mere personality types. Wait until your kids start bringing those papers home from school.

wow... that's the worst bit of paranoia I've seen in a long time... did Rush say all of that or did you make it up yourself?And I don't see how letting a man and woman get married to each other doesn't warrant polygamy just as much as letting two men or two women get married to each other. You could easily use the arguement "Well, if a man and woman can get married, why can't a man pair up with two women and marry them both?" Why does gay marriage make this any easier?Also, it's irrelevant whether or not two women raising a child is better than a man and woman... it's no doubt better than one woman raising a child, or one man raising a child. Gender wouldn't become "nothing". You act like everyone is going to turn gay the second gay marriage is legal. You think men and women won't be attracted to each other any more in most cases? Things will be EXACTLY THE SAME as they are now in your life and in most other people's lives. Only, there'd be more couples around to adopt those kids you guys are always talking about in the abortion threads.

Actually, that is the logical extereme of the gay-activist position. All the rhetoric has been "We are exactly the same as you, our love is the same, there is no difference between a hetero couple and a homo couple".Ah, but before we could say "It is not a traditional marriage to marry a man and two women, therefore we do not allow it" (sound familiar?). Once we allow one non-traditional marriage, the same arguments can be used to allow others. A polygamist marriage will not affect you, they love each other the same, the love that they give the children is exactly the same, the gov't has no business telling me who I can and cannot love. My love deserves validation, it is discrimination when the gov't supports one loving relationship and not another.Also irrelevent how many raise the child, as long as the child is loved. In fact, if the child recieves more experience with more people, I daresay that the child will be better adjusted.Then what is the difference in value between a hetero and homo couple?

Equal rights does not make gender meaningless. Women have had equal rights for nearly a century.

Because it's bollocks.You espouse 'traditional' marriage. What is 'traditional' marriage? One where the wife was considered a possession of the husband? One where children could happily marry adults? One arranged by the parents when both participants were children? One where the husbands use of prostitutes and mistresses is considered normal? One that only stays within bounds of class/race? All of these are 'traditional', but people ignore that fact and paint 'traditional' as being some rose-tinted vision of a era in the near past. Marriage has already evolved from these things, thankfully, and will continue to do so.

Are you kidding? Marriage is only about the domestication of men? That's ludicrious. Men are not wild untamed beasts that need to be caged in.

Its two individuals making a choice to being together. Also, again, I'm going to point out that same sex marriage has existed in other cultures without horrible results.

I'm a married woman to a lovely danish man. We've been married for eight months now, and it has been a very very difficult process. INS is a hard thing to tangle with, and there are a lot of restrictions on this kind of thing. We have to be very careful about planning and traveling and taxes. However, I am very happy I just have the right as a citizen to marry whomever I wish. I think that this needs to be a right for everyone, not just straights. To me marriage is not about procreation...maybe once upon a time it was. However, if you look back on the history of marriage, it used to be simply about social connections and money. Now people view it as a way to express love for one another and show the world that they have made an honest commitment that will hopefully last a life time. Marriage has gone through several changes: Once marrying someone of a different religion, color, whatever, was taboo. It simply was never done, and those that tried were ostracized. They still are. However, people are learning and changing, and those types of relationships are becoming much more accepted, but we need to do more.The minute we say that one type of relationship is unacceptable, we proceed to shut the door on many other things.

How about:

Yes, I think so. Why do you ask?It isn`t. Its 2,0% (est. 2003)... They do. The appointments in the judicial branch are either political (by a democraticly elected government) or based on merit. The legislative branch is elected through popular elections and the executive branch (the government) is in turn elected by the parliamentNope. Denmarks political system is based on parliamentarism. The executive power rests in the prime minister, not the monarch (who lacks political power).Nope, judges are either appointed by democraticly elected governments or hired on merit (depending on what facet of the judicial branch you are talking about).Well, I`ve always seen denmark to have a rather high level of political, economic, social and religous freedom (the only real detriment is high taxes, but some would argue that high taxes coupled with a large amount of income distribution actualy increases economic freedom, so its kind of ambigous). This being mixed with relative socialistic and prosperous economy makes Denmark a good contestant for the title "the land of the free".

Yearly efforts to find pride in the gay lifestyle portray a lack of inner peace. The constant demand for acceptance also illustrates this. The public cannot be forced to accept homosexuality.

First of all how do you know it's a sin? Because the bible says so? Well I'm sorry but I don't believe everything I read. And I don't believe everything in the bible mainly because it was written by like 50 different people. It wasn't written by God himself. And no you can't make people accept homosexuality and their will be people that will never accept it. I see nothing wrong with 2 people being in love and wanting to share that.

Homosexual marriage will always be an abomination to God. When God calls something unholy, man cannot make it holy or bless it. Granting same-sex couples a license to marry will not create true marriage. Neither two men nor two women can become one flesh. Licensing the unnatural does not make it natural. It would be a state-sanctioned counterfeit, a sham and a fraud. Homosexual sex is dangerous and destructive to the human body and powerless for human reproduction.

First of all how do you know it's a sin? Because the bible says so? Well I'm sorry but I don't believe everything I read. And I don't believe everything in the bible mainly because it was written by like 50 different people. It wasn't written by God himself. And no you can't make people accept homosexuality and their will be people that will never accept it. I see nothing wrong with 2 people being in love and wanting to share that. It's a beautiful thing when 2 people are in love. And I think everyone should butt out and let people live their lifes! Life is to short for all this non sense. Blue

So then you agree that any Christmas parades with Santa, or more importantly other symbols of the Christian holiday should be banned right? Atheists don't want Christmas flaunted in front of them.Churches shouldn't be allowed to have Nativity scenes or crucifixes on them either if I read you right, it's just plain offensive. I think ANY public display of affection such as you've mentioned is inappropriate. Unless you're going to make all such displays illegal, you don't have a leg to stand on with that one either. Just don't take your kids to a gay pride parade, seems simple enough.Waxy

No one is forcing you to attend the Gay Day party....You don't want your kids to see, don't take them.I live in Los Angeles and West Hollywood is the "gay" mecca, you have to be pretty motivated to watch the parade...Its not that easy to get a front row seat , and if your kids can see it, you worked way to hard to get them there.Its a free country, they can have their parade just as you can choose not to attend.

Homosexual intercourse is clearly forced. Unlike the vagina, the anus is not self-lubricating, so an artificial lubricant must be used. The vagina is self-cleansing, while the anus is a filthy wasteland of bacteria. The anus exists to excrete fecal matter from the body; it should be apparent to any reasonable thinker that the anus ought not be used as a receptacle for a penis. Is it any wonder that the rate of sexually-transmitted diseases among those who engage in homosexual sex is many times greater than among those who engage in natural sex.

Yet, lesbians are less likely to get diseases than straight people. Nothing is forced, and no chance for unwanted pregnancy. So by your reasoning, since lesbian sex is less likely to spread disease, and nothing is forced, all natural lubricant is used... then it's really the way to go!

Divorce, domestic violence, and child abuse, in the heterosexual lifestyle portray a lack of inner peace. The demand for a constitutional ammendment to ban same sex marriage also illustrates this. The homosexual community will not be forced to accept unequality, hate crimes, and homophobia. Traditional Marriage defenders are like a freight train out of control, running over each and every homosexual family as well as their friends, all in an effort to promote one thing: acceptance of their religion and values of hate and intollerance in the US constitution. This not only affects the homosexual community, it devides our country, it attempts to promote the bible and christianity as part of the US Government. DOMA activists feel they can keep us in the closet while promoting "homophobia" or hate and a good and Christian moral that needs to be written into the consititution - by deceiving and desensitizing this generation now. The same sex marriage ban is one way they are doing this very thing.

[QUOTE=Jaaaman]Homosexual intercourse is clearly forced. First of all, Homosexual intercourse does not necessarily mean anal sex. Homosexual means two people of the same sex. This includes lesbians as well. So your statement Plus, even with men there are a various ways of reaching sexual gratification besides Anal sex.  The vagina is self-cleansing, while the anus is a filthy wasteland of bacteria. Actually I would describe the anus as self cleaning also. Most of the bacteria that is present there is beneficial bacteria that "cleans" the area.

Just because you yourself are not homosexual and you do not find two men or two women kissing each other attractive does not mean that you get to force that view upon us.

Homosexuality is immoral. My morals have no more validity than those of the relativist, because we are both human, both fallible and of a limited perspective. Nor do the shared beliefs of a majority of people dictate morality. If nine of ten people find murder an acceptable practice, that does not make it so. The source of moral judgment must lie outside of humanity, it must be changeless, and of an infinite perspective. For the Christian, that authority is the God whose will is expressed through the Bible and the traditions of the Church – both of which expressly condemn homosexuality. None of the world’s major religions approve of homosexuality. For the nonreligious, the highest source of authority is the natural law. Homosexuality transgresses natural law by subverting the propagation of the species. The consequences of transgressing natural law are often obvious; if you touch fire, you will be burned. Surely, the long list of diseases associated with homosexuality is evidence of causation. America must never allow this unnatural, unhealthy and immoral life style to become normalized.

The homosexual community seizes upon scanty evidence to justify something because they want it justified, not because they've examined the evidence carefully. They'll say animals practice homosexuality. How do they know that? Because they have seen male animals mounting other males, smelling each others rectums, or licking each others genital area. They will exclaim, “See? It's obvious: homosexuality is natural.” First, one must remember animals such as dogs also mount sofas, trees, and even your the leg. This is not homosexual behavior but this is auto-eroticism. Second, the only way one could show this behavior was homosexual is if one could demonstrate that the animal was desiring the male gender of the animal he was mounting. One can't conclude from the observed activity alone that any animal has homosexual desires. This is just another example of a hasty judgment. Third, animals either in playful antics, stressful conditions such as captivity, or in dominance behavior to assert hierarchy engage in perceived homosexual behavior. Male animals mount other males in a a very powerful way to communicate a higher position in the "pecking order". Fourth, every time you bring a female which is in heat into a situation, suddenly the male-male behavior is abandoned in favor of the female. Edited to add: Animals sometimes kill their young, roll in or eat excrement, have intercourse with numerous partners, and some engage in cannibalism. Man knows right from wrong and is not on the same level with the animal kingdom. If there were genuinely homosexual lions prowling the Serengheti or homosexual mountain gorillas gorging on bamboo, you can be sure we would have seen them in action on public television.

I agree with you, I don't consider homosexuality to be natural. I also couldn't care less, the point is totally irrelevant. Very little of what we do is 'natural', our laws are certainly not based on the 'natural' extent of something, they are based on fairness and equality. As you rightly point out nature can be seen to do many things that are abhorrent to us. So the argument that homosexuality is wrong because it is 'unnatural' is totally daft.

And one cannot conclude that from the observed activity that any animal doesn't have homosexual desires. Essentially your argument is: We don't know, therefore I am right. That doesn't win arguments. "Just because this happens, doesn't mean this." That's all your argument is. While it does actually have facts, something i'm not used to seeing in the past 2 weeks after being on Whistlestopper, it still resides on "this occurs, so therefore you might be wrong, therefore I am right." Sorry, doesn't work that way. Besides, real animal pyschology is still a relatively new field. On the topic of natural: Many things today aren't natural. Man was not suppose to fly. Man was not suppose to wear corrective lenses. Man was not suppose to live in towers hundreds of feet high. Man was not suppose to drive at 200 mph. All of that is unnatural. Yet all of it is supported, and even cheered by humans. Cessarian sections aren't natural, yet it is a common and accepted practice. Jumping out of planes for a HALO jump isn't natural, yet it's a key military inseration tactic. Man was not suppose to live 500 feet below the ocean. Man was not suppose to live in the artic. Man was not suppose to spend months at sea. Man was not designed to live in Space. Heck, I can do this for days. Much of what we do today that is accepted is not natural. To say that banning homosexuality because it is "unnatural" is hypocritical if you support the thousands of actions we do everyday that are unnatural.BTW: Thanks for ignoring the theories regarding homosexuality as a propagater of the species, as well as the legal measures, it's always nice to see they can't respond.

Firstly, you cannot prove to me your assumption that God exists, therefore you cannot convince me you know what your God wants. You say you know God exists because the Bible tells you so, and the Bible was written by God. This is a cirucular fallacy of course, and is an attempt to avoid the unanswered and most important, question, does God exist? Without first proving that first question of God's existence, you don't know anymore about God in terms of what God wants, how and if God judges, God's sex, God's sexual orientation, how what and if God writes, etc.If there were a natural law against homosexuality, humans would not be able to violate that law, nor would that law have to be enforced by humans.You argument for propagation of the species, through natural reproduction, I suppose, doesn't take into account a few things:Kin Selection: An animal doesn't reproduce directly itself, however may act as a helper and promoter of its family, by defending and hunting for its family, and reducing violent competition for females. Very little of sex that takes place leads to reproduction. If that is it's function, it is quite inefficient. Sexuality seems to have evolved to become inefficient, if reproduction is its only function. Even though my heterosexual partents had one child, I know each of them will have sex much more than one time in each of their lives. This ineffciency makes sexuality different from other evolved traits, or perhaps sexuality has other functions besides reproduction. What do we do with childless heterosexual couples, take away their marriage licences?

I've study history and I don't write comments and negative statements without full studying it. Most importantly, I don't repeat what others believe in, without doing my own research.

Only bigots and prejudice people believe that homosexuality is immoral. We are dealing with man made prejudice and not biblical prejudice. People who make bigoted statements have not really fully studied history and the bible.

folks, homosexuality being unnatuaral is a man man myth. people who make such statements have not literally studied the bible(only homosexuals in pagan practices). They are just being feed back by others who are prejudice bigots.

Very convincing. :p :p :p emoticonXClown emoticonXClownWaxy

But see that's my point! Everybody thinks it's wrong because it's in a book called the Bible. But like I said you really can't go by everything in the bible because it wasn't written by God. Maybe God didn't have a problem with it but the person that was writting the bible did have a problem with 2 women or 2 men so they wrote that it was wrong??

Homosexual marriage will always be an abomination to God. When God calls something unholy, man cannot make it holy or bless it. Granting same-sex couples a license to marry will not create true marriage. Neither two men nor two women can become one flesh. Licensing the unnatural does not make it natural. It would be a state-sanctioned counterfeit, a sham and a fraud. Homosexual sex is dangerous and destructive to the human body and powerless for human reproduction.

Or other religious texts. But who ever said religion was correct? After all, religion has placed in the path of man obstacle after obstacle. It has placed the greatest minds in isolation, shamed them, and stopped all access to their works, only to find in the future they were correct. Religion is a dangerous tool that must be constantly watched. The Catholic church spreads lies about condoms and safe sex. Religion cannot be fully trusted. Hmmmm. The bible, written by man, and man is erronous, therefore the bible is probably errounous. Imperfection creates imperfection.
