The ugly reality of life in America today regarding the secular humanist Left is that they support free speech as long as you agree with them. If you disagree with them, you are branded as a religious zealot who's determined to take their rights away. What they don't want you to ever realize is that it is they who are tearing at the traditions and customs that America was built upon and gained us the respect of the World at large. And it is their corruption of the morals and values America once represented that is the cause of so much hatred and disrespect from the rest of the World today.So thanks to the liberal immoral left, we are seen as the moral evil of the World. Not because of the Religious Right as the Left would have you believe.

Now we're working toward death with dignity for the terminally ill, reasonable gun control, access to abortion and contraception (without sparking the ire of fundy parents and community members)... are these things that are despised by the rest of the world? No, but things like slavery, sexism, rampant crime, and politicization of private issues are.The main cause of so much hate and disrespect is the phony war we're fighting and our tactics in violation of international law, our attitude of superiority in the world, and our outright bullying of others, all of which are being pushed the most by -- you guessed it -- not liberals.No, Archie, you and your boys can take the blame for that one.Archie's projection complex strikes again!Pretty much, we can take whatever Archie says and know that the truth is the precise opposite.

Talk about a crock! How can you wail on anyone with your imaginary truth stick of no mercy when you wouldn't know the truth if you tripped over it? And you going ballistic like this just proves the exact point I made in that you'll allow my free speech until I say something you disagree with and then you attack me to shut me up. Which is exactly what I said above that precipitated your childish tirade. See?The problem you are left with lyteboy, is that I didn't try to do that at all. See?So try actually responding to the points I'm making rather than just making up stuff to attack me over.WOW, and you claim to be a teacher? No matter our kids have the lowest scores in the World. Didn't you know that it was the democratic south that started the civil war to fight against the abolition of slavery? And didn't you know that it was the democratic party that fought hardest against the 1964 civil rights act? Until Johnson finally submitted a watered down bill compared to the Republican bill due to political and public pressure? Wrong again sherlock. All of this animosity is after the fact to why radical islam considers our christian Nation to be hypocritical due to the exporting of our pop culture of hedonistic sexual and moral depravity. That was why they signed fatwas against us originally. It is the abortions, gay marriage and our women walking around half naked that caused that lack of respect to occur. And you can thank the immoral left for that contribution to Americas image. It was the Left that coined the phrase, "If it feels good, do it," Not the Right.Sure you do emoticonXDonno . Because like any reprobate, what is wrong, is right to you; and what is right, is wrong to you. So of course you consider anything i believe to be wrong. emoticonXDonno But just so my original statement isn't lost to your attack, here it is again so it can be clearly interpreted without your tainted condemnation.

Yes, panic attacks are sparking many very long winded rants. I can see why some reviews have called it "important" and "powerful". It was very good, not a comedy as some may attempt to describe it. It had a little of Ben Stein's mysteriousness and humor to it, but it was generally serious, and some may say, depressing. It was nice to see the people whose writings I had seen on the net, but had never seen speak before or even a picture of - Myers, Ruse, Berlinski, etc. I'll address the six points from your first link, that's all I have time for tonight. 1) Nitpicking. The movie wasn't attempting to link euginics and the holocaust to Darwin himself nearly as much as it was showing its relationship with Darwinism in general. I don't think linking Darwinism and societal atrocities are an unprovoked first assertion. It's a response to atheists/evolutionists who constantly link religion with societal atrocities. 2) Informed viewers of Expelled might NOT think Stein was giving speeches on college campuses, if they had any knowledge of "speech codes" and other games played in todays universities to keep conservatives out. When I saw that scene, I sure didn't think it was a college campus. I didn't give much thought to where it was, but it was no crime to stage it. It is a movie, after all. 3) Crying that they didn't know what they were being interviewed for? If they'd have known, would they have refused to participate, or lied about something? 4) Yes, there are all kinds of long winded rants about all the details of how the ID proponents were being treated perfectly fair. It's up to anyone who actually watched the movie to decide if these people just weren't intelligent enough to make the grade, while ALL the Ward Churchill's of the academic world seldom seem to have any problems. 5) HELLO!! THAT'S WHY!! Then we see the standard dance of how innocent and objective science really is. 6) And the standard "theistic evolution" dance. Atheistic evolutionists can't get along without it! I wonder if Kenneth Miller will see the movie, and comment on it. I wonder if he'd have refused to be a part of it.

WHAT?!Did they edit the part out from the pre-screening version where Berlinski literally says that Darwinism was a necessary condition for the Holocaust? That means that were it not for Darwin, the Holocaust would not have happened.That's not just Berlinski talking, either. Ben Stein thought this was serious enough to warrant a visit to Dachau. Mark Mathis thought it was such a brilliant way of putting things that he told us during the pre-screening Q&A that he agreed with it. An entire third of the movie is devoted to "relating" Darwin to the Holocaust and eugenics. Meanwhile, the film is spliced from beginning to end with black and white footage of Soviet and German oppression. Nitpicking. Yeah. Whatever, Marc.

Even if we assume that accusations of religion's negative influence are misplaced, two wrongs don't make a right. Either Darwinism and social atrocities are related, or they are not. Frankly whether they are has nothing to do with whether evolutionary theory is true or whether science expels dissenting opinion. The topic is completely tangential to the alleged point of the movie, which is because the movie is pure propaganda intended to dupe people like marc into thinking that these issues are topical.The classic example is: gravity makes countless people fall to their deaths every year. This isn't an example of one Holocaust-like instance of mass death; no, this is continual, yet nobody has made a fuss about it in the scientific community. This is because scientists are evil and out to destroy dissenters by letting gravity do the dirty work.

You sure as hell weren't until you came back and read a link that you wouldn't have read on your own.2) Presenting the scenario as if Stein were addressing an actual audience when the "audience" is composed of virtually nothing but stand-ins is dishonest no matter which way you slice it. To say that it's okay to be misleading because it's a movie just backs up the point that we've been making all along. These people aren't interested in presenting truth; it's all about propagandism.Some of them know (from experience, because many nutjob anti-evolutionists are positively dishonest -- like Mathis & Co.) that statements have to be phrased carefully for at least one of (at least) two reasons: First, these people know a sh*tload less about the technicalities than the interviewers do; second, words may be chosen more carefully to try to prevent snippets being used out of context. You can see both in this instance, with the explanation of one postulation involving crystals and Dawkins referring to the ultimate Darwinian development of any theoretical panspermia initiators (which got cut off to be spun into a ridiculous quote mine).Notice that nowhere here do you address the claims and evidence -- which the movie apparently lacks -- about the assertions of "the expelled." Trying to deflect attention from your inability to respond substantively won't fly with us; these guys are fudging the stories and sharing only selected pieces in a specific attempt to hide what really happened.For what it's worth, I feel a hell of a lot more vulnerable as an atheist in my profession and location than IDers should feel in research and teaching academia.HOLY SH*T, marc.

Um, for some reason, I keep thinking the OP is actually a bot. One word answers, usually not showing much of a connection to the topic, hardly legible...Or maybe it's just me.Anyway, there's quite enough freedom of speech going on around. The problem is people will often hide the true reasons they lost their jobs. Like a "Santa" actor, who claimed that he was fired because the "Ho ho ho" was insulting to women, while in truth, he disregarded a series of rules about how to behave while being Santa (the booming laugh was found to sometimes scare the children, so it was to be avoided and similar).With religion, it's similar. Believing in ID is one thing. But then ignoring things that are vital to the job because they conflict with ID is a different thing. Imagine taking your pet to a vet and finding out that the doctor didn't believe in the bacterial theory of infection and instead started performing an exorcism ritual on it...

Well no, it takes longer than just a "few minutes" to read Dawkins rant alone (that you linked) about the movie. When that's combined with all the other links you and your helpers posted, plus all the further rabbit trail links associated with them, all the reading could take longer than an hour and a half, even for a very fast reader. It's not a black and white issue, it's a worldview thing. Even the most highly intelligent random mutations and mindless natural selection winners like you and Dawkins aren't allowed to make that determination for all of us more unlucky monkey decendents. Neither was Hitler. If you won't watch the movie, there's not much to discuss with you. You seem to know about as much about it as you know about what paper Collin signed. One thing you constantly make clear, you make a lot of guesses, and make them look very positive. These kind of childish, sarcasitic examples that are put fourth by those who claim to be in education are a big help in calling attention to this political problem. Just have to fight fire with fire. After all, evolution is a slippery word. Atheists are constantly telling us that Catholics are in full agreement with them about evolution. It's not really all that complicated. They simply wouldn't have spoken their minds about the harm they believe religion does, and how strongly they feel about combating it. That's what it appears they were angry about. That's the lovely thing about truth, sometimes it just slips out all by itself! I didn't take an audio recorder, and record every word spoken by the people who were victims of discrimination. What they said was convincing. But you'll never watch it, so you'll never know. Don't worry, you have the ACLU on your side. No, because Dawkins, Provine, Myers, and others say it in the movie. emoticonXIdea Not as disconnected as one has to be to sputter with rage, use four letter words, and make assertions about a movie that they have no intention of seeing. But you never DO it. Whenever the heat is on just a little bit, theistic evolution is introduced by atheists. To do with any kind of detail, it would have required the movie to be 3 or more hours long. Theistic evolution wasn't the subject of the movie. Evolution in academia was. Only to atheists, not to anyone with much of a knowledge of Christianity, or to anyone who has actually read his book. I'm waiting for you to link me to his comments on the movie, just like I'm waiting for you to get your book back so you can give me the page numbers of where he refers to his Catholic beliefs. You're a legend in your own mind.

Therefore, religious people are justified in trying to convince the pubplic that Hitler would not have succeeded without Darwin. I see.This does not make Darwinism a necessary condition for the Holocaust. It's hardly nitpicking to point out such a blatant and dishonest leap of logic.

Did you see the part where Hitler declared that he was a christian doing his christian duty? So I guess we can conclude that christianity was a necessary condition for the Holocaust.

But the discussion isn't about the ideas of the Enlightenment. The equality of all men was an idea that was adopted by the Founding Fathers of this society, contrary to the teachings of the christian churches.

sorry but all are created equal, but this society says otherwise.:(

But the discussion isn't about the ideas of the Enlightenment. The equality of all men was an idea that was adopted by the Founding Fathers of this society, contrary to the teachings of the christian churches. It is a political idea, not a religious or spiritual one, that all men have equal rights before the law. That has never been a teaching of either christianity or biology.

No one in the film says science is "atheist," "atheistic" or anything of the sort. Both Dawkins and Myers said science influenced their positions as atheists and that many scientists are atheists.That's it.

ID proposes that Goddidit. That's not a scientific endpoint as it says there is no quantifiable answer... Science is areligious/agnostic, in that it seeks no supernatural answer and has no stance on the existance of God. If you conflate the meanings of areligious/agnostic and atheistic then your mistake is understandable, but still wrong...

But it does propose a designer, outside the normal and natural actions of the laws of nature and physics (plus the documentation from the people who came up with it says Goddidit). This is not something that science can investigate, and therefore is not a scientific enquiry....Lots of people have used religion to shore up thier belief in thier cultural superiority and to justify wars. Does that mean that all religion is a racist belligerant clique? Just because many atheists are scientists doesn't mean that science is atheistic....Don't you see the problem with what you say here? If you are looking for design you have to postulate a designer, or your research is pointless.

Actually, that's a categorical syllogism. Your argument is valid just the same, but modus ponens has one premise stating a conditional relationship between X and Y and one premise affirming the antecedent of that relationship, which allows the affirmation of the consequent in the conclusion.

Sure, and here's a rebuttal to your talk origins piece. http://creationwiki.org/Polonium_hal..._a_young_earth1. Polonium forms from the alpha decay of radon, which is one of the decay products of uranium. Since radon is a gas, it can migrate through small cracks in the minerals. The fact that Po-haloes are found only associated with uranium (the parent mineral for producing radon) supports this conclusion, as does the fact that such haloes are commonly found along cracks.The fact that all three forms of Polonium are part of the uranium decay chain and that the haloes are only found in association with uranium has caused some creationists to question Gentry's conclusion. However only 210Po haloes are found along such cracks. 210Po has longest half life (138 days) of the Po isotopes involved in these haloes.Reference: Polonium Radiohalos: Still "A Very Tiny Mystery" by Andrew Snelling, ICR Impact #326. Aug 1, 20002. The biotite in which Gentry obtained some of his samples (Fission Mine and Silver Crater locations) was not from granite, but from a calcite dike. The biotite formed metamorphically as minerals in the walls of the dike migrated into the calcite. Biotite from the Faraday Mine came from a granite pegmatite which intruded a paragneiss which formed from highly metamorphosed sediments. Thus all of the locations Gentry examined show evidence of an extensive history predating the formation of the micas; they show an appearance of age older than the three minutes his polonium halo theory allows. It is possible God created this appearance of age, but that reduces Gentry's argument to the omphalos argument, for which evidence is irrelevant.While Talk Origins may have a point here, it needs to be noted the alleged evidence for extensive history assumes uniformitarian geology. Because of this fact, this response adds up to: Your theory doesn't work under my theory, so your theory is wrong.If you can show how literally billions of people today live their lives according to the principles in those books, then you'll have a valid point. Until then your argument is totally fallacious and off topic because those are poems and stories, but in no way considered sacred texts.

Preservatives have nothing to do with the fossilization process. Preservatives are chemical compounds created to preserve meat or they are chemical compounds used to preserve material. Fossils are frequently treated with epoxy, which is a resin (sp?) not a preservative...Please don't try the 'fossils aren't old' argument. You will get fried, and I'm too tired to argue with another fundie. The data is out there, if you deign to read it...

Well, you're posting replies, but you're not responding at all to anything I say. Why not?

Maybe you're naive enough to believe that soft tissue will survive 70 million years under the environmental and geological pressures they must go through in that incredible period of time, but I'm not. I believe a discovery like this one irrefutably proves that the dating methods of these fossils are terribly flawed and unreliable. I don't believe any bones could ever survive 70 million years under the best of circumstances and the best evidence of this is mans attempts at preserving bodies over the past 5000 years and the fragile state of mummies that were placed in shielded sarcophagi. Just take a preserved mummy and drop it in a hole and tell me how it will fare after getting ground up through 70 million years of Earth upheavals, floods, and environmental and ecological changes. http://news.nationalgeographic.com/n...ofttissue.htmlNow consider this theory as explained in this video and see how, if true, it would affect the theories you base your World view on.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjgidAICoQI

Point 1: I thought you were a YEC? If you contenance the idea of 70 million years you might not be as daft as I thought....Point 2: The point is that it is not the original soft tissues that survive. They are always replaced my minerals which are much better at resisting geological stress.Point 3: Argument from personal incredulity. Just because your mind is limited, stop imposing it on the rest of us....I've met Mary Schwietzer (sp?), and she was quick to point out that there was not original material preserved, but that the fossil had undergone a unique taphonomy (the process from death to excavation). The prepared fossil specimen was flexible, but actual cellular material was not present. The paper is open access here. Again you present your faith as fact. Present a serious argument if you will.They don't.... Check out replacement and diagenesisSo you're ignoring the peat bog mummies from Ireland? Also you're comparing situations that are nothing alike. Mummies (I'm guessing you only refer here to Egypt) were prepared and treated prior to being entombed. Natural processes involve no treatment at all.It'll probably be destroyed. However take 20 million bodies and put them all in an area where decay is limited, and then see what survives. The fact that bodies decay is self evident, given that we're not walking on corpses. But mineral replacement occurs, and has been replicated.I did consider that, and then fell off my chair laughing. The guy is a nutter who seems to be conviced for no evident reason that subduction does not occur. Never mind the fact that it fits observed data, or that a changing size of planet would result in gradually increasing force of gravity, playing havoc with observed natural processes....

I am a YECer, so don't change your superior opinion of me just yet. I don't want anyone thinking that you and I think alike at all. I offer the 70 million year age based on the claims of the article I posted only, not on my beliefs at all.This is only partially true based on your link, and completely irrelevant since Some regions of the demineralized bone matrix are highly fibrous, and the matrix possesses elasticity and resilience. If the soft tissue was replaced by minerals as you imply, then the possibility of retrieving DNA wouldn't exist, nor would the matrix be elastic and resilient. Soft-Tissue Vessels and Cellular Preservation in Tyrannosaurus rexMary H. Schweitzer,1,2,3* Jennifer L. Wittmeyer,1 John R. Horner,3 Jan K. Toporski4Soft tissues are preserved within hindlimb elements of Tyrannosaurus rex (Museum of the Rockies specimen 1125). Removal of the mineral phase reveals transparent, flexible, hollow blood vessels containing small round microstructures that can be expressed from the vessels into solution. Some regions of the demineralized bone matrix are highly fibrous, and the matrix possesses elasticity and resilience. Three populations of microstructures have cell-like morphology. Thus, some dinosaurian soft tissues may retain some of their original flexibility, elasticity, and resilience.It's more than personal incredulity Gazza, it's common sense also, but why would I expect you to get that? Lay a piece of steel, or a thousand pieces of steel in any part of the world, and in 70 million years nothing will remain of it. If steel wont make it, neither will bone, much less soft tissue. I don't care how many scientists make a ridiculous claim, that doesn't make their claim anymore rational. Your problem, like all pseudo intellectuals is that you believe this stuff just because someone you think is intelligent tells you that it's right or true. You don't have the common sense or discernment to see through the smoke and mirrors to understand that those scientists don't know any more than you do in reality.Of course you did. Because anything that doesn't fit with your world view is rejected out of hand. And yet you accuse me of being close minded. And he did offer evidence for his claims, next time turn the volume up and listen to it. And I realize none of this is definitively provable, but neither is the cr*p you spew. The bottom line is though, when all is said and done in life regarding these questions, I will most definitely be proven right and you will find that your faith in science and intellectualism was seriously misplaced.

Actually, there is no possibility to retrieve any DNA since none exists in any of the samples. They did recover several short peptides, each only a few amino acids long. Everything else was replaced by minerals.Learn, then speak.

I stand by my statement. It is you who is nitpicking considering we are discussing 68-70 million year old bones ALLEGEDLY. They extracted viable and testable material otherwise this wouldn't have been a story of interest to anyone at all.  In a related study, a team led by Mary Higby Schweitzer of North Carolina State University conducted tests that also revealed the presence of collagen in the T. rex remains.In one experiment, antibodies that normally react in the presence of chicken collagen reacted strongly to the dinosaur protein, suggesting a similar molecular identity.For the protein sequencing study, Asara's team isolated seven fragmentary chains of amino acids—the building blocks of proteins—from the T. rex specimen.http://news.nationalgeographic.com/n...o-tissues.htmlSo pandion, learn, then speak.And by the way, i'm not the only sceptic regarding this discovery. Evolutionary anthropologists agree that for such material to last more than a million years is incredible to say the least. One self-proclaimed skeptic is Christina Nielsen-Marsh, an expert on ancient bone proteins at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany."I would love it to be true," she said of the new T. rex findings. "But I do have serious doubts. I know of no other research group that has been able to extract—let alone sequence—indigenous proteins from fossils older than a million years."Based on what we presently understand, these T. rex sequences make no sense at all," Nielsen-Marsh said."That doesn't mean they are wrong. But if they are right, then we all need to rethink how molecules survive in the geological environment."Schweitzer and her collaborators, including paleontologist John Horner of Montana State University, agree that their discovery should prompt such a rethinking, which could lead to changes in how fieldwork is conducted.Regarding the bolded above, What amazes me about such seemingly intelligent people is that they will rethink how molecules survive in the geological environment rather than consider that their dating techniques are irreparably flawed and the T-Rex isn't anywhere near 70 million years old. That is the only rational explanation for this evidence.

What amazes me-- no, nothing amazes me about you, Archie. What's not amazing to me at all is that you expect scientists to look at one interesting occurrence and -- instead of analyzing what we've thought to be true -- throw out all of the data we have that confirms radiometric dating's accuracy and geologic time scales. This is like punching "2+2=" into a calculator and getting "4" ten thousand times, then getting a "0" once due to a strange anomaly and declaring that we have sufficient reason to disbelieve that four is the correct answer.

Oh believe me, the word superior does not apply to my thinking about you...GoodSo you have an avenue of escape as your argument collapses?Read the paper... They clearly stated that some material was present that displayed elasticity and flexibility. They did not claim the material was original. They stated that after preperation of the specimen (demineralization) some fibrous material was present. As pandion pointed out they only recovered a few protien fragments. There is no dino DNA (much as I wish there were). I admit the flexible nature of this fibrous material is completely novel, and suggests that there are elements of the taphonomic process we don't yet understand. However, doesn't the fact that they had to demineralize the material tell you something?????Maybe it's because your brand of common sense isn't?Prove it...Organic tissues are far more complex than steel. Plus they are frequently more resistant to damage. Steel is more brittle than bone...Apart from this tiny thing called evidence....Well I guess you've got a problem there in the fact that I am one of those scientists.... I've got a degree in palaeontology, and I currently work on experimental taphonomy, attempting to replicate the decay process... Believe me, organic material lasts....Don't make me do the projection thing again....I did. He is working from the position that there is no subduction, a starting point unsupported by evidence. He also states that there are no fossil deposits from the deep sea. Check out the Burgess Shale for starters. He claims that the expansion model is required to account for the continents fitting against each other. For a start they don't fit perfectly, and secondly we can see erosion and tectonic movement today. Why do we need this new model? Oh the ocean that he didn't believe existed (the 'huge pacific area') was called Tethys, and encircled the entire planet (The remenants are in Tunisa amongst other places). It was at least the second sea to do so (4.x billion years is a long long time)...Yawn. I can take you through the science of preservation, but after 2 and a half years, I have only scratched the surface, and you're not interested in facts, so why bother. If you have a specific question, I'll happily answer it.You know, I think you get so worked up because right at the core of your soul there's a little voice that wonders if you're wrong. You probably think it's the devil, and that's tragic. In response to your (rather predictable) threat of hell-fire, I'll merely say that if God judges you on whether you belong to his club or not, then that's kind of a sad judgement on creation...It amazes me how you manage to jump to the wrong conclusion so often. Given all the supporting data for an old earth doesn't it seem more logical that we don't yet understand the process, rather than all the other data is wrong based on this one off?

By all means, post this overwhelming evidence to the contrary that my God exists. I challenge you to produce it right now. And then in your infinite wisdom, explain how genetic material can survive an alleged 70 million years. You then must explain how that bone lasted 70 million years without the complete fossilization process being completed in it? That's the only way any genetic material could survive you know, if the bone was never completely fossilized. I quote from my link above:So can you explain that genius? 70 million years under ground without being fossilized? And remember that my source is Nat Geo, not some creationist site that you would just dismiss as ignorant christian rants.

No collin, both sites are dedicated to their respective missions. For every article you post from TO, AIG has an answer for and vice versa, so the two sites cancel each other out. Child posts that cr*p so confidently as if he's actually contributing something to the debate, and TO is absolutely flawlessly right without question. And I obviously reject that rationale out of hand.For example, explain this contradiction between two allegedly reliable and consistent sources of info regarding the same issue. Here And yet your ultra scientific TO said this about the same T Rex case.So why such inconsistency regarding the type of foul? Can't they get any more accurate than that? After all, the genetic material they're comparing the T-Rex results to are contemporary and known to us. So why do two scientific sources contradict each other based on the same science and scientific results? Where's the lack of communication within the community? I mean, if Schweitzer et al is putting out chicken proteins, why is TO getting Ostrich results from that?

But for you to scream at me in your usual condescending fashion as if your high school teaching job makes you a superior intellect, and insist that the evidence for evo is overwhelmingly in your favor simply proves how deluded you are.After all, I didn't just post my opinion, but the opinion of an evolutionary anthropologist who also believes it impossible by a factor of 70. I repeat for your edification:

FFS.1: There is no genetic material. Amino acids are not genes. There is no DNA or RNA2: The comment about ostrich eggs is about the structure of capillaries seen in the fossil. Schweitzer et. al. are commenting on the convergent structures3: The comment about chickens is about reacting co-factors during an amino acid test. Basically, it means that this tissue uses the same building blocks as a chicken. Not suprising, given that birds are dinosaurs, but it is a nice piece of supporting evidence.4: Two scientists contradict each other based on the same evidence because each have a different approach to the problem allowing multiple perspectives. It's how science works. You seem to want to have your cake and eat it. On one hand you claim that science is a united front out to destroy God, and on the other you seek to dismiss science on the basis that people within it disagree. Choose. You sound daft claiming both....

No collin, both sites are dedicated to their respective missions. For every article you post from TO, AIG has an answer for and vice versa, so the two sites cancel each other out. Child posts that cr*p so confidently as if he's actually contributing something to the debate, and TO is absolutely flawlessly right without question. And I obviously reject that rationale out of hand.For example, explain this contradiction between two allegedly reliable and consistent sources of info regarding the same issue. Here And yet your ultra scientific TO said this about the same T Rex case.So why such inconsistency regarding the type of foul? Can't they get any more accurate than that? After all, the genetic material they're comparing the T-Rex results to are contemporary and known to us. So why do two scientific sources contradict each other based on the same science and scientific results? Where's the lack of communication within the community? I mean, if Schweitzer et al is putting out chicken proteins, why is TO getting Ostrich results from that?

Ffs, dinosaur blood? Again? Why is this brought up by you whack jobs every 6-8 months? It's been adressed and explained countless times.

With pleasure. After you demonstrate where in my post I suggested that there was such evidence.

By all means, post this overwhelming evidence to the contrary that my God exists. I challenge you to produce it right now. And then in your infinite wisdom, explain how genetic material can survive an alleged 70 million years. You then must explain how that bone lasted 70 million years without the complete fossilization process being completed in it? That's the only way any genetic material could survive you know, if the bone was never completely fossilized. I quote from my link above:So can you explain that genius? 70 million years under ground without being fossilized? And remember that my source is Nat Geo, not some creationist site that you would just dismiss as ignorant christian rants.

Robert A. Heinlein."Men rarely (if ever) manage to dream up a god superior to themselves. Most gods have the manners and morals of a spoiled child." Some folks are living examples of their belief system. I rest my case.

I presume that you are talking about birds and not baseball or some other sporting event. That's why I had such a good laugh at another example of creationist semi-literacy. If you mean baseball, then I don't understand. If you mean birds then that should be fowl. Not a typo since the keys aren't even close.

PROJECTION, again.... I'm amazed you can't recognise the amount you do it....The original paper is here. Dr. Schweitzer uses an ostrich egg to compare the structure and layout of the vessels. The chicken comes in from a reacting factor that showed a reaction in the presence of the subfossil 'collagen' material. He hasn't changed it on this occasion, he's just not able to read context....Oh, by the way AA, are you planning on replying? Or do you cede that fossil discussion?

Whatever, people losing jobs for saying they beleive in intellegent design. Good?emoticonXGood Bad?emoticonXBanghead emoticonXConfused

Actually, the two scientists didn't contradict each other at all. One said that he got a reaction similar to that from chicken protien, the other said stuctures are similar to those seen in ostriches. These are both just observations of fact, and don't contradict in the least. They're both just saying that dinosaurs had traits in common with some modern birds; they're not saying that they were chickens or that they were ostriches. The only contradiction is between what they said and what Archie thinks they said.

Fair enough, I haven't read the TO page. I stand by my point that discussion of the evidence is the key to scientific advancement, and this inevitably produces disagreement.....

An entirely valid point, just not what happened here.Archie admits that he doesn't understand the stuff he links to, so you should by no means accept his interpretation as being remotely correct. His reading was probably along these lines:Author 1: T-rex bone blah-blah-blah chickenAuthor 2: T-rex bone blah-blah-blah ostrichAh-ha! One said chicken and the other said ostrich. Clearly they're in fundamental disagreement, even though I don't know what they were talking about, which proves I'm right about whatever...Of course, if I'm wrong about this it'll be trivial for Archie to prove it. All he has to do is describe, in his own words, what contradiction he was refering to. Of course if he just does the same cut and paste again that'll just support my point.
