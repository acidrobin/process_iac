Can some one explain why it is better to keep some one locked in a cage, than to kill them? I am asking about the criminals that get sentences of 100+ years. Is it more humane to kill those who have been determined to never be able to renter society, or to keep them in 80 square feet for, 23 hours a day, for the rest of there life?IMO, it would be better to put them to death.

Death penilty

I don't think either one of these is particularly humane. Given a choice, I personally would prefer to die rather than spend the rest of my life in prison. Of course, if it is wrong to kill people, then we shouldn't do it. If it is not wrong to kill people, then why are we making such a big deal of it?I think what we need is prson reform and reform of our legal system. People like murderers are difficult to deal with if you are not going to execute them under the current system becuase, as you pointed out, it is questionable whether death might not be preferable to spending life in a little cell.I think a workable solution might be more prison farms like the Angola prison. Prisoners there are not constantly locked in little cells, or even confined behind walls all the time. Life is not easy there, but it is arguably worth living as you can actually accomplish some things.

Sure. 1) It's cheaper to lock them up for life2) Death is a weak punishment3) Trial cost money, counties pay for trials. Counties cut social services to pay for these exorbiant trials. Guess who often counsules and stops people from going on violent crimes? So in essence, fewer victims with more life sentences (with the death penalty hanging around) A society is judged by how it treats its prisoners. However, those who are unable to be rehabiliated and shown this time and time again, should be removed from society. However, this should be a tiny minority due to the 3 reasons above.

If inmates in for life actually got life in 100% of the cases, I'd be more inclined to support a ban on capital punishment. But, the fact is that inmates can get out, either by escaping, legal technicality, etc., or can kill again while in prison. For that reason, I'm in favor of throwing the switch and giving them a juice sandwich. emoticonXGood

Once in prison the only technicality likely to get you out is "innocence". Most appeals fail.Escape from prison is rare but not a reason to execute as a precaution anyway. The potential of being killed while in prison sounds like deterrent to me.

In some states, death sentences have been commuted to life and then, later, the felon is eligible for parole.It depends on the prison, but one is one to many for me.If that was the case, then the death penalty would be a deterrent in itself, huh?

Death penalty commuted to life w/ possibility of parole? I've not heard of this but I supposed it could happen.I don't believe the DP constitutes deterrent for capital offenses. Being killed while in prison for GTA or some such was more the sort of thing I had in mind.

I would agree fully.what I am talking about is not a death penalty trial as we have today, but after the person has received a 100 year or more sentence. The cost would be only the method of death.if it was for punishment we would use the less humane one. More “pain” (discomfort, unpleasant situation, whatever term you prefer) the more likely some one will try to avoid it.I don’t under stand this one. I think you are saying that a “death penalty” trial costs too much? See comments for #1

Neither of them are humane? Is murdering 5 people and cutting them up humane? That is letting someone off way too easy. You took someone's life, and that is one of the worst things you can do. Letting them work out in a field and "accomplish some things" does no justice to the family of the victims. Someone who commits a crime that serious should at least be behind bars for the rest of their life, no parole at all. Maybe for lesser crimes (which warrant 15-30 years in prison), the Angola thing would work. But someone who has been found guilty of murder doesn't deserve the pleasure of actually working.

Oh that greatly changes the equation doesn't it? Very unrealistic, but for the sakes of the debate, why not?

It is the hard labor part here that I want to address. Under the current system, people mostly get put in prison and have nothing to do. they pretty much sit and rot. Go to the library, work in the laundry, etc... From a realistic standpoint, though, they do nothing productive. You take a place like the Farm (angola) and you end up with a prison that is self supporting (which lessens th e burden on the tax payer) and has fewer problems with inmate violence than many other prisons. I say YES, put these guys to work. Let their labor pay for their stay. Let them develop some on the job skills for when (or if) they ever get out. Paying for a guy to rot away in a cell fro his entier life is not doing any good for anybody.

In a case like this, we can assume that the alternative is life in prison. These are the two worst punishments we have at our disposal (death or life in prison). If you let somebody choose between the two worst punishments we have, or they request one of the two worst punishments we have, they are both still punishments.In countries in the ME where they still chop off peoples hands for stealing (and there are places they still do this), most places will give you an option as to which hand they cut off. By your logic, this would NOT be considered punishment, since they got to choose which hand.If I was to grab you in an alley and give you a chioce between being beaten to a pulp with either a chain or being cut up with a knife, regardless of which you chose, I would still be guilty of a crime regardless of the fact that you chose the manner in which I assaulted you.I think it could be proven that putting somebody in prison for life whent ehy have requested the death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment. Besides, what would be the point of keeping somebody in prison for life, when they want to die anyway? The point of putting them in prison is to seperate them from society so they cannot commit another crime. Is there really a point to keeping them in there until they rot besides petty revenge? There is a difference between punishment and revenge, and frankly, our law does not allow for revenge.

Murder often involves passion which clouds judgement. For cold blooded, calculated murders I would imagine the perp assumes he/she will not be caught. Additionally I believe the stats for recidivism of paroled murderers is actually one of if not the lowest rate for all felonies. Of course one repeat of murder would be far worse than a dozen thefts. Certainly the effect of execution on the individual criminal's career path is predictable. I don't believe execution has any significant effect on the overall fact that Americans kill each other at a rate far above other developed industrial nations.

It is not meant as a punishment, it should be used when the courts have decided that the person is too dangerous to allow back into society. The way I am thinking of it is after the sentence is passed down, there would be another trial (revue, whatever you want to call it.) to decide if there is a chance of the person ever being reformed. If not they would just put them down, like you would do for a rabid animal

Having them executed does not restore justice either. Restoring life to the murder victim would bring justice, nothing else will. Retribution or revenge is what you may mean, but not all victim's families find comfort in that. Some would prefer to see productive work is being accomplished.

I have had some experience with this topic...My father was murdered when I was 12, the perp was convicted a year later and was charged with 1st degree murder and sentenced to death..flash forward 24 yearsHe ran his course of appeals and every legal proceeding you can imagine. His lawyer after 20 years of him being on death row came up with "retardation"Mind you he "walked" 3 times.. all of which I was there to witness. I was to be a witness to the execution by request of my grandmother who has passed on. anyway at the last minute he got a stay of execution. Back to the drawing table.. Last year after several hearings, they came to the conclusion the he was mentally retarded..scoring a 75 on his IQ test. The limit for the death penalty is 70. He was a high school graduate, had a family, held jobs.. and clearly competent, nonetheless they found him otherwise. So now he is off death row, and the DA has told me that it is possible he could get parole eventually. With all that it has been a very trying time for me and I have had to struggle with how I really felt about the death penalty. I have been a supporter but never really could my put heart into my conviction. I do not know if it is out of revenge or not, hard to say I am too close to the matter. But I did feel let down when they took him off death row, now I feel like there will never be justice. I put so many years of waiting for that moment... it sounds kind of sick, but as much as I dreaded witnessing it, I also looked forward to it.I do think that maybe life in prison may be better, only if his experience there is just awful....but the revenge side of me, just wants him to suffer what my father suffered. but if you were to ask me to think about this the old fashion way, which would be I should be the one to flip the switch .. not so sure I could do it.so with all that I still don't really know if I in my heart, support the death penalty or I am just after revenge.The victims of violence I would imagine go through this struggle.Side note... the man who murdered my father also killed a young girl when he was a minor... he had escaped from the correctional facility he was in.. and it was several years later when he killed my dad.

So sorry, Anastasia...that's a horrible thing to face. And now, using that excuse? What!If justice was swift for the guilty then he would not have escaped only to do it again. Some criminals never change, and via your testimony, only live to do it again.There are some who need to be put to death.Your situation made me shudder, Anastasia. But, I am glad you didn't let it (revenge) effect you to the point of taking his life yourself.If it would have been my father, those many years ago, I cannot say that I would have waited, nor would have accepted that lame excuse of retardation.

What a good argument in favor of the death penalty. Here's a concrete example of a murderer escaping to commit yet another murder. My heart goes out for you, Anastasia. I was 13 when my father died of natural causes and that was difficult enough. To know that my father was murdered and his killer was still alive would be unbearable for me.

Yup, you failed english. As a means of termination, not as a deterrence. Look at the defintion. One who is dead cannot by influenced by motivation! Therefore the argument of death as a deterent is a joke. I already gave the definitions shamming your entire argument. You can ignore the english dictionary all you want, it doesn't make you right. You just admitted you lost. No it doesn't. Deter primarily means stopping by fear of the consequences, hence MAD. Death does neither. Simply because you fail to understand the very simplest of concepts does not make you right. You obviously don't understand the concept of a deterrence yet think you do. If you believe you understand, explain the concept of deterrence in the Cold War MAD strategy.

I have. And I have also given you alternate definitions which you conveniently dismissed. If there was only ONE definition of the word, then I might agree. But, there are more than one definition for the word and mine was perfectly acceptable.Deter "primarily" means stopping by fear? What are some of its alternate definitions? How about "prevent from occurring". Wouldn't death prevent another crime from being committed by the dead person? Your argument is silly. The only thing that being "shammed" is your credibility.I understand nuclear deterrence better than you, I'm sure. I was alive when we had Civil Defense drills in which we lined up in the school halls with the young kids against the wall and older kids over top of them in a shieling manner. That was back in the early 60's. Where were you then? Probably not even a twinkle in your dad's eye. ;)

Yup, you failed english. As a means of termination, not as a deterrence. Look at the defintion. One who is dead cannot by influenced by motivation! Therefore the argument of death as a deterent is a joke. I already gave the definitions shamming your entire argument. You can ignore the english dictionary all you want, it doesn't make you right. You just admitted you lost. No it doesn't. Deter primarily means stopping by fear of the consequences, hence MAD. Death does neither. Simply because you fail to understand the very simplest of concepts does not make you right. You obviously don't understand the concept of a deterrence yet think you do. If you believe you understand, explain the concept of deterrence in the Cold War MAD strategy.

Cant we all just get along?JPSartre12, the threat of the death penalty convinces few, if any criminals, to NOT commit the crime.Duo_Maxwell, there have been no cases of a criminal that has had the death penalty carred out committed a crime.Both uses of the word could be correct, depending on the context. Now, do you think killing some one that the courts have decided can never go back into society kinder than leaving them in a cage?

Many murders are crimes of passion. Fear of punishment doesn't come into play. And the fear of capital punishment can actually lead to worse crimes being committed by career criminals.That was my point. Dead men don't commit crimes. The recidivism rate drops to zero in those instances.I'm glad that you realized that. I write for a living; I don't appreciate some clown telling me that I flunked English 101. As for your question, I can't give you a blanket answer. I'd take each situation and evaluate it on its own merits. I don't believe that all murders, or murderers, are created equal. ;)

Very highly doubt. Deterrence means to prevent a action through the use of fear as a discourgement. Are you contesting this? But that does not mean it is a deterrent. We have used this form of punishment since the dawn of man, and the supreme court in Furman vs. Georgia has acknowledged there is not a single shred of evidence supporting or detracting that the punshiment is a deterrence.

I do not agree with your statement. However, on the definition of deterrent, I believe you are correct. The death penalty should not be catagorized as a deterrent.

Not in the slighest. You are saying it deters, by prevents people from commiting more crimes, and therefore acts as a deterrence. He disagrees with that definition, as the rest of the rational world does. In the intellectual world, deterrence means to prevent through fear, not prevent through any means necessary, which you presume it to mean. Fringe defintions are like fringe groups, not taken seriously. But you were still using the fringe defintion that no one else uses. His in more appropirate because he is keeping in tune with the normal, accepted, and more or less legal defintion of the word, while supporting the penalty for other reasons. I'm still waiting for you to explain MAD, that's if you can get over your age complex.

It may be close to what you said, but it doesn't change the definition of deterrent.If a person is deterred from commiting a crime it is because fear in that person's mind has prevented him from commiting the crime. Killing a person is not a deterrent. However, I think it is more effective than a deterrent...that person will NEVER commit another crime, whereas someone who has been deterred from crime one time may commit the crime later.

OK, I've only read the last 5 or 6 posts, but I'm going to stick my neck out on JP's behalf - I think that by deterrent, JP is referring not to the person being executed as being deterred, as it's obviously not a deterrent to him/her, but to everyone else that might be considering commiting a capital offense being deterred.IE - the death penalty acts as a deterrent to other would be murderers. The idea being that their fear of being executed will win out over their desire to murder someone.However, IMHO, that assertion is very arguable as well.Waxy

You don't believe that the death penalty is a deterrent for capital offenses? What is the recidivism rate for criminals executed under the death penalty......ZERO.

Say again, please.

The deterrent effect of any punishment would depend on the frequency of the punishment. If most criminals don't believe they will be put to death, they may not fear the consequences of their action. It would be interesting to test this theory by automatically executing every convicted murderer the day after their trials.

MAD, mutually assured destruction was the strategy used by the US and USSR to prevent a first strike attack from one on the other. In the US, we chose a 3-pronged strategy: land-based missiles, nuclear warhead equipped subs and strategic bombers in the air at all times. The theory being that we would be able to effectively wipe out the USSR even if one or two of our 3-prongs was eliminated by a first strike. The USSR, for the most part, took a similar tact but with a differing weapon mix. The key was that each side possessed enough nuclear power to wipe out each other many times over, even if part of their arsenal was neutralized by a first strike.Now, for some personal historical perspective. In the 1950's, my father was a Civil Defense Director for our county. He was responsible for assessing damage, calculating fallout patterns, defensive measures, etc., In fact, I still have in my possession his Geiger Counter and a CD film on the effects of the nuclear explosion on Hiroshimo. ( It's a 16mm documentary that is very scary. )MAD was the basis for at least a few old movies, namely Fail Safe and it's spoof "Dr. Strangelove- or how I learned to stop woorrying and love the bomb" as well as a few newer flicks like The Day After and Twilight's Last Gleaming, IIRC.Reagan's Star Wars program threatened the deterrent value of MAD, so he made a bold move and told the USSR that we should jointly develop SDI technology, thereby keeping the playing field level.

This really is getting silly, how much argument can there be over the use of one word?According to every dictionary I could find deter is explicitly meant to prevent from acting through fear, hence it's Latin root which it shares origins with the word 'terror'. Even if for some reason you choose to ignore the vastly accepted linguistic definition, there is even less ambiguity over the use of the word in the context of criminal punishment. Where it means to stop either the criminal or other potential criminals from offending by means of fear of retribution.Give it up man!

Agreed. You people are driving me nuts. Somebody concede the point. Deterrance=scaring somebody so they don't commit a particular act or group of acts.easy enough. You can't deter somebody once they are dead. The death penalty is not deterrance for the person executed. The death penalty is deterrance for the rest of society, both criminals, potential crimanals, and average citizens. It is the governments way of reminding you that if they find you objectionable enough, they CAN and WILL kill you.Personally, I think it has less to do with crime, even as a deterrent, than it does with reminding us all who is running the place and exactly how much power they have (that would be the governement, and they have LOTS of power, up to and including the power to kill you). I was discussing this the other day with my sister who is a psychologist. We disagree on almost every political issue there is since she is about as far left as you can get on pretty much every issue out there. We speak very rarely, and when we do we try to steer clear of politics. She does have an interesting argument when it comes to the death penalty, though, and I have to say I think it makes sense. I am anti-death penalty anyway, since I feel that either it is wrong to kill people, in which case we shouldn't do it, or it is OK to kill people, in which case we shouldn;t be making a fuss over it when people get murdered. I also don't think that the government should have the power to execute people. The governemnt gets its power from the people, and the people don't have the right to execute people (at the vaery least it is a gross violation of their civil rights), so it stands to reason that we cannot give the government power that we ourselves do not posess.Anyway, her argument is that the death penalty, form a purely psychological sense, does not make any sense. The vast majority of murders that are commited are not premeditated. They are carried out in a fit of rage, or fear (such as in the case of a thief shooting a police officer or citizen during a robbery). In this case, the death penalty has little or no value as a deterrent, since the emotional state of the person does not exactly lend itself to wholly rational thought. In many cases such as this, the act of murder is very nearly a reflex. This is not to say that people should not be punished in these cases, but it is highly unlikely that somebody who is in such a state of emotional distress that they are ready to kill somebody is likely to stop and consider the possible penalties rationally.In the case of premeditated murder, the death penalty makes even less sense as a deterent. In most cases, people who commit premeditated murder (and I am talking real, honest to god premeditated murder here, not the BS cases we have seen recently where prosecutors have claimed that if somebody has 30 seconds to think about it it was premeditated), the person plans the murder, and honestly believes they will not be caught. In this case, it is pretty unlikely that the potential for being executed is likely to have any real effect on the decisionmaking process (she has a very long explanation for why, but I don't have the time it would take to put it all down right now). Life in prison is, on its own, a pretty serious deterrent, and adding one level past that is pretty much worthless. A third class of murders are commited by guys like Bundy. These folks are mentally ill, are sometimes unable to stop killing, and no amount of deterrent is going to stop them. Fortunatly, there are very few of these folks running around (depending on whose estimates you want to look at, there are likely between 100 and 500 serial killers running around America at any given time).I would like to present a hypothesis as far as deterrents go. I think that once you get enough "deterrence" in place, it actually becomes a catalyst for violent crime. Lets not kid ourselves, we know what causes crime. Lack of education contributes enormously, as does a poor socioeconomic structure. Crimes are not generally commited by sociopaths, they are generally commited by people who are desperate. Personally, I can kind of understand this. It is easy to look at a guy who robs a bank or a convenience store and write him off as a "bad guy". I cannot gaurantee that I would not do the exact same thing if my back was against the wall, though. It is easy to sit there in your comfortable middle class home, with your 2 cars in the garge and your 2.5 kids playing in the yard and think of criminals as scumbags, but if you were in a situation where your family was hungry and you were facing the very real possibilty of being homeless wit your family, I don't think there is a man in America who would not commit a crime to take care of his family.Anyway, we have imposed these incredibly harsh penalties for people who commit crimes. I think that this makes people more likely to resort to violence in order to get away with commiting crimes. If you look at violent crime in America, it rose pretty steadily, and disporportionatly to other crime, then it began a fairly steady decline that IS porportionate to other crime. If you look at what was going on as far as out criminal justice system in those years where violent crime was skyrocketing, we were imposing harsher and harsher penalties. A lot of this violence came with the drug trade, which is still booming today. but without so much violence. While we tend to envision drug dealers as movie type millionairs, the vast majority of the drug dealers busted during that time period were small time nobodies who were hustling to make a buck. If you were a drug dealer, and were about to get busted, and you knew that meant going to prison for 10 years (mandatory sentencing being what it is/was), and you saw a way out, even if it did involve serious violence (i.e shooting your way out), would you do it? i think I wouldthink about what 10 years in prison means. When you get out, your life is, of course, ruined. You have no money, no real prospect of ever getting a decent job because you are a felon, and if you had a family, you are pretty much a stranger by then. There is a better than average chance that your wife has left you. you are basically penniless, and you have just burned 10 years of you life away.The decline in crime did not come with lengthier and more outrageous prison terms. It came with social programs that addressed the root causes of crime. This is one thing I really have to give the democrats credit for. I am generally not fond of liberal/democratic ideals as a whole, but they really did get some good programs passed that have helped address crime. You are always going to have those who are more or less criminals by nature, and you will never really be able to do anything about them. By helping those who are criminals by desperation, I think you can make a huge difference in the crime numebrs (and history seems to back this up). I think that if we want to decreas violent crime even further, we need to remove mandatory sentencing guidelines and put sentencing power back in the hands of the judges, where it belongs. I would personally rather combat crime than punish criminals. If a guy walks into court on a charge of theft, shows the judge that he stole a car because he can't find a job, and his family is starving, I would have no problem at all with the judge sentencing him to probation and a job development program. Unfortunatly, in my state, he would get a mandatory 3 years. Same guy gets out, has fewer prospects than he did before, and ends up commiting more crimes. We started imposing mandatory senteces because we anted to appear tough on crime. And crime went up. So we imposed tougher mandatory sentences, and crime went up some more. Are people really so stupid that they cannot see the connection here? Are we really such a shallow, vengeful society that we prefer to punish crimainals rather than stop crime?

This really is getting silly, how much argument can there be over the use of one word?According to every dictionary I could find deter is explicitly meant to prevent from acting through fear, hence it's Latin root which it shares origins with the word 'terror'. Even if for some reason you choose to ignore the vastly accepted linguistic definition, there is even less ambiguity over the use of the word in the context of criminal punishment. Where it means to stop either the criminal or other potential criminals from offending by means of fear of retribution.Give it up man!

As an example if I were to fall out of my office window, the laws of physics would prevent me from flying. However it would be incorrect to say they 'deter' me from flying, as no human choice is involved. Deterrence implies choice, if I am falling (or have been executed) I have no choice in events therefore am not deterred from them. However in the above example the laws of gravity do actually act as a deterrent, as I am careful not to place myself in a situation where I could fall out of the window, for fear of the consequences.Now from the linguistic definition, we move on to the legal definition.

Even the best of authors can misuse a word now and then.Synonyms are words that have the same or nearly the same meaning in some or all senses. They are not necessarily indentical or totally interchangeable. In this particular case (deterrence) there is not application to a dead man by the particular word. Some of the synonyms you mentioned could be applied, but not the word itself.A good thesaurus will list similar words also:deterrent: hindrance, impediment, obstacle, see restraint.It would be improper to say, "He has a speach deterrent" when one means to convey that "He has a speach impediment."

No I can't say I'm that suprised. I should have said has over had.This is the only reference of the death penalty being a 'specific deterrent'. And according to what some have said a dubious one at that. Every legal site I have looked at has most defiantly listed the death penalty as a general deterrence, specific deterrents being those which the criminal looks back upon and knowledge of them happening again dissuades them from committing again. I think Jim answers this point quite correctly.

Like Maxwell, you're missing the point. The content of the argument isn't what I was arguing; it was the grammatical use of the word deterrent as it applies to a dirt napper's ability to commit a future crime. I've agreed that most murders are crimes of passion so consequences of those actions don't enter into the thought process. And, while we're speaking about linguistics. What do you mean by "defiantly" in the above statement? You wrote"Now your argument is based around the fact that some dictionaries list deterrence to mean 'preventing' something. And indeed it does, for if you discourage something you are in effect preventing it. Yet this does not mean that the word is synonymous with 'prevent', as prevent encapsulates much more."Some dictionaries' definitions make no such distinction and do not imply that deter has to have an element of conscious thought associated with the act. Deter can simply mean prevent. Period. It's only when you slant the meaning with current conventional thought that it means more. Prior to MAD, there wasn't the concept of nuclear deterrence, for example. It is a modern construct.

A few comments on the death penalty, not to anyone in particular (didn't read all the posts :-) ):Seems to me that we all know the deterent effects of stiff punishment-get busted for speeding and get a warning, you are more likely to laugh it off and keep speeding..when you get busted and slammed with a $200 fine, that stays with you awhile. So, seems to me that when you make death a quick (as in timely) and certain punishment, there is most definitely a deterent effect. Now, the problem I REALLY have with the death penalty is the method. We all know that if we can choose our way of dying, we would all most certainly choose to die painlessly in our sleep. Well, death row inmates have it great in those terms, do they not? They get to be put to sleep..plain and simple..what a great way to go. Now, imagine if you knew you were gonna die bloody and painfully-kinda frightening, isn't it? Afterall, isn't that one of the big reasons we fear death? If I KNEW I would go painlessly, I wouldn't fear it as much, if at all.

Walk means to move by walking. emoticonXFrazzled Useless. But it doesn't. No court of law, nor any respectable lawyer will use the term as you are using. Deter means to prevent through motivation and fear, not through a gun shot wound to the head. Deter does mean to prevent, but it relies on the following that you have constantly ignored. You have resorted to idiotic essays, complete disrgard of history, and complete disregard of all accepted terms to uphold a single word in a defintion. What does speed mean?

A few comments on the death penalty, not to anyone in particular (didn't read all the posts :-) ):Seems to me that we all know the deterent effects of stiff punishment-get busted for speeding and get a warning, you are more likely to laugh it off and keep speeding..when you get busted and slammed with a $200 fine, that stays with you awhile. So, seems to me that when you make death a quick (as in timely) and certain punishment, there is most definitely a deterent effect. Now, the problem I REALLY have with the death penalty is the method. We all know that if we can choose our way of dying, we would all most certainly choose to die painlessly in our sleep. Well, death row inmates have it great in those terms, do they not? They get to be put to sleep..plain and simple..what a great way to go. Now, imagine if you knew you were gonna die bloody and painfully-kinda frightening, isn't it? Afterall, isn't that one of the big reasons we fear death? If I KNEW I would go painlessly, I wouldn't fear it as much, if at all.

Know what? Let's just drop the semantics. You are not willing to accept the defintion accepted by the courts, the people, and history itself. I am not willing to ignore parts of words to suit a argument. I talked the pizza? No, I don't support that form of arguing (and neither should you).Moving on. Should we support the current penalty?

I've seen plenty of words misused by all three of those entities, but I'll drop the semantics in favor of substance.Yes, we should support the death penalty. While it may not deter (oh no, there's that dreaded word again) others from committing capital crimes, it does provide a measure of justice/retribution to the victm's family, friends and society as a whole. If practiced as designed, it would also alleviate some of the fears of prisoner's escaping, life sentences being commuted 20 years later and some of the fiscal burden that we, as Americans, refuse to pay.Many Americans speak out against capital punishment, in favor of life sentences, and then vote against increased spending for prisons. This causes criminals who have committed lesser crimes to be given shorter sentences and gives them the opportunity to graduate to capital crimes.I also believe that the system is broken in many states, specifically IL, where courts have refused to allow DNA testing to make sure of a criminal's guilt/innocence. I'm in favor of removing doubt before executing anybody.

Simply because you fail to understand the word, fail to understand the history, fail to understand your absurdly large amount of fallacies, fail to understand the legal defintion, fail to understand how enforcement in the past has worked in the past, attacked another for his dictionary use while showing your own indept ability to use a dictionary, and that's just for starters. Your own character flaws do not make me a troll. Prevent is NEVER a all encompassing subsitute for deter. You weren't use the proper use of the word, you were using a single word in the defintion as the entire definition. I TALKED THE PIZZA! Does that make sense? Well, talk means to deliver by speech, so Yes, it does, if we use your logic. You should take a look at the fallacious arguments thread in the same forum as the bear defense one. You are using quite a few of them. Superior? That's questionable, and utterly arrogant as well. For one who uses a dictiontary that defines the word with the word, that's quite a arrogant and ignorant comment to say. You haven'r proved anything beyond your absolute love for fallacies and your completely contempt for history. If you noticed, I went paragraph by paragraph dissecting and pointing out all of the problems in your arguments. You have selectively read points. Another fallacy to fail to notice. No, I called you a blowhard because you listed all of your courses in a attempt to prove that you are smarter, and therefore right, another fallacy, what is that? Like the 15th time you've resorted to fallacies. Physics has nothing to do with proving a historical argument. I called you ignorant because you apparently know nothing about history (except mad) nor do you understand the economics of the penalty, nor do you understand how lower crime prevention stops major crimes. All of these you have ignored. See above. Considering you haven't proven anything, constantly selectively read, ignore everything you don't like, don't bother to research, constantly assert that age and "education" makes you right without any substance, have used a large number of fallacies, ignore the fact that I have used a phrase exactly like you did, your skills are severely lacking from my persepective. Ignore facts, ignoring points, ignoring history, restorting to fallacies, and ignoring everything you don't like, as well as fabricating argunents rarely wins a arguemnt past 3rd grade. Prove it. If you can. Considering how weak your arguemnts are (you remind me of "expert" creationist) you won't be able to prove that. Notice you can't rise to any challenge I give. You simply ignore them, along with everything else you don't like. Once again you resort to the knowledge of the ancients/youth fallacy. I will take you down in every argument. You have a fallacy lover as well as a fabricator. You have ignored so many facts. You have ignored so many points. You haven't proven anything or refuted anything. I think I'll go make a list of all the fallacies you have used.

Like Maxwell, you're missing the point. The content of the argument isn't what I was arguing; it was the grammatical use of the word deterrent as it applies to a dirt napper's ability to commit a future crime. I've agreed that most murders are crimes of passion so consequences of those actions don't enter into the thought process. And, while we're speaking about linguistics. What do you mean by "defiantly" in the above statement? You wrote"Now your argument is based around the fact that some dictionaries list deterrence to mean 'preventing' something. And indeed it does, for if you discourage something you are in effect preventing it. Yet this does not mean that the word is synonymous with 'prevent', as prevent encapsulates much more."Some dictionaries' definitions make no such distinction and do not imply that deter has to have an element of conscious thought associated with the act. Deter can simply mean prevent. Period. It's only when you slant the meaning with current conventional thought that it means more. Prior to MAD, there wasn't the concept of nuclear deterrence, for example. It is a modern construct.

Please explain this. Show me some figures on the cost of an execution and the cost of life imprisonment. Base it on a 21 year old criminal whose life expectancy is 50 more years.Also, please explain how the Supreme Court can logically back up a claim that capital punishment is not a deterrent to capital crime. Do they have figures on how many times people have decided not to commit a crime? Are they comparing statistics among states with and without the death penalty?(BTW, make sure your hands are clean before you tell someone else they need to wash theirs.)

What I was talking about was the use of the word by the rest of the world, the use of the word throughout history, and the use of the word in law, explain to me how those are the same as nitpicking on the use of "a" and "an." Apparently dispelling fallacies as well as giving legal definitions is snide to you. Not to mention a few other things I won't mention. Well considering how "well" you debated the point with ignoring history, ignoring the use of it in law, ignoring the accepted use, using fallacies, using distortions and lies, and upholding a single word and ignoring the rest (I talked the pizza!), it really doesn't matter. I didn't post that ridiculous essays which essentially has the argument Bobby was around when the birds flew, therefore Bobby made the birds fly. How am I running away from it. You keep ignoring the fact that you are ignoring a vast amount of information to uphold a single word instead of the entire meaning. I talked the pizza! Is that correct? In your eyes yes. Being a blowhard doesn't mean you are correct. Physics has nothing to do with accepted legal definitions. Another fallacy you are using, along with knowledge of the ancients. Much of your arguments are based on known fallacies I have pointed out time and time again, and which you have ignored time and time again. Do you have any real facts or just fallacies? At least they don't judge on lies, distortions, and ignorance as the essay you did does. That's quite something to say that when you have posted a essay far worse then how they judge. Ignoring the fact that you did this doesn't make you right. Purely myoptic understanding? Is that what you call the historical use of the word for the past 3,000 years? Apparently the legal definition, historical definiton and accept defintion are all semantics to you have no bearing. If we all ignored parts of word we did not like, no one could communicate. I talked the pizza! You can constantly ignored how that is exactly what you are doing. Alright. But you're just giving them the ultimate freedom. No more pain, no more suffering, no more hardship, no more earthly demands, no more constantly uncertaintly, no more worrying, no more problems. Doesn't sound like the murderer is even being punished. An eye for an eye and the whole world goes blind. Ignorant. Executing people is costing this country money, lives, and dignity. The crime rate doesn't drop with more penalties, it increases. If you know anything about how these trials are paid for, you would know that counties, counties that are usually in the RED, have to pay for them. They cut social services FIRST, and pressure police to handle the major crimes, not the small crimes. And as any knowledge person knows, without that form of help and enforcement, crime rates go up. If republicans are for fiscal responsibitly, why are republicans voting for Bush? Do you realize it costs more to kill people then the put them away for life? Do you even understand how the system in NY works? None of what you say even matters if we applied it to the entire country.

No problem. here is data from a internet paper floating around in the internet. A commission after an extended study came to the conclusion that the cost to execute a convict was far more than the total expenses of life without parole. On average, the commission found execution was 38% more expensive then life without parole. On average, the yearly costs for life without parole total to $22,000 per prisoner. If a prisoner serves the mandatory 60 years, it will cost the state roughly $1.32 million for a single life sentence. While those statistics may seem staggering, what is truly astounding are the statistics from other studies, such as one by North Carolina. That study found that it costs $2.16 million per execution more than the of prosecuting a non-capital punishment case, and a lifetime sentence combined. If you apply that cost to the rest of the nation’s executions, the nation has spent over $1 billion on capital punishment since the reinstatement of the penalty via Gregg vs. Georgia in 1976. The Miami Herald estimated that in the state of Florida, the 18 prisoners executed in the fifteen years from 1973 to 1988, cost an average of $3.2 million per convict, totaling $57.6 million. However, one must remember that it takes a trial to send a person to death row, and eventually to their final destination. The National Bureau of Economics Research, directed by Katherine Baicker, found that sixteen years of capital punishment trials have costs the nation $1.6 billion dollars. They also found most capital punishment cases fall on a county’s budget. Subsequently, the counties that prosecute these cases must balance the high costs, and most cut programs, slash budgets of fire and police departments, and public transportation. However, this is usually not enough, and higher taxes end up balancing the budget. One example of counties balancing their budgets by those methods is Douglas County, Kansas. The residents of the county have a $1.7 million budget deficit. The county has already cut $1.5 million from the budget, which will degrade the quality of programs in the county. On top of that $1.7 million deficit, a capital punishment case is scheduled in that county. Recent estimates of the trial have the total cost ranging into the $2 million price tag. Commissioner Jones was quoted comparing the costs to the trial’s results, “That extra measure of justice or vengeance -- however you want to call it -- is not worth all the sacrifices you’ll have to make.” Clearly the costs of the trial have an impact, enough to make the people wonder if it is truly worth invoking the death penalty. Many wonder how is death more expensive than life! Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin’s 2002 death penalty case breakdown is as follows: Four prosecutors for the two-month trial, including preparation time totaled $296,000. $34,000 was spent on equipment, presentations for the trial, and expert testimonies. Another $43,000 was allocated for investigators to research the case. $164,000 was paid to one of the defense attorneys. The other three attorneys did not submit their legal fees, but the estimated additional fees top out at $200,000. The jury selection costs the state more than $87,000. The calculated costs add up to $602,000, without overtime pay to deputies. However, this case did not end with a conviction to death row, but only life without parole. This cost is unusually low since Jamil did not go through the multiple appeals that most convicts do when originally given the death sentence. A convict can appeal to his or her state’s Supreme Court, then an intermediate court, and finally the US Supreme Court. If Jamil received the death penalty, the low end of his three appeals would total $1.806 million. If he did appeal, the low end of the sum of his appeals plus his first trial total $2.4 million. That total is significantly more than $1.32 million that Indiana’s Commission had found for room and board of a life sentence.

Think about it. If it WAS a deterrent, why isn't there any convincing empirical evidence saying it is after 3,000 years of use? Answer me that. The supreme court has access to every legal staistics and study ever done in this country. And what do you mean by this?

Please explain this. Show me some figures on the cost of an execution and the cost of life imprisonment. Base it on a 21 year old criminal whose life expectancy is 50 more years.Also, please explain how the Supreme Court can logically back up a claim that capital punishment is not a deterrent to capital crime. Do they have figures on how many times people have decided not to commit a crime? Are they comparing statistics among states with and without the death penalty?(BTW, make sure your hands are clean before you tell someone else they need to wash theirs.)

this is not about cost, it is about whitch is more humane, in your opinion, life in a cage, or death?

So you are comparing incarceration to the costs of prosecution and conviction for capital crimes, not just the execution.I noted in an article regarding the cost of the death penalty in California that a capital trial costs $1,898,323.00 while a non-capital trial costs $627,322.00. The bulk of the increased cost goes to the lawyers, investigators, the court and the jail. True, some of this is taxpayer money, but it's being recirculated through payrolls and redistributed as taxable income, so it's really not that expensive.The execution itself costs far less than incarceration. I have made a standing offer to perform executions for $250.00 a head (group rates available) and that includes burial at sea.

Death would be more humane and therefore I choose the "life in a cage". Hopefully a long, long life.

this is not about cost, it is about whitch is more humane, in your opinion, life in a cage, or death?

Emclean: Oh but it is about cost. The trial of one alleged criminal will likely cost many other families the lives of their loved ones. That is unacceptable in almost every case and notion to me. We do not kill people to ensure that more innocents are murder. That refers to our current system, one I do not support. Because that is what seperates the costs in between the two. If we ran our system like Saudi Arabia, I wouldn't have made the argument. You cannot ignore the costs of the trial to suit your argument. So you admit that it does cost more. Not like that's up for discussion anyway. While the divided example mentioned in the long economics explantion I posted does sort of support your argument, it only does on the surface level. The other examples I posted cost significently more, to the point of a million or more. True, the money does go back into the system as tax, but it is not being kept in the county/state and being spent as it normally would be. The key to stopping violent crimes is to enforce a Draconian rule of lower laws. NY tried this and succeeded beyond their most wild dreams. Violent crimes dropped more then 50%. Not to mention that many killers start off disturbed, and can easily be helped early through proper social services. The money that is spent on trials is not spent on those two fundemental cutters of violent crimes. So in reality it not only costs more, but it only ensure more innocent blood to be spilled. Then we abandon many civil rights, including due process of law. Like I said, it would be cheaper if we ran our system like Saudi Arabia, but we don't, nor should we, that's if we consider our society civilized.

I offer to execute only those who have been proven guilty, not just suspected of it.Incidently, there's a country (I think in South America) where if you cause an auto accident that hurts someone and you are determined by the officer in charge of the scene to be under the influence of alcohol, he can shoot you dead at the scene, thus saving the cost of a trial.

A year ago I stopped at the scene of an accident of a vehicle driven by a woman who I witnessed sail over the median and land squarely in the opposite side of the freeway. We all, including the state trooper, believed she was intoxicated judging by the response to questions, with slurred speech and all, but the paramedics who arrived later found her bracelet identifying her as diabetic, suffering an insulin reaction. Think of the medical expenses we could have saved with a simple bullet.

I did not claim to agree with the policy of shooting people at the accident scene. I do not.My father was diabetic and I learned what it's like for a diabetic to have high and low blood sugar.I believe in the swift and relatively painless execution of those convicted (in a qualified court) of capital crimes.

Jim: But the cost is already been paid for. Millions of dollars have left the county and the state coffers. That was probably during Argentina's war aganist Britain where martial law was enacted, or Chile's dictatorship. Besides, it ignores mechanical failure as well as other factors. Due process of law is something this country is built on, it seperates us from the dictators who run their courts as extensions of their own will. It is simply easier, cheaper, and better to simply lock away the scumbag for life? I do support a penalty, just not the current oneDeath is still a weak punishment in my eyes. Why would I give a murderer freedom from suffering and the demands of a worldly life?
