We've been waiting for someone to tell us, but somehow they're reluctant to become specific... at least as far as demonstrating cause-and-effect. (They can come up with people wanting to marry their mailboxes, and apocalypse, and things like that, but not how they would inevitably result.) You'd think they could just point to what must be plentiful examples in the countries/states that already have  gay marriages. Wouldn't you?

Don't know if you've read this before already, but the interpretations of the Hebrew texts for Genesis Ch 19 have been seen buy many to have been deliberately mistranslated by the homophobic church leaders back in the day.Two examples:Gen 19:4 often translated as - 'the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the poeple from every quarter'.However, the Hebrew word transliterated as "anshei" was translated above as 'men', when it is ambiguous and can refer to people, including women and children. This seems to have been an attempt to make the mob all-male.The second is the next verse Gen 19:5 often translated as 'They called to Lot, 'Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them.' Here the Hebrew word transliterated as "ya,da" is translated as 'to have sex', when it is ambiguos and can mean 'to know'.Now considering that we already have a description earlier in Genesis as 'a tiny fortress in the barren wasteland south of the Dead Sea. The only strangers the people of Sodom ever saw were enemy tribes who wanted to destroyand take over their valuable fortress and the trade routes it protected', doesn't it seeem more likely that if some strangers appeared in Sodom, the entire town, not just the men, would want to know who they were (in case they were hostile - as many of the strangers in Sodom were) than to gang rape them?The story of Sodom and Gomorra seems to this reader as a grossly and deliberately misinterpreted Bible passage designed to support unfounded homophobia.

Not only that, but think about it logically. If every  male in town, young and old, and that's what the passage says, was gay, wanting to rape Lot's visiting angels out of homosexual lust--the inescapable implication of the use of the story to condemn homosexuality--Sodom must logically have been an all-gay  town, with a reputation far surpassing the Castro or West Hollywood. (You got to wonder where the young ones came from, since obviously no one there was, uh, "procreating.")Funny, then, that none of the other references to the city (and there are many) mention what must have been its most notable aspect.

They were probably two perfectly nice towns, weathly by the sounds of it, who had the misfortune to be struck by earthquakes. Early Hebrew scholars seized on the opportunity to teach a lesson on the importance of generosity to the poor and of hospitality to visitors and made up a story about angels and rude rich people. Generations of bigots, ignoring the message about selfish wealth, have reduced the story to a statement on homosexuality. If god had a real problem with homosexuals, he'd have wiped much of the Mediterranean clear of all life. It strikes me that his letting the Greeks, Egyptians, Romans, and others flourish for millennia swamps one little bitty earthquake in the grand scheme of things.(my, but this stuff is foolish absurdity!)

..and nevermind the fact that the Catholic church prescribes NO gender/genitalia to Angels at all. So, if the crowd/mob did want to "Know" that the visitors were actually Angels, they would want to see that they had no genitalia...right? So it's also possible that there was no intent of rape at all. The only instance of rape suggested was Lot offering up his daughters to be raped. Which is sick and perverse to begin with.

UK Civil Partnerships are not identical to marriage. There are a few small differences (and a heck of a lot more pages for the law books) because CPs are an entirely new entity. Most of the differences are minor, though I, and quite a few gay people in the UK, find one particularly insulting. CPs CANNOT have any religious component. Unlike heterosexual marriages which can be "completed" in a church by having someone "proclaim" them, CPs take effect upon the second signature, have no "proclamation" requirement, and cannot be "performed" in a church (though I guess nothing stops people from signing a document in a church).It's a sop to the religious right and has quite a few religious folks angry that the government is seeking to dictate what can and cannot happen in a church.more details:http://www.womenandequalityunit.gov.uk/lgbt/faq.htmhttp://www.pinkweddings.biz/thelaw.htm#bhttp://www.equalitycoalition.org/pressrelease.asp?ID=4Well, we have our head in the sand in more ways than one.

It is one of the few truly old-world countries in Europe left and is quite conservative--predominantly Catholic by far.It's a neat place and the people there are very warm and 'laid-back.'

A dear friend of mine from High School took a few years after school and lived in Spain as well. She came back siting similar views. Indeed she had made many friends there and some of varying sexual orientations. But, it simply wasn't talked about. Everyone knew who they were, but just didn't make their sexual orientation to be a reason to like or dislike someone, let alone deny them work, housing or prevent them from finding someone to love. Sexuality was a very personal affair.

LOLAs compared to the US, Canada or (I'm guessing) Africa as Jyoshu mentioned. Spain is the size of Texas - for a whole country's population to fit in there is pretty different than here in the US. Personal space is a rarer commodity in Europe than the US. :)

Spain is small and crowded? It's twice the size of the UK with only two thirds of the population. Come again?

They better not do that! I hail from Spain! Those are MY people turning gay! This isn't cool...Actually, I strongly disagree with gay marriage anyway. It just isn't marriage. It is hypocritical and just plain disugusting. Marriage is ment to be between one man and one woman, and no other way. Some people claim to be Christian, then they go and commit this sin full of hypocricy by marrying someone of the same sex.Homosexuality, in terms of sex, marriage and whatnot, is a sin. Now, homosexual LOVE isn't a sin. I have a male friend who is my friend, and I am in NO way attracted to him, because I am not gay, but I love the guy. That is homosexual love, but homosexuality does not mean GAY. Homo=Same Sex=Gender. You can love someone same gender as you, such as mother, father or close friends, and it is homosexual, but not GAY.We need to stop this hypocricy before human civilization continues to defile itself by doing such things.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4469653.stmGood news for gays in Spain, it saves them a trip to Holland or Belgium. ;):p

Who says they are turning gay? There are merely letting those who are gay marry into the civil contract of marriage. Because you say so? emoticonXRolleyes Why? That's not how marriage started off. For at least a good thousand years marriage was between two consenting people. You seem to be missing information about how the Catholic church adopted marriage and then changed it so suit its purpose after the fall of the Roman Empire. So you're saying that only Christians can get married? emoticonXRolleyes You're going to be running into a tempest if you contiune with such ridiculous comments. Let me be the warning: temper your claims and get some history as well as comtemporary knowledge about how religion is used in the world. You're going to be in for a real hurt here if you don't. In your opinion. I don't believe in such hogwash. I'm not a athiest either. While your history is lacking, you are amusing. but that isn't a homosexual relation at all. It is merely brotherly love. The fact that you said that lets me know i'm going to have fun watching this thread.Bibilical justification doesn't do **** here. You're going to need some solid facts.

Crujir, could you please point to where the Bible says homosexuality is wrong. With an accurate translation you will struggle. I would also be interested to know why you find the romance between two people disgusting.

Welcome to the forum!I am in agreement with you on much of what you are saying. Marriage is indeed a 'straight thing', and gay groups have taken a wholesome institution and used it to validify their sexual vices. It's a shame that it's come to this.

No, everyone should have those regardless of marriage. You're the one here who seems to think straight and gay marriage should be a litmus test for those things.

Then I say the govt. should enact some way to give couples' or groups benefits without making marriage the litmus test.

If the govt. gave couples' or groups benefits to people who claim it regardless, why would it matter either way? My marriage is still marriage regardless of what the govt. does.

True. Even if the government recognized gay marriage. That is why I cannot understand your objections to it.

Welcome to the United States of America, where, if the people have anything to say about it, RELIGION DOES NOT MAKE UP THE LAW! Also, to catch you up to speed, we've already established the fact that "marriage" is a Government institution, not a religious institution. So, let's not have to rehash that for you now. Just in case I've missed something, I will also remind you that "human civilization continues to defile itself by doing such things" would also include divorce, murder, theft, rape...etc. Are you attempting to say that those issues are somehow a lesser of a problem than homosexuality (or for you "gay sex")? I seriously doubt it. Mainly because the issues I listed all create victims, show me the victims of a concentual, committed homosexual union? I don't think you can. I will also refer you to WMS's post #716, in the thread entitled "Let's Make a Deal." where he reprints actual church cerimonial rites given to same sex unions. For your further education, these rites are VERY old. So, I'm not talking "modern" stuff here. So, now that you have been brought up to speed. Your religious feelings about homosexual love, or since you seem to have such a problem with that term...GAY SEX and GAY UNIONS, really don't have much to stand on as far as laws go.Oh, and before I forget, your ettimology of the word "HOMOSEXUAL" is also not correct, well not completely anyway.Yes, it stems from the word: Homo, meaning same.But the later part is still: SEXUAL, not sex. The extended meaning of the word: "Of, relating to, involving, or characteristic of sex, sexuality, the sexes, or the sex organs and their functions. Implying or symbolizing erotic desires or activity. Relating to, produced by, or involving reproduction characterized by the union of male and female gametes: sexual reproduction." So, if we were to apply your definition to the word "Homosexual" one would have to call you Oedipus..and I really hate to tell you, but sexual contact with a member of your immediate family is known as INCEST.Eeeewwww...No, homosexual does NOT mean simply "liking" or having platonic affection towards someone of the same gender.ho·mo·sex·u·al (hm-sksh-l, -m-)adj.  Of, relating to, or having a sexual orientation to persons of the same sex.n.  A homosexual person; a gay man or a lesbian.
