gay marriage: isn't one of the main points of being gay, besides the 'i was born this way'-ism kind of a way to tell convention to go shove it? as far as i'm concerned, marriage is simply a way of providing a stable home life for children, thus giving them a better chance of succeeding outside the home. and it doesn't always work! look at the divorce rates- whats the average marriage length now, two or three years? while we're on it, why are you fighting for state sanctions anyway? is it tax benefits or something?i simply can't understand this, and its driving me up the wall! so far i've seen you guys (and girls, or whatever you would prefer that i refer to you as) say 'to hell with the system! we're outside it, we don't need it!' and then you turn around and say 'we want back in! give us this this and this, or we'll have gay pride parades and march on washington!'would somebody care to explain this to me so i can go about my life in a slightly more politically correct manner? :)

this has been slightly bugging me...

Who told you the primary function of marriage is children? That's not necessarily true, and it's not universal. Marriage has many other important functions. And, acccording to all mainstream organizations, Homosexual marriage doesn't harm children, despite what the armchair psychologist-religiwackos say.That should tell you something about the "good christian moral super institution" of marriage. It's also funny how the fundies have some of the worst divorce rates of all the Good Christians (TM).Not really. I'm gay. I don't tell anyone to **** anything. I don't want an anarchy or a poor government. There's no alterior motive behind anything. It's just the same as you are.

Maybe this will be helpful in boosting your understanding of the issue.This list is from the Human Rights Campaign:Top 10 Reasons for Marriage Equality10. Marriage equality would build on America’s tradition of moving civil rights forward and erasing the inequities of the past. More than 10 nations already allow same-sex couples to get married or to enter federally recognized domestic partnerships. What’s more, the fact that excluding same-sex couples from marriage has a long history in this country doesn’t necessarily mean that this policy is in keeping with American values. The real tradition in this country has been to pass laws to safeguard the American people and to expand laws where they leave citizens unprotected, as was done for voting rights and workplace protections. It is also an American tradition to abandon discriminatory laws, even if they are popular – as were bans on interracial marriage and Jim Crow laws segregating the races in everyday life.9. Marriage protects couples nationwide. Unlike civil unions and domestic partner registries, which aren’t portable, marriages are recognized across state lines, under the Constitution’s full faith and credit clause. If the question of recognition is left to the states, same-sex couples in some states might not achieve equality for decades. After all, it wasn’t until 2000 that Alabama voters removed laws against interracial marriage from the state constitution – and that was with a solid 40 percent voting to keep the law on the books.8. Separate is not equal. Although any step toward legal recognition of same-sex couples and their families is a step in the right direction, GLBT families will not be truly equal until they, too, can receive marriage licenses. As American history has proven, a separate but equal system does not ensure real equality. And nothing short of marriage would provide same-sex couples with the more than 1,000 benefits, responsibilities and protections afforded under federal law on the basis of marital status.7. Public support is growing. The Human Rights Campaign released results in August 2003 from a poll (conducted by the Democratic polling firm of Peter D. Hart Research Associates and the Republican firm American Viewpoint) showing that 50 percent of registered voters support or accept granting marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples as long as religious institutions do not have to recognize or perform these marriages. A total of 47 percent were opposed. There is no consensus in this country around denying the legal protections of marriage to same-sex couples. In fact, polls show us that a plurality of voters support or accept granting marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples. And, according to a Sept. 22, 2003, ABC News survey, only 20 percent would agree with amending the U.S. Constitution to ban marriage for gays and lesbians.6. GLBT people deserve equal access to the American dream. Gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people grow up dreaming of falling in love, getting married and growing old together. Just as much as the next person, same-sex couples should be able to fulfill that dream. We know from anecdotal evidence that after same-sex couples have a commitment ceremony, their friends and family treat them differently – as a married couple. Shouldn’t they, too, have the legal security that goes along with that?5. Marriage provides families stability and security. One thing that both sides of the marriage issue can agree upon is that marriage strengthens families. Children are more secure if they are raised in homes with two loving parents who have a legal relationship with them and can share the responsibility of parenthood. According to conservative estimates from the 2000 census, there are more than 1 million children being raised by same-sex couples in the United States. Without the ability to establish a legal relationship to both parents, children of same-sex couples are left without important protections, such as Social Security survivor benefits. These children should not be penalized just because their parents are gay.4. There are hundreds of ways in which state laws take marital status into account, including some of the most basic of human rights. State laws protect married couples in extremely important ways, such as allowing hospital visitation, the right to inherit without a will and the right to make decisions in a medical emergency. Some of these can be secured through costly legal documents, but not all of them can. Furthermore, same-sex couples – who pay the same taxes and work just as hard as other couples – should not be forced to pay higher taxes and high legal fees just because of whom they love.3. The Constitution promises liberty and justice to all Americans, not just the majority. Opponents of marriage equality are pushing a divisive measure that would amend the U.S. Constitution to state that marriage “shall consist only of the union of a man and a woman.” The Constitution has been used throughout American history to ensure, protect and expand the individual liberties of Americans. It has never been amended to single out a class of people for unequal treatment, but it has been amended to grant freedom of speech, religious liberty and voting rights for women. The Constitution should secure equality, not restrict it.2. No religious institution would be required to perform a ceremony. Just as no religious institution can be required by the government to marry an interfaith couple, no religious institution could or should be told to marry a same-sex couple. Right now, the government fails to ensure religious freedom when it refuses to honor the unions of same-sex couples performed by one religion the same way it honors those of opposite-sex couples.1. There are at least 1,049 protections, benefits and responsibilities extended to married couples under federal law, according to a 1997 study by the General Accounting Office. Gay and lesbian couples in lifelong relationships pay higher taxes and are denied basic protections under the law. They receive no Social Security survivor benefits upon the death of a partner, despite paying payroll taxes. They must pay federal income taxes on their employer’s contributions toward their domestic partner’s health insurance, while married employees do not have to pay such taxes for their spouses. They must pay all estate taxes when a partner dies. They often pay significant tax penalties when they inherit a 401(k) from their partner. They are denied family leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act. All American families deserve these crucial protections

How is it that gay marriage recognition is an example of "equality" rather than a special right? You already have the very same right to marry and opposite-sex person right now, as anyone else in this country. The problem is that you want a right over and above that--special rights.Then we can work on ways to make civil unions protable.Public support does not make it the way to go. There was public support for slavery at one time, and prohibition. Both turned out to be the wrong direction.You seem to think that a legal document somehow give a commitment between two people legitimacy. Marriage strengthens families because it is a commitment that hoepfully is kept. The ONLY think in question here is the govt.'s recognition of marriage, not marriage itself. You can already have the strength of marriage if you want to commit to someone. Let's not confuse the two. There is nothing magical about a state-issued marriage license. It's simply a legal paper--it won't give you stability to your home and family. You'll have to do that yourself.And these can be extended to portable civil unions.That doesn't mean you get absolutely anything you want, anymore than someone wanting social security monies at 25, for instance. The constitution doesn't guarantee anarchy.Huh?? You don't have to have a religious institution to perform your ceremony NOW, either. This one makes no sense at all.Sure, if you want to call some of them serious benefits. Some are a stretch.- End stage renal disease program?- Tutorial assistance? (as if marriage is going to make it THAT much easier to get tutoring)- Protection of indians regarding tribal property when marrying white men? (a carryover from an earlier part of our history when this was an issue)Furthermore, many items in the list are very general, which could be taken to apply to one instance, or many. Some apply to outdated laws which aren't even applicable any longer. The document itself says that it is "a collection of 1049 federal laws classified to the United States code in which marital status is a factor." It does not even call them actual 'benefits.' Gay rights groups have tried to portray ALL these as benefits. But as the GAO document itself says "no conclusion can be drawn, from our identification of a law as one in which marital status is a factor, concerning the effect of the law on married people versus single people." Funny isn't it, how gay rights groups tend to leave that part out when they quote the document.Coscura, see the GAO document itself, if you want to make your own judgements:http://www.marriageequality.org/1049.pdfIt's a PDF, so you have to have Acrobat Reader to read it.

Well, the simple answer to this question is "No it is not." Telling convention to shove it is not one of the main points of being gay, not in any way shape or form. Being gay is simply about the people one is attracted to, the people one loves, and the person one wants to spend his or her life with.Now this does not mean that these people do not tell convention to go shove it, but they do so only when they believe convention is unfair, unjust, unequal, and a detriment to happiness. On the issue of gay rights, most (but maybe not all) gay people believe that the specific convention of denying some rights to gay people is a bad one, so they stand against it. They do not simply hate convention because it is convention; good convention is worth retaining.Marriage does many good things, including providing financials relief and expanding health care and other benefits. This helps out the members of a marriage when one of them falls ill or is laid off and needs help to get through a tough situation. It also encourage the family unit, which provides emotional support.I do believe that children are an important reason behind marriage as well. However, quite a few, if not most, long-duration same-sex couples have children, and allowing them to marry would give them a much better chance at adoption, which would further increase their likelyhood to have children. Because same-sex couples can have children and have the same needs as any other family, they deserve the same marriage benefits provided to opposite-sex couples.So is it the tax benefits? Yes, sort of. It is that same-sex couples are in the same financial situation and hold the same family structure as opposite-sex couples. It is unfair to give special benefits to opposite-sex couples; they have no special need for these benefits that does not apply to same-sex couples.If this is what you've seen, then you've misinterpreted. I don't know any gay people who really believe that "the system" needs to be torn down or removed. They may think that they are outside of the system, but this is certainly not due to their own intentions. Their goal is to change the system to give themselves a place in it, a place equal to that of any other.And what is it you think of gay pride parades? It does not sound to me that you equate these to the civil rights marches of the past, though civil rights marches is exactly what these things are. Surely you would not have condemned the African American marches on Washington when African Americans fought for equality, so why look down on the marches of today?Well, I would not make the claim that anyone is just like anyone else, but I would make the claim that gay people are just as likely to be good people as anyone else. Now, I would wager that I know far more gay people than you do. I wager this only because I am in a variety of gay rights organizations, as well as other gay-friendly organizations. I also have many gay friends outside of these organizations. I know of none being sexually promiscuous, though perhaps some are doing it behind my back. I know of many who do believe that sex is for pleasure, but an equal, if not greater percentage of heterosexuals who also believe sex should be used for pleasure. Further, I know a number of very promiscuous heterosexuals.Yet we let those heterosexuals marry. In truth, I see no reason not to. Lots of people of all sexual orientations believe that sex should be used for pleasure, not just children. This fact is a religious / moral belief, and it does not make these people bad parents, nor does it make these people bad people, nor does it make these people less in need of the benefits of marriage should they decide to start a family. If we are going to give marriage to some people, it is inexcusable to deny that marriage to others who are in equal need of it.If you would like others to respect your status as a husband (or wife, or whatever you would prefer that I refer to you as), then you must be willing to respect the marriage of others in return.

Not at all. Not as far as I'm concerned. Maybe for some, propably very few, gays and lesbians actually want to "tell convention to shove it." The problem is with the mindset you are displaying. You may not believe gays are "born that way" and therefor you see it as a form of "non-conformity." To me, I was born this way. Just as I was born being left-handed and blue eyed. I didn't choose any of those things. But traditionally being left handed was thought to be simply a behavior, something which could be changed through cruel correction. Being blue eyed is physically a detriment because those with blue eyes are far more light sensitive. I was also born gay. I didn't choose it and although I did try to change it, I later realized it cannot be changed. Really? So why do the elderly marry? Why do those who know they can never convieve children marry? Why do those who actively refuse to have children marry? Marriage is in no way "simply a way of providing a stable home life for children" at all. Marriage, today, is for compainionship and love.Who's marriages? Opposite gender marriages. Because same gender couples cannot marry you can in NO way compair the two. Sometimes yes. Sometimes no. Although there is no denying the obvious tax advantages to marriage, there are other aspects of which you blatently close your eyes to. How's about respect for one? Again, it's your perspective. Let's pretend for a while, shall we? Let's pretend the laws still did not allow interracial marriage and you want to marry someone outside your race. Is this fair? Why would you want to marry outside your race? Would it be for the tax breaks? If so, why not just marry someone of your own race? Why do you have to be allowed to marry someone of another race? Why can't you just stick to your own? Allow me to answer...You want to marry the person you love. Pure and simple. You want to legally be recognized as married when you register your children for school. You want to be recognized as legally married if you or your loved one should ever be hospitalized and cannot make medical decissions for yourself. You want to be recognized as legally married when you or your loved one retires and you are of age to obtain Social Security benefits. You want to be recognized as legally married when you grow old and need the aid of an assisted living center and so you and your loved one can still live together. You want to be legally recognized if anything should happen to your or your loved one so that when your (as a couple) estate is divided, someone else in your extended families cannot take off with the home you two built together. You want to be legally recognized as married so that if your or your loved one need medical insurence coverage you aren't paying for two seperate individual coverages. You want to be legally recognized as married so that if anything should happen to you or your loved one, the chidlren you raised together (even if they are from a former relationship or adopted) aren't stripped from you thus tearing your heart and your family in pieces. Oh get off it. PC is **** and you know it.

A marriage between 2 people has finanial benfits for the family. Joint accounts like IRA's and 401(k)'s can compound in interest tremendously. Joint accounts can compound in interest 2x faster. Guess where the interest comes from. Tax money, which would otherwise be government's money. Obviously, like everything else, there is a hidden agenda. God is just the bait.

Because homosexuals aren't attracted to members of the opposite sex, so it's pointless. In order to have a right, you have to have a legimimate way in which you can exercize that equal right. That's not possible with hetero-only marriages. There is no special right, it's equalizing it for biological concerns. Saying homosexuals can get married, but only to heterosexuals is like saying that they HAVE the right, but they have to go against their biological/mental state in order to exercize that. That's unreasonable. Of course, prior to this debate, Blacks COULD get married, but only proper marriage was between members of the same race. emoticonXRolleyes They have the same, equal rights!WHAT! that's blasphemy! In a democracy, the majority always wins! Rar!False analogy. Social security at 25 and "anarchy" are totally incomparable to equal marriage facilities. Also a strawman. No one's claiming "anything you want." They are claiming equal facilities, which, due to biology and psychology, aren't accessible (allow so harms no one and violates the rights of no others).I usually ignore XXXXXX like you, but I'll make an exception, because the illogic of your posts is fun to exploit; it's like a day and disneyworld.

A marriage between 2 people has finanial benfits for the family. Joint accounts like IRA's and 401(k)'s can compound in interest tremendously. Joint accounts can compound in interest 2x faster. Guess where the interest comes from. Tax money, which would otherwise be government's money. Obviously, like everything else, there is a hidden agenda. God is just the bait.

I think social security is a very applicable analogy--when the govt. gives SS money to one group (those 62 and over) and doesn't give it to another, it is discriminating based on age. There is no guarantee that any given 25 year old will make it to 62, and if gay people can expect marraige benefits for gay marriages, I don't see why younger people couldn't expect the benefits older people get. The point is that you don't get to have discrimination ended just because you say so. If that weren't true, SS benefits might already be given to all age groups. Does the constitution guarantee that a 25 year old can cash in on SS benefits? No more than it does for gay people to cash in on straight marriage benefits, and vice versa.Careful; gay rights people expect others to take them at their word all the time."It's natural because I'm gay, and I SAY it feels this way!"

Because homosexuals aren't attracted to members of the opposite sex, so it's pointless. In order to have a right, you have to have a legimimate way in which you can exercize that equal right. That's not possible with hetero-only marriages. There is no special right, it's equalizing it for biological concerns. Saying homosexuals can get married, but only to heterosexuals is like saying that they HAVE the right, but they have to go against their biological/mental state in order to exercize that. That's unreasonable. Of course, prior to this debate, Blacks COULD get married, but only proper marriage was between members of the same race. emoticonXRolleyes They have the same, equal rights!WHAT! that's blasphemy! In a democracy, the majority always wins! Rar!False analogy. Social security at 25 and "anarchy" are totally incomparable to equal marriage facilities. Also a strawman.

why does everyone think that i said gays have a negative side effect on children? is it because i said this:the part about 'or they want someone else to come home to and don't mind the side effect of kids' is not the same as saying 'they don't mind the side effect ON kids'. what i was referring to is the typical heterosexual couple who uses protection only sporadically- they're married, right? they don't need it, kids are acceptable since its not wedlock or some **** like that, and if their partner is faithful, they have no diseases to worry about. why does this make me look like an idiot? because you can ignore one word and assume that i'm against you? jesus tapdancing christ! it gets old to have everybody jump down your throat over something they misinterpreted but can't bring themselves to admit! emoticonXMad and if its something else that implies that, then i'm sorry, i didn't mean to.next:what the hell are you talking about? i cited the philosiphies of exactly seven gay people that i know. do you really think this affects all of you? if your really that worried about it, doesn't that place some concern where it shouldn't be? and on a lighter note, i will condemn all college students with that attitude, until i meet a notable exception (i'm in college and that may take a while. i could also include the professors if you're worried about equality). :)as for my assumed stance of supporting 'institutional marriage', i couldn't honestly care less. if you want to assume that i have that stance, go ahead. if, however, you'd like to know what i honestly feel and think of it, i could still care less. marriage isn't something i plan on getting involved in for a few reasons- the survival odds of my career of choice not the least of them. still, i have to admit, its very fun to watch people assume to know what you think and who you are based on that... and then watch them walk circles around themselves supporting the same point you're trying to make.

And what is the rational logic behind the justified "discrimination?" Do you expect to pay with money you cannot afford?

Having sex for pleasure, if done in a responsible manner, is harmless. Yet I do not understand why you believe it is okay to **** people off and attack their emotions, perhaps even bringing them to tears for your own experiment on the reactions of others. You may not have an emotional stake in this matter, but as a decent human being, I ask you to please respect the emotions of others. Though you may not be able to see the people you speak with on this forum, they are people. Caring only about one's own emotions is not a quality of a person who is in any place to condemn someone else for immoral actions.

How is it that gay marriage recognition is an example of "equality" rather than a special right? You already have the very same right to marry and opposite-sex person right now, as anyone else in this country. The problem is that you want a right over and above that--special rights.Then we can work on ways to make civil unions protable.Public support does not make it the way to go. There was public support for slavery at one time, and prohibition. Both turned out to be the wrong direction.You seem to think that a legal document somehow give a commitment between two people legitimacy. Marriage strengthens families because it is a commitment that hoepfully is kept. The ONLY think in question here is the govt.'s recognition of marriage, not marriage itself. You can already have the strength of marriage if you want to commit to someone. Let's not confuse the two. There is nothing magical about a state-issued marriage license. It's simply a legal paper--it won't give you stability to your home and family. You'll have to do that yourself.And these can be extended to portable civil unions.That doesn't mean you get absolutely anything you want, anymore than someone wanting social security monies at 25, for instance. The constitution doesn't guarantee anarchy.Huh?? You don't have to have a religious institution to perform your ceremony NOW, either. This one makes no sense at all.Sure, if you want to call some of them serious benefits. Some are a stretch.- End stage renal disease program?- Tutorial assistance? (as if marriage is going to make it THAT much easier to get tutoring)- Protection of indians regarding tribal property when marrying white men? (a carryover from an earlier part of our history when this was an issue)Furthermore, many items in the list are very general, which could be taken to apply to one instance, or many. Some apply to outdated laws which aren't even applicable any longer. The document itself says that it is "a collection of 1049 federal laws classified to the United States code in which marital status is a factor." It does not even call them actual 'benefits.' Gay rights groups have tried to portray ALL these as benefits. But as the GAO document itself says "no conclusion can be drawn, from our identification of a law as one in which marital status is a factor, concerning the effect of the law on married people versus single people." Funny isn't it, how gay rights groups tend to leave that part out when they quote the document.Coscura, see the GAO document itself, if you want to make your own judgements:http://www.marriageequality.org/1049.pdfIt's a PDF, so you have to have Acrobat Reader to read it.

Some have argued that it would also be incredibly financially costly to make the application of marriage benefits much more open-ended as well.There is no guarantee that anyone will reach 62, either. SS funds at 25 is no less or more of a right than gay marriage. And people DO argue for marriage rights based on "equal treatment" all the time.Face it, both are there to give benefits to a certain group, based on specific criteria. No one of any criteria who wants it can just cash in on SS funds, and no one of any marriage criteria (or marriage arrangement) can just cash in on marriage benefits. You are arguing the same sort of argument that one would argue if he were 25 trying to get the govt. to give him SS funds.

No, they made a commitment before they got married, married or not people make commitments. They made a commitment with their first joint checking account, their first major purchase together, the first time they made a plan together for their futire.

Marriage IS a commitment. That's what people do when they get married--they make a commitment to each other.

Sorry, but my marriage is so much more than a "legal" agreement. If the govt. took away the legality of marriage tomorrow, I'd still be married.What of all the gay people who have claim to have gotten married even though they know the govt. doesn't recognize it? Are you going to tell them as well that they only have a marriage if it's "legal?"

No, they made a commitment before they got married, married or not people make commitments. They made a commitment with their first joint checking account, their first major purchase together, the first time they made a plan together for their futire. That commitment was there with/or without a marriage. Marriage just seals the deal and makes it legal. Note: the word legal.

marriage is marriage. If they are not married, they are in a long term relationship, not a marriage. My partner and I have a long term commitment to each other, we plan to psend the rest of our days together. We are not married. We are hoping that we can get married for the legal protections on the life we have together. BUT when to people say they are married. either they are or they are not. If it is not a legal thing, then they are not. Then it is just a nice jesture, not a marriage. Two people being committed to each other for life is a relationship and a beautiful thing, marriage is a legal aggreement that seals the deal and protects it.

That is true. Many anti-gay marriage people have made that claim. It has ALSO been soundly DISPROVEN, including Social Security benefits. :p

Some have argued that it would also be incredibly financially costly to make the application of marriage benefits much more open-ended as well.There is no guarantee that anyone will reach 62, either. SS funds at 25 is no less or more of a right than gay marriage. And people DO argue for marriage rights based on "equal treatment" all the time.Face it, both are there to give benefits to a certain group, based on specific criteria. No one of any criteria who wants it can just cash in on SS funds, and no one of any marriage criteria (or marriage arrangement) can just cash in on marriage benefits. You are arguing the same sort of argument that one would argue if he were 25 trying to get the govt. to give him SS funds.

Well, there are a lot of gay people who would disagree with you since they got married without the possibility of a license.I think you are referring to civil marriage. In my opinion commitment marriage is a marriage depending on what the couple wants it to be. If they want to call it a marriage, that's their business, and none of yours to question. Regarding this issue, you should take your own tagline to heart.

gay marriage: isn't one of the main points of being gay, besides the 'i was born this way'-ism kind of a way to tell convention to go shove it? as far as i'm concerned, marriage is simply a way of providing a stable home life for children, thus giving them a better chance of succeeding outside the home. and it doesn't always work! look at the divorce rates- whats the average marriage length now, two or three years? while we're on it, why are you fighting for state sanctions anyway? is it tax benefits or something?i simply can't understand this, and its driving me up the wall! so far i've seen you guys (and girls, or whatever you would prefer that i refer to you as) say 'to hell with the system! we're outside it, we don't need it!' and then you turn around and say 'we want back in! give us this this and this, or we'll have gay pride parades and march on washington!'would somebody care to explain this to me so i can go about my life in a slightly more politically correct manner? :)

Civil marriage is what the debate is about. Stop talking out of both sides of your mouth. You must have missed my earlier post to you a few pages back.Marriage is nothing more than a legal, civil contract. Anything else is a religious or private commitment or agreement.You can't babble about redefining marriage when you yourself seem to have numerous definitions already. They only one you don't like includes gays. So as long as it does include gays, you seem to have many definitions.

No, it's about gay rights, and to deal with that issue we have to discuss gay relationships--even though I'm sure you wish that were not the case.Actually, its you all who muddy the waters of civil marriage and marriage as a commitment when you use whichever one is most convenient for your argument at the time. One one hand you seem to think that gay people don't have the right to get married at all--they do because you can get married anytime you want. A number of gay people have, regardless of the fact that they don't get a license. The ONLY difference between a marriage you might have and one that I might have (in terms of commitment) is that mine happens to have govt. sanction. That's ALL. A gay person can claim to have a marriage as much as anyone, and many of them do (as you should be aware!)By reducing marriage to only a legal agreement, you've not only denigrated the marriages of many people, but many gay people as well who claim to have a marriage even though they don't have a license.

I understand more now, I think. The reason so many want marriage is probaby not because they believe it will make their relationships last forever. But people who are going to break up will do so whether the government recognizes their relationship or not. And those break ups will be just as hard and traumatic for a couple who has declared themselves life partners as it would be for a couple whose life partnership is recognized by the government. The debate over marriage rests in idea that it is not only wrong for the government to grant recognition to some relationships but not others, it is wrong for the government to grant benefits to some relationships but not others. Same-sex couples are as deserving and in need of benefits and recognition as anyone else, and there is no reason to recognize one relationship over another simply because of the gender of the people involved.Whether you believe in voting or not, it is still a worthwhile cause to work toward equality under the law. Although you may not believe marriage is a good thing in many cases, surely you agree that our current definition of marriage does not treat same-sex couples fairly and justly under the law. When faced with such injustice, working against it is an important task; injustice is not something which should be allowed to stand unchallenged.I don't think you're so evil; I'm certain you have good intentions. I was also not certain that you quite meant to word that the way you did. I do not find it immoral to have a discussion with people, even though that discussion may hurt them emotionally. But I do find it immoral to pay no mind to whether someone is hurt emotionally, and I do find it immoral to not care that someone was hurt emotionally. That is the impression what you wrote gave me, whether it was intended or not. I did not mean to imply that you have actually harmed anyone emotionally, though you seemed to say that you would not care if you did. I get the impression now that you do actually care about hurting people emotionally.Regarding Marx's ideas, well they would certainly be a great thing if they could work. Perhaps in time we will see a society make those ideas work, but I'm not so certain human nature wouldn't tend to abuse those principles too much. We will see, I suppose.

its not just you, i've gotten this response from several people, and its not a point i'm interested in hearing about. its been getting me called all sorts of names by many different people. but to answer your question, no, i havent seen a satisfactory answer yet. claiming that its unfair to not have marriage when so many marriages end so miserably points to some bizarre form of masochism, in my mind. the cases where i've seen marriages work out are few and far between, and in many cases have more to do with economic support than with love or affection. thats why i've been asking: because even though i don't have any stake in this, it still baffles me. does that make more sense?would it make you feel better if i told you i refrain from voting? i honestly don't believe in it- its simply too easy to rig, as gwb's first term in office taught us. and i also don't see how banning gay marriage is a greatly immoral act, for the reasons stated above: marriage is great while it lasts but hell afterwards for nearly everyone involved, in most cases: why do you want to put yourself or somebody you love through that? if it makes you feel better, i'm in most cases against hetero marriages- they don't last, everybody gets heartbroken, so on etc.ooOOooh! you dare make ambiguous jabs about who i am as a person! fine, if you think i'm so evil condemn me, and if its true i'll admit to it- but the majority of what you just accused me of is simply a detached view of what most people would do anyway. if i bring them to tears, i don't laugh at them- i'm not a bully, or at least i try not to be- i try to show them why i think they're wrong and why it wasn't a good idea to get so emotionally attached to an idea in the first place. i'd make karl marx cry if i showed him what happened to the soviet republics and communism, to get the point across that it doesn't work anywhere but on paper. that doesn't mean i point and laugh- just the opposite- i'd try to comfort him and profess the respect i have for his ideas and the hopes that they could somehow/someday work. does that seem immoral? as for condemning others for their actions and emotions, if i've been interpreted as doing so i- again- have to profoundly apologize. all i've done is asked for an explanation, and persisted in asking for one when no reasonable answers were forthcoming.

I agree that this would be an acceptable solution; certainly as acceptable as recognizing same-sex marriage.

In many cultures, this is true. In our Western tradition, it is not. Legal, civil marriage is based on ROMAN law. Roman law, in this area, was independent of any particular religious tradition. Early Christian thinkers counselled AGAINST marriage, as an impediment to personal dedication to God. It took a few centuries before Christianity first recognized, then co-opted, the marriage ceremony. Not coincidentally, it did so once it was strong enough to control it. And even while it controlled it, the Church often (but not always) found a way to conduct some marriages (non-Christian ones) in a way that was considered LEGAL but not SACRED.Odd that some* modern day Christians can't grasp a distinction their ancestors could...* I am going to try to put "some" into all my posts until you come up with that codeword I asked for.Visit the laws of the State of Virginia. Gay people are BANNED from entering into any legal partnership or contract that in any way mimicks legal marriage.

In passing, a gay couple might well use the term "married". They might do so with family and friends. They might do so only in the gay community, where everyone knows what they mean.If they say it on a government form, it's fraud. If they put it on a bank loan, it's fraud. If they say in to the INS (whose new name I forget), it's a felony and quite likely considered a "terrorist" act.

Bob- I think I will not respond. You only prove my point here. The terms you use are precisely intollerant of one who's beliefs are different from yours. Ask others on this forum what my position is on Gays. To say that most act a certain way and then justify your behavior towards everyone because of the most, is BY DEFINITION, perjudice.As to your comments on Roman law, marriage has been around long before the romans, long before states mandated it. Regardless of whether or not our western society has adopted this, it does not make it right and is why I say the government should get out of it. Your logic is terrible.

This is ambiguous. No longer gay or no longer your wife? (I don't believe you can turn it on and offf by the way)

You are wrong about the intolerance. I am not intolerant of others whose beliefs are different. As a citizen, I have no option to restrict their rights. I must tolerate them. I must accept them. I believe in what the Constitution says is our legal framework. Furthermore, I celebrate them. I believe strongly in people maintaining their cultural traditions but NOT BY IMPOSING THEM ON EVERYONE. I respect and admire many orthodox communities of a variety of religions, even though they may be rabidly anti-gay, AS LONG AS SOCIETY AS A WHOLE PROVIDES AN ALTERNATIVE for those who do not share the beliefs.All I am looking for a shorthand term that does not take up a page with all its qualifications that I can use when I need to refer to that SUBGROUP of religious folk who use their religious faith (genuine or otherwise) to prevent my full participation in the legal rights this country guarantees to its citizens. Actually, two terms might be useful: one for the sincere; one for the hypocrits.I'm not asking for a word to describe any particular religious faith. I'm asking for an acceptable term -- acceptable to YOU -- to describe the subgroup. I clearly can't say "Christian" (and I don't) as many, many Christians do NOT object to gay rights. I can't say "fundamentalists" (even though most of the folks who fall into the category I mean call themselves that and hardly anyone complains about it) for the same reason. I can't say "Southern Baptists", to some degree for the same reason but also because I'd have to make a list to include some Mormons, some Catholics, some Muslims, etc. etc.And homosexualilty has been around forever. You can't seriously suggest that we have never been part of what societies considered "moral families". All sorts of cultures accepted us, some as equals, some as inferior, some as superior.That wasn't logic. That was history. You said "It has historically been a religious ceremony (whatever your religion)."That is disingenuous. It has been a religious ceremony and it HAS NOT BEEN a religious ceremony. In THIS culture, our culture, it was civil BEFORE it was legal.Thou shalt not bear false witness. Sins of omission. think about it.

Bob- I think I will not respond. You only prove my point here. The terms you use are precisely intollerant of one who's beliefs are different from yours. Ask others on this forum what my position is on Gays. To say that most act a certain way and then justify your behavior towards everyone because of the most, is BY DEFINITION, perjudice.As to your comments on Roman law, marriage has been around long before the romans, long before states mandated it. Regardless of whether or not our western society has adopted this, it does not make it right and is why I say the government should get out of it. Your logic is terrible.

I would agree that using such terms destroy persuasive value, but this is because when attacked, the person being argued against immediately becomes defensive and protects themselves from an insult. The person who uses such terms seems like a jerk, and when viewed as a jerk, that person cannot be convincing.But this is not really ad hominem. Although those insults were used, they were not used as reasoning behind an argument, just as a side note. An example of ad hominem might be "your argument against same-sex marriage is invalid because you are uneducated" or "why should I listen to you? You're gay." Those are using an attack on a person as the reason that their arguments are incorrect. It is certainly possible to make a logical argument, then tack on as a side note that one's opponent is a wacko without commiting a logical fallacy.

As I stated, your point is well taken. Also, it is not a matter of approval or disapproval. It is a matter of logic and a persuasive argument. It is not logical to argue in that manner as it only points to the opposite. It is not persuasive for the same reason.edit: Essentially it is argumentum ad hominem. A logical fallacy.

::reads as he sips coffee, humming "I'm gonna **** on a hornets nest"::this has really taken off. now for another two cents from me: i see marriage as a contract between two people to be sexually abstinant from everyone else except that one person (kind of why i'm against polygamy), with a smattering of the 'to have, to hold, to cherish and to comfort, in sickness and in health'. why does this require a piece of paper and economic sanctions?i guess its the last two things on that list that **** me off so much- GWB has proven himself to be inept with money. he's a classic good american: he can take any idea, good or bad, fund it for the wrong reasons, run it into the ground, and then find someone else to blame. the liberal civil rights crowd loudly points this out, then turns around and says 'give our gay couples those scraps of paper the other couples have and let them keep most of their money'. is this logical? it doesn't seem like it.

on some level she was bisexual, in order to be with men she must have had some attraction to men.

Politics is essentially the business of taking advantage of the average person's beliefs and convictions, and discrediting one's opponent. Left-wing politicians aren't automatically more sincere than the Dubyas of this world. Gay people want to see their views and values (namely, civil rights and equality) represented in gov't just as much as fundamentalist Christians or any other group, and are just as willing to be taken in when we're hit in the right place.

I believe you have not seen the numbers of studies conducted which provide evidence that allowing same-sex marriage will save the government and taxpayers approximately one billion dollars per year. The specifics are listed in this study, which we quoted in another thread:http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=5559&sequence=0I believe that this study also does not factor in that more same-sex couples will be able and willing to adopt, should their marriage be legalized, which indicates that less children will be raised by taxpayer-funded adoption homes and more will be raised by families.So I think your claim that liberals are saying "give our gay couples those scraps of paper the other couples have and let them keep most of their money" is based only on the assumption that allowing these marriages is somehow an increase in government spending. It is not; this debate is not at all about government spending. This debate is about giving the same set of rights and benefits to same-sex couples that opposite-sex couples currently have. It is a battle where equality, freedom, and happiness stand against long-held, but unfounded moral beliefs, as I see it.

I do not think this is necessarily true. Just as disliked oatmeal raisin cookies when I was younger but love them now, I do not see any reason that the sexual attractions experienced by a person could not naturally change over time. However, it certainly may be the case that she is bisexual, as you describe.It may also be that she was attracted to other women and still is. However, perhaps her religious beliefs tell her that she should be with someone of the opposite sex, and she obeys those before she obeys her physical attraction. Of course I would never personally agree with such a religious belief, but perhaps she believes it more than I do.

So what your are really saying is the only reason she is with a man is because god says so, she may not really want to be with you, but god tells her it is right. Wow, I would rather be with someone who is with me because they love me, not because it gets them into heaven.

Well straight Americans everywhere better watch out - they might turn gay later in life!I think this is absurd. She is either bisexual or was simply experimenting (not uncommon in either sex). I know straights who have tried the same sex and homos who have tried the opposite sex - fully aware of their actual orientation. I think most people fall somewhere in between actually. I really REALLY reallyreallyreallyreallyreally like guys. A lot. Especially this one guitar player here in town.... emoticonXLove but I digress. My point was - being a staright women - I can openly admit I would probably not turn Anglina Jolie down. I have a gay male friend who says the same thing. :)

Wait, remember now that I'm not the same person who said that I have a wife who was once gay; that was epaphras_faith. I just read the situation, and I am speculating on the causes. I would not guess that epaphras_faith believes that the causes are the same things I do.I would hardly make the statement that straight Americans everywhere need to "watch out"; I would guess a change in sexual orientation is not common and not usually very drastic, but I would also guess that it could be. If I am to consider sexual orientation as a genetically-rooted preference, which I do, then I find it illogical to assume that it should not follow the same set of rules which govern any other genetically-rooted preference. I cannot readily think of a genetically-rooted preference which cannot change over time. So why should sexual orientation be any different? I merely wonder if it is not possible that some (though not all or even most) people who once "experimented" actually may have experienced a slight or dramatic change in their sexual orientation as they progressed from late teens to early twenties. I freely admit that such a statement is mere speculation, but it is speculation with reasoning behind it.
