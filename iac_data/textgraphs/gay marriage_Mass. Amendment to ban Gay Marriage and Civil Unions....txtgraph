Mass. Amendment to ban Gay Marriage and Civil Unions...

You know, I see that happening about as fast as my state overturned it's recently added "Sexual orientation" wording to it's Anti-Descrimination Act. There were no less than six bills being proposed, NOT ONE of them made it out of committee. I suspect the same will happen in Mass.

It won't be interesting at all. It'll crash and burn before it even gets off the ground, and for one simple reason. Gays have been getting married for a year now, and nothing bad has happened. No apocolypse, no surge of divorces, none of the end-of-the-world predictions. There's no basis for depriving gays of their rights, and it's been clearly demonstrated. The Governors push will fail, the amendment that's currently in the works will fail, and people will get on with their lives with the realisation that gays getting married is not, in fact, a bad thing.

Mass. Voters Don't Want Gay Marriage Amendment by Michael J. Meade 365Gay.com Boston BureauPosted: February 7, 2005 7:30 pm. ET (Boston, Massachusetts) The Massachusetts legislature will take up the second phase of a proposal to amend the state Constitution to ban gay marriage this year, but a new poll shows most voters want the effort abandoned.The Bay State Poll, taken for the Eagle-Tribune, and released on Monday, shows that most people in Massachusetts have grown comfortable with same-sex marriage."We have it. It's been happening. The sky is not falling," said Bay State pollster Russell K. Mayer, the director of the Center for Public Opinion Research at Merrimack College.The poll found 52 percent of respondents do not want to see the amendment on the ballot. Last march lawmakers approved the proposed amendment which would define marriage as a union of a man and a woman. It would, however, allow civil unions with legal marriage rights (story) It must be approved again in this session of the legislature in order to go to voters in 2006.Same-sex marriage became legal in Massachusetts in May 17, 2004http://www.365gay.com/newscon05/02/020705massPoll.htm

As I said, good luck! Even if they gather enough signatures, it hase to get past the Senate president, and he is very pro-gay marriage. This was tried once before, and then Senate president Tom Birmingham, although not a supporter of gay marriage, did not want the world's oldest living constitution amended in such a fashion. So he killed the debate, essentially killing the proposal.

It's not just a matter of "voting." The point is that the will of the people need to be respected--that's what democracy is. Ours is, after all, a govt. by the people and for the people.And the question isn't whether civil rights is being voted on, but whether or not changing the institution of marriage is a civil right to begin with.

Anyone who opposes gay rights, or the rights of any and citizen, is a bigot. I say if they want the people to vote on my civil rights then I want to vote on their civil rights. Lets start religeon I want all, baptist, bible, catholic, and any tv evangilists shut down and outlawed. Lets not stop there I want to outlaw the republican party. This is my petition drive I am starting here in the state of michigan here is the wording.To secure and preserve the benefits of religeous freedom in our society. All laws weather in this constitution or created by the lesgislature, local authority, or penal code which are based on religeous beliefs or proposed and suported by any religeous organization past or present shall be removed and considered void. Further no religeous group, church, or any organization that has a religeous statement or mission, may indorse, propose, any legisaltion, polotition, ballot initive, or give any financial support to anything political or recieve funding from any government agency for any purpose.This would put a big wall between church and state infact it would stop the raving christonazi lunitics from running over peoples civil rights. I think there are enough non church going and poeple p'ed off out there I might just get this on the ballot.BTW don't give me the 1st admendment arguments IT says CONGRESS shall make no law it says nothing about states. Also there is the 9th and 10th admendments back this up with powers to the people and states.

Look the term Bigot up in the dictionary. I think it applies to anyone who wants to keep others out of something based upon a certain quality. Namely people who want to stop gay people from getting married because they don't believe in gay marrtiage, or it goes against their religeous beliefs. A bigot never views himself as a bigot a bigot views himself as normal and any one who doesn't meet that standard is abnormal. So I say to you if the shoe fits then wear it.

ONly in your opinion, as far as I am concerned, same sex marriage is a civil right. AND in the goodrich decision on Mass it was named a civil right. It is only based on your moral view that it is not a civil right, not a legal view.Just the fact that some committed couples have access to marriage and other couples don't is discrimination. I consider that a civil right, although I understand but don't agree with your opinion on it.

The states have a perfect right to not perform gay marriages. However, they have no right to not recognize weddings performed legally in other states. That's the issue that will come up before the Supreme Court, and given how clear the constitution is on the subject they will have no choice but to order the states to recognize the marriages.

I live in Massachusetts. I am well aware of the political climate here. Robert Travaglini (the current Senate President) seems reluctant to bring the amendment he co-sponsored that would ban gay marriage but allow civil unions to the floor. Considering that 3 pro amendment people lost their seats in the last election, as well as in the special elections held afterwards, I would be worried, too. And I can guarantee you , that there is no way that Travaglini will allow an amendment banning civil unions to make its way out of debate.Good luck to you.There will be no amendment in Massachusetts.

We shall see what the people of Mass. say.........The polls you cite say they favor gay marriage...The polls the Governor cites say they are against it........If the people of Mass. want and amendment and the politicians don't then the politicians will be looking for new jobs..........That is the way it works in this country.............If Mass comes up with and amendment to ban Gay marriage then I honsestly believe that when all is said and done every state will eventually pass and amendment banning it..........Mass. is really the only state in doubt.........

Only one state can perform gay marriage at this time and that is Mass........The marriages there are not recognized in any other state.........The SCOTUS will not touch issues that are state issues..........They will throw it back to the indivual state and their amendments banning gay marriage will prevail..........

The states have a perfect right to not perform gay marriages. However, they have no right to not recognize weddings performed legally in other states. That's the issue that will come up before the Supreme Court, and given how clear the constitution is on the subject they will have no choice but to order the states to recognize the marriages.

Please enlighten me and name me one state that has segregation in their constitution..........I would love to hear that since it is against Federal Law........

funny how many states still have segregation as part of their state constitutions. I doubt that the supreame court will uphold marriage bans they have been trending towards individual privacy rights for years. This is what scare conservatives that someone might not want to live under their draconian system any longer.

Eventually every state will have and amendment banning gay marriage with maybe the exception of Mass. and it might even happen there too.......
attacks
Marriage is a State's right and each state has a Supreme court. Those states without gay marriage will recognize them because of federal decisions. It is not an "if" this happens it is "when"

We've gone over this before. Do you really not remember, or are you just being difficult? Either way...Article 4, section 1, United States Constitution:Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State. If you're married in one state, your married in every state. And since that is spelled out in the US Constitution it falls squarely in the provence of the Supreme Court. The states do get to set their own rules for who they will give licenses to, that is a state's issue. But one state does not get to tell another that their legal proceedings don't count. It's in the Constitution, and the Supreme Court can't do anything but rule in favor of having marriages performed in Mass. be recognized everywhere in the country. Some day soon, VoR, you will have a married gay couple living in your neighborhood!

The US constitution trumps state constitutions, as you really ought to know. And Mass. is not currently allowing out of state gays to get married there, based on an old segregation law. That law is in the process of being overturned, and once it is the floodgates will open. Just like any two adult hets can fly to vegas and get married, even if they don't qualify in their home state, any two gays will be able to go to Mass and get married, and that will mean that they're married in their home state as well.

I don't need to spin it. I live here. I am well aware of the politics involved here. Even if you believed that people voted for Romney based on his conservative credentials, that victory did not translate into victory for the candidates he supported for legislative seats.Why is that? Romney would have never won the governorship without the inner suburbs of Boston. And those people are very socially liberal. They may have been initially wary about gay marriage, but now they have grown to support it. And they have always supported rights for same-sex couples, including civil unions. And they are not very happy with him right now.And it says a lot that he has still not formally announced his run for reelection yet. Also, if he formally decides not to run, one of the potential candidates (can't remember his name right now) is actually for same-sex marriages.On the democratic side, Attorney General Tom Reilly has announced he will run for governor. While initially he was against gay marriage (but for civil unions) he has now come out in favor of marriage for same-sex couples. Another contender on the democratic side, Deval Patrick, is enthusiastically for gay marriage.Romney is definitely in the minority here.Stay tuned indeed.

We're debating a term here. If you want to be technical about it, any male who is attracted to young boys is homosexual. Any male who is attracted to young girls is heterosexual.But that does not change the fact that an attraction to young boys is very different than an attraction to adult men. And it does not change the fact that an attraction to young girls is very different from an attraction to adult women. Even though we use the same words for those things, they are completely different attractions.Now no one here is talking about giving rights or the legal benefits of marriage to men who act on their attraction to young boys. Everyone here will agree that those people should be criminals and should recieve punishment for their actions.The only thing we are saying is that men who are attracted to other adult men should be allowed to get married, just as men who are attracted to other adult women should be allowed to get married.So it does not matter whether those priests labeled themselves as "homosexual", "heterosexual", "bisexual", "asexual", or "metrosexual". They're people with an attraction to children, with a very different attraction than homosexual men who are attracted to other men. No one wants to give anyone the right to get married to or to molest a child.But the most important part is that no matter what terminology is used, attraction to a young boy has nothing to do with attraction to an adult male. In the same fashion your attraction to adult females doesn't make you attracted to children, and it doesn't mean you're going to molest female children.

That's the point. Because they are completly different things we don't use the same word. Attraction to adults of the same gender is homosexuality. Attraction to children is pedophilia, regardless of the gender of the child or adult. In point of fact, most men who have sex with boys are not gay. When they have sex with adults they have sex with women. There simply is no comparison between the two activities, and so they shouldn't be described with the same word.

They don't have to be. I don't mind what word or words are used to describe them. This is not and has never been about a word. The law does not define words.This debate is not over the definition of a word, it is about access to a legal institution. We absolutely must give same-sex and opposite-sex couples the same legal benefits under the law, and the same access to legal institutions under the law, or we are promoting the idea that one is superior to the other.Males and females are different. I wouldn't describe them using the same word. But I wouldn't create two different legal institutions, then put men in one and women in the other. The only things I could accomplish by doing that are to promote the idea men are still superior to women, or to eventually work toward giving men and women different benefits under the law. Both of those goals are morally evil.You can call the legal institution "marriage", "civil unions", "legal relationship benefits", or whatever you want. But it must be called the same thing for both opposite-sex and same-sex couples. We have never before, and we should not now, create two seperate sets of legal rights that accomplish the same thing, simply to distinguish one lifestyle, one religion, or one belief from another. That legal distinction will never do anything except elevate the majority over the minority.

The distinction between gender of victim and sexual orientation of perpetrator is important because many child molesters don't really have an adult sexual orientation. They have never developed the capacity for mature sexual relationships with other adults, either men or women. Over the years, this fact has been incorporated into various schemes for categorizing child molesters. For example, Finkelhor and Araji (1986) proposed that perpetrators' sexual attractions should be conceptualized as ranging along a continuum with exclusive interest in children at one extreme, and exclusive interest in adult partners at the other end. Typologies of offenders have often included a distinction between those with an enduring primary preference for children as sexual partners and those who have established age-appropriate relationships but who become sexually involved with children under unusual circumstances of extreme stress. Perpetrators in the first category – those with a more or less exclusive interest in children – have often been labeled fixated. Fixation means "a temporary or permanent arrestment of psychological maturation resulting from unresolved formative issues which persist and underlie the organization of subsequent phases of development" (Groth & Birnbaum, 1978, p. 176). Many clinicians view fixated offenders as being "stuck" at an early stage of psychological development. By contrast, other molesters are described as regressed. Regression is "a temporary or permanent appearance of primitive behavior after more mature forms of expression had been attained, regardless of whether the immature behavior was actually manifested earlier in the individual's development" (Groth & Birnbaum, 1978, p. 177). Regressed offenders have developed an adult sexual orientation but under certain conditions (such as extreme stress) they return to an earlier, less mature psychological state and engage in sexual contact with children. Some typologies of child molesters break the fixation-regression distinction into multiple categories, and some include additional categories as well (e.g., Knight, 1989). For the present discussion, the important point is that many child molesters cannot be meaningfully described as homosexuals, heterosexuals, or bisexuals because they are not really capable of a relationship with an adult man or woman. Instead of gender, their sexual attractions are based primarily on age. These individuals – who are often characterized as fixated – are attracted to children, not to men or women. Using the fixated-regressed distinction, Groth and Birnbaum (1978) studied 175 adult males who were convicted in Massachusetts of sexual assault against a child. None of the men had an exclusively homosexual adult sexual orientation. 83 (47%) were classified as "fixated;" 70 others (40%) were classified as regressed adult heterosexuals; the remaining 22 (13%) were classified as regressed adult bisexuals. Of the last group, Groth and Birnbaum observed that "in their adult relationships they engaged in sex on occasion with men as well as with women. However, in no case did this attraction to men exceed their preference for women....There were no men who were primarily sexually attracted to other adult males..."

"King himself was a very strong advocate for equality, not just for African Americans but all people." Wolfson cites King's reliance on Bayard Rustin as a key adviser during the Montgomery bus boycott. Rustin, who was gay, also organized the 1963 March on Washington. "King's right-hand man was a gay man," Wolfson said. "People like Coretta Scott King and (U.S.) Congressman John Lewis, who marched with him, have said that King would have stood for the rights of homosexuals." Cecil Williams, pastor of San Francisco's Glide Memorial Church, said King sought an end to racism, classism, homophobia and all forms of discrimination. He also cited Coretta Scott King's defense of gay and lesbian rights. "I know her personally, and I know what her position is," said Williams.

We don't know for sure if her husband would have supported it or not. And MLK III as well as the Kings' daughter believe gay marriage is immoral and do not support it.

People have long invoked Martin Luther King and used his name for lots of things. As perhaps the most well-known civil rights leader of all time, it's only natural that anyone who comes along trying to claim the civil rights mantra, even if it's not a matter of civil rights at all, are going to to try to use his name. There's quite a leap to take from having an advisor who is gay, and full support of gay marriage. We'll never know for sure if he would have supported it or not. It's true that his widow has come out in favor of gay marriage, but other members of his family have definitely come out against it. If King had felt as strongly about it as some want him to have, he would have said so and made some statements about it. As it is, we'll never really know for sure.

It doesn't have anything to do with pedophilia in the sense of the idea that gays are more likely to be pedophiles than anyone else, which isn't true.

This idea that sexual orientation doesn count if it's a case of anyone being underage or even a child in the situation is ludicrous, especially if you are going to, in other instances portray sexual orientation as so inescapable and an all-powerful influence on human behavior. This is a case of gay rights people talking out both sides of their mouths.Hello?????!!! If he's attracted to HER and not attracted to boys, then OBVIOUSLY it's related to heterosexuality to some degree (or homosexuality if he's only attracted to boys).

Nice try, but I think you are going to be hard pressed to prove that everyone's sexual orientation's cut-off age for attraction is a certain age."No, I won't be tempted by your looks--you're only 13 (even though you look like you 19).

That may be. But I think you'd be hard-pressed to say that individuals who are attracted to adults of one sex or another are also attracted to children of that same sex. Certainly that isn't true at all.Children tend to have more asexual physical characteristics, and their body types change dramatically over time. Simply because I am attracted to adult males does not mean I am attracted to male children. Simply because I am attracted to adult females does not mean that I am attracted to female children.Now, I'm not saying that there is a specific "cut-off age", but certainly there is an age at which I am not at all attracted, and there certainly is a process by which I become more and more attracted to an individual as that person's body becomes physically more like an adult.There are some people who are more attracted to younger children than they are adults, and those are the people you see molesting children. I would argue that in many cases, it is probably the dominating situation created by having sex with a child that draws many child molesters. But whatever sexual attraction drives them, it is as different from adult homosexual attraction as it is from adult heterosexual attraction.Simply because the words we use group a large variety of sexual attractions under the term "homosexual" and a large variety of sexual attractions under the term "heterosexual" does not mean that the "heterosexual attractions" are more similar to one another than they are to the "homosexual attractions". Each sexual attraction should be considered independantly. The grouping of sexual attractions into "homosexual" and "heterosexual" is arbitrary. Sure, it affects who you're attracted, to but so does my sexual attraction to thin people over overweight people.

The only thing that homosexuality has in common with pedophilia is that it is an atypical sexual orientation, like beastiality or something. Don't you think pedophilia is innate?Don't you think maybe pedophiles are born that way?That's what I always assumed.Just because people don't use that terminology doesn't mean that pedophiles don't have a preference.

Pedophilia is a mental disorder, not an "orientation." People aren't "born" child molestors, they become  them.

Again, you are neglecting the fact that pedophiles are selective in the gender of the kids they go after. If sexual orientation were not a factor at all, all pedophiles would molest girls and boys just as readily.I have to agree with MrWriteLA; pedophilia is not a sexual orientation. And I think a pedophile's sexual orientation still plays out when they molest kids. That's why they are selective in which gender of kids they victimize.

How do you know this?Well, ok, technically a person can't be a child molester until they molest their first child, so in that way, they become a child molester.But, why wouldn't a pedophile be born that way?

Pedophilia is a mental disorder, not an "orientation." People aren't "born" child molestors, they become  them.

The distinction between gender of victim and sexual orientation of perpetrator is important because many child molesters don't really have an adult sexual orientation. They have never developed the capacity for mature sexual relationships with other adults, either men or women. Over the years, this fact has been incorporated into various schemes for categorizing child molesters. For example, Finkelhor and Araji (1986) proposed that perpetrators' sexual attractions should be conceptualized as ranging along a continuum with exclusive interest in children at one extreme, and exclusive interest in adult partners at the other end. Typologies of offenders have often included a distinction between those with an enduring primary preference for children as sexual partners and those who have established age-appropriate relationships but who become sexually involved with children under unusual circumstances of extreme stress. Perpetrators in the first category – those with a more or less exclusive interest in children – have often been labeled fixated. Fixation means "a temporary or permanent arrestment of psychological maturation resulting from unresolved formative issues which persist and underlie the organization of subsequent phases of development" (Groth & Birnbaum, 1978, p. 176). Many clinicians view fixated offenders as being "stuck" at an early stage of psychological development. By contrast, other molesters are described as regressed. Regression is "a temporary or permanent appearance of primitive behavior after more mature forms of expression had been attained, regardless of whether the immature behavior was actually manifested earlier in the individual's development" (Groth & Birnbaum, 1978, p. 177). Regressed offenders have developed an adult sexual orientation but under certain conditions (such as extreme stress) they return to an earlier, less mature psychological state and engage in sexual contact with children. Some typologies of child molesters break the fixation-regression distinction into multiple categories, and some include additional categories as well (e.g., Knight, 1989). For the present discussion, the important point is that many child molesters cannot be meaningfully described as homosexuals, heterosexuals, or bisexuals because they are not really capable of a relationship with an adult man or woman. Instead of gender, their sexual attractions are based primarily on age. These individuals – who are often characterized as fixated – are attracted to children, not to men or women. Using the fixated-regressed distinction, Groth and Birnbaum (1978) studied 175 adult males who were convicted in Massachusetts of sexual assault against a child. None of the men had an exclusively homosexual adult sexual orientation. 83 (47%) were classified as "fixated;" 70 others (40%) were classified as regressed adult heterosexuals; the remaining 22 (13%) were classified as regressed adult bisexuals. Of the last group, Groth and Birnbaum observed that "in their adult relationships they engaged in sex on occasion with men as well as with women. However, in no case did this attraction to men exceed their preference for women....There were no men who were primarily sexually attracted to other adult males..."

Again, you are neglecting the fact that pedophiles are selective in the gender of the kids they go after. If sexual orientation were not a factor at all, all pedophiles would molest girls and boys just as readily.I have to agree with MrWriteLA; pedophilia is not a sexual orientation. And I think a pedophile's sexual orientation still plays out when they molest kids. That's why they are selective in which gender of kids they victimize.

Just about anything repeatedly paired with masturbation will eventually become sexually arousing in itself. It only becomes a disorder when that attraction has bad consequences, ie when it results in you wanting to molest children, or have sex with animals, or some such.You can experiment with this for yourself; try pairing images of obese women with your masturbation, and you will eventually become sexually aroused by obese women. (Note: you may not want to actually do this).

It wasn't because of any new medical data or anything, it was because of political pressure. It was a moral/value judgement.But that's the case with most "psychological disorders" isn't it?It's not typical for someone to brood and mope around all day, so a person who does this is "diagnosed" with "depression." But if everyone moped around all day, a person who didn't would be "diagnosed" with "hyperactivity disorder" or something like that.What's on this list is very subjective, IMO.Homosexuality could easily be on this list if not for the political pressure to keep it off.Oh, they left off beastiality?

I don't think this is necessarily true, as plenty of child molestors certainly have and do have mature sexual relationships with other adults. There's a man who's wife I know who was sent to prison for it. They had what she thought was a good marriage.Look, everyone is on board here (other than VOR I suppose) that gay people are no more likely to be pedophiles than anyone else. You don't need to defend that at this point. You guys are so worried about that association that you can hardly have a rational discussion about it. First, like so many other things, pedophilia is not an all-or-nothing issue--it probably manifests itself in degrees with different people. In other words, there probably ARE some pedophiles who are not even attracted to adults, and there are probably plenty that are. Second, you still can't get away from the fact that on some level, pedophiles obviously have a sexual orientation because they are selective about the gender of their victims. Third, this can get very grey because child molestation doesn't just include little children who's bodies haven't developed, but also young adults who are underage and who sometimes are certainly NOT "asexual" in appearance. It's still morally wrong of course, but child molestation doesn't just include very young children.

It doesn't have anything to do with being gay. Being gay is an attraction between adults of the same sex.I don't know that. There is no reason to come to that conclusion based on their criminal acts with children.How is it ludicrous? You have not shown it is ridiculous, all you have shown is your ignorance.What the heck? This is an entirely different topic, and does not connect being a pedophile to being gay or being straight.Wrong. Sexual orientation, gay or straight are attractions of adults to other adults.

Good grief, drop your ideology and get some education!I don't think I've changed anything. Adult sexual orientation is an orientation towards adults by other adults.Most people have a general idea, and some yes, do have a certain, specific age.If a person has sex with a 13 year old, that is illegal. Age of consent laws are a whole other topic. What you are talking about I belive is called ebophilia(maybe wrong on the name), an attraction to those just at puberty.

It doesn't have anything to do with pedophilia in the sense of the idea that gays are more likely to be pedophiles than anyone else, which isn't true. But you are being intentionally dishonest when you try to explain away any case of a someone trying to engage in homosexual acts with an underage person by saying "oh he's a pedophile' that has nothing to do with being gay." Don't be silly. You know as well as I do that some or many of those priests who were obviously attracted to same-sex boys were gay. This idea that sexual orientation doesn count if it's a case of anyone being underage or even a child in the situation is ludicrous, especially if you are going to, in other instances portray sexual orientation as so inescapable and an all-powerful influence on human behavior. This is a case of gay rights people talking out both sides of their mouths.Hello?????!!! If he's attracted to HER and not attracted to boys, then OBVIOUSLY it's related to heterosexuality to some degree (or homosexuality if he's only attracted to boys). If pedophiles were free of sexual orientation as you seem to think, and only influenced by their pedophilia, then it only stands to reason that they would be just as attracted to boys as girls and vice-versa.Good grief, this isn't even that complicated.Oh, and I notice you've now changed your terminology to "adult sexual orientation." Nice try, but I think you are going to be hard pressed to prove that everyone's sexual orientation's cut-off age for attraction is a certain age."No, I won't be tempted by your looks--you're only 13 (even though you look like you 19). Go away.""What? Did you say you're actually 14??? That's above where my "adult" sexual orientation kicks in! Weeeeell, in that case . . ."

Homosexuality was removed because of the research, and because it does not fit the requirements to be a paraphilia. Gay people live happy, fullfilling lives. There is no distress from gay activity to one's self or to others. There were politics involved on both sides, and both sides had the chance to make their cases. It's time some people got over what happened over 30 years ago, unless they have some compelling new piece of evidence to present.

I think that's about as logical as a flat-earth. A heterosexual pedophile (toward adults) is more than likely to target opposite gender kids. That's just common sense. Now you're just chain yanking.

That's not true. Studies have been posted here. There is no correlation between adult sexual orientation and the sex of the child the pedophile chooses. It's you who is very ignorant on this subject. Can someone who is a heterosexual target opposite sex kids? Yes. The heterosexual can also target kids of the same sex. He(usually a man) is doing so, not because of his heterosexuality, but because he is a pedophile. The fact that he very well may target an opposite sex kid, doesn't change that. I feel like I am talking to a brick wall. You don't have a sophisticated knowledge of sexuality. You are looking to re-write the textbooks. It's not going to happen.It's just that you make strange associations in a strange context.I don't notice this, but fine.One can compartmentalize those who are pedophiles as being attracted to young children. What do you mean pedophilia is more than about young children? If you have a sexual relationship with a young kid, regardless of how mature you feel that kid looks or acts, that is pedophilia. A pedophile is an adult who is attracted to children. This is not the same category as someone who is gay or straight.

Once again, you have ignored evidence showing you your mistakes.I will say this only once more, if you don't get it, that's your ignorance...The term: Homosexual Pedophile, relates to the gender of the victim NOT the sexual orientation of the predator. A person who identifies as being sexually oriented to adult females, but who victimizes young boys is a "Homosexual Pedophile", but his sexuality in regards to ADULTS is HETEROSEXUAL.Case in point: John Wayne Gacy.He self identified as HETEROSEXUAL. He had been married twice and had children by his wives. His children actually said he was a loving and attentive father. BUT...His victims were male. The thing is most pedophilial serial killers, like Mr. Gacy, don't actually regard their victims as having any gender at all. They don't even regard them as human beings. They see them as inanimate objects.But, as in the cases of the priests, most of them actually self identify as heterosexual as well. The difference is that their pedophilia was enacted upon boys. Why? Simple. It's what they had access to! (DUH, moment here)The thing is that most pedophiles who go for prepubescent children don't really see their victims as having a specific gender. Prepubescent boys and girls phyisically look similar. So, again, just to emphasize my statement: "Homosexual Pedophile" is a CLINICAL term identifying the gender relation of the VICTIMS...not the SEXUALITY of the PREDATOR! Do you get it now?

Paedophilia is much more analogous to rape. Rapists, even if their victims are male, do not tend to identify as gay. It is not generally about attraction or sex so much as it is about power, control and dependence. Comparing consensual sex between adults of any gender with non-consensual sex simply does not make sense.

A person who identifies as being sexually oriented to adult females, but who victimizes young boys is a "Homosexual Pedophile", but his sexuality in regards to ADULTS is HETEROSEXUAL.Case in point: John Wayne Gacy.He self identified as HETEROSEXUAL. He had been married twice and had children by his wives. His children actually said he was a loving and attentive father. BUT...His victims were male. The thing is most pedophilial serial killers, like Mr. Gacy, don't actually regard their victims as having any gender at all. They don't even regard them as human beings. They see them as inanimate objects.But, as in the cases of the priests, most of them actually self identify as heterosexual as well. The difference is that their pedophilia was enacted upon boys. Why? Simple. It's what they had access to! (DUH, moment here)The thing is that most pedophiles who go for prepubescent children don't really see their victims as having a specific gender. Prepubescent boys and girls phyisically look similar. So, again, just to emphasize my statement: "Homosexual Pedophile" is a CLINICAL term identifying the gender relation of the VICTIMS...not the SEXUALITY of the PREDATOR! Do you get it now?

Exactly my point. VoR simply cannot detach sexual orientation between concenting adults from perpetrators of crimes which just happen to include acts of sex.

Paedophilia is much more analogous to rape. Rapists, even if their victims are male, do not tend to identify as gay. It is not generally about attraction or sex so much as it is about power, control and dependence. Comparing consensual sex between adults of any gender with non-consensual sex simply does not make sense.

But the problem with priests abusing kids (which is what we've been discussing here) is not just a problem involving pre-pubescent children. I agree that gays are no more likely to be pedophiles than anyone else, but to act like this priest problem is completely isolated from the issue of homosexuality is to bury one's head in the sand."Many dioceses may have taken care of the victims with adequate counselling, while the priest involved was allowed to resume ministry after a period in a treatment center, followed by approval from the same treatment center to resume ministry away from adolescent youth.I say adolescent youth - most often male - because over the years, very few priests have been involved in acts of pedophilia. Unfortunately, the few were involved in many acts with children from 1983 to 2000 in Louisiana (Lafayette) and in Massachusetts (Boston - Fall River). The media, however, has made the actions of a few pedophile priests the main problem. Bad as it is, the main problem of errant priestly crimes is not in the area of pedophilia, which is strictly defined as an adult having sexual relations with someone below the age of puberty (12), but rather in the phenomena of priests with homosexual inclinations seeking out vulnerable youth. The secular press refuses to recognize that these priests are actively homosexual, not pedophiles. All such priests are called pedophile priests by the media who said that the Pope called the Cardinals together to solve the problem of "pedophile priests". And so on."http://couragerc.net/ongoing_reflect...n_scandals.htm

That's not true. Studies have been posted here. There is no correlation between adult sexual orientation and the sex of the child the pedophile chooses. It's you who is very ignorant on this subject. Can someone who is a heterosexual target opposite sex kids? Yes. The heterosexual can also target kids of the same sex. He(usually a man) is doing so, not because of his heterosexuality, but because he is a pedophile. The fact that he very well may target an opposite sex kid, doesn't change that. I feel like I am talking to a brick wall. You don't have a sophisticated knowledge of sexuality. You are looking to re-write the textbooks. It's not going to happen.It's just that you make strange associations in a strange context.I don't notice this, but fine.One can compartmentalize those who are pedophiles as being attracted to young children. What do you mean pedophilia is more than about young children? If you have a sexual relationship with a young kid, regardless of how mature you feel that kid looks or acts, that is pedophilia. A pedophile is an adult who is attracted to children. This is not the same category as someone who is gay or straight.

Here is the crux of the problem with YOUR and VOR's analysis and, in fact, with the scapegoating the church is currently engaged in.Plenty of otherwise heterosexual men, denied heterosexual sexual outlets, will turn to vulnerable young men, consciously and unconsciously, not just physically but emotionally as well. This is obvious in prisons and in certain circumstances in the military and in fraternities. To put those men in the "homosexual" column to excuse those who created the circumstances (the RCC in this case) is dishonest. When the people making this leap in illogic choose to frame the argument as homosexuals going after "young children" as VOR does, it's not just dishonest, it's quite likely sinful.

John Wayne Gacy was a psychotic serial killer who targeted young gay men. Who knows why. He was not a pedophile. He was not gay. He was not straight. He was insane.

So. All of this could be applied to homosexuality.Actually, this quote from you could apply to heterosexuality, so it's pointless.Just replace paraphilic with sexual.Your quotes aren't helping you:They all offer "theories" and "assumptions" but no one knows where paraphilias come from. No one knows for sure whether pedophilia is innate or not.They sure seem like they are whimsically defined as they are.First of all, feelings about these paraphilias and even the theories that shrinks pull out of their asses to explain them are based more on social mores than on medicine. My lay "theories" are just as concocted as the "theories" you have presented as examples. They all say "no one knows for sure, but we believe such and such..."Second, you could not be more wrong about my stance on gays.

If we lived in a culture where it was ok to have sex with children, the same could be said for this paraphilia also.There would be no distress on willing participants.Everyone would lead happy lives.The only evidence to present is that in our culture it's ok to screw any adult who will let you, but you cannot screw any child that will let you.
supports
Homosexuality was removed because of the research, and because it does not fit the requirements to be a paraphilia. Gay people live happy, fullfilling lives. There is no distress from gay activity to one's self or to others. There were politics involved on both sides, and both sides had the chance to make their cases. It's time some people got over what happened over 30 years ago, unless they have some compelling new piece of evidence to present.

No, but child molestation is.But only because our culture and our laws tell kids that it's bad to have sex with grown-ups and vice versa.Right, I was never comparing child rape with homosexuality.I was intrigued by the way our culture treats 2 different paraphilias.A pedophile can live their whole life being one without raping a child, just like a closet gay can live their whole life without expressing their sexuality.

No way. After all, that contradicts sexual orientation. Maybe emotionally, but not so easily physically.I think you assume too much to think these simply aren't cases of gay people.And I've read that such cases in prison are actually a lot less common than what is assumed--mostly from urban legends and heresay gossip. Of course it happens, but not as much as people tend to think.I don't agree with the RCC's stance on celibacy any more than you do. But to act like these aren't often cases of gay people in the priesthood is ridiculous. It's not a matter of blame or vilification (as far as I'm concerned anyway), but one of simply representing the reality of the situation.

Will you please explain then why you persist in saying that gays represent a tiny minority? Many, MANY men in prison have sex with other men. Either they're just doing it with whatever and whomever is available, OR -- according to you -- there are A LOT of gay men in this country.Again, if you think the percentages of men who will have sex with other men in prison, in the military, in fraternities, in all those cases where females are not readily available, indicates the TRUE number of homosexuals in this country, by all means, shout it from the rooftops. I won't agree with you, but if you can convince this country that we're a HUGE minority, I suspect we'll get further than we would otherwise.GASP!!! How DARE YOU?An honest analysis and assessment of the perpetrators and the victims in this scandal is unlikely to take place. Certainly the Church itself is fighting tooth and nail to prevent an honest discussion of the situation. No doubt, some of these priests were gay men trapped (even if by their own choice) in an unliveable situation. MOST were straight men trapped in the same circumstances. I suspect that the more mature of either camp refrained from ANY abuse, just as the vast majority of priests always have. But I reject utterly the idea that it was ONLY or even MOSTLY the gay ones who succumbed to temptation with other males. Were some of these priests gay? Yes. Were all the priests who abused adolescent males gay? No way.This leaves the issue of those cases of TRUE pedophila aside for the moment. Those cases, which VOR keeps saying are "homosexual" are not, and I -- like all the other gay people on here -- deeply resent his IGNORANT assertions.

Actually Bob, his "targets" were NOT gay. Although Gacy did sodomize this victims, they were largely not homosexual prostetutes as some articles would have the public believe. My own cousin's best friend was murdered by Gacy. This teenager was not a runaway, a protestute or homosexual. He came from a middle class Des Plaines, IL family, went to Catholic school (although that means very little), but had a part time job working for Gacy's lawncare/construction business. Granted, his murder is what triggered my cousins belief, as VoR here exemplifies, that all homosexuals are pedophiles. Funny thing is, Gacy himself was sexually oriented as a heterosexual and many of his victims were infact heterosexuals themselves. The form of torture and abuse prior to the killing of the victims was infact homosexual in nature. But that is not to say that either he or his victims were homosexuals.

Or cases of male to male sex in prison are really not as rampant as we in the free world tend to think when imaginations run wild . . . Thats not to say it doesn't happen, but it's not THE thing that defines prison life as some urban legends tend to lead people to believe. Based on accounts I've read, it's not as common as people on the outside think it is.Again, the other possibility (and more plausible one) is that such cases aren't as common as you probably think. Do you actually think there are THAT many cases of male-to-male sex in the military? Do you actually think it's more than isolated instances, and that mostly what does take place is between gay men?

Look, you keep insisting that gay people are a tiny minority. You probably think 1-2%. I would say maybe 5-8%. In either case, the rate of same-sex activity in prison and other male-only environments doesn't have to be terribly high in an absolute sense to double or triple the "background rate" of homosexuality.As for who's doing it, sure many of the men are gay. And a lot of the guys they're having sex with aren't.As for the frequency of homosexual activity among predominantly hetero guys outside of prison but in male-only situations, I suspect that the rates have declined quite a bit over the last few decades because women are no longer as inaccessible as they used to be -- there are women working side-by-side with men in the military and few military situations are that removed from civil society anymore. I suppose the growing acceptance of homosexuality might make fooling around between young men more common -- and less hidden -- but at least for now, the identification of fooling around with a gay orientation has probably helped LOWER such activity.Whatever the case, it still happens and, in particular, it was happening in the Church with many of the abuse cases.

I shouldn't have made a generalization. Gacy took advantage of boys and young men with whom he came in contact. Some of these kids were picked up in pretty casual ways. Of course, America was a more trusting place then. Some were probably gay, some were just hitching a ride.P.S. I don't think that most guys who allow themselves to be "picked up" are prostitutes. Far from it.
