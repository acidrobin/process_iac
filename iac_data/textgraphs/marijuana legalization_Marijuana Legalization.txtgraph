Marijuana Legalization

Should it be legalized? Yes. Is it harmful? No, not nearly as much as alcohol or tobacco.Should it be taxed once legalized? Yes.Should laws still aply to it, such as DUIs and the like? Yes.As for what is blocking it, people who have been convinced, mostly by right wing politicians that legalizing marijuana would bring about an end to civillization. They'e simply afraid of people enjoying themselves in a non-harmful way.

First of all, MJ has side affects. Alot of them. Second, the damage that widespread use to our already screwed up healthcare could be astronomical. However, the current system obviously does not work. But because it is not a problem free drug, legalizing it is likely a bad idea. If we had a single payer system where people were accountable for their own health, I wouldn't have a problem. 7 million ways to screw/kill yourself. You make the decision.

I just say this so we don't become like amsterdamProve that marijuana is not good for you? Or prove that it is worse then smoking and alcohol?Either one, we have discussed this in the crime debate forum so see that. Marijuana is "less" harmful then an alcoholic...but that is not a good comparison. In fact, it is hard to compare the two. A normal user of marijuana is worse then a normal(1-2 beer, glass of wine, etc) user of alcohol (see other forum). Smoking tobacco is as harmful if not less harmful then smoking weed. You are just inhaling more cancer causing agents then tobacco...but once again, what do you compare? One pack to one joint? One to one? I dunno...I think the bottom line is if you had to put certain things into categories then alcohol, tobacco, weed would be "bad for you" herion, coke would be "really bad for you", sugar and sweets would be "not good in large numbers for you", carbs would be "ok with normal amounts" for you and so on.

Legalize:NO. Punishable by law: Yes. Do you not know that MJ will kill you? What about alcohol poisoning, smoking addiction? They are all addictive drugs. Yet alcohol is not a "get high" drug and can be ahandled by the body in small ammounts. Smoking (the basis for MJ) is harmful and causes lung cancer. So just add another health risk to American's and raise social security. While we all kick back lite a fresh one and say "screw problems man, like mellow out and watch out for responsibility". And then the country goes to "pot".

If something has side effects, then we should ticket people who do that something? Is that a general principle you're ready to accept?Why would ticketing, as opposed to legalizing or not legalizing (that is, what we have now), lead to less widespread use? There's an argument in here somewhere, but you just aren't making it.We should not legalize anything that is not problem-free?Isn't a single payer system the sort of system where the government, not individuals, are accountable for the health of the people? Perhaps in a pure free-market system, you could argue that if you smoke weed and get sick, it's your own damn fault, hire a doctor. But under a single payer system, you are not accountable; everyone is.Which only raises the question, what is the qualitative difference between alcohol and MJ?HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!Okay, I'm done.(not a "get high" drug indeed...)I'm finding it very hard to understand PRECISELY what it is that you are worried about.

jazyjason: when I was in high school, we smoked weed rather than drinking alcohol because you could buy weed from a drug dealer, who would only ask if you had money. If you wanted booze, you had to do all kinds of onerous things like hiring some sketchy character to buy it from you (and making sure he didn't steal your money), or steal it from your parents (and make sure they don't notice), etc. Weed was just that much less of a hassle, precisely because it's illegal.I don't understand what you're talking about here.

Most of the "research" on marijuana is junk science anyway. The whole "psychologically addicting" nonsense was a reaction to their inability to show physical dependence. Remember when they said boys would grow breasts and the so-called amotivational syndrome?

This is my view: If you want to screw up your life, you can. Will it hurt you? Yes. Do you already know that if you're taking it? Yes. Asprin can kill too, why not make that illegal? I think that if someone is hurt by marijuana or another recreational drug of the sort that they shouldn't be eligeble for money to help them (unless it was for medical purposes, that's a whole other argument). The best scenario would be you put in your own money and spend it to help you, that way if you want to screw yourself, you can, but society won't bail you out. That's how it should be.

Actually, controlled legalization is far better than the proven failure of prohibition. Since paid programs exist for the addicted, it would make more sense to get the funds for these programs from the drugs that cause it. You get other benefits to this. Gang presence is lessened (possibly removed completely), as their income source is now removed. Smuggling is lessened - who would risk it if the rewards are limited?Legalizing drugs will not create the flood of users the prohibitions claim. And prohibitionists seem to be reinforcing the poor parent syndrome, where the parents are not involved enough in their children's lives, causing many of these problems. This is easily seen in the drug use spike of yuppy teens. They have money, they are bored, they are lonely. Because mom and dad are too busy making money to properly parent.

Seems to be a lot of bad information about various drugs.Alcohol: 1. Moderate potential for abuse.2. Psychologically addictive. Sometimes physically addictive.3. Potential for fatal overdose: Moderate (usually self limiting, however when consumed in massive doses over a short period of time, can cause death due to liver failure, kidney failure, apnea (lack of breathing), or disturbance in electrolyte balance causing sudden cardiac arrest.) Heroin:1. High potential for abuse.2. Both highly psychologically and physically addictive.3. Potential for fatal overdose: High (simply put to much in the syringe, or unexpectedly get a more potent dose, you stop breathing, dead)Cocaine (including crack):1. High potential for abuse.2. Psychologically and physically addictive.3. Potential for fatal overdose: High (snort or smoke too much, massive heart attack, dead)Marijuana:1. Moderate potential for abuse.2. Psychologically addictive, not physically addictive.3. Potential for fatal overdose: Extremely Low (you would have to smoke an enormous amount of marijuana to kill you, not likely)Tobacco:1. High potential for abuse.2. Both psychologically and physically addictive.3. Potential for fatal overdose: Low (usually as the result of underlying cardiac disease aggravated by cardiac affects of nicotine)Tylenol:1. Low potential for abuse.2. Neither psychologically or physically addictive3. Potential for fatal overdose: High (taking simply 5-10 times normal dose can cause liver failure and clotting problems)Do all drugs have side effects? Yes.

Personally I think that Marijuana should not be legalized or decriminalized. How does it make sense to do either? Why add another problem into the mix?There’s a huge problem with Marijuana use, especially here in Canada, and my making it legal doesn't solve the problem, or help the war on drugs. People will get behind the wheel while being as high as a kit and they will kill because your reaction time is greatly hindered. The organized crime that comes along with it is too big of a rise as well, especially if you decriminalize. The business of producing and distributing Marijuana is a good business and if you make it easier for people to get away with possessing it and using it then you will open the doors for more organized crime, which equals more production, and larger organized crime organizations; which will bring about other organized crime activity. Marijuana is very addictive, in the psychological sense. And is harmful to the human body. When you smoke up, the smoke goes into the lungs and then is transfused into the blood stream. When this happens the smoke takes up some of the place of oxygen. Then the blood is sent to the brain. How can it possibly be any good to deprive your brain of oxygen?Also im not exactly sure how old some of you are but the drug isn't the same as it once was. Back in the 70's the active ingredient, THC, made up about 2% of drug. Now it makes up 15%, and it’s only getting higher (pun intended)The drug can also easily be lased with other extremely harmful substances. The point here people is that by legalizing or even decriminalizing Marijuana doesn't help anyone, and only creates more problems. If anything there needs to be stricter punishments for those that use it.

In 2004, at least 9 percent of roughly 17,100 drivers tested for drugs after being involved in a fatal crash came up positive for marijuana, according to statistics provided by the National Highway Traffic Safety Adminstration.In Bucks County, a 19-year-old died last year after crashing into a tree near Oxford Valley Mall. He was under the influence of marijuana, police said.In March, 16-year-old Jessica Easter of Bala Cynwyd was killed as she tried to get out of an SUV driven by Stephen L. Meloni, 19, a Harriton High School graduate who had twice the legal amount of alcohol in his system. Meloni also tested positive for marijuana. In addition, police found nearly 80 grams of the drug in his vehicle.Furthermore, drivers who are found to be intoxicated are rarely given a second test for the presence of drugs. As a result, those who are multiply impaired can go undetected.marijuana combined with a beer or two can produce a blood-alcohol level nearly twice the legal limit in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. It's more than seven times Pennsylvania's limit for drivers under 21.http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/n...a/14580457.htmWow that was the easiest thing i've ever cited, took all of 2 mins.

In 2004, at least 9 percent of roughly 17,100 drivers tested for drugs after being involved in a fatal crash came up positive for marijuana, according to statistics provided by the National Highway Traffic Safety Adminstration.In Bucks County, a 19-year-old died last year after crashing into a tree near Oxford Valley Mall. He was under the influence of marijuana, police said.In March, 16-year-old Jessica Easter of Bala Cynwyd was killed as she tried to get out of an SUV driven by Stephen L. Meloni, 19, a Harriton High School graduate who had twice the legal amount of alcohol in his system. Meloni also tested positive for marijuana. In addition, police found nearly 80 grams of the drug in his vehicle.Furthermore, drivers who are found to be intoxicated are rarely given a second test for the presence of drugs. As a result, those who are multiply impaired can go undetected.marijuana combined with a beer or two can produce a blood-alcohol level nearly twice the legal limit in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. It's more than seven times Pennsylvania's limit for drivers under 21.http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/n...a/14580457.htmWow that was the easiest thing i've ever cited, took all of 2 mins. Im very surprised that you even doubted it.

-First off they actually believe that " Drivers under the influence of marijuana retain insight into their performance and will compensate where they can (e.g., by increasing distance between vehicles or increasing effort)"Drivers who aren't under the influence don't do that now. -60-80% of drivers who were found positive for THC also showed the presence of alcoholThats a huge gap, which is it, 60% or 80%. Unless the amount of subjects used was around 20 people that tells me nothing. And plus its a common sense issue, I have no idea how old you are but if you've ever been around teenagers while they're high, which happens on occasion in high school, you would know that their reaction time is slowed (which causes a huge problem on the road), and some have a tendency to freak out when you wave your hands in front of their face, image what they'll do on the road. We all know the effects of marijuana; educe ability to do things which require concentration, swift reactions, and coordination; so why is it that all of a sudden when these pot heads get into a vehicle they magically lose the effects of the drug? Thats right, they don'tAnd your point is irrelevant, granted we may fear more from those who drink and drive, I don't know for sure, but that doesn't take away from the danger of those who drug and drive.

Huh? Only alcohol can raise your blood alcohol level. Drinking 1 beer will cause a relatively constant rise in blood alcohol level per person. Smoking a joint while drinking that beer will have no effect on blood alcohol level. And if you want to get technical, marijuana will actually assist the body in ridding itself of alcohol. Since marijuana causes a rise in heart rate and blood pressure, there will be a concurrent rise in metabolism. (This is why many stoners feel the need to eat Wendy's at 2 AM) This rise in circulatory and metabolic activity causes the blood volume to be circulated at a higher rate, thereby passing more blood through the liver where alcohol is metabolized.

It should be legalised as it's no more harmful than alcohol or tobacco.Not only that but many marijuana users end up going onto harder drugs through contact with their marijuana dealer. Lesgalising it would break that link and actually reduce the level of drug addicts overall.Furthermore you could tax it and put the money into more police to clamp down on hard drugs, which would be a good thing.

It does raise your heart rate, but it also enhances the effects of other drugs taken and alcohol, so its not a good thing to be going around smoking up just to get sober quicker based on what you stated. But lets still not forget the common sense aspect... When you smoke up its possible to have hallucinations, drowsiness, paranoia, anxiety, and pointless laughing. How does that at all sound safe while driving?

It should be legalised because it’s no more harmful then alcohol or tobacco eh... Well maybe not in the long term sense, at least there’s just insufficient studies to prove that it is, But the effects of the drug happens pretty quick and its not good to be high while driving. I don't get why you all want to add another problem into society... It doesn't make sense...

Way too sensible. Religious leaders will never accept legalization of any substance their dogma has declared sinful. Another sin openly flaunted, denied market tax revenue while consuming existing tax revenue for legislative enforcement.

True, the effects do kick in fast but why is that necessarily bad?It's also no worse than drink-driving and it would be just as serious an offense to drive while on marijuana. In fact, since the police are spending less time going after ordinary smokers they can spend more time going after sunstance abuse drivers.It's not adding a problem into society, the problem is already there. It's making the problem better for numerous reasons such as breaking the link between marijuana and hard drugs, increasing police funding through tax and also technically decreasing unemployment as people who have smoked will no longer be refused jobs.

Your logic makes no sense... we have a drug problem so we'll just legalize the drug and BAME, no more problem... by legalizing it more and more people would be getting into it and smoking more of it. Causing more and more cases of drugging and driving. Also the market in the marijuana right now is huge for Organized Crime, and they won't go away just because the government is involved, the profit is to high. In fact they'll try competing with the government and will be able to win by providing a product with a higher potency and cheaper prices if you tax the XXXX out of it, as you proposed. We also already have a massive problem with people going out and drinking and driving, why do you want to add to it. As i stated when you legalize it your pretty much opening the flood gates and providing it to even more people, raising the chances of drugging and driving, therefore creating a bigger problem. Also it will not change the fact that Marijuana leads to other drugs. Druggies like the high, and after awhile they will want to try something that provides a bigger high. It doesn't matter wither or not it’s legalized or not.

Not sure why I'm posting here as many of the posters are completely ignorant of all this.I smoked pot in high school. Big deal. Was it easier to get than alcohol? Maybe a little, but I could get either whenever I wanted. I hope my children also enjoy their lives, smoke a little pot now and again, eat a little steak, have some beer, smoke a cigar, etc. This is how I was brought up.Am I a degenerate? I certainly hope not. I am a Nuclear Engineering major at probably the most prestigious school in the country, which must go unnamed. Of three of my absolute best friends in high school: The one who smoked the most pot now goes to Princeton; he is brilliant. The one who smoked pot and did a whole host of other drugs passed more AP (advanced placement) college exams than anyone in America, ever. As soon as he graduated high school, he was a senior in college. The other smoked a large amount, and now attends an ivy league school as well (Brown). I no longer smoke pot, but a lot of my friends do, and I probably will again when I am older (possibly retired).I have yet to understand where all this anti-marijuana sentiment comes from. Rather, I know where, I just can't make sense of it. It's generally middle-aged people (women in particular) who seem to associate pot with gangs and violence. The truth is the opposite. Pot reduces violent tendencies (if you ever smoke it you would know this without question). There is absolutely no evidence that driving while stoned increases one's risk of getting into an accident. NONE. In addition, whatever societal negatives you are trying to conjure up would be far outweighed by the enormous tax revenues the government would make off selling the drug.To say that marijuana is addictive is wrong to the point of hilarity. We know it isn't physically addictive. To say that it is psychologically addictive is to say that you enjoy doing it. So, it shouldn't be allowed because it is psychologically addictive is the same thing as saying: "you shouldn't be allowed to do it because you will enjoy it." If that doesn't make you chuckle, we've got problems.Also, I don't know if you realize this or not, but THC has in no way been proven to be harmful in any long-term sense. Sure, SMOKE is harmful. Not THC. You can use a vaporizer to extract only THC from the marijuana and it becomes completely harmless health-wise. You people with a stick up your butts probably do not know this.The number of drugs that are much worse for you that America’s and Canada’s governments are too inept to criminalize are many. Just go smoke some purified salvia and tell me it ought to be legal. Yet you can buy it at virtually any herbal market or florist. If you purify it, which is legal, and smoke it, which is legal, you will hallucinate and temporarily go insane. MANY other similar such drugs exist in our country. And here we are debating something harmless, while you ignorant marijuana haters just keep going. So sad. Public ignorance always is. And if there is one thing I’ve learned, sadly, it’s that the public is always ignorant.

I never stated that this was a good policy to sober up. And yes, marijuana can cause sedation, and slowed reaction times, so yes, combining it with alcohol can cause a concominent potentiation. However, you stated previously that smoking marijuana while drinking a beer will inflate your blood alcohol level, I was just pointing out how you were wrong. I never said it did sound safe while driving. I firmly believe that pot should be legal for adults to buy, and regulated in the same respect as cigarettes or alcohol. However, just as with alcohol, I advocate responsible use and sober driving. What exactly would be your objection to me sucking down a joint on my couch in the privacy of my own home? BTW: Alcohol is a causative agent in many of the motor vehicle accidents I go to, as well as many of the assaults, domestic violence scenes, and falls. I can't count on both hands the number of drunks I have dealt with over the last month. I can however say with certainty that I have not been to one call over the last month where marijuana was the problem. In fact, in over 13 years of EMS experience, I can honestly say that I have been to less than 10 calls where marijuana has been the problem. It happens, but not that often. Do you advocate prohibition of alcohol as well?

Also, I saw some discussion about religion and pot. Well, I am a practicing Roman Catholic. I am not even close to perfect. But, if there is one thing I don't lose sleep over, it's having smoked pot. I'd do it again if my lifestyle supported it. The fact is that the only reason my religion tells me that smoking pot may be sinful is because it is breaking the law. And even this doesn't necessitate it as sin. Now, Catholicism is a pretty darn large religion, and nowhere in the Bible, nor in Church doctrine, is there anything that has yet to make me believe that smoking pot is inherently sinful. Thus, I have no reason to believe most other Christian doctrines have pot listed as one of their nono's. I'll warrant there are some, such as Mormonism, but not many. As I said in my other post, I was brought up to enjoy life as God created it, and marijuana is simply another herb that one may choose to enjoy. Moderation? Yes. Inherent sin? Ridiculous.I truly do not believe that "sin" is what is keeping pot illegal. It is mere politics and the ignorant fear of the masses. Pot is "of the devil," they secretly believe, yet nowhere can one find evidence for such white trash garbage.Evan, lemme give you a little advice. Find a friend who smokes, take a couple drags, and enjoy yourself. Then come tell me it’s a big deal.At the risk of going off on a rant, I'd like to add another thing. The only reason pot is associated with crime is because it is a criminal act. Do you understand this?? That is why "shady hoodlums" are the ones with the pot. Whose who are willing to risk breaking big-time laws are the ones supplying it. If it were legalized, all this nonsense about the "bad kids doing pot" would fall by the wayside and you all would wake up and realize the drug does nothing more than create a harmless, benevolent high. NOTHING. It does not make you stab your parents, or rob a jewelry store, or steal money from a fifth grader, or get into fights, or .... and the bs-list goes on. My guess is that the only reason this mis-association ever came about is because the inherent nature of making any substance illegal prerequisites the fact that a criminal must be the one who obtains it. Remember when alcohol was illegal in America? Next thing we knew it was those pesky ole’ mobsters killing people by the dozen to supply alcohol. Those were the “shady high-schoolers” of alcohol. Hah! Now look at what we have today – no more black-market killings to obtain it! And the funny thing is that the negative effects of alcohol could be seen, legal or not! You still had your drunks, your moderate drinkers, your party animals, and your dry-mouths. What we have here is a misunderstanding due to confusing association with causality – NOT the same things! But I've no doubt I'd have as much luck as telling these things to a brick wall...

Yes more people would get into it. However they would be educated not to abuse the drug and take it in small doses.They could just as easily drink and drive, it's actually more harmful.Firstly, they will not be able to sell the drugs that cheaply because they are buying them from illegal sources, as opposed to the government buying in bulk. Also the tax wouldn't be huge because of the large number of people that smoke it.Secondly the police will not need to arrest 'druggies' on the streets so they can go after more dealers.Thirdly using that logic no one would buy cigarettes as they can get ilelgally smuggled imports cheaper than they do at the shops.Fourthly, did the prohibition of alcohol in America mean organised crime or more organised crime?Drinking under the influence of marijuana is less harmful than drinking under the influence of alcohol.That's exactly what happens if drugs *aren't* legalised. Dealers get the addicts started on marijuana and then get them addicted to harder drugs. By making sure that smokers do not go to the dealers to get their drugs, you break the link between marijuana and hard drugs.Also there will be less dealers because the police will be going after the serious criminals rather than a junkie with a spliff in his pocket.

But let me clear something up because your deeply confused, i don't know if that’s from your smoking years or you just want to justify "the good times" you had. But its not only considered criminal because its a criminal act, its also strongly assisted with organized crime. Now its organized crime that supplies this stuff, and its a huge profit for them. And its a completely different situation then prohibition. Why? because you want the government to supply it! Government won't be able to compete with the product that organized crime will provide. Organized crime will be able to deliver a variety of different variations of the product, high potency, and they will be able to compete with government prices because of the taxes. The only reason why Organised crime couldn't compete with prohibition was because they couldn't commit with business' prices of alcohol, organised crime will compete and will win with government because government will regulate and tax the XXXX out of it. And i know what your saying "well ah, we'll just not tax it.." come on, we know very well that the government can't help its self, not to mention that if it is legalize that it will be done by a liberal and its in there nature to tax. Also when you legalize it you will be opening the flood gates to more and more users and consumers. And the ones that already do it will do it more; only making a larger consumer base for the organized crime, and will also allow for larger organized crime set ups, resulting in higher violent acts created by organized crime.

I think Evan would be in for a major shock if he had any clue as to how widely distributed pot users are within US society, at all socioeconomic levels. Marijuana is just a replay of America's failed experiment with alcohol prohibition. Morality legislation consuming abnormal enforcement resources in a supply and demand circumstance with no offsetting tax revenue.

Actually, I know a lot of people who smoke marijuana, and the majority of them do enjoy it in their homes, and are responsbile enough to not go out and drive when they get baked. It is simple common sense and maturity. Yes, some will get in their cars and drive, but this already occurs far more often than you realize. You seem to be oblivious as to how many people in this country smoke marijuana. And you base this on what? Or are you just telling us what you think will happen? Marijuana is already so commonly available that it is simple to obtain. With it's common availability it is not hard to realize that if someone wants to get high that they can do so without difficulty. I doubt that we would see a significant increase in DUI of marijuana simply by legalizing it. Look to Amsterdam...decriminalization and government control of marijuana seems to have worked well. I have not heard of a significant increase of traffic accidents and fatalities there. And yes, prohibition seemed to stop people from obtaining alcohol. Sure you're right. emoticonXRolleyes Alcohol causes more problems for a variety of reasons. 1. It is far more harmful to the body than marijuana.2. Alcohol causes changes in mood and affect not common to marijuana, namely violent and irrational behavior. 3. Alcohol is far more debilitating than marijuana in acute intoxication. We have all seen people drunk to the point where they cannot talk, walk, see straight, or even form a complete sentence. I have never seen someone high enough on marijuana to cause these problems. I do not advocate driving under the influence of marijuana any more than I would alcohol. But to say that someone who is high is as dangerous as someone who is drunk behind the wheel is irresponsible and simply wrong. Marijuana is already readily available. We have not seen the problems with pot that we have seen with alcohol.Then you are a hypocrite. You advocate continued prohibition of marijuana based on the fact that legalization will make our roads more dangerous due to an increase of people DUI of marijuana. So in your mind, less people smoke up and drive because we have a prohibition against marijuana. So following your logic, if alcohol was prohibited and "less available", fewer people would DUI of alcohol, making our roads vastly safer. Yet you do not advocate prohibition of alcohol, and even state that you do not believe prohibition works. Which is it? Sad news, people already have a taste for marijuna even though it is prohibited. I agree with the statement that prohibition does not work.Again, based on what? Do you have any examples or research to back up this statement? Or are you guessing?They already do. Legalize marijuana, remove more of the street dealers, and make it more difficult to obtain on the street. Don't see too many moonshiners around these days...

Alright, well theres so much to say here... This is for Snakespit and Oliphant First off, Snake dude, you admitted that the drug slows reaction time and causes sedation. you may sit there on your couch and smoke up, but come on! that’s not going to be the case with allot of people. People will get in a car and will drive while under the influence of the drug. Also, if you legalize the drug this occurrence will happen much more often. Also you stated that alcohol cause much more problems... umm... why is that? Could it be because its readily avaible. Now im not advocating prohibition because it will never work and it didn't work because the people had already had a taste of what it was like to have alcohol. Once you give the public something like that they will not give it up. Now if we were to legalize marijuana you would most definitely see a rise in situations where marijuana was a contributing factor. Also you say that it should only be given to adults... lol i don't know how long ago you were a kid but kids don't care whats only suppose to be for adult and whats not, they'll get it one way or another. Secondly in response to Oliphant. Now your right about a couple of things... Its not the Big boys supplying it that do the drug, its the little pot head who of course don't go around stabbing people. I don't think anyone ever said that it caused violent acts.... But let me clear something up because your deeply confused, i don't know if that’s from your smoking years or you just want to justify "the good times" you had. But its not only considered criminal because its a criminal act, its also strongly assisted with organized crime. Now its organized crime that supplies this stuff, and its a huge profit for them. And its a completely different situation then prohibition. Why? because you want the government to supply it! Government won't be able to compete with the product that organized crime will provide. Organized crime will be able to deliver a variety of different variations of the product, high potency, and they will be able to compete with government prices because of the taxes. The only reason why Organised crime couldn't compete with prohibition was because they couldn't commit with business' prices of alcohol, organised crime will compete and will win with government because government will regulate and tax the XXXX out of it. And i know what your saying "well ah, we'll just not tax it.." come on, we know very well that the government can't help its self, not to mention that if it is legalize that it will be done by a liberal and its in there nature to tax. Also when you legalize it you will be opening the flood gates to more and more users and consumers. And the ones that already do it will do it more; only making a larger consumer base for the organized crime, and will also allow for larger organized crime set ups, resulting in higher violent acts created by organized crime.

I know this was not addressed to me, but I feel like I should respond anyway. 1. Learn to use peoples names. It shows a little respect, and people might be a little more apt to return it in kind. Cheese Dude and Snake Dude are not screen names used on this forum. There are however Cheesejoff and Snakespit.2. Second, instead of telling people what is wrong with their posts, try telling them why you dissagree with their post. Arrogance is not a favorable quality in this setting. 3. If you never smoked pot, and have no first hand experience with it, where do you get your information from? I am just curious as to what sources you are looking at, and how objective the information presented by these sources is. 4. Suggesting that you are the only one here with common sense is rather myopic. What leads you to believe that the rest of us do not speak with common sense?

ah I see. So we take away the right of someone to do with their own body what they want to, unless they pay the government more money? Sound a little too much like bribery to you too?And how would clamping down on hard drugs be a good thing? How about we concentrate on the real crimes in our society, and let people kill themselves/ruin their lives if they want to. Why should I be spending tax dollars (ok, well hypothetically, pretend I pay taxes) to force someone else to not hurt themselves? Sound a little counter-productive? And then we complain about a defecit? (Obviously that's not the main culprit of spending, but you get the point).

It should be legalised as it's no more harmful than alcohol or tobacco.Not only that but many marijuana users end up going onto harder drugs through contact with their marijuana dealer. Lesgalising it would break that link and actually reduce the level of drug addicts overall.Furthermore you could tax it and put the money into more police to clamp down on hard drugs, which would be a good thing.

I believe that the taxation being spoken of here is simply for the people who would buy and partake of marijuana. By legalizing marijuana, our tax dollars used to prosecute and jail marijuana offenders could be put to better use. I think that is the point everyone is getting at. Marijuana is a soft drug, in my opinion less harmful to our bodies and society as a whole than alcohol. Users of marijuana are not people that typically make life difficult for others. Crackheads, heroin addicts, alcoholics, meth users, coke heads etc... generally are the people causing the biggest problems, and often people who commit many of the real crimes in our society. We could refocus our efforts at these people, and leave the harmless pot smokers alone. I for one would pay a little extra in the way of sales taxes to buy marijuana legally rather than buy it on the street illegally.

As well, why would lawyers and officers of the court want it legalized? The drug system is a money machine not only for the bad guys but for the "good" guys too.

Lawyers don't much care as possession busts for user amounts are now citations in most states with a shred of common sense, like a traffic ticket. Quantity, dealer and wholesale amounts, have gained the same level of distribution sophistication as alcohol did during that prohibition. With the exception of federal publicity busts, virtually anyone who wants pot can buy it from a very well-oiled and condoned system. LE is a different story. A large portion of their war on drugs federal funding is still tied to marijuana while meth creates their real problems, crimes against property and people. As usual, the feds are a day late and dollar short. As to the legalization of marijuana, I think its taxation potential will eventually override the morality and ignorance aspects. Most groups advocating legalization of pot have stayed with the civil liberty side of the argument. At the right time, as our economy continues its downward spiral, somebody will put numbers forth that look good to desperate politicians. With 34% of all Americans over the age of 12 and under 50 having tried marijuana, it's only a matter of time until common sense overcomes knee-jerk emotion and dogma.

As far as I can guess they wouldn't. Legalization would mean government control and sale, and a significant decrease in street sales of marijuana. After all, why buy it illegally and risk the penalty when you can get it legally? I can see no benefit of legalization for drug dealers.

So regulate and tax it so it costs $50 a dime bag. Then the price stays up, and the government gets the money instead of drug dealers. People would be more likely to grow it though.

Not that many people are inclined to be personal growers. When BATF and Ag get through with it, anyone will be able to sell it with a tax stamp. Big, powerful government agencies. Without the stamp, governments get real serious about tax sources. Like cigarettes and alcohol, an underground market will exist with legal pot.

That's rediculous. People would simply continue to get it on the street, and the dealers would thrive instead of withering. The idea would be to make it competitive with the prices currently found on the street, then the motivation to buy it from a government sanctioned agency would be to avoid criminal penalty by buying it legally. At $50 a dime bag (usually about a gram), you are talking of a price about $1500 per ounce. I don't know anyone in their right mind that would pay that much when you can currently find an ounce for $150-$300 depending on quality.

Your prices are correct and I still say most people would not be growers for even personal consumption. Who gets to legally grow it for commercial sale will be the real question. At $300/oz, that makes the average primo plant's buds worth a minimum of around $5k. It could get real cheap with legal competition.

Replacing marijuana prohibition with a system of taxation and regulation similar to that used for alcoholic beverages would produce combined savings and tax revenues of between $10 billion and $14 billion per year.Replacing marijuana prohibition with a system of legal regulation would save approximately $7.7 billion in government expenditures on prohibition enforcement-$2.4 billion at the federal level and $5.3 billion at the state and local levels.Revenue from taxation of marijuana sales would range from $2.4 billion per year if marijuana were taxed like ordinary consumer goods to $6.2 billion if it were taxed like alcohol or tobacco.http://www.taxfoundation.org/blog/show/530.html

US decriminalization of drug usage has always been a political hot button used by both sides of the political spectrum, both saying no. Due to the volume of US voters claiming to be morally motivated by Christian dogma, no sane politician would favor decriminalization when it (drug usage) is considered a moral sin by that voting block. The current definition of conservative right has been filled with, by definition, fascists who favor all forms of government contrary to traditional conservative values. Add current US administration governing methodology of fear to evangelical moral interpretations and the result is government by punishment, not resolution of social problems. So the US regresses in dealing with social problems as incarceration increases at record rates. A contemporary sociological Dark Ages by any standard.

Alright I see i've been getting some questions about how would the legalization of Marijuana creat more of a crime problem.You see the legalization of the drug would not go the same way as the end of prohibition did. We live in a very different world. The first thing that the government would do after legalizing it would be tax it and regulate it. Which i have heard no objection to from people on this forum. You see the only reason why the end of Prohibtion worked is because the responciblity was given to small businesses, and therefore organized crime was unable to compete. This would not be the case. Government would be in control and taxes would be imposed. Organized crime would be able to compete. They would produce a better product and at a cheaper price. Also the demand for this product would boom, because people would have easier access to it, and wouldn't fear any consiquences for possession of it. With this boom in demand will come a need to increase supply and market. Bringing more organized crime into our neighbourhoods. This is exactly what the police protest, and why they fear and consideration in government decriminalizing or legalizing the drug.I, like many others, want to go back to traditional family values. That means, encouraging the standard nuclear family, stop the unlimited access of pronographic matterial to children, honouring the defintion of marriage, and stop the flow of drugs from invading our neighbourhoods, and homes.

It worked for the rum-running Kennedy clan...made Papa RICH!!!Legalizing and taxing the sale of marijuana should not prevent people from growing their own for their own personal consumption. After all, it's not illegal to brew your own beer or make your own whiskey. It's just illegal to sell it.Most smokers would not go to the effort of growing quality pot. They would purchase it from licenced dealers who paid the taxes to the government for selling it.However, this (legalization) will NEVER happen because law enforcement and the lawyers make too much money off of it and they won't have it any other way.

Wouldn't small scale growing operations accomplish the same thing then?

Sort of like the cheap black market tobacco so widely available? Or that pervasive moonshine market we have today?What about legal growing for personal comsumption?

This difference there is that by the time the government started regulating and taxing those substances there was already a legitimit market and no black market, therefore the black market never had a chance to thrieve. No, because that still brings up other issues like druging and driving. There is not benefit to Marijuana for society, and it will only cause problems, so why allow it into society on a legitimat bases.

That makes no sense.There was a legitimate market for cocaine and opiates before government regulation. Conversely, there was no black market for alcohol prior to Prohibition, but one arose when alcohol was made illegal and it disappeared when Prohibition disappeared. It takes no time at all for a black market to arise; all you need is a demand for a product and laws against that product.

i never said it didn't, i said that there was no black market for those substances before the government started taxing them to death and regulating them. the substances aren't being taken away at all, they're just being made more expensive, and the people haven't really protested it, and therefore there has been no chance for a black market to thrieve off of these substances.

None, thats why i do neither. However, making those substance illegal would cause a huge protest. Once you give the people something like that and allow them to have it for decades it becomes almost in possible, in a democratic society, to take it away because the people will see it as taking away a right.

Nothing in the US other than terrorism has ever expanded domestic and international LE faster than moral legislation with serious political value in carrying out the wishes of a manipulated public that votes on representation. IMO Alcohol prohibition caused far less social structure damage than the potential of crystal meth. As US concentration of resources is currently on foreign policy, this illegal commodity will find negligible funding resistance to continued expansion of the already booming federal prison industry.

I object to taxing and regulating it. 1 objection. The government has no business telling us what we can eat/smoke/put in our body. They can tax it just like any other food or other product.If it isn't a crime to grow/sell marijuana, how would it be organized crime competing?Wait, demand would increase because of it being more accessible? Demand would go down. Most rare things have a higher demand.and how is it that you keep referring to marijuana salesmen (I guess that's what you'd call them) as organized crime?Prove it. My friend's dad is a police officer, and he is of the opinion that they should be focusing more on other criminals, not the ones trying to harm themselves. I understand not everyone thinks like that, but the police in general do not protest it.AKA my way is the only way and if I have to use the government to force it down everyone else's throat so be it.If you want to have traditional family values, go ahead. No one's stopping you. If you don't want to view porn, don't. If you want to honor marriage, do and don't get divorced, and if you don't like drugs, DON'T DO THEM. Drugs only affect the person taking them. Drugs "pouring" into neighborhoods isn't hurting you one bit unless a high person comes and tries to do something to you, in which case you call the police because they are actually committing a crime now as opposed to before when they were only affecting their own body.

Alright I see i've been getting some questions about how would the legalization of Marijuana creat more of a crime problem.You see the legalization of the drug would not go the same way as the end of prohibition did. We live in a very different world. The first thing that the government would do after legalizing it would be tax it and regulate it. Which i have heard no objection to from people on this forum. You see the only reason why the end of Prohibtion worked is because the responciblity was given to small businesses, and therefore organized crime was unable to compete. This would not be the case. Government would be in control and taxes would be imposed. Organized crime would be able to compete. They would produce a better product and at a cheaper price. Also the demand for this product would boom, because people would have easier access to it, and wouldn't fear any consiquences for possession of it. With this boom in demand will come a need to increase supply and market. Bringing more organized crime into our neighbourhoods. This is exactly what the police protest, and why they fear and consideration in government decriminalizing or legalizing the drug.I, like many others, want to go back to traditional family values. That means, encouraging the standard nuclear family, stop the unlimited access of pronographic matterial to children, honouring the defintion of marriage, and stop the flow of drugs from invading our neighbourhoods, and homes.

Thats fine, but thats not how its will go down. you know and i know the government will tax and regulate it. The people who are involved in organized crime, who sell the drug now will be the same people selling it then. They will still be involved in other acts of organized crime including violence.The people who want to do it, and those that already do it will do it more, causing a greater demand and force either government or more likely the organized crime sellers to create more supply.I already explained that oneGood for him, i have a diploma in Police Foundations. In that course every single one of my teachers was a retired police officer, all of who argee with my statments. Also in Canada when the Ontario government tried to decriminalize the drug there was spoken protest from police officers and police chiefs all over the province.Thats not true, like with alcohol, people will get behind the wheel of a car and end up killing themselfs or another.

Actually you and I know that it will never be legalized/decriminalized anytime soon, you just said so far no one had objected to it, well I object to it.And without being able to sell the drug these people involved in organized crime won't do anything else, but once they have the drug to sell, they will also be involved in organized crime including violence? Where's the correlation? Why aren't they committing the violence now?Wrong. People who already do it will not do it more. Prove it. Also the people who really want to do it will have already done it. It's still a drug, it can still harm you, but so can alcohol. And learn economics, more demand equals a higher price, not more supply. Although your premise that there will be an increase in demand is still flawed.OK, just wanted to let you know that all police officers aren't robots and follow 100% what other people tell them to do. Not all police officers are against legalizing marijuana.And that's the crime. Same with alcohol, drunk driving's the crime, NOT drinking. People are able to do marijuana and not drive, just as it's possible to drink and not drive. If they are driving under the influence of marijuana, it's still illegal. We just actually punish something that may harm other people rather than only harm themselves as you people for so-called "family values" seem to enjoy forcing your values on other people.

And so they should.Tax it, partly for consistency (there's huge tax on alcohol and tobacco, and it would be anomalous to omit MJ); partly to fund medical care of anyone harmed by it (which currently has to be funded from other taxation); and partly to price it beyond the reach of minors.Regulate it? Of course. Again, to restrict who can sell it and to whom (just like we do with alcohol and tobacco - protection of minors again); and to restrict the circumstances under which you're entitled to take it or be under its influence (not, for example, if you're an airline pilot with a flight departing in two hours, or if you're going to drive a car: we take this for granted with alcohol).Alert readers will note that I referred above to possible harm caused by taking MJ, which might seem an unusual admission from someone advocating its legalisation. Yes, it can be harmful: it's futile to deny that. So, I would argue, can playing body-contact sports.A general principle arises here, which I have not often seen debated: to what extent does a government have a right or a duty to prohibit its adult citizens from voluntarily participating in activities that may cause them harm?I don't have figures to back this up, but it's my guess that injuries sustained playing rugby cost the Health Service far more money, and lead to more person-days off work, than harm caused by MJ. Shouldn't the government, logically, ban rugby? And rock climbing? And any activity that may result in harm to the participant and subsequent cost to the economy?Well of course not: the cost to individual freedom would be huge; we would have the Nanny State, so derided by conservatives. When it comes to chemical recreation, though, conservatives seem to want Nanny to be as big and muscular as possible.

People fight, kids are programmed to be rebellious, and people are hardwired to enjoy sex. I've also had a hard time figuring out how MY family values in any way affect someone else.

I thought regulating it would be for example having to prove you're not about to fly a plane to buy it.

Are we going to force people to have jobs now? If they don't it might hurt the economy (which I may add is very vague)Yep, but I'm not holding my breath.

I’m a little confused with your first sentence, but I’ll do my best to clear that up. The people in organized crime will sell the drug whither its illegal or legal.

And no, its not different people, and you don't have one gang that just sells drugs, and then one gang that just commits violence. One gang will do both. So by making it easier for them to do one will only allow them to grow and more gangs will be introduced into the communities. Wrong. Are you telling me that people who do it won't do it more, regardless if it becomes more easily accessible? I don't think so. And there will be those who are unwilling to try it because of the legal consequences that will end up doing it. And saying it still can harm you only make me ask; why then? Yes alcohol can harm you to, but that’s not reason to start introducing other harmful substances. Hey, heroin can harm you and its addicting, but hey its the same with cigarettes. Also, there will be more demand because it will be more readily accessible, plus yes prices will rise, i never said they wouldn't. As you said that’s basic economics. And then demand will go down due to those higher prices.

I said I didn't see the difference in the violence that organize crime would commit whether or not they sold marijuana. Basically wouldn't they commit the same amount of violence with or without a marijuana ban?Yes, marijuana is extremely easy to get now. There was an article in our high school newspaper about it and I know people who've done it (obviously no hard proof, but you know what I'm talking about). Why would they do it more if it were legal? They can already do it as much as they want now, unless they care about the laws, in which case some people are dying as a result of the law.Do you understand economics at all? There is a balance. These don't happen in steps. The price and demand changes gradually. Prices will rise, people won't want it as much, and there will reach a balance where enough people will buy and the companies can maximize profits. BTW, still waiting for proof that demand would go up if it were legal.Again another wrong assumption. I am for legalizing anything that only harms the user, which includes pretty much all drugs.And that's the government's problem why? It's only a gateway drug because it's easy to get and illegal. Being alive is also a gateway drug to marijuana. Everyone who's done marijuana is alive, so why don't we kill them, then they won't do drugs? Unless there is a hard correlation (90% or more I'm thinking) between something (marijuana and harm to other people, marijuana and another drug that causes harm to other people, etc.) then you are punishing some people for the fact that other people can't control their urge for drugs. I would bet cigarettes are also a gateway to many drugs. But the tobacco companies have money, and politicians don't want to stop taking their money. Smoking and alcohol are both worse than marijuana. Why do we ban marijuana but not alcohol or tobacco?

If this is true (and it is by no means self-evident), then part of the reason is its illegal status. At present, if you want to smoke marijuana and don't grow your own, the person you buy it from is by definition a criminal. That being the case, this person may well be happy to offer you other illegal drugs as well.If, on the other hand, you could buy your marijuana from your local licensed store, no promotion of other drugs (apart from alcohol and tobacco) would be encountered.

But the majority of constables and high ranking officers object to it.I'm not forcing my values on anyone, I’m merely encouraging them. And before you go nuts say "yes you yes you, your forcing me not to get high".. Well unless you advocate the legalization of cocaine then your doing the same thing.Also, marijuana acts as a gateway drug. Now, now, I know how much you hippies hate that point “no its not no its not”, I’ve heard it before… although 10mins later the guy starts telling me about how he did meth and coke….. Obviously not everyone goes beyond marijuana, there’s always the exception, but a lot of people do. They have the high from marijuana and they want something stronger so they move on to a stronger substance. According to Dr.Margolis, Marijuana releases dopamine in the brain, much like cocaine and heroin. Not to mention that marijuana is addictive mentally. You crave it and that forces you to do it more and more. And I’ve this before to “ya but so it chocolate”, ya well chocolate doesn’t increase the chance of lung cancer or make you a XXXXX. That’s another thing; it rocks your short term memory, and de-motivates you. And I’ve seen it, people get “perma-fried”, and it’s pretty sad.

No because there would be a rise in organized crime establishments, therefore increasing the proabably gang related violence. Im sure there are those that care about the laws and don't want criminal records... after all, isn't that why people are suggesting the decriminalization of the drug in Canada?Ya i realize that perfectly... However there’s more in the equation, your forgetting about supply. If its is affordable they will increase the supply to accommodate for the demand at a desired price, as soon as it becomes unaffordable and supplies run low they will raise prices in order to regain supply. How am i suppose to show you actual proof when it hasn't been done yet, that’s why we're debating the out comes.I don't even know what to say to that... These products destroy peoples life’s, and hurt families as well. They bring organized crime, which also cause the deaths of innocent people, and none innocent people... people none the less.Because they're already in the system of society. It would be impossible to do ban those substances because they're already an commodity the people freely use and the people won't give them up. But saying that marijuana is no worse is no argument. Why introduce another harmful product into society?
attacks
I said I didn't see the difference in the violence that organize crime would commit whether or not they sold marijuana. Basically wouldn't they commit the same amount of violence with or without a marijuana ban?Yes, marijuana is extremely easy to get now. There was an article in our high school newspaper about it and I know people who've done it (obviously no hard proof, but you know what I'm talking about). Why would they do it more if it were legal? They can already do it as much as they want now, unless they care about the laws, in which case some people are dying as a result of the law.Do you understand economics at all? There is a balance. These don't happen in steps. The price and demand changes gradually. Prices will rise, people won't want it as much, and there will reach a balance where enough people will buy and the companies can maximize profits. BTW, still waiting for proof that demand would go up if it were legal.Again another wrong assumption. I am for legalizing anything that only harms the user, which includes pretty much all drugs.And that's the government's problem why? It's only a gateway drug because it's easy to get and illegal. Being alive is also a gateway drug to marijuana. Everyone who's done marijuana is alive, so why don't we kill them, then they won't do drugs? Unless there is a hard correlation (90% or more I'm thinking) between something (marijuana and harm to other people, marijuana and another drug that causes harm to other people, etc.) then you are punishing some people for the fact that other people can't control their urge for drugs. I would bet cigarettes are also a gateway to many drugs. But the tobacco companies have money, and politicians don't want to stop taking their money. Smoking and alcohol are both worse than marijuana. Why do we ban marijuana but not alcohol or tobacco?

No they would want to try other drugs because they would want to incounter a greater high... after all isn't that the reason for doing the drug?
attacks
If this is true (and it is by no means self-evident), then part of the reason is its illegal status. At present, if you want to smoke marijuana and don't grow your own, the person you buy it from is by definition a criminal. That being the case, this person may well be happy to offer you other illegal drugs as well.If, on the other hand, you could buy your marijuana from your local licensed store, no promotion of other drugs (apart from alcohol and tobacco) would be encountered.

Argue for legalization if you like, but don't say this, because this is simply not true.

Some people spend all their money (and their family's money) on cigarettes. Why are they legal? Oh yeah, I forgot about the tobacco companies.So would you be for a law saying that anyone currently under 18 can never smoke or drink, because they haven't been introduced to it yet?

All experience suggests just the opposite. As someone else has pointed out, there is no current mafia outlet for tobacco and alcohol. When there is a public demand for something illegal, as was the case for alcohol in the twenties and is the case for MJ now, of course organized crime will meet that demand. When the demand can be met through your local corner shop, there's no incentive for the mob to get involved in the commodity.Prohibition of alcohol made organised crime. Prohibition of other drugs keeps it in business.

The biggest for our local LE. Our sheriff says almost all of his federal funding is tied one way or another to marijuana with almost zip for crystal meth, the current problem drug. And every local LE person I know doesn't consider marijuana a dangerous drug.What's funny is our state government outlawed over-the-counter sale of some of the primary ingredients for cooking crank in an effort to combat it on the cheap. Yep, all those ingredients are now smuggled in, reducing local retail revenue and we've also experienced an increase of cheap Mexican crank on the street.Interestingly enough, OR is a state that allows personal pot cultivation for medicinal purposes by MD prescription. As those prescription holders are on record, DEA makes regular inspection rounds of their residences to make sure they aren't exceeding the legal limit of six mature and six immature plants. LE tax dollars at work. Everyone wonders how long it will be before the feds attempt invoking the sleazy interstate commerce catch-all to eliminate that states right. Since Ashcroft the Evangelist is no longer driving dark ages federal moral legislation, maybe there's a chance that won't happen.

I don't know how shielded you are from general society, but access to marijuana in every US city is virtually unlimited. In larger metropolitan areas defined drug territories have numerous street corners offering a drive-up supermarket selection of drugs including marijuana. The issue is not increased usage of marijuana by legalizing it, consumption/demand is already in place, but to save enormous law enforcement costs of enforcing antiquated moral legislation and deriving tax revenue from already thriving, currently illegal market supply and distribution. Why are you having problems grasping the reality of creating an illegal market inviting criminal activity by outlawing a substance?

Emphatically not, in this case. Access (supply) is not at present a limiting factor on MJ usage, as georged's post makes clear; this being the case, demand will not increase if supply is made easier. What prohibitionists never seem to take on board is that there is a demand for drugs such as MJ, and that demand consists not of degenerate sub-human junkies but of sane, normal, productive citizens who enjoy the occasional high. If legal sources don't meet that demand, illegal sources will.

Oh I've been waiting for someone to try to use that argument. The reason that marijuana was pegged a "gateway drug" is because most everyone who's tried harder drugs used marijuana first. However most everyone who's tried marijuana has tried alcohol and/or nicotene first. Does that mean alcohol is a gateway drug? Taking it even further, most everyone who has tried alcohol and/or nicotene has tried caffiene first. Does that mean caffiene is a gateway drug? I've used pot and have had no desire to use any harder drugs. 95% of the people I know who use or have used pot have never taken any harder drugs. Here in Alaska it is legal to grow and posess up to one ounce of marijuana for personal consumption. I promise you that a very large percentage of Alaska residents smoke pot on at least a semi-regular basis, and I promise you that you'd never be able to pick them out of a group. They look, act, and dress like anyone else. They have jobs like anyone else. They have kids. Many are business owners. Yet we don't seem to have the huge social problems with marijuana as you would predict. We haven't had any rash of organized or un-organized crime. We haven't had any increase in motor accidents. There hasn't been any public outcry to re-criminalize it. The involvement of alcohol in crimes still far outweighs the involvement of marijuana in crimes. The only real difference between here and any other state is that no-one has to worry about getting arrested for having a joint in their home. I quit smoking pot and drinking both completely of my own volition. It had not been having any sort of noticable effect on my health problems but I quit because I didn't even want to take the chance they could, and I didn't want symptoms and medication side-effects that I have been trying to keep track of to be clouded by effects from other substances. All of my doctors were aware of my usage before, and none of them had any reservations about it. I don't crave either one very much, but I miss alcohol more than I miss pot. I have no plans to take up either one again, even if pot were to go fully legal, and the idea doesn't bother me. I'd be pretty upset if I had to give up sugar for health reasons, but pot? Nah. I like it, sure, but I can take it or leave it. I really don't see what the big deal about it is, and I find it pretty telling that no-one else here who's used it before sees the big deal with it either. There's nothing wrong with not wanting to smoke pot, but there's nothing really wrong with wanting to either.

I’m a little confused with your first sentence, but I’ll do my best to clear that up. The people in organized crime will sell the drug whither its illegal or legal. And you don't see the correlation between violence and organized crime... your not serious right? People involved in gangs commit many different crimes, from drug selling to murder. And no, its not different people, and you don't have one gang that just sells drugs, and then one gang that just commits violence. One gang will do both. So by making it easier for them to do one will only allow them to grow and more gangs will be introduced into the communities. Wrong. Are you telling me that people who do it won't do it more, regardless if it becomes more easily accessible? I don't think so. And there will be those who are unwilling to try it because of the legal consequences that will end up doing it. And saying it still can harm you only make me ask; why then? Yes alcohol can harm you to, but that’s not reason to start introducing other harmful substances. Hey, heroin can harm you and its addicting, but hey its the same with cigarettes. Also, there will be more demand because it will be more readily accessible, plus yes prices will rise, i never said they wouldn't. As you said that’s basic economics. And then demand will go down due to those higher prices. However the sellers will increase their supply, in order to avoid having to raise those prices and lose demand because the higher revenue benefit. Who's telling them to do anything? lol I never said that some police don't care. But the majority of constables and high ranking officers object to it.I'm not forcing my values on anyone, I’m merely encouraging them. And before you go nuts say "yes you yes you, your forcing me not to get high".. Well unless you advocate the legalization of cocaine then your doing the same thing.Also, marijuana acts as a gateway drug. Now, now, I know how much you hippies hate that point “no its not no its not”, I’ve heard it before… although 10mins later the guy starts telling me about how he did meth and coke….. Obviously not everyone goes beyond marijuana, there’s always the exception, but a lot of people do. They have the high from marijuana and they want something stronger so they move on to a stronger substance. According to Dr.Margolis, Marijuana releases dopamine in the brain, much like cocaine and heroin. Not to mention that marijuana is addictive mentally.

I really don't see what the big deal about it is, and I find it pretty telling that no-one else here who's used it before sees the big deal with it either. There's nothing wrong with not wanting to smoke pot, but there's nothing really wrong with wanting to either.

Personally, if I have to come down on one side or the other I am against legalizing MJ. But honestly, because MJ in moderation, like drinking or smoking in moderation, can be controllable and is only somewhat damaging, I can live with it. I do not smoke because I find it disgusting and if we were meant to breathe fire, I believe we would. I do have a kind of quirky solution to how MJ could be legalized yet still regulated. The government has a large stockpile of illegal drugs through confiscating so much through the years. The govt could set up facilities that allow people to come in and smoke pot all they want for a much lower price than illegal MJ goes for today. This money would go straight to the govt so it is basically a maximum tax. By not privatizing MJ (and God help me this goes against every capitalistic idea I believe in) the government would be making very high profits, regulating the amount of drugs on the streets, and breaking the back of crime, particularly organized crime. Who would want to pay the current street price of MJ when they can go to a govt facility and get it for a fraction of the cost and garaunteed to be safe. The people stay at these facilities until they have sobered up enough to leave. This could be a winning solution and it might even work with harder drugs too. The mafia/druglords/drug rings would lose a huge source of income when they have to compete with the US govt. But this might be just some crazy, no-way-it-could-work idea.

Good grief, an outbreak of plain common sense. What is this forum coming to?Thank you, somnolence, you've pinpointed precisely the difference between the two sides of this debate. One side wants to control the other's behaviour; the other does not.

Get high at a government facility? Guaranteed to be safe? Sobered up enough to leave? You aren't really serious, are you?

Crazy? No-way-it-could-work? But it's exactly what did work in the US after alcohol prohibition was revoked: the mob's income from illegal booze dropped to zero. The same would happen to its take from narcotics if our respective governments were capable of adopting a grown-up, rational approach to the issue. I don't mean people having to go to some government facility to smoke - that will never work. I mean government-licensed but otherwise independent outlets for the purchase of mind-altering substances which you can take home and enjoy at your leisure; or other outlets licensed for the enjoyment of such substances on the premises. In the UK we have these already wrt alcohol - they're called off-licenses or pubs respectively. I believe you have the equivalent in the form of liquor stores and bars in the USA. Both provide a way for the government to monitor supply and consumption, and to police supply to minors.Come on, all you conservatives out there - cut the mafia off at its knees. Reject the nanny state and vote for freedom!

Core of truth in that, but as always, the situation is slightly more complicated. For starters most Dutch natives speak an intelligable level of English and are not shy of switching to it when facing foreign nationals. The old truism that one buys in his own language and sells in the language of the customer is understood.It's more that we Dutch are generally considered brand-loyal, so once a company or store has built up a customer base, it'll generally be allright (bar scandals, intolerably bad customer care or outrageously high prices), the result is that storeclerks aren't as obsequious as they may be in comparatable sectors in other countries where companies have to fight harder to keep their customers, add in that we already have a reputation of being some of the rudest, most direct people in the Western world and expats and tourists sometimes find the dealing with government and retail the most memorable event in their stay here, and not in a good way.

So true. When I was in Sweden a couple weeks before Christmas, I found it almost impossible to shop. The stores weren't open until ~11AM on SATURDAY, closed at least an hour for lunch and closed for the day by 3:00PM....and they weren't open on Sunday. During the week, they were open from 9 - 5.

America isnot supposed to be a copy off of all the other countrys, and it shouldnt. Just because its the popular law that something should or should not be done does not mean that it is the right law. In fact, if you knew anything about your own country, it was made FOR the freedoms which the rest of the world lacked, and slowly those freedoms are being taken away.And as for the harm... More harmful then tobacco? Where did you get this? Give some proof to back yourself up.The fact is, the THC in marijuana reduces the effects of cancer to the point that cancerous sicknesses coming from the marijuana (that means the weed itself- it doesnt include tobacco-caused cancer, etc) to a point that it would take 200 years to die from. Otherwise, it would take about 20,000 pounds of marijuana smoked in fifteen minutes to die from, which is due to the thickness of the smoke, not what the smoke came from.

What? Are you trying to claim that marijuana slows the progress of cancer? Or did you mean that it helps control symptoms related to the treatment of cancer? Just a little difference there. Being that you don't seem to know what you are talking about...I'm going to guess that you intended the former.

The estimated lethal human dose (LD50) of intravenous Marinol is 30 mg/kg (2100 mg/70 kg). Using this estimation of lethal dose, the equivalent inhaled THC would represent the smoking of 240 cannabis cigarettes with total systemic absorption of the average 8.8 mg of THC in each cigarette.In other words, the LD50 would be approximately 2112mg in one sitting. It is generally considered to be physically impossible to consume that much marijuana in 15 minutes or even and hour (believe me...i have tried emoticonXCool ). Therefore, the possibility of an OD on marijuana is nil. If you are going to try to make an argument, at least make sure your statistics are correct.

Marijuana prohibition is:1) A joke, everyone can get it anyway2) Disgustingly costly - because of how common marijunana is, enormous amounts of police resources are spent trying to police it (unsuccessfully). Jails are full of people whose crime is nothing more than selling or smoking a commonly available weed. Aside from the enormous monetary cost of policing and jailing these people, hard criminals are set free because the prison system does not have the capacity to keep both them and violent criminals inside.3) Harmful - because it is illegal, no one really knows what is in what they're smoking. Properly farmed, most the bad effects would be gone.

The cannabis that is going around today in its bud form is incredibly strong and can cause mental problems with users. The resin has got all sorts of poisonous rubbish in it so of course it should be banned.Anyway there is enough misery about with excessive alchohol consumption and cigarettes so why legalise this awful drug.

So to get the same high, you would smoke less of it. That is a good thing, as it minimizes the amount smoked and decreases exposure to the dangerous chemicals.Then by this rationalle you favor banning cigarettes, cigars, and pipe tobacco too, right?

if marijuana was legalthere would probably be fewer teensgetting addicted to itbecause half the fun is having to sneak around to smoke itif its legal whats the fun in that?it would also be so expensive and over taxed that nobody could afford it the weed farmers should be allowed to keep growing their cropsthen sell them to the government for a wealthy profit ,but of coursethe government would never let that happen if weed were legalized anybody in prison for weed related offenses could be released, which would benefit overcrowded prisons everywherewhich might also lower the crime rate in those prisons.. lol yeah right

The cannabis that is going around today in its bud form is incredibly strong and can cause mental problems with users. The resin has got all sorts of poisonous rubbish in it so of course it should be banned.Anyway there is enough misery about with excessive alchohol consumption and cigarettes so why legalise this awful drug. People who sell drugs on the street are just as bad and bring just as much misery to other people as violent criminals.

There are much better arguments against marijuana legalization than that. I've come to call the "loser" argument "noob logic", because low level players on MMOs often accuse higher level players of being losers or having no social life, normally because they're jealous (not saying that you envy stoners, of course). The "loser" argument is nothing more than an ad homenim and it can be applied to any internet regular. It's a fallacy.

legalize - yes.i could care less about what you do in your own home. i will continue to not smoke weed as i continue to not drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes. its excellent that we have a choice on certain things, not so excellent that we dont have a choice on other things, equally balanced.as for it being harmful, i have friends who smoke weed all the time and they seem alright. cigarettes are probably worse for your lungs and alcohol is probably worse for your brain - i dont know first hand... or second hand teehee.

I mean it is another problem just waiting to escalate in the nation. Think about it- teens having adults by drugs for them, they fail in school become criminals etc. We need to control this. The AMA has done lots of tests for long term effects, phycological ones. So were gonna throw away all we have done with anti drug programs, drug rehap , just to enforce it?

I've been watching pot smokers for decades. With very few exceptions they lose their initiative and zeal and become - for lack of a better word - slugs. Not only that but when you hang around pot smokers a good number of them always seem to have other drugs - uppers, downers, cocaine, etc. Pot is a gateway drug no doubt about it. It should not be legalized.In fact, just as soon as you legalize 'drugs,' there will appear new witches' brews which you will then have to address. It never ends.Better to get high on Jesus and the Holy Spirit.OK, let see - so far you're ok with sodomy and legalizing illegal drugs (marijuana). Didn't you claim to have an objective moral basis for your worldview?

I know plenty of people who have used cannabis, I'm not aware of any of them having tried anything beyond that. Cannabis is only a gateway drug in the same sense that tobacco or alcohol is - most people who try something harder will have tried cannabis in the past, just as they have tried alcohol and tobacco. That does not mean that those who try cannabis will inevitably try other things.For the record, I've never consumed cannabis in any form (except second hand), and have no intention of doing so. I don't smoke tobacco or drink alcohol either, but I have no intention of imposing my choice on other people.

When you have a room full of people smoking dope, somebody is always there saying, "Try this (or that)". I've seen it plenty of times. I've had people trying to push hard drugs on me. Some of them want you hooked so they can make money off you. Guys will try that with girls to get them high and in the sack. There's all kinds of that garbage going on when potheads are present.

Maybe it's the sort of people you hang out with, but I've never seen that. Most people I know who use cannabis have the odd joint of an evening in the same way others might have a bottle or two of beer, or they bake it in cookies or brownies to have at a party.

Yeah Easy, not exactly sure who you are hanging out with, but the people that I know who use marijuana typically are not the trouble-maker type. I have never seen anyone high on marijuana get violent, I have never seen them out robbing banks, and they don't typically ever try to push their maijuana on others. The people I know who use marijuana typically don't use other drugs, some don't even use alcohol (which is far more harmful than marijuana...yet somehow still legal). They are some of the most intelligent and creative people I know. Many of them hold down professional careers in many different industries.

absolutely. how often do you hear of someone smoking marijuana and then beating his wife? never. he would probably rather give her cuddles. but to be fair, there are people who try to push marijuana on others, theres always people who push anything onto others. theres people who try to push people into not drinking or smoking cigarettes. its just the people you choose to hang out with that matters. there are always some that will be completely cool with how you choose to live your life. those are the people i would rather hang out with. - philosophy moment.thats because marijuana is illegal! how often do you go to a wine tasting party and see waiters walking around going "excuse me sir, would you like to try this?" and offer them a line of coke? that would be hilarious but it doesnt happen. thats because marijuana is illegal! make marijuana legal and that will stop the weirdos from selling it in alley ways.you clearly have a misunderstanding of the effects of marijuana. someone who smokes weed will be conscious and aware, just slower and more calm than usual. so that wouldnt work if the girl didnt want to.and besides, how often do you hear of this instance happening with alcohol? all the friggen time! and that's legal.also, easyrider. just because i dont need a book to remind me whats right and wrong (i figured it out myself, thank you) doesnt mean i dont have an objective moral basis.

Wow. Great unbiased information brought to us by NARCANON, a for profit treatment center. I would say that they have a more than vested interest in exagerating half-truths and propogating outright lies about the most popularly used illegal substance in the world. Their treatment methods have been called into question time and time again, the actual success rate of their program has been found to be much lower than they claim. They have been repeatedly condemned by medical associations around the world. Their understanding of the science behind drug addiction has been called into question by the scientific community.Not sure what else I would expect from an organization with strong ties to scientology.

I've tried Pot a few times but I didn't take to it, Actually never did much drugs or drinking, but I think they should legalize it at least for medical reasons if nothing else. They allow the sale of Tobacco and alcohol and both of those are known to be bad for you. My opinion is that they probably would have legalized a lot of drugs by now if they could figure out a way to control it and Tax it. It's not so easy for just anyone to Grow tobacco or make alcohol so it can be regulated a bit more. Marijuana on the other hand can't be regulated and taxed like the others so they make it a crime rather than allow people to freely grow and smoke it. I think this country has way more problems to worry about other than who is smoking weed, so if it comes up on a ballot in my state I'll be voting yes, legalize it and move on to bigger problems.

Not really. Marijuana prohibition is big business. Drug companies, the FDA and the DEA the court system, jails and prisons, and to a smaller degree ICE/BP have a vested interest in seeking to keep pot illegal. The money wasted by our government in the war on drugs, and the profits that a select few are making off this war is obscene. Just more proof that our goverment is controlled by big business and a select few wealthy people.

I think it should be legalized along the lines of alcohol. Regulated and taxed, with recreational access in the privacy of one's own home or places that accommodate (like Amsterdam cafes).Still, I'm not surprised it didn't pass in California. Big money went into the opposition campaign, and when Americans vote nowadays, they are very prone to going with whoever can pay for louder advertising.Even if it's not in their best interests.They don't reflect enough on how they're being conditioned or manipulated by commercial advertising.

The side effects and "dangers" associated with using marijuana are negligible compared with most of these legal prescription drugs.

It's hard to believe that people still buy into the XXXX that our government says about marijuana. The only reason it is still illegal is money.

I don't think it needs to be a "prescription drug", even though that's what the drug companies are trying to do. It's funny how it seems to become acceptable if a large drug company sells it, but if you grow it at home...you're a criminal who is using a dangerous drug. It just goes to show how large greedy drug companies can manipulate government policy. Pharmaceutical Drugs Based on Cannabis - Medical Marijuana - ProCon.orgI support the right of people to use natural drugs as they see fit without interference of any kind from the government so long as they do it in their own home and refrain from placing anyone other than themselves at harm. If it is insisted upon that it only be made legal for medicinal use, I believe that those who are granted the right to use it medicinally should be allowed to grow it at home for their personal use if they wish.

I think you have more of a right to that view than me a Brit( although I dont necessarily think its right).This is because you pay for your own health care so you should be allowed to risk your health if you want.Why should I help pay for potheads ,junkies and alcoholics medical treatment when they brought it on themselves?In my experience prolonged use of cannabis changes people and not for the better.I know the same applies to alcohol but that does IMO condone the unrestricted use of cannabis .I know that it does have medicinal properties.My relation has MS and grows large amounts of cannabis which has helped relieve his condition more than anything he was prescribed( he was given some tablets with a cannabis derivative but these were too weak do do anything ,it seems).Now this bloke can smoke huge amounts of dope and not get stoned but other people I know are wrecks because of smoking it.So maybe your solution is right.

I don't believe that you should have to pay for others bad behavior, but this is simply an unavoidable consequence of taxpayer funded government healthcare. Cannabis can be abused just like any other drug, although it cn also be used recreationally by responsible adults with very little harm when compared with other currently legal drugs. One of the common misconceptions regarding legalization of marijuana is that everyone will use it. This is not supported by what we have seen in Portugal and the Netherlands. I wager that those who already use it would continue to use it. Those who don't already use it probably will not start. The real question we should be asking is what position is the greater benefit to society as a whole. I think we can all agree that prohibition does not work. Billions of dollars are spent every year in America's war on drugs...with a large percentage of it going to fight marijuana. Thousands of people are thrown into prisons, costing the states huge amounts of money per incarcerated inmate. Clandestine grows are taking over pristine forest causing danger to hikers and environmental damage to the native flora and fauna. Meanwhile, violent drug cartels and street gangs fight for control of the marijuana trade, and in the process often end up hurting innocent people. Legalizing marijuana and allowing people to home grow would save tax dollars, save our forests, and take the marijuana trade out of the hands of mexican cartels and street gangs. The DEA and other law enforcement could refocus efforts and money at stopping the flow, manufacture, and distribution of drugs that actually pose a significant danger to society. It shows great promise as a medicine, and I know people who benefit from it. I too know people who abuse it recreationally...some of them to the point that they don't do anything but sit around and get stoned all day every day. Most of the people I know who use it do so simply on a recreational basis every now and then, and they continue to be productive healthy members of society. BTW: does you relation actually smoke cannabis, or do they use a vaporizer. Vaporizers are a much healthier way of using cannabis. Same goes with oral consumption, which eliminates the health risks of smoking it.

I think you have more of a right to that view than me a Brit( although I dont necessarily think its right).This is because you pay for your own health care so you should be allowed to risk your health if you want.Why should I help pay for potheads ,junkies and alcoholics medical treatment when they brought it on themselves?In my experience prolonged use of cannabis changes people and not for the better.I know the same applies to alcohol but that does IMO condone the unrestricted use of cannabis .I know that it does have medicinal properties.My relation has MS and grows large amounts of cannabis which has helped relieve his condition more than anything he was prescribed( he was given some tablets with a cannabis derivative but these were too weak do do anything ,it seems).Now this bloke can smoke huge amounts of dope and not get stoned but other people I know are wrecks because of smoking it.So maybe your solution is right.

I think I understand what you say but I still see a problem of the legal home growing and selling(which some will) of marijuana( sorry not cannabis..thats a bit harder to make lol).Although I agreed with you about people prescribed it being allowed to grow it I see a problemI see it in the same way of legal home distilleries.If people were allowed to distill liquor in their homes and sell it then cheap gutrot and potentially dangerous booze would be available to anyone who wants to buy it.Im not sure whether that would be a good thing.The same goes for allowing home grown marijuana.It would be foolish not to sell some marijuana if you could grow it at home so there would be a lot of it around to buy.In the UK there was a huge rise in ' home grown' bud a few years ago.Home grown being bud that was grown in houses rented by Vietnamese gangs.This stuff was White Widow and Chronic which as you may know is pretty strong stuff if its grown well.I cant see loads of this stuff around being a good thing especially if even more stronger strains are developed and once the law is changed it would be near impossible to get control.One good thing I suppose would be the possibility to get rid of some of the worst solid .Ive seen quite a few bits of plastic in that XXXX. God knows what else was in it.So I dont see the legalisation of marijuana as necessarily a good thing but one we could not reverse if it becomes as bad as I suspect it would ie minors toking big spiffs or bottle bongs and growers competing to grow cheaper and ever powerful dopeI cant smoke it because I will hit the deck if I am not careful.I used to eat it in cakes but you can consume a lot of it in a cake and it would make me trippy for about 48hrs but that does not mean I would just want to deny it to others because it wasnt for me.One of my friends would swear by it to kill pain and as said it took a lot of the symptoms of MS away from my relation.He would have about 12 big spliffs a day and had a constant sore throat.Ive never seen anyone who could smoke so much weed ..about two tokes of his spliff would send me to sleep lol.I havent seen him for a few years but I know he is still around so he probably is still toking.If you mean by vaporiser a bong then I have had one but I dont think he did.I suppose like everything else its all about moderation but I can see legalising weed causing as much problems as it cures.

I don't believe that you should have to pay for others bad behavior, but this is simply an unavoidable consequence of taxpayer funded government healthcare. Cannabis can be abused just like any other drug, although it cn also be used recreationally by responsible adults with very little harm when compared with other currently legal drugs. One of the common misconceptions regarding legalization of marijuana is that everyone will use it. This is not supported by what we have seen in Portugal and the Netherlands. I wager that those who already use it would continue to use it. Those who don't already use it probably will not start. The real question we should be asking is what position is the greater benefit to society as a whole. I think we can all agree that prohibition does not work. Billions of dollars are spent every year in America's war on drugs...with a large percentage of it going to fight marijuana. Thousands of people are thrown into prisons, costing the states huge amounts of money per incarcerated inmate. Clandestine grows are taking over pristine forest causing danger to hikers and environmental damage to the native flora and fauna. Meanwhile, violent drug cartels and street gangs fight for control of the marijuana trade, and in the process often end up hurting innocent people. Legalizing marijuana and allowing people to home grow would save tax dollars, save our forests, and take the marijuana trade out of the hands of mexican cartels and street gangs. The DEA and other law enforcement could refocus efforts and money at stopping the flow, manufacture, and distribution of drugs that actually pose a significant danger to society. It shows great promise as a medicine, and I know people who benefit from it. I too know people who abuse it recreationally...some of them to the point that they don't do anything but sit around and get stoned all day every day. Most of the people I know who use it do so simply on a recreational basis every now and then, and they continue to be productive healthy members of society. BTW: does you relation actually smoke cannabis, or do they use a vaporizer. Vaporizers are a much healthier way of using cannabis. Same goes with oral consumption, which eliminates the health risks of smoking it.

There already is a lot of it around to buy. The problem being that a large majority of what is around to buy is being sold by gangs and cartels. I would rather grow my own than support gangs and cartels. And yes, some people who home grow in the US do sell some of the cannabis that they grow. If I was going to use cannabis and was unable to grow it myself, I would rather buy it from a trusted friend than to buy it off the street knowing that I am supporting violent gangs and/or cartels. Home grown: meaning cannabis grown in one's own home for personal consumption. I'm not sure what you said here.Minors already "toke big spiffs"...(I think you meant to say "spliffs"). People already make bottle bongs. Growers are already growing more powerful "designer" cannabis. Look up a marijuana seedbank online...you can find seeds for just about any kind of cannabis that you want. The things you are worried about happening if cannabis was to be made legal are already happening. You're a bit behind the times if you don't already realize that marijuana is everywhere. Prohibition has failed, the war on drugs has failed, and the government is simply wasting money tryingto pretend that they are making a difference. At some point, we just need to admit the truth. As with any drug, knowing how much you are taking is important. Knowing your response to any drug is also important. It's part of the whole "responsible use" idea. 12 joints a day would give anyone a sore throat. That's not healthy. If someone is going to use cannabis for a medicinal use at such high levels, it makes a who lot more sense to consume it orally rather than smoke it. Smoking anything is bad for you. .No, I meant a vaporizer. A bong is used to smoke marijuana, not vaporize it.

First off...I have a problem with the phrase "potentially dangerous substance". Marijuana is not dangerous in the acute. There is long term risk associated with heavy cannabis use (ie. respiratory disease)...but far less than many currently legal substances. Again...not sure what that first sentence even means. All marijuana is grown. Home grown means growing your own marijuana. You've found plastic in cannabis resin? How? Are you some sort of chemist? Do you work in a lab? Or is it possible that you once bought some cannabis and got crappy stuff? Legalization of cannabis would only lead to increased quality of product. As it stands currently, Mexican cartels and street gangs are only concerned with profit...not quality. On a losing strategy...absolutely. Neither does that which comes from cartels and street gangs. Any time you take a drug, it is always advisable to start out with a minimal amount, until you know what effect it has on you. Marijuana is no different. Also, many of the medical marijuana dispensaries in California do actually display the TCH content of every strain that they sell. They go to great lengths to assure purity, quality, and absence of mold, mildew, fungus, and pests. This is a perfect example of what happens when you bring cannabis out of the shadows and into the mainstream. Then I submit that you know little about marijuana.

I won't argue that there can be effects from long term heavy use...just like any other drug. But what is this "acute risk" that you speak of?What is a "lump of solid"? If you're finding plastic and other unidentifiable bits in your bag of weed, you probably need to look for better weed. Because the majority of weed that is being dealt on the streets by gangs and cartels is junk. They spray pesticides all over it, they use chemical fetilizers to grow it, they simply don't care what is in it or what is has been exposed to. Their only motivation is to make a profit. If it were legalized for home grow, most people who grow would be far more meticulous about what they expose their marijuana to. And if it were to be sold in stores, those running the stores would have an interest in selling a clean product from a trusted grower. Pitty. Or perhaps adopt a new strategy? Obviously, prohibition of marijuana has been a failure. Perhaps regulation, sale, taxation? Refocus our war on drugs towards drugs that present a serious threat? uh...both?I would have no problem with marijuana being sold OTC in stores to adults. As per the US constitution, that should be a state decision. And why can't I have both? I can brew my own beer. I can grow my own tobacco. Why can't I grow my own marijuana?

I do agree that marijuana can lead to earlier development of mental illness in people that use it during early adolescence, but I believe that most often these are people with underlying mental illness in the first place. Many scientist and psychologists have raised the question if these teens are using marijuana in an attempt to "self medicate". At any rate, the current policy of prohibition does not seem to keep marijuana out of the hands of our youth. In fact, it most likely makes it far more available. It sure is a good thing that I don't advocate the use of marijuana by children...isn't it? First off, I would never buy anything from "anyone". If I were going to buy something, I would get it from someone I know and trust. Second, if you are talking about just plain resin...a black, almost tar-like chunk of material...why would anyone smoke that in the first place? What is commonly known as "resin" by most marijuana smokers is the residue that is left over after combustion of marijuana. It is a sticky tar-like substance that they scrape from the inside of their pipes and bowls. It has a relatively high THC content. I follow a general rule in life: If I can't identify it, I leave it alone. It's not about them giving up drug trading or getting a proper job. I could care less what they do. The reason drugs are in the hands of gangs and cartels is that they are illegal. Perhaps it is a difference between the US and GB that you just don't see. Over here, a majority of marijuana is smuggled up from Mexico and South America by cartels, and then sold by gangs. Needless to say, their practices are less than admirable. There are growers in California and Colorado (just to name a few) that sell their products to cooperatives and dispensaries for the medical marijuana industry. They are above ground, tax-paying citizens who don't carry guns, don't shoot people in drive-by's, don't sell their drugs to kids, and don't fund any such violence through the sale of their products. If dispensaries were legally allowed to sell to adults...where do you think that the vast majority of Americans would buy their marijuana from? It's not about what the criminals do, it's about what we do to the criminals. Brigning marijuana above ground would put them out of business. Believe me...street gangs and drug cartels do not want to see marijuana legalized.No we buy our liquors from stores...in my state, I get it from state government run stores. The point was that you stated that it would be cheaper to make them at home rather than buy them in stores, and I agree, it would. Despite this fact, there is little competition for home distilled alcohol in the US. Most of us prefer the convenience, selection, and quality that comes from large scale above ground distillaries. However, the government is not knocking in doors when people home-distill a little alcohol. And I don't know about you, but some of the best beer I have ever had has been home-brewed beer. I just finished brewing a lovely stout...dark, complex, chocolatey, with just a hint of warm holiday spice notes. I'm going to try the same recipe again, but use more honey this time in the wort. The differences: These are drugs made in a lab. Marijuana is a plant I can grow in my back yard. Nobody ever overdosed on marijuana. Plenty of people have overdosed on the drugs you mentioned. You're comparing a bottle rocket to a bunch of land mines. Simple logic tells me I can. Something tells me that the quality of marijuana grown organically in a greenhouse by a reputable gorwer is going to be better quality than that which is sprayed with chemical pesticides and fertilizers and who know's what else, and is smuggled into the country in gas tanks or the asscrack of some Mexican drug runner. Cartels don't care about spider mites in their finished product, a reputable grower does. True. One is a plant that I can grow in my back yard that I can cook with, consume alone or with other food products, or place in mason jars and save for later. The other tastes good on salad.

So you concede that marijuana can lead to mental illness in children..whether it it underlying or not is immaterial just as developing cancer from cigarettes does not mean one jot to the victim if they have a ' underlying' tendency to develop cancer.Many scientists and psychologists have raised many questions about a lot of things.I agree the curent policy does not seem to keep marijuana out of childrens hands.I believe the same goes for other even more dangerous drugs..maybe we should make ketamin,crack and ecstasy legal..maybe even angel dust..is there are market for angel dust?You dont advocate it but want to make it as easy or easier for children to obtain it in the future..I dont see much differenceGood for you.You can call the substance what I described whatever you like.I call it solid....Ill leave a space...............As aboveAs long as it doesnt affect you...Any free growing and selling marijuana will lead to less than admirable practices . Thats just the way it is.Potheads selling to potheads =less than admirable practicesFrom the guy down the road who grows his own pot in a garage or from a bloke on a street corner..if the price was right.Only selling pot from legal dispensaries would be the lesser of two evils though.Neither do I.Where the gangs and I differ is on the penalty of selling illegal drugsProbably because the amount of people doing it is negligable..but I am only assuming thisSome of it is palatable but most of it tastes like XXXX.Define overdosed.Apparently nobody has overdosed on LSD insofar that they died through LSD poisoning.Im comparing dangerous drugs with dangerous drugs.How do you guarantee that the product is as good as you say without a quality control inspection?Lol;)

The reason drugs are in the hands of gangs and cartels is that they are illegal. Perhaps it is a difference between the US and GB that you just don't see. Over here, a majority of marijuana is smuggled up from Mexico and South America by cartels, and then sold by gangs. Needless to say, their practices are less than admirable. There are growers in California and Colorado (just to name a few) that sell their products to cooperatives and dispensaries for the medical marijuana industry. They are above ground, tax-paying citizens who don't carry guns, don't shoot people in drive-by's, don't sell their drugs to kids, and don't fund any such violence through the sale of their products. If dispensaries were legally allowed to sell to adults...where do you think that the vast majority of Americans would buy their marijuana from? It's not about what the criminals do, it's about what we do to the criminals. Brigning marijuana above ground would put them out of business. Believe me...street gangs and drug cartels do not want to see marijuana legalized.No we buy our liquors from stores...in my state, I get it from state government run stores. The point was that you stated that it would be cheaper to make them at home rather than buy them in stores, and I agree, it would. Despite this fact, there is little competition for home distilled alcohol in the US. Most of us prefer the convenience, selection, and quality that comes from large scale above ground distillaries. However, the government is not knocking in doors when people home-distill a little alcohol. And I don't know about you, but some of the best beer I have ever had has been home-brewed beer. I just finished brewing a lovely stout...dark, complex, chocolatey, with just a hint of warm holiday spice notes. I'm going to try the same recipe again, but use more honey this time in the wort. The differences: These are drugs made in a lab. Marijuana is a plant I can grow in my back yard. Nobody ever overdosed on marijuana. Plenty of people have overdosed on the drugs you mentioned. You're comparing a bottle rocket to a bunch of land mines. Simple logic tells me I can. Something tells me that the quality of marijuana grown organically in a greenhouse by a reputable gorwer is going to be better quality than that which is sprayed with chemical pesticides and fertilizers and who know's what else, and is smuggled into the country in gas tanks or the asscrack of some Mexican drug runner. Cartels don't care about spider mites in their finished product, a reputable grower does. True. One is a plant that I can grow in my back yard that I can cook with, consume alone or with other food products, or place in mason jars and save for later. The other tastes good on salad.

No, I do not concede that. I agreed that I believe marijuana can expose underlying mental illness, or hasten the symptoms of mental illness, but I do not believe it causes mental illness, nor do I believe that if these mentally ill people had never used marijuana that they would never have become mentally ill. Correlation vs. causation. You have no hard evidence to support your theory, I have no hard evidence to support mine. What I can say is that I do not advocate the use of marijuana by minors, and I believe that prohibition places children at greater risk to be exposed to marijuana. No, I do not want to make it easier for children to get marijuana in the future, and I believe I have made that clear. I believe that the current system of prohibition makes marijuana more available to children, due to unscrupulous dealers who only want to make a profit. And furthermore, I believe that seperating marijuana from hard drugs such as you listed will decrease exposure to these hard drugs. I work in an envronment where I see drugs all the time. The same guy on the corner that deals pot can also get you crack, meth, coke, or just about anything else you want. It's a no brainer that if people are buying their marijuana at a dispensary, they wouldn't need to be exposed to dealers like this anyway. Gangs and cartels affect all of us. I just want them to go away. As I have explained before, it is the war on drugs and the policy of prohibition that keeps them in business. I was talking about the violence that cartels and street gangs deliver day after day. Perhaps you don't see such in you little kingdom over there, but I see gang violence almost daily at work. I've never known a "pothead" to shoot another "pothead" who was buying marijuana from him. If legalized, marijuana sold at disrensaries could be cheaper than what is currently available on the black market. Any time you make something illegal and push it underground, you increase it's value to those who want it. If I were going to buy marijuana, I would still rather pay a few bucks more to buy it in a safe environment like a dispensary from someone I trust than to go out and take my chances with the armed gang banger on the street.If you want to insist that it is an "evil". If marijuana were taken out of their hands, most would no longer be around. Hmmm...lock people up for causing problems, or make them vanish and eliminate the problems. Hmmmm....Probably not. It's because the majority of people who do home distill don't sell their product. They use it themselves, or share it with friends on a social basis. To each his own. Overdose simply means "excessive dose". And yes, actually it is thought that one person (perhaps 2) has died from an LSD overdose, but it requires extraordinarily high doses, and is not easy to do. I am thinking in terms of the work that I do, where overdose means to seriously places one's life at risk via ingestion of a drug or chemical.Many dispensaries do their own quality control. Simple testing is available through labs and much testing can be done right in the dispensary with a few basic tools. But again, simple logic tells us that if marijuana can be cultivated legally, the practices used to grow it will improve. I know a few people who grow their own, and they go t great lengths to ensure that they grow healthy plants organically with no disease or infestation. Government inspection would only add one more wasteful government beaurocracy to the payroll. That's the last thing we need. Lol;)[/QUOTE]

So you concede that marijuana can lead to mental illness in children..whether it it underlying or not is immaterial just as developing cancer from cigarettes does not mean one jot to the victim if they have a ' underlying' tendency to develop cancer.Many scientists and psychologists have raised many questions about a lot of things.I agree the curent policy does not seem to keep marijuana out of childrens hands.I believe the same goes for other even more dangerous drugs..maybe we should make ketamin,crack and ecstasy legal..maybe even angel dust..is there are market for angel dust?You dont advocate it but want to make it as easy or easier for children to obtain it in the future..I dont see much differenceGood for you.You can call the substance what I described whatever you like.I call it solid....Ill leave a space...............As aboveAs long as it doesnt affect you...Any free growing and selling marijuana will lead to less than admirable practices . Thats just the way it is.Potheads selling to potheads =less than admirable practicesFrom the guy down the road who grows his own pot in a garage or from a bloke on a street corner..if the price was right.Only selling pot from legal dispensaries would be the lesser of two evils though.Neither do I.Where the gangs and I differ is on the penalty of selling illegal drugsProbably because the amount of people doing it is negligable..but I am only assuming thisSome of it is palatable but most of it tastes like XXXX.Define overdosed.Apparently nobody has overdosed on LSD insofar that they died through LSD poisoning.Im comparing dangerous drugs with dangerous drugs.How do you guarantee that the product is as good as you say without a quality control inspection?Lol;)

Its a pity the tobacco companies never thought of that one.All those smokers who got lung,throat, mouth cancer,emphysema would have got the diseases anyway.That wouldnt of worked for them and it doesnt work for you.You made it clear that by allowing anyone to grow cannabis somehow children will have less access to it...?Yes they would buy their pot at the dispensary and buy their crack on the street corner.Why not let them buy their crack at the dispensary too?Save them a walk...sheeshOf course those gang members would have to get a real job if you deprive them of selling a few ounces of pot a day.You live in a real tough hood and we Brits live soft a little kingdom ..give me strength, I would be offended if that wasnt so ridiculous.Please tell those dealers to stop shooting their customers.lolThere are plenty of gangs guns and violence in Britain...not as much as YOU have of course lolAs I said selling from dispensaries is preferable than allowing a free for all but if you sell from dispensaries and still allowed people to grow pot then there still would be the capacity to grow and sell and anyone who grew a bit of extra to sell will ALWAYS be able to undercut the dispensaries or grow a more powerful variant than the dispensaries sell.So unless you are saying you prohibit home grown then you really dont have a case and if you say we should prohibit home grown pot we are back to where we startedIf your child became mentally ill through smoking pot then you would think it evil...as said as long as it doesnt affect you.And no I haventIf you think legalising pot will make the gangs go back to college then there is not much point in arguing with youOr its illegal to sell home made liquorIts thought but not proved...and if the most possible fatalies are 2 then LSD must be nearly as safe as pot and far safer than alcohol.....or maybe notWhat is to stop the homegrower selling marijuana that was cultivated badly?What we should do is assume all home growers are stand up guys because they do not belong or could not possibly belong to a gang.Therefore anything they sell would be high quality.........[/QUOTE][/QUOTE]
