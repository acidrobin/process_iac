Those Who Abort Them Know Otherwise.I posted this on Youdebate, but as this is becoming more popular, I'll post it here too.---Some people call an early concieved baby just a fetus or bunch of cells early on. That is their view.But this question makes me wonder if they don't say this just to ease their conscience. "If it is just a bunch of cells, why do they abort it?"I think some people will agree that the fetus is a living thing. But I have never heard of a couple who didn't want a baby look at it and say: "Oh, it is really just a bunch of cells. Why not wait a while before it starts looking like an actual human just to make sure?"This one particular arguement infuriates me. If they're going to abort the baby, I say go ahead. But don't start calling a little child not a human being. The woman knows darn well it is a human being and that is why she has it aborted.The little children are the future of america. Well they don't have much future if they can't even get the respective title of "Human Being" just because they're young. I've seen aborted babies at just six weeks and they look an awful lot like a regular baby. Just a ton smaller.Every person reading this post (including you ;-) ) was a baby just like that thing. You were just as much alive then as you are now. If you truly weren't living, than how do you explain yourself now? Life doesn't come from non-organic material.I've smiled before because my Mom chose life for me and my ten brothers and sisters instead of making excuses like this. She went through a lot of pain and financial cost and worry. But there is no baby out there that isn't all these things. I think more women (Or adolescent girls who get into sex early in life) would choose to let their child live if they saw what a baby truly looks like and what a baby truly is. They wouldn't look at early babies like they were nothing more than an inert bunch of matter.So my question is this. Why don'y they call those bunch of cells a baby? Do they:1. Do it because they believe it really is a babyor2. Do it because it eases their conscience when they kill it?

Early Fetus Not A Human?

They are human fetuses. But not a person as yet.There are human sperm and eggs, dog sperm and eggs, etc. When you say that they are human you are merely indicating the origin of the eggs and sperm. Human versus feline or canine or whatever.

aww yes,The Person v. Human arguement. This is more of a word game to justify rather than describing reality. I often ask the question...if you are pro-choice...then why do you feel it is your job or the mothers job to determine if someone else is deserving of human rights that a person has? This might be "begging the question" but don't we have to? If not, then I could say John Smith is not a person and thus it is ok to kill him. Any reasonable person would find this crazy and say "well of course he is a person". What makes you so sure? What gives you the authority to make such a call? Who are you to tell someone else they are not a person deserving of rights?I suppose you can play words games all day though...but whether you call the unborn a fetus, human, person, dog, cat, goat doesn't really matter because he/she doesn't change based on a word.The unborn deserves life because you deserve life as well. We are all of the same kind and for whatever reason, we believe our kind is worthy of natural rights.

I believe that most women aren't in denial about what they are aborting. I haven't heard any women who have had an abortion call it "a bunch of cells". I haven't heard any women post abortion not consider it a "human being". I have heard the term "fetus" more than "baby". This could be because 1. Eases their conscious or 2. It's a 'more correct' scientifically phrase. (up for debate with some)With the women I've talked to, if they've had an "early on" abortion they feel less like it was a baby and more like it was an unknown that lacked personification b/c it lacked personality, they couldn't feel it, they didn't "show", they didn't allow themselves to name it, use their imagination over what kind of person it would grow up to be, etc. Denial? Perhaps.I think it's a choice they make in their best interests, and they have to come to terms with their conscience. If they cannot come to terms with their conscience regarding having an abortion, then they have the child.

I have heard the arguement of "a bunch of cells, not a person" from men and women. Perhaps women who have abortions don't speak of it as much, but it still seems to be used by pro-abortion people. They try to justify this idea because the young fetus is the only arguement view they can fall back on in such a debate. At least, that is what I've seen.A fetus is not a fully developed person. So what? What difference does that make? emoticonXConfused They are still a person, and it should be just as much a crime for killing it as any person outside its mothers womb.And when I talk about abortions, of course, I am talking of humans. Please, at least try to avoid including dogs or other animals in this debate, it usually ends up with vulgar comments. And I won't equivocate animals with humans either.

Well, I wish I could change your view.Perhaps some pictures of babies at say... 6 weeks or so would convince you that they're a person? I mean, maybe it won't change you're mind about them being a person till they're born, but perhaps the fact that they look like babies may make you think differently?

What if I want to say you aren not a person until you are 1yr old?

Exactly. The original post smacks of someone who has a limited understanding of this most complex issue. No serious discussion speaks of things like "bunch of cells" or quibbles about the words we use to discuss the unborn. These are the thoughts of someone who spouts what someone else told him, or what he read somewhere and is devoid of critical thought. Mostly, as Simone suggests, this is someone who has never had to address this issue on even close to a personal basis. I am continually shocked how men (I am male) profess to have such an intimate understanding of a situation they could never experience.

This is the biggest fallacy done of these forums. Being male has nothing to do with it because I know many females with the same views as me and the original poster. So right there your arguement is irrelevant. Even more so though, we all understand the situation because we were all once a fetus. I guess, by your own admission, that if you are white you can't say slavery is wrong with any authority. Furthermore, if you were supposed to be aborted and were not yet you are a male you have no say in the issue. LOGICAL FALLACY

To those who are pro-life, I pose this set of questions:If a embryo were conceived that had no mind or soul and would never develop a mind or soul (so it would ONLY be a living human body with "nobody home"), would you still have objections with a woman aborting that embryo? If yes, why?If no, then what are the main differences you would see between that situation and a typical pregnancy? If you think that there is a mind or soul in the earliest embryo (right after conception), then why do you believe this? Otherwise, do you think that one should not abort an early embryo because it will someday have a mind or sould?

Steveeeeee, All I am saying is that men certainly have a different, less personal and intimate perspective than women about pregnancy. I am not saying men cannot have an opinion about the legality of abortion. You misunderstood me. You can disagree with that, but the statement is not logically fallacious or irrelevant. I can understand if you are saying as a human being you are entitled to an opinion, but are you saying you remember being a fetus? As for slavery, I could rightfully say that I cannot know as a white person, the experience of being a black slave under white people or to be a descendent. That doesn't stop me from feeling that slavery is abominable. Now there is an illogical statement. (logical fallacy! logical fallacy! nyah-nyah!)Your last sentence, Furthermore, if you were supposed to be aborted and were not yet you are a male you have no say in the issue.",mystifies me. Could you clarify this?

It's true I am a male, but how does that relate at all? Any man can have a say in this matter and so can a boy. It's like saying unless you've been killed, you can't say anything against the murderer who killed someone else. You don't know what it felt like, how can you complain?I happen to know that pro-choicers seem to think that 16 year old girls who get pregnant early on can have a say and even make a decision regarding this issue. Simply because I cannot get pregnant and that I'm male makes no difference.And my world is hardly limited. I can't avoid this abortion issue anywhere I go. The newspaper, the internet, it's everywhere. I know a lot more than you assume and remember this. I am the fourth in a family of eleven children. I know what things go on during pregnancy and labor and birth. I have had seven brothers and sisters born after me. Would you like to withdraw that little assumption?Whether Michelle agrees with me or not doesn't mean I can't debate this. If she thinks I'm not worth debating or thinks I'm too young to try and convince her otherwise, she can leave.

Well, if you're talking about this as a reason to make ALL abortions illegal, I would probably say get rid of abortion anyway. There are very few abortions made for that circumstance.And besides, you can never know whether a baby would never have a mind.

A 'baby' (or anything) without a brain has no mind - seems obvious to me if you wanted to find a fairly consverative estimate at when a developing fetus has a mind you would look at when the brain has developed. Souls can't be brought into this debate, something religious or metaphysical should not be allowed to be involved in legislation.

You are missing the point of the question. I am simply trying to get to the core reasons about WHY pro-life people think abortion should be illegal. My personal view is that abortions should be illegal (with the usual exeptions of risk to mother's life, etc.) from roughly the third trimester on (and allowed before that) since Science seems to tell us that this is the earliest point when the higher brain functions of thought and emotion can start to emerge. I find it hard to have much sympathy for a very early fetus since there is "nobody home" that I can have sympathy for - it is still just a body then that will someday have a mind. I was simply asking these questions to see what the views of pro-life people are on this matter. So, what is YOUR view on this? Namely, when do you think an embryo / fetus / baby first starts to have a mind or soul, and why do you believe this?

If you are killed, no matter how early, then someone has deprived you of your right to live. Rights or not, it is wrong and its an injustice to human life to allow killing.

As I mentioned on the other thread, if you want to know the real reason a lot of people make the distinction you should try to define 'human' for us. You'll see then why a lot of people don't consider that a good enough reason to ban abortion.

Your world is not limited? You fail to mention that you have ever known a woman or couple facing the issue of an unwanted pregnancy. Announcing that you belong to a family that didn't seem to employ birth control is hardly something I would use as a stance from which to have an unbiased or worldly opinion.Also, you're 16 for god's sake, of course your world is limited.

I hope that one day you will talk to some actual people who've had unplanned pregnancies to increase your world view.In another thread you said that the "irresponsible girl or woman is obligated to take care of it" yet you make no mention of the obligation of the father. Of course males are entitled to their opinion, but why, if, according to you, they aren't under any obligation to take care of their progeny- do they get to legislate women's reproductive rights? I don't really think you mean this-I just want you to think out the father's role in this whole scenario before claiming that the "irresponsible girl or woman" is obligated to do anything.16 year old girls "get a say" and make decisions about this issue because it directly involves their bodies. I don't understand what you mean. Of course you get your say. If you are part of an unplanned pregnancy, wouldn't you want a say? Would you want me here, a woman you've never met, to decide your fate?

The trouble with trying to change the definition of "person" is that that term was never properly defined in the first place - that is a main part of the problem. There are legal definitions about when people attain certain rights - to vote, drink, etc. Those legal definitions are based on underlying reasons (ex. Your average 16 year old is not responsible enough to vote or be allowed to drink). What would be the underlying reasons for any definition of person? For me, at least two criteria would have to be met:1) He/she is human - i.e. is alive and has human DNAThe reason is that we should cherish our own species more than others (though I would still argue for humane treatment of animals).2) He/she has a mental existence - i.e. a mind or soul.The reason is that, without a mental existence (mind / soul), a human being is only a body - a biological machine. Machines don't have rights.Does anyone dispute any of those criteria as being part of a definition of personhood? If so, why?

You mean DNA closely matching that of humans? Oh no, wait - you mean DNA closely matching the DNA of organisms that closely match with DNA of organisms we consider humans. Oh no wait...do you really mean organisms that have been shown to be able to breed with you?No problem with the second, which if you don't mind verging off into scifi will also cover AI and Aliens, however the first is just circular reasoning or using such a precise definition that you really don't want it in a legal argument.The second is enough to cover what any one would consider a person, and will hold equally well if we encounter anything really wierd in the future (though a Hive mind might give us an issue). However the first has really just been siezed upon as proof that abortion is wrong by people who really don't know what they are talking about.

you are the one changing the definition though.Person: A Living Human (among other things)the fetus is both a human and living.
attacks
Trying to change the definition of "person" isn't realistic. The truth of it is that no one has rights until they are born. Some rights, such as voting, come later.If you die before you are eighteen, no one has deprived you of your right to vote.

I dont discriminate based on how much "mind" someone has. I am no more a person than a severly mentally retarded person is. Your claim would be that a person with asheimers disease is not a person. If they are not a person then why treat them as such?It is an inconsistent standard or an arbitary standard that you place. Third trimester is not scientific at all but rather a court made thing to say "3 periods". As for why I think a person deserves rights at conception (or soon after) is because it is the only nondiscriminative way to look at it. It provides equality as well and because this is an unsure question it is always best to take the safest stance.

You are missing the point of the question. I am simply trying to get to the core reasons about WHY pro-life people think abortion should be illegal. My personal view is that abortions should be illegal (with the usual exeptions of risk to mother's life, etc.) from roughly the third trimester on (and allowed before that) since Science seems to tell us that this is the earliest point when the higher brain functions of thought and emotion can start to emerge. I find it hard to have much sympathy for a very early fetus since there is "nobody home" that I can have sympathy for - it is still just a body then that will someday have a mind. I was simply asking these questions to see what the views of pro-life people are on this matter. So, what is YOUR view on this? Namely, when do you think an embryo / fetus / baby first starts to have a mind or soul, and why do you believe this?

This is untrue. Do you just make things up Steveeee?Trimesters are a longstanding medical designation that are related to fetal viability. They are roughly each 12 weeks. Fetal viability prior to the end of the 2nd trimester (24 weeks) is highly unlikely. That is the basis for which 1st and 2nd trimester pregnancy terminations are considered medically appropriate and therefore legal. I think that this may have some bearing on this issue of "humanhood". One needs to consider whether the fetus would be able to survive outside the mother's womb.

Listen. For the amount of people I've debated, not many of them have been confronted with a woman or couple who've faced this issue either. Yet, they still debate left and right, and being an adult doesn't mean you know more, and being a teenager doesn't mean you know less. Nobody says they can't have a say simply because they weren't INVOLVED in such a situation.I've talked (and debated) with a woman who had an abortion before. There, does that satisfy you? Or are you just going to say that since I only talked with one person that it doesn't matter?Limited world means nothing. I think a lot of people would agree that the radio, the newspaper and the internet are the most informative things in this world.

Your world is not limited? You fail to mention that you have ever known a woman or couple facing the issue of an unwanted pregnancy. Announcing that you belong to a family that didn't seem to employ birth control is hardly something I would use as a stance from which to have an unbiased or worldly opinion.Also, you're 16 for god's sake, of course your world is limited. No shame in that, just recognize it and have a little humility.

The court made this up in Roe v. Wade....at the end of the 3rd month there is nothing that changes enough to justify calling it something different (2nd trimester). It is just 3 periods....made up by the court...adopted by the medical field (because roe set the 1st trimester rule).http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontl...ws/balkin.htmlCare to rephrase your statement?

In theory, you are right that hypothetical aliens or artificial intelligence as well as possible human-animal hybrids could complicate the picture. However, none of those are part of our current reality, where my definition was based on our current reality. One could make the point that a definition should be all inclusive but it may be impossible to predict all future challenges to a definition, so I would suggest this one until a new reality forces us to rethink our definitions. One could also argue that people are not the only creatures that deserve rights. We also do give a sparse minimum of rights to certain animals against animal cruelty. One could also categorize any sufficiently intelligent hypothetical being (from aliens, to animal-human hybrids, to AI) under a separate category of rights which could or could not be equal to that of people.

You mean DNA closely matching that of humans? Oh no, wait - you mean DNA closely matching the DNA of organisms that closely match with DNA of organisms we consider humans. Oh no wait...do you really mean organisms that have been shown to be able to breed with you?No problem with the second, which if you don't mind verging off into scifi will also cover AI and Aliens, however the first is just circular reasoning or using such a precise definition that you really don't want it in a legal argument.The second is enough to cover what any one would consider a person, and will hold equally well if we encounter anything really wierd in the future (though a Hive mind might give us an issue). However the first has really just been siezed upon as proof that abortion is wrong by people who really don't know what they are talking about.

You are missing the point. Of course Alzeimer's patients and the mentally retarded have minds. I do not discriminate against anyone with a mind. I do discriminate against living human bodies without ANY minds.You may not discriminate how much mind a human has but I would guess that you would also be willing to discriminate against a human that has no mind at all - for example, someone who is pronounced brain dead, but who is being kept artificially alive via machine. The part of our brains that develop the earliest are only those that control the machinery of our body (blood flow, digestion, etc.). It is only later in the pregnancy that the brain starts developing to the point that thought or emotion (subconcious or conscious) are possible - at least according to Science. In placing my own choice of determination date at around the beginning of the third trimester (which is simply a unit of measure - one could choose, for ex. 26 weeks or 793 days if you prefer), I am actually erring on the side of caution in that the great majority (if not all) fetuses would not have achieved a rudimentary mind at that stage.If you dispute the scientific basis of determination when the earliest possibility of thought or emotion could occur, then present your case. I would guess that your case is purely based on religious grounds or arbitrary guesses - for which you have no evidence one way or the other.

It's true I am a male, but how does that relate at all? Any man can have a say in this matter and so can a boy. It's like saying unless you've been killed, you can't say anything against the murderer who killed someone else. You don't know what it felt like, how can you complain?I happen to know that pro-choicers seem to think that 16 year old girls who get pregnant early on can have a say and even make a decision regarding this issue. Simply because I cannot get pregnant and that I'm male makes no difference.And my world is hardly limited. I can't avoid this abortion issue anywhere I go. The newspaper, the internet, it's everywhere. I know a lot more than you assume and remember this. I am the fourth in a family of eleven children. I know what things go on during pregnancy and labor and birth. I have had seven brothers and sisters born after me. Would you like to withdraw that little assumption?Whether Michelle agrees with me or not doesn't mean I can't debate this. If she thinks I'm not worth debating or thinks I'm too young to try and convince her otherwise, she can leave. But as long as she stays and debates, I will try just as much to change her view on this issue.Simply because I'm young and a male makes no difference. I can still have a say in this matter and I can still debate this with older people.So please, don't make such assumptions when you want to debate.

First, let me reply to those who know I'm rather young.I'm 16. That's my age, I admit. But does that falsify anything I've said, or make anything I've said untrue? Does it have any less meaning? If I said my age was... 23, would you doubt me then? Come on, my age makes very little difference.Simone, my religion has nothing to do with my views on abortion. Granted, I needed some to know that murder and stealing are wrong, but that's about it. It really hasn't shaped my views on any of this.

Someone with alzheimers has no mind...no more than an unborn.The brain develops much earlier than 3rd trimester. In fact, it really isn't "for certain" when the brain is developed enough to meet your arbitary standards. In your example, lets say this "brain dead" person has the ability over time to develop the brain back. Would you feel it is ok to unplug this currently brain dead person eventhough it is fairly certain that their brain will re-develop? For the record, a brain actually starts development from day 1 but more significantly around 1 month (or so) into it (for those concerned with brain waves). At birth the brain is only 1/4 developed. You haven't presented in "scientific" facts to show it is not a human you are killing :). You also present many fallacies here such as "religious grounds". I haven't said one thing about religion in all of my posts to you. So lay off the fallacies for a bit.

Why do you say that someone with Alzheimers has no mind? Until their mind degenerates to the point where they no longer have higher cognitive brain waves, then they still have some level of mind.The brain may start developing early on but that does not mean that rudimentary thoughts or emotions (i.e. rudimentary mind) can start from the beginning. So far, the scientific evidence I have read on the topic suggest that this can start happening in the early part of the third trimester (ex. ~30th week). Ex: from part 4 of http://www.2think.org/abortion.shtmlThinking occurs, of course, in the brain--principally in the top layers of the convoluted "gray matter" called the cerebral cortex. The roughly 100 billion neurons in the brain constitute the material basis of thought. The neurons are connected to each other, and their linkups play a major role in what we experience as thinking. But large-scale linking up of neurons doesn't begin until the 24th to 27th week of pregnancy--the sixth month. By placing harmless electrodes on a subject's head, scientists can measure the electrical activity produced by the network of neurons inside the skull. Different kinds of mental activity show different kinds of brain waves. But brain waves with regular patterns typical of adult human brains do not appear in the fetus until about the 30th week of pregnancy--near the beginning of the third trimester. Fetuses younger than this--however alive and active they may be--lack the necessary brain architecture. They cannot yet think. As for the recovery of the brain-dead person, my understanding is that, when a person is declared brain-dead, that means that their cognitive capabilities cannot recover. If you want to leave room always for the extremely unlikely 'just in case' scenario, then would you advocate for all people who are pronounced brain dead to have their bodies kept perpetually alive artificially?I never denied that it was a human that was being killed. I was simply saying that aborting an early fetus was not killing a "person" since, in my view, a "person" also has to have a mind.I am happy to hear that you are not basing your views purely on religious grounds. So many pro-life people do and do not admit it that it is often difficult to start a discussion. So, is it your opinion that thought or emotion is possible as soon as the brain starts to develop?

I see what you mean, but it needn't really be an all or nothing thing, various rights increase as the mind develops. Generally smarter animals get more protection under the law (animal cruelty doesn't apply to fish or insects, certain types of experiments are not permitting on animals of a certain intelligence etc). However I wouldn't think its that difficult to really set a level of inteligence or developed mind to grant what we generally think of as people the highest 'person' status rather than just animals (though I'm sure there might be some oddities slipping in somewhere).Probably best to leave that sort of thing unlegislated really, just have it as a principle on which rulings might be based.

I can see how a general scale of rights based on scale of intelligence could make some sense.

Indeed, should more intelligent people with more highly developed minds have more rights than those with poor mental capabilities? I would feel rather uncomfortable with such a policy.Perhaps you are right that it is best to leave such things unlegislated for now.

That clearly can not be the case though, murder and theft are illegal everywhere despite what religion is popular. The law is just rules for living socially written down, religion came later to enforce them - whether God recognises the importance of these rules and decided to lend his weight to society or whether it was just priests deciding that God would probably agree with the existing laws.People do not turn into random theives and killers if they become atheist and God isn't overly clear on Patent law. Most laws are just common sense, I am happy to waive any right to kill people if it allows me to live in a society which will try to prevent other people killing me, likewise with theft.In the abortion case, I have no problem with you deciding that you don't want one or even trying to disuade people from getting them because you beleive that the soul enters at conception and God does not approve (as long as you arn't too obnoxious whilst doing it and don't mind people doing the opposite back to you). I do have a problem with you trying to get your religion made law if you can't back it up with non-religious logic. In short, if your religion coincides with the laws you would propose, good for you! If you think abortion is wrong purely because there are passages in the bible that state God knew someone before birth and therefore they must exist as a 'whole person' by whatever definition you choose, then thats not enough to justify a law in my opinion. It also clogs up the threads, its best if the religious reasoning for and against and the secular (not atheist) reasonings for and against are kept seperate I think.

It is not just ANY brainwaves. Brains not only define our thoughts and emotions (mind), they also control our bodily functions. In my understanding, all or most of these functions involve electrical brain activity (i.e. brain waves). If a brain is only putting out brain waves controlling bodily functions and there are no brain waves reflecting thoughts or emotions, then I would say that that living human has no mind and is therefore not a person, only a living human body. You had never answered my question that I had posed first about whether you would pull the plug if you knew that that living human body could not recover. As for my answer to your question, if Science could prove a mental existence without brain waves, then I would have to rethink the criteria. So far, that is not the case. If that were the case, then I would hope that other criteria could be found by which one could judge.The same authority you are using in saying that a person starts at conception. Neither of us has authority in making such a definition. We are simply stating our opinions and our reasons behind our opinions. Other people reading our views will simply make up their own minds.Why would you not include a mind in your definition of person? If there is no mind (or soul, if you prefer), then who exactly is it that you are having sympathy for?As for the consistency, I value people - or other mentally existing humans - and my views are consistent with that approach.

I agree for the most part with Another Opinion, though I thought I'd just add toto head off the obvious response. Whilst I myself might not care much what happens to a brain dead body, including myself (seeing as I would be dead and not really in a position to object). I do recognise the value tha other people may place on it. I'm not going to go around gleefully killing anyone who doesn't meet my definition of a person, but if I had to decided between a brain dead body and a living person who also needed the life support I wouldn't need to think about it for a second. The living person clearly takes priority if there is a conflict between the two.

The court made this up in Roe v. Wade....at the end of the 3rd month there is nothing that changes enough to justify calling it something different (2nd trimester). It is just 3 periods....made up by the court...adopted by the medical field (because roe set the 1st trimester rule).http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontl...ws/balkin.htmlCare to rephrase your statement?

[QUOTE=Tastyfish]Its not a fallacy, if his views were shaped by his religion then he needs to seperate the religious parts if he wants to have an influence in legislation.QUOTE]No. If that was true, than no law in america should stand. Things like prohibiting murder and prohibiting stealing are religious based ideas as well. Now, in this day and age, people like you will say that you cannot use religious views or beliefs to make a point. You are wrong, very wrong. Without a religion or God to make the rules, than there is no definite right or wrong. Including religion in legislation will not hinder me in such areas.

Well, I still believe that a universal right and wrong exist and that God set them in order. I also believe that he gave every human the knowledge of right and wrong. But that is justmy belief.I won't argue with you further on religious grounds. And I'd hardly try to get my religion mixed into the law of America. There are so many different religions practiced in America that anyone trying to get a law in by their religious belief would be ridiculous, and certainly not enough to enstate it. (I agree with you there.)

That clearly can not be the case though, murder and theft are illegal everywhere despite what religion is popular. The law is just rules for living socially written down, religion came later to enforce them - whether God recognises the importance of these rules and decided to lend his weight to society or whether it was just priests deciding that God would probably agree with the existing laws.People do not turn into random theives and killers if they become atheist and God isn't overly clear on Patent law. Most laws are just common sense, I am happy to waive any right to kill people if it allows me to live in a society which will try to prevent other people killing me, likewise with theft.In the abortion case, I have no problem with you deciding that you don't want one or even trying to disuade people from getting them because you beleive that the soul enters at conception and God does not approve (as long as you arn't too obnoxious whilst doing it and don't mind people doing the opposite back to you). I do have a problem with you trying to get your religion made law if you can't back it up with non-religious logic. In short, if your religion coincides with the laws you would propose, good for you! If you think abortion is wrong purely because there are passages in the bible that state God knew someone before birth and therefore they must exist as a 'whole person' by whatever definition you choose, then thats not enough to justify a law in my opinion. It also clogs up the threads, its best if the religious reasoning for and against and the secular (not atheist) reasonings for and against are kept seperate I think.

Well, that would limit many handicapped people as being persons. I didn't realize I was supposed to answer to that. I will first respond to your answer.The unborn is an example of brain activity growing into a mental existence as you define it. Why would you need to rethink your criteria for that situation but not this one? As to answer your question. It is surely scenario based. I wouldn't pull the plug on anyone that could breath or otherwise move on their own. It someone is on machines for every function of life then obviously there is nothing that person is doing on their own. Does this answer your question?perhaps I was unclear on this. It isn't my call to call them a person or not. Just give them the opportunity to determine that for themselves. This however, requires some kind of standards because your wouldn't reasonably give a tree time to see if it can call itself a person. These standards should be set for what could reasonably be a person by your definition (or in my case..I select the set of all humans). It is not unreasonable to let anyone with human DNA determine if they are a person or not.A soul and mind are different things. I don't think one losses their soul if they have lost their mind :p. Nevertheless, if a mind is your standard for human, you have to discount alzheimers patients as human, and even some mentally retarded "persons". I don't believe in this because who am I to say who does or does not have a mind. Are you all certain a 7 week old unborn doesn't have a mind at all as you define it? Science can't measure a mind really...not without communication (they can measure brain waves but not extent of what they communicate).you define "mind" (it seems) as with emotion and thoughts. Trust me when I tell you that mentally handicapped and disabled persons can have neither emotion nor thought (that one can know of). Spending much time in a nursing home leads to this conclusion. However, many people have taken the logic step from your views which is eugenics and euthanasia of persons that are a "burden" on society.

It is not just ANY brainwaves. Brains not only define our thoughts and emotions (mind), they also control our bodily functions. In my understanding, all or most of these functions involve electrical brain activity (i.e. brain waves). If a brain is only putting out brain waves controlling bodily functions and there are no brain waves reflecting thoughts or emotions, then I would say that that living human has no mind and is therefore not a person, only a living human body. You had never answered my question that I had posed first about whether you would pull the plug if you knew that that living human body could not recover. As for my answer to your question, if Science could prove a mental existence without brain waves, then I would have to rethink the criteria. So far, that is not the case. If that were the case, then I would hope that other criteria could be found by which one could judge.The same authority you are using in saying that a person starts at conception. Neither of us has authority in making such a definition. We are simply stating our opinions and our reasons behind our opinions.

Maybe not finding this is a sign that I am correct. I am sure if you looked hard enough one doctor at some point or another referred to pregnancy as three periods but there is no need to split it this way unless you are referring to abortion. There is no medical backing to a trimester system. It is as arbitary as semester. The article should have been enough evidence to show that the court set up the trimester framework...yet you still deny this.A "mothers health" was also defined by the courts. So try and prove me wrong, if you do, then fine, I don't care...I don't see why you are stressing about it as it proves nothing either way.yet by law is a medical term now. It seems that your belief system states that if you believe in something that a religious person believes in then you must be part of this "dogma" (a word you seem to love I might add).

Are you claiming that handicapped people do not have the higher level brain waves associated with rudimentary thoughts or emotions? I have never heard of the like. Just because someone cannot communicate their thoughts or emotions doesn't mean that they don't have them.Perhaps I misunderstood your question, but I thought that your scenario was one of someone continuing to mentally exist without any brainwaves. If science could prove that someone could mentally exist without brainwaves then I would not only rethink the scenario you presented but would also rethink the early fetus question. There has been no such evidence, so I am not forced to change my mind until and unless such evidence would be presented. I am confused. Does that mean that you would pull the plug on someone who had nothing left of themselves (including mind) and was only being kept alive by machine? What if they were breathing on their own (that part of the brain was still alive) but the part that defines mind (thoughts, emotions, etc.) were dead?To let someone determine for themselves, they have to have a mental existence - otherwise, what is it exactly that is making that determination. My only criteria for personhood (outside of human DNA) is that the being have a mental existence (i.e. mind / soul). Indeed, you criteria of them determining for themselves is more narrowly defined since it requires a higher level of mind than what I require - the simple existence of a rudimentary mind.Why do you keep saying that Alzheimer's patients or the mentally handicapped do not have minds? Does your definition of mind require the ability to communicate? My definition is simply that rudimentary thoughts and emotions exist, whether or not they can be communicated, and whether or not they are conscious. So far, the scientific evidence points to certain types of brain waves always being associated with thought.

I agree, but you require evidence of this I thought. There is no evidence to support some patients having emotions or anything thought other than basic breathing type of thoughts.Then let me rephrase the question. If a person with currently the same brain activity as an early stage unborn was sitting in a bed and the doctors could in fact give him something (or maybe just on his own) to restore normal brain function as you define it, then would it be ok to kill this person before the treatment? I thought I made this clear. Breathing on their own...no. Every life function running by machine then yes.It certainly doesn't require this. An answer is irrelevant as it is still not my call. I don't have to assume mental existence...a mentally handicapped person from day 1 might not be able to determine this but I still don't get to call them a nonperson because of this. It is still their call...even if they can't make that decision.If this is the standard then you are going to have to push back personhood to starting sometime around the first month or two. An Alzheimers patient has about the same mental capacity. I am not sure how many you have seen...but the ones that are bad off have 100% no thoughts or emotions. In fact, some look like Terri Schaivo (sp) without the massive brain damage. It just seems your cutoff for when enough emotion and thought is enough is soley based on you wanted abortion to be allowed instead of any non-arbitrary standard.

Though no one can read another's mind, Science does seem to say that thoughts are accompanied by certain types of brain waves, mostly associated with the cerebral cortex. I haven't heard of Alzheimer's patients or the mentally handicapped not having such brain waves. Though a completely unrealistic scenario, it is an interesting one since it involves a human body with mental existence, then no mental existence, then mental existence again. The philosophical question comes up whether this resurected person is a new person or a continuation of the already existing person. If it is a new person (who is essentially a cloned brain inhabiting the body of the old one), then, up to the point of brain restoration, he would never have mentally existed yet so yes, if it were necessary, I would condone killing that still uninhabited body since you can't kill someone who doesn't exist yet. However, for the brain restored person to be considered the same person, there would have to be some continuation of mental existence, which brings us to the same point as my previous posting - Science would have to prove that one can mentally exist without brain waves.How about breathing on their own but no mind or soul left - just a partially working body - a human machine - with "nobody home"?Without a mental existence, there is no "they" to speak of - it is just a biological machine. There is no sense of thought or emotion and neither is there even a sense of self. A mentally handicapped person certainly has some level of mind. Do you really believe that mentally handicapped people only have a working body and nothing else?You keep coming back to this idea that Alzheimer's patients or severely mentally handicapped people have no thoughts or emotions. I do not understand why. Do you require thoughts or emotions to be either communicateable or even conscious to exist? I don't. As long as measurements of their brain waves indicate that there are some mental processes still existing that reflect some level of mind, then I would not support "pulling the plug" on them. I would only allow having the plug pulled if they had a living will, since I know that many people (including myself) would not want to be artificially kept alive in a hopeless, minimally existing situation.

I don't want to quote everything as normal.. I will just pick up on the main points.Your whole idea is that brain waves are key. I say that this is inconsistent because brain waves start early yet you think 3rd trimester is when they have emotion and thought brain waves....something you later on deny as being possible to know. So I will just deal with all possible scenarios using your standards.Using Just Brain Waves:Brain waves start around 40 days (or so) in a baby...that we have been able to measure.Using thoughts and emotion Thought and emotion is rather limited with anyone that young (even a 2 day old baby). A baby has been born at 21 weeks before (this is 2nd trimester I might add). Some say the baby has "dreams" at 17 weeks although I don't know the extent of these dreams. Here is kind of a link...not sure how good it is though.http://www.babyworld.co.uk/informati...ies_brains.aspEither way, we haven't any reason to believe that thoughts and emotions has to be the standard. It would be like me saying 1yr old is the standard...and thus me aborting my 7 month old son should be very moral. It is just arbitary and against all reason. My idea of letting it be "to each their own" is the best way to look at it. I don't decide who is or isn't a person...however each can decide for themselves even if they don't have the capacity to do so. It is the most fair and the most consistent.

There are a few things that you seem to not be understanding from my posts:1) I do not claim that ANY brain waves define a mind. There are many types of brain waves - some purely associated with bodily function (those are the ones that start at the early dates you claim) and other associated with potential thought (or mind) that, according to what I have read so far, appear to start near the beginning of the third trimester. Since, for me, it is the mental existence that matters, those early brain waves associated with bodily function only are not that significant.2) For me it is a mental existence that matters - and this need neither be communicable nor even conscious. As soon as there are indications that thoughts COULD be occuring (ex. via the higher level brain waves), then I would err on the side of caution and say that a mind COULD exist. Until the beginnings of a mind exist, I really do not see WHO it is you are having sympathy for. Please don't keep introducing the false arguement of Alzheimer's patients or severely mentally handicaped people not having ANY minds, since they do. Even the conscious effort of lifting up ones hand (as opposed to that hand making random motions) involves a mind. It doesn't take much ...One has to set the limit SOMEWHERE. I set it at the beginning of mental existence (i.e. beginnings of the mind) since, when we have sympathy for people, it is not their bodies we have sympathy for but themselves - i.e. their mental selves (the thing in yourself which you call "I"). Until there is a mental existence, there is no "I" - there is just a body.

No they don't. You are talking to a brick wall there. During the late stages of Alzheimers you pretty much have nothing but a person that is breathing. This disease kills you so it isn't like a lack of brain function is the question here. Many people who think the brain is everything make the natural leep to killing someone who has Alzheimers disease. The very very basic brain functions are exactly like what an unborn has as explained below.This website seems to suggest differentlyhttp://www.birthpsychology.com/lifebefore/early.htmlOnce again, why is your standard right?

Some ancient Greeks thought that sperm were just miniature people ready to grow into a full person.

If this is your standard then an unborn qualifies pretty earlier on. At worst you would have to say this unborn qualifies...this is before 3rd trimester. However, even in the first trimester an unborn qould qualify under your standard. Furthermore, you state that it doesn't need to be communicated verbally or physically....I never said it did and if this were the case why does the unborn require this? An Alzheimers patient in the severe stage is no more capable than the unborn in the link I just provided you. This is not an opinion based on observation...look at a brain scan of someone with Alzheimers. You just said that an arm movement requires some thought....the website suggests 10 weeks!! That is first trimester (end). It is a little unreasonable to say a sperm is its own unique person. The sperm is not a human by itself and would die without being part of the whole. So my standard does rest with reasonableness but it sets no standard for anything human. Maybe a better way to put it is all humans are given the chance to be a person. I don't know where you got that quote from by the way...please link.So I am not sure where your standard lies. Is it movement or some thought at all? I thouht observation was not the way to determine this. Is it a sense of "I" because any doctor will tell you that an Alzheimers patient has no thought of "I". And once again, why does your standard have to be King? It seems a standard that is very open ended will surely allow for any error because of our limited knowledge in such a hard moral question.

We are naturally disturbed when we see a human form mangled - from mangled bodies to purposefully staged art images of mangled human forms. Just because we have the emotional reaction doesn't mean that there is substance behind it. We have to separate our emotional reactions from reality. So, what is the reality of such an early fetus? At 10 weeks, there can be spontaneous movement but spontaneous movement is not evidence of a mind controlling that movement. Touch a newly dead (headless) frog in certain spots and it will move around. We should not confuse things that appear to have a mind (ex. movement) with things that actually have a mind. One has to do a full analysis and I trust Science with such analysis (involving the back-and-forth debate within pear-reviewed publications). So, if you claim that a first trimester fetus qualifies under my standard of having a rudimentary mind since it shows spontaneous movement, then that is a false arguement. Purposeful movement (i.e. choosing to lift up one's hand) is another thing all together and that only happens later in the pregnancy.First, the link from another page of your same web site (about the organization who wrote your site):http://www.birthpsychology.com/apppah/index.htmlAs for your standard, if it is a standard that all human life be given the cance to be a person, then a sperm is also human life. Why not give it a chance to become a person? Also, from your wording, it sounds like you acknowledge that a newly fertilized egg is not yet a person. Is that true?My standard lies at the beginning of some internal mental existence that doesn't need to be externally expressed. Since I don't have the background in biology or psychology to judge for myself when thought first starts, I trust Science, which tells me that it is late in the pregnancy when thought can first start. There has to be some reason to set a standard somewhere - otherwise, one can be so openended in one's standard that one requires all sperm and egg be given the chance for becoming people. I set my standard where Science has told me that thought can first start. Since we, as a people, have to set the standard SOMEWHERE, I am presenting this standard and the reasons behind it for consideration of other readers. You are presenting the standard of setting the limit at conception. I am still not clear why you place that moment as being of paramount importance.

If this is your standard then an unborn qualifies pretty earlier on. At worst you would have to say this unborn qualifies...this is before 3rd trimester. However, even in the first trimester an unborn qould qualify under your standard. Furthermore, you state that it doesn't need to be communicated verbally or physically....I never said it did and if this were the case why does the unborn require this? An Alzheimers patient in the severe stage is no more capable than the unborn in the link I just provided you. This is not an opinion based on observation...look at a brain scan of someone with Alzheimers. You just said that an arm movement requires some thought....the website suggests 10 weeks!! That is first trimester (end). It is a little unreasonable to say a sperm is its own unique person. The sperm is not a human by itself and would die without being part of the whole. So my standard does rest with reasonableness but it sets no standard for anything human. Maybe a better way to put it is all humans are given the chance to be a person. I don't know where you got that quote from by the way...please link.So I am not sure where your standard lies. Is it movement or some thought at all? I thouht observation was not the way to determine this. Is it a sense of "I" because any doctor will tell you that an Alzheimers patient has no thought of "I". And once again, why does your standard have to be King? It seems a standard that is very open ended will surely allow for any error because of our limited knowledge in such a hard moral question.

The hand reached out and grabed the doctors finger...You mean to tell me thats not a person?From that website: "By 15 weeks, ultrasound reveals babies moving in reaction to something as simple as a mother's laugh or cough".So if 10 weeks isn't good enough for you..surely 15 is.How is a sperm a human life? But it doesn't tell you this. You haven't shown anything to suggest this! In fact, my evidence shows the exact opposite. I just don't know what thoughts and emotions you are looking for. I baby grabbing someones finger isn't good enough (that is a common photo btw)...a baby reacting to a mother isn't good enough....I don't know what functions you wish to have. An Alzheimers patient has all reactionary responses in the late stages..The breath and sometimes react to getting kicked in the knee...this is like the 15week old fetus listed above! Yet you find the Alzheimers patient to clearly be a person but the fetus not. I don't understand where you draw the line...please provide some scientific evidence...as I have to support your claim. As for my stance...it is very different from yours. Right now I am just arguing that your standard would lend a different result than what you have...however, my standard (the non-standard) doesn't play word games by trying to define person and human. A human is a person...it has never not been this way up until recently when people tried to find a difference. All of this differences prove nothing and are based on arbitrary points that change.

Its likely reflexs if the brain isn't showing activity in the right places as well, especially when you consider the what the fetus will be responding to in the case of laughs or coughs - its not hearing the sound but being compressed by the movement of the diaphram. A lot of movement (probably the majority of it if we take into account moving to balance weight and smooth muscle stuff as well) requires no concious control from the brain at all, and in many cases you won't even be aware its happening. Don't forget that on top of this there are a lot of instincts babies have as soon as they are born that then are replaced shortly after, grabbing things is one of them. Though I don't know quite what the level of brain involvement is when it comes to instincts.

Not quite a just guess, but what I would assume was the case if the brain wasn't showing any (let alone higher) activity in the brain. Its the case with with more traditional reflexs like recoiling after touching something sharp or hot, or when your leg moves when the knee is tapped (which is one the balancing ones I mentioned). On top of that there are the frog leg and lizard tail examples. The laughing and coughing on is almost certainly going to be a reflex (you don't conciously move when you are poked or prodded unexpectedly, the signal doesn't even go up to the brain until after the movement is complete in these sort of cases in adults), the grasping one I'm less sure about as I don't know entirely where instinct works within the brain.

It was in response to you saying that brain activity occurs early on the pregnancy, whilst there may be some neural activity and even brain activity - it doesn't require there to be a mind, or even for the body to be alive in some cases.

I believe Tastyfish has already addressed these (Thanks, Tastyfish).If your requirement is that it is alive and has human DNA, then sperm is a human life. What is the difference between a sperm and a newly fertilized egg? Mainly, the newly fertilized egg has a COMPLETE set of DNA and will begin the growth process into a full human being. What do you think is so precious about a newly fertilized egg that is important enough to take away the woman's right over her own body?One has to distinguish between reflex actions and actions controlled by a mind. When one is emotionally involved, it is easy to read more into reflex actions and disturbing images than the reality supports. Scientists generally agree that thought and true emotional reactions are chiefly held in the cerebral cortex, which is much slower to develop. My evidence on the beginnings of thought were presented in my post #40, quoting from the fourth section of the link: http://www.2think.org/abortion.shtml. As for your evidence, please quote and reference a site that tells that there is no thought or cerebral cortex activity in the late stage Alzheimer's patient.You claim that a newly fertilized egg has always been called a person. I disagree and challenge you to come up with proof of your assertion. It is not word games when people simply disagree with your arbitrary view of what makes a "person" (which you have never actually defined in detail). My main goal in coming up with a criteria for abortion law is to analyze what exactly it is that we find precious. For me, there has to be "somebody" inhabiting a body for it to be precious enough to overrule a woman's right to her own body. You seem to think that a living human body with "nobody home" is more important than an existing woman.

Having had three infants, I observed the grasping instinct when something touches the palm of an infant's hand, a profoundly human instinct, a reflexive action, not a reflective action that is, an action governed not by thought and decision but by an action of the lower brain.Humans have been evolutionarily designed to grab things with their exquisitely grasping hands.Gimme, gimme, gimme is the basic animalistic constuct of the human animal.

for one, the body is alive. Secondly, I would say that your assumptions are based on anything. This website suggests that emotions and thoughts consistent with what "Another Opinion" finds to be a person are seen early in pregnancy. While it very well could be wrong, I see no reason to think it is unless you are a neuroscienctist.He addressed this based on his own thought and no evidence. At some point you gotta think that your goal is not really to find and answer but ot justify one you already have. I wonder if you might be working from the conclusion that the unborn is not a person and finding ways to justify this.A human cell by itself can't survive. It is the collection that makes the human. Doesn't really matter how big the collection..just so that the collection is self growing. Anyway, that isn't your question...the sperm is not "alive" in the sense I am addressing and is only half human DNA as you say. We can get into the specific science of it but in the end this doesn't matter to me.ok, so we look at actual thought and emotion from the cerebral cortex. Alzheimer's Patients have the cerebral cortex destroyed. I couldn't really find a link that talks about it but here is a glossary which has some terms. http://www.zarcrom.com/users/alzheimers/w-07.htmlI just don't understand that if you have such a hard time saying we should kill severe Alzheimers patients. Many pro-choicer people have gone to this logical step. I however don't take the view that brain is everything...even more so if it is growing into a highly developed one.by the way, your link gets the Bible wrong again...everyone makes the mistake of quoting that "exodus" passage. It makes the skeptical about the source but for now I will assume the part you refer to is correct.My view is not arbitrary at all..in fact, it is even what a common dictionary says. Human and person are just interchangable words...not that this even matters. http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=personI think it is not my call to try and make some standard for seperating humans and persons for the sole purpose of abortion law. This doesn't place an unborn above the woman but rather equal. It just seems that whenever we try to say "this isn't a person" it always backfires and is wrong. Better just to assume the position that trying to seperate the two is just a way to justify an action rather than seek the truth of the matter. Science actually told us that blacks were not people like whites but that proved to be wrong on so many levels...same thing with Jews. It goes farther back then this though. Once you decide to rank humans and classify them, you always end up discriminating and just plan being wrong.

My goal is to try to analyze the situation as objectively as I can and then draw conclusions. If Science could show the highly improbable situation that a one month old embryo has a mind, then I would change my stance on abortion to not allow almost all abortions, and would then push hard for as good contraceptives as the medical profession could possibly make.As things stand, that is not the case (luckily for women who need to make such a choice). The scientific sources I've seen so far point to the potential for thought starting around the beginning of the third trimester. The two examples which you gave - a photo of an earlier fetus grasping a doctor's finger and the response stimuli to a mother's voice can, at first glance, appear that there is a mind that drove that finger or a mind that reacted to the mother's voice. However, one has to analyze farther. For example, with the fetus photo, it is easy to jump to assumptions that the fetus might have felt fear and held onto a finger for emotional support because that is what we might assume from similar image of a young child. It is an emotionally stirring photo because of that assumption. However, we have to ask ourselves whether that assumption is right and that is where Science comes in. Scientists have investigated wide ranges of biological / neurological behavior and are able to distinguish between behavior that involves a thinking mind and behavior governed by the body itself - as in reflex actions. I do not have the background in biology to judge for myself so I trust the results of scientific inquiry. The few links I have seen so far suggest that many areas of the brain (including the cerebral cortex) are in the process of being destroyed in an Alzheimer's patient, just like the fetus and born baby have cerebral cortexes that are in the oposite process of being developed. There comes a point in the development of a fetus' cerebral cortex that thought first becomes possible and that seems to be reflected by the onset of higher brain waves. If there would come a time that there are NO higher brain waves in an Alzheimers patient, then I would also agree that there is no mind left. You have not shown that that is the case and I haven't heard that to be the case. My definition of person is not arbitrary. Whenever we use the term "person" in any sense of having sympathy, then we always assume that there is "somebody home" in that human body. Otherwise, who are we having sympathy with? I simply have never gotten a good definition from you about what constitutes a person. More specifically, do you or don't you think that a newly fertilized egg is a person and, if so, why?

Tastyfish, you failed to note, as I have told you in another thread, that I plainly stated that human life has priority over ownership of inanimate property. I must also add a codicil to the effect that animals that one may own, I hope that I do not have to make a distinction between humans and animals on your behalf, Tastyfish, but let me remind you, a human may own animals if he or she wishes, but a human does not own other humans, strictly interpreted as a human who has been born, is able to survive independently of dependence upon another human's womb for survival.Parents are responsible for their children, one hopes that they are capable of such responsibility, but they DO NOT OWN THEIR CHILDREN once liberated from a fetus' dependence upon the womb for its existence.

Codicil to codicil, one is responsible for the conduct of one's animals and may not allow one's animals to savage or kill humans or other animals, unless said animal is working in the capacity as a hunter on behalf of the human and preying upon beasts in the wild.Cattle rustling? Most cattle rustlers were greedy rather than hungry, I'd say, in most cases.I must say, I am a bit perplexed that Christians should raise such a fuss over the ownership of a loaf of bread and give short shrift to the situation of someone who is starving.

I wanted to read this whole thread, but I have to stop you there. What's non-organic material? Do you mean things that aren't alive, or do you mean things that don't consist of carbon atoms? If the first, I'd disagree. If the latter, I'd agree only because the definition of non-organic is anything without carbon, so it's a moot point.They are just a bunch of cells. If we take your position to its logical conclusion, we'd have to stop masturbating as that kills of billions e10 of living things.Oh yeah, 10 siblings? How old are you?

Those Who Abort Them Know Otherwise.I posted this on Youdebate, but as this is becoming more popular, I'll post it here too.---Some people call an early concieved baby just a fetus or bunch of cells early on. That is their view.But this question makes me wonder if they don't say this just to ease their conscience. "If it is just a bunch of cells, why do they abort it?"I think some people will agree that the fetus is a living thing. But I have never heard of a couple who didn't want a baby look at it and say: "Oh, it is really just a bunch of cells. Why not wait a while before it starts looking like an actual human just to make sure?"This one particular arguement infuriates me. If they're going to abort the baby, I say go ahead. But don't start calling a little child not a human being. The woman knows darn well it is a human being and that is why she has it aborted.The little children are the future of america. Well they don't have much future if they can't even get the respective title of "Human Being" just because they're young. I've seen aborted babies at just six weeks and they look an awful lot like a regular baby. Just a ton smaller.Every person reading this post (including you ;-) ) was a baby just like that thing. You were just as much alive then as you are now. If you truly weren't living, than how do you explain yourself now? Life doesn't come from non-organic material.I've smiled before because my Mom chose life for me and my ten brothers and sisters instead of making excuses like this. She went through a lot of pain and financial cost and worry. But there is no baby out there that isn't all these things. I think more women (Or adolescent girls who get into sex early in life) would choose to let their child live if they saw what a baby truly looks like and what a baby truly is. They wouldn't look at early babies like they were nothing more than an inert bunch of matter.So my question is this. Why don'y they call those bunch of cells a baby? Do they:1. Do it because they believe it really is a babyor2. Do it because it eases their conscience when they kill it?

Let me put it simply. It is either dead or never alive in the first place. That's what non-organic means. Unsupportive of life; incapable of starting life.My conclusion does not eliminate masturbation, and you can't put abortion and masturbation on the same platform.Guess what, you happen to be nothing more than a bunch of cells yourself. You have things that babies haven't yet developed, true. But the fact is, your body is made up of nothing else. You're killing would lead to an investigation of murder, while a baby's life isn't because of people like you who try to make this belief a fact.It is not just a bunch of cells, it is a human body with a developing system arranging every single cell in such a way to form everything needed to live dependently. A bunch of skin cells or fluid cells are not a living person.I can't see how this is relevant.

If the first, I'd disagree. If the latter, I'd agree only because the definition of non-organic is anything without carbon, so it's a moot point.They are just a bunch of cells. If we take your position to its logical conclusion, we'd have to stop masturbating as that kills of billions e10 of living things.Oh yeah, 10 siblings? How old are you? Were your parents rich, foreign, or Mormon?

Proto, perchance, was your father a polygamist?

Let me put it simply. It is either dead or never alive in the first place. That's what non-organic means. Unsupportive of life; incapable of starting life.My conclusion does not eliminate masturbation, and you can't put abortion and masturbation on the same platform.Guess what, you happen to be nothing more than a bunch of cells yourself. You have things that babies haven't yet developed, true. But the fact is, your body is made up of nothing else. You're killing would lead to an investigation of murder, while a baby's life isn't because of people like you who try to make this belief a fact.It is not just a bunch of cells, it is a human body with a developing system arranging every single cell in such a way to form everything needed to live dependently. A bunch of skin cells or fluid cells are not a living person.I can't see how this is relevant.

No chance. And besides, my Mom still had the same amount of kids, how does this relate?

You still don't give any links to these scientists. If "everything you have read" has shown you this...then why don't you post links to all of this. The position that the "mind" is where you draw the line is more arbitrary than just not deciding a line. The concept of "higher brain waves" means nothing because we never thought of drawing the line here until we realized we wanted the conclusion of abortion. A human is a person is a human and to try and find a difference is just playing word games to achieve a desired result.

My goal is to try to analyze the situation as objectively as I can and then draw conclusions. If Science could show the highly improbable situation that a one month old embryo has a mind, then I would change my stance on abortion to not allow almost all abortions, and would then push hard for as good contraceptives as the medical profession could possibly make.As things stand, that is not the case (luckily for women who need to make such a choice). The scientific sources I've seen so far point to the potential for thought starting around the beginning of the third trimester. The two examples which you gave - a photo of an earlier fetus grasping a doctor's finger and the response stimuli to a mother's voice can, at first glance, appear that there is a mind that drove that finger or a mind that reacted to the mother's voice. However, one has to analyze farther. For example, with the fetus photo, it is easy to jump to assumptions that the fetus might have felt fear and held onto a finger for emotional support because that is what we might assume from similar image of a young child. It is an emotionally stirring photo because of that assumption. However, we have to ask ourselves whether that assumption is right and that is where Science comes in. Scientists have investigated wide ranges of biological / neurological behavior and are able to distinguish between behavior that involves a thinking mind and behavior governed by the body itself - as in reflex actions. I do not have the background in biology to judge for myself so I trust the results of scientific inquiry. The few links I have seen so far suggest that many areas of the brain (including the cerebral cortex) are in the process of being destroyed in an Alzheimer's patient, just like the fetus and born baby have cerebral cortexes that are in the oposite process of being developed. There comes a point in the development of a fetus' cerebral cortex that thought first becomes possible and that seems to be reflected by the onset of higher brain waves. If there would come a time that there are NO higher brain waves in an Alzheimers patient, then I would also agree that there is no mind left. You have not shown that that is the case and I haven't heard that to be the case. My definition of person is not arbitrary. Whenever we use the term "person" in any sense of having sympathy, then we always assume that there is "somebody home" in that human body. Otherwise, who are we having sympathy with? I simply have never gotten a good definition from you about what constitutes a person. More specifically, do you or don't you think that a newly fertilized egg is a person and, if so, why?

Twice in this thread alone (posts #40 and #69), I have given you the link to the main arguement. I will give it again:It is part 4 of http://www.2think.org/abortion.shtmlThe others were found in passing, and I did not bookmark those sites, so it would take time to search them out. The link above is an exerpt from a text that has more references in the text itself (which is only found in the hardcopy that I did not have access to). If it will actually make a difference in your point of view, then I could go through the trouble of finding the references that the authors used in the text correponding to that link. Otherwise, it is not worth my trouble.In my own deliberations on abortion, I started out by analyzing all the situations in which I consider it wrong to kill and recognized that a core minimal requirement was that the person at least minimally exist mentally. The main consideration behind most of these deliberations was to treat others as I would have myself be treated. I believe my mother should have had every right to abort me before I started mentally existing. "I" did not start to exist until I started doing so mentally so it would not have made much of a difference if she had aborted me at three months, if she had used contraceptives, or if they had never had sex during that period. Nobody would have been hurt since nobody existed yet.I was fairly confident that first trimester embryos/fetuses did not have a mental existence but did not have a good feel about certain second trimester fetuses until I read such links. With proper scientific evidence, I could still be convinced that the mind can exist prior to the third trimester - I simply haven't seen any such convincing evidence.As for your last comment, I could just as easily say:A person is not a human is not a person and to try to make them the same is just playing word games to achieve a desired result.

An article from the well known (sarcasim) 2think.org that states scientists think this doesn't show anything about scientists..although this is not really the point as it is clear you take the "neurological view" which is not the view of many scienctists at all but rather just one group.This still presents a view that is both arbitrary and discriminative. It is arbitrary because one could easily say they think a person (or human...or whatever) begins at the develoment of fingernails. Furthermore, one could say that a person doesn't beging until the cerebral cortex is finished development (after birth I believe) or until the brain has gained the ability to development a sense of "self" (also after birth). It seems with someone so subjective (if you place a value on life) as this than you would probably either want a safe bet standard or find other criteria that everyone tends to agree on. This is how I can get to the idea of having no standard. If one is in development of any of these standards than that is enough. This is neither arbitrary as it doesn't define a point really and it doesn't discriminate based on development. So why is the sperm and egg not considered in this? Well, neither of them involve any of the views on development of life. This also support something you said earlier which is that life is a "continum" (was that you?). If life is continuious than it would seem that there is no gap from one life to the next as we are always in development. I would then ask why a person is defined as a human.

Of course, I am not counting the views of scientists that have nothing to do with the study of the brain since those opinions are much less relevant. My opinion as a scientist is not relevant on these issues since that is not my field. Therefore, I rely on the opinions of scientists (neuroligists) who do specialize in the study of the brain. You arbitrarily place your limit at conception, I place mine at the beginning of the possibilities of a mind. We each consider the other's limit as arbitrary since we don't agree with it. It is absurd to equate either of our limits with setting a limit at the development of fingernails. Since I consider your view arbitrary, I could say the same about you, but logic prevents me. As for being discriminative, I have no problem with discriminating against mind-less bodies, just like you have no problem discriminating against unfertilized eggs. If you think that we shouldn't discriminate against bodies without minds, then try to convince me WHY we should not discriminate against them.However, we simply have different views of where to set that safe standard. I am erring on the side of caution in setting my limit when a mind even has a first possibility of appearing. I have had discussions with a few pro-life people that wanted to err on the side of certainty - i.e. later in pregnancy or even after birth - but that is not my view. I am already erring on the side of safety - at least where that one critical criteria is concerned- the possible presence of a mind. Where my criteria of having the beginnings of a mind is concerned, my setting the point of safety at conception would be just as arbitrary as my setting the point of safety at an unfertilized egg - there is no logical reason to set it there. I set it at a point that makes logical sense.I do not understand what you are getting at in that last sentence.Certain animals can have minds as well but, if we were to also call them people, then we would have to grant them similar rights. Though I support anti-animal cruelty laws, I, personally, don't think animals should get the same rights as we humans do. That is why I place being human as one of the criteria for being called a person.

The viewpoints about the mind have generally fallen in three categories:1) Our minds are fully defined by our brains. The experts for this viewpoint are neuro scientists and that is why I go to them.2) Our minds are fully defined by a non-physical self. This is a religious point of view (or at least a faith-based point of view since there is no evidence of this). Since one cannot impose ones religious beliefs on the populace, this is not an option.3) A mixture of physical (brain) and non-physical self. So, if one wants to avoid a religious arguement, then who could possibly be considered better experts than neuro scientists?You simply chose to define person and human as the same thing (all humans are persons as well). I chose to define person as a human with the possibility of a mind. What exactly is it that you are questioning?As for arbitrariness, if you truly believed that all unfertilized eggs were people as well, then you would also have to protect those. Your goal of protection seems to start at conception, which is why I stated that you set your limit there.

You make the assumption that the mind is what has to guide us. An embronic (sp) scienctist would say something different.I am saying that human and person have never not had the same meaning..or rather person has never had a meaning other than "a human"...until the abortion debate when we decided we wanted to justice it. A simple dictionary will show this.My goal is to not set a point. I have tried to make this clear. If you set a point than you fall into an arbitary arguement. An unfertilized egg is part of a human...getting rid of it would not end the development of a seperate entity of a species. Like I said, if life is continious there is no "point"..it just keeps on going.

You are missing the point. I am not saying that the majority of scientists take the same ethical stance of the mind being the determining point. I am saying that those most familiar with a non-religious view of the mind (i.e. neurologists) say that it can start to exist around the beginning of the third trimester. THe ethical stance of the mind being a critical factor is my own and that ethical stance is what I am presenting in these posts for general consideration. You have another ethical stance that you are presenting. The readers will decide for themselves and, most likely, not choose either of our stances but come to their own conclusions.Prior to the abortion debate, human and person were almost exclusively discussed with respect to born people, where there is no question that human and person are the same thing. The discussion about pre-born people is new. We are venturing into new territory with such debates and that is why those definitions loose their solid meaning.You seem to be in denial. You keep denying that you set a point while, at the same time, you continue to set one. You do not defend an unfertilized egg, you do defend a fertilized one - THAT IS SETTING A POINT! WHen you call a fertilized egg a separate entity vs an unfertilized egg not a separate entity - THAT IS SETTING A POINT!

If it was not a human what species is it?A sperm is just a replication of my DNA; and the human egg is just a replication of the woman’s DNA; however when these unite an individual human exists with all the chromosomes to be identified as a human, and more importantly an individual because its DNA is unique. Its death is murder, even according to existing law.
attacks
They are human fetuses. But not a person as yet.There are human sperm and eggs, dog sperm and eggs, etc. When you say that they are human you are merely indicating the origin of the eggs and sperm. Human versus feline or canine or whatever.

Species is an abstract concept - if we are being really technical its not human unless it either a: looks like a human, or b: can breed with one.I'd advise you have a read of the Science and Where life begins thread before you make statements like a person being created at the fusion of egg and sperm. Its not as simple as you might think.

None, its unclassified until it meets one of those definitions.Species isn't as cut and dried as people like to think, have a look at the whole herring gull/black backed gull issues, as well as the various dog breeds with red coyotes and wolves. Its really just an arbeitary label we apply to things to make it easier to repeat experiments really - just like colours have no official boundaries and sort of merge into each other at the edges, so do species.

No, we have moved on since the 1930’s, we have DNA now; it can be used to identify and catalogue species, sort of like barcodes.

Nope, DNA on its own means very little as its fairly random with regard to the amount of matching DNA between two organisms due to issues with chromosome numbers and suchlike. Even being able to predict what organisms might be able to breed with one another doesn't stop species being arbeitary with all the things capable of assexual reproduction or being extinct. Or the wierd thing of one organism being able to breed with two different 'species' who can not breed with each other.We are far closer to chimps in our DNA than we are in our proteins that the DNA codes for - a lot of the genes are near identical with regard to the actual code, we just stick them together differently (after splicing the 'junk DNA' introns out).

Because what matters there is that someone is meddling with the continuation of a line, they are trying to prove the eggs came from somewhere specific most likely. I was under the impression that a trained ornithologist would be able to tell the difference between eggs without needing to do a DNA analysis.Its technically shaky ground though, its using the 'I'd know one when I saw it' definition of a species rather than the actual technical one. Law and science do have a tendancy of just assuming they know what the other one is talking about, and law has a ton of other wierdness thrown in from precedent etc. Law likes to be consistent, science likes to be right even if that makes it inconsistant over the long term - its very different viewpoints. Technically speaking, if we do this then transplant organs and cancer cells will count as people under the lawNot to mention if you are going to decide that just being 'human' is required for protection under the law and nothing else then you need to say why - and in most cases the explaination themselves, generally tending to be a list of traints found nearly exclusively in humans and regarded as special, would surely do as the set of things required for protection under law.

Rubbish! An organ just like any other part of a person’s body carries a signature in the DNA, that is present throughout the whole body, yet a foetus has their own DNA, and killing it is the destruction of a unique person, with their own DNA. When you destroy a foetus, you destroy a unique individual; you should stop comparing them to the organs of people, that is misleading to people seeking the truth.

Nonsense! Identical twins are seperate people, yet form after a single sperm and egg have fused and have indentical DNA - are they the same person? We're talking comparing DNA to a standard in the bird egg cases anyway and seeing what degree it differs from it, not seeing if each is a unique individual. If you want to exclude organs and cancer cells (which are totally self sufficient organisms with human DNA) then you end up excluding identical twins.

Indentical twins have exactly the same DNA, doesn't matter if its different from the mother because its the same for two different people. The reason it seems so weird having to include organs and cancer as people because they have human DNA is because making having human DNA the sole requirement to count as a person is a utterly stupid idea.Its like insulting someone pointing out that if you say that the number of legs is what should determine person under the law, you will be including chickens as people.

It is not the sole reason; the reason is to demonstrate that it is a separate person, not an extension of the woman as you are trying to describe it as. It is not like having a tooth out, is it? A person will still live if they have a tooth out, unlike the destruction of an unborn, which will not go on to live after the abortion. Can you not even see this? Why are you completely denying this?

The tooth and the fetus both die, your analogy is a bit confused here. The DNA means nothing, absolutely nothing here. The fact its a different thing means its a different thing, the DNA doesn't really add anything to the debate other confusion. Not to mention you've ignored the issues with cancer that has a different genetic sequence (slightly) from the host

There is nothing confusing; it is not even an analogy. When I "get my tooth out", I do not die, when you "get your son or daughter out", they die. A person and a tooth are not comparable.What! DNA has nothing to do with abortion yet cancer does?DNA has every thing to do with the debate, it is one of the rudiments for distinguishing people from each other, and this is exactly what you are trying to do with regard to the foetus and the mother. What is confusing is when you talk about cancer; cancer will not grow into a human being, whereas a foetus is a human being.

Since you seem to be considering abortion to be murder from conception because, as you say, the embryo is then a "human being", I wonder what meaning you are attaching to that term besides simply having a complete set of DNA and having the potential of growing up into someone who we do cherish. I suspect it is that potential that is by far the overriding factor in your view of abortion as murder. As a test, I would ask you the following question:If the newly fertilized egg, or even one month fetus, would stop their developement at that point and stay that way forever with no chance for continued development, would you still call it murder to destroy that entity? If so, why? What would you cherish in that perpetually existing newly fertilized egg?
attacks
There is nothing confusing; it is not even an analogy. When I "get my tooth out", I do not die, when you "get your son or daughter out", they die. A person and a tooth are not comparable.What! DNA has nothing to do with abortion yet cancer does?DNA has every thing to do with the debate, it is one of the rudiments for distinguishing people from each other, and this is exactly what you are trying to do with regard to the foetus and the mother. What is confusing is when you talk about cancer; cancer will not grow into a human being, whereas a foetus is a human being.

Since the scenario you describe never happens, the question is hardly worth answering. However, it would be murder to kill that person who is less developed then we are. We are all developed to different degrees, and the level of development is not a factor that determines us as people.

I know that scenario never happens. It is simply a hypothetical question to see whether it is something about the fertilized egg as it is *at that moment* that is important to you or whether it is its potential to become something important (ex. you, me and everyone else). Your answer didn't really address the question though. I asked what it was in that unfertlized egg that you cherish, assuming that that egg will never develop farther. You simply restated your opinion that killing at all levels of development is murder.The one thing that you said that does touch upon truly answering the question is: "the level of development is not a factor that determines us as people". So, if I am reading you right, you view a newly fertilized egg as a person and that is why you would consider it murder. The thing that is confusing is that I have absolutely no clue what you mean, then, by "person" outside of simply having a complete set of human DNA and not being just one of millions of cells of another person. If that fertilized egg will stay as just that, then what makes that a person? This is a very important question and an aspect that I never understood about the pro-life movement.

You're still confused - whatever you take out of the body dies, whether its a organ, tooth or developing person. People who have abortions don't die - which is what you are saying.DNA doesn't have anything to do with it, but if you bring it in, then you bring in the issue of cancer. Cancer cells have distinct DNA from the parent, and can survive without it (infact most cells lines have outlived their parent), cancer cells have human DNA (but don't meet the real criteria - oh but nor does a fetus!).Seeing as you are happy with a fertisilised egg being a human, or a section of a blastocyst even if they will not develop into anything - why do you exclude cancer cells from your definition of human? What is the difference between the two?Why are we trying to dinstinguish mother and fetus, you don't need DNA for that at all anyway?

Well done, you have grasped the concept, if you remove your son from your womb, he dies. His entire life will end. However if you compare removing a tooth to removing your son, it is not an equal comparison, because for it to be a valid comparison, the extraction would have to be like for like, say for example: your finger and his finger, your toe and his toe, your eye his eye. Taking his entire body and destroying it means that an equal comparison would be to take your body and destroy it. Agreed?So, when some women allow their pregnancies to take their natural course and are rewarded with children, do people with cancer receive an offspring after 9 months too?No, so the physical comparison fails.

No, his and my bodies are very different - say I can keep my brain because he doesn't have one. If we are talking blastocyst and early embryos I could just kill a few undifferentiated cells (or perhaps at least donate some bone marrow) and we would call it even. We are very, very different things.Depends what you want to count as an offspring, the cells are alive and can reproduce and grow independantly. But beside that, the point was that even if the embryo could not advance to full development you still class it as human.

I personally draw a large distinction between a fertilized egg and a late-term fetus. With the late-term fetus, there is someone there that we can feel sorry for if an abortion happens. There are the beginnings of the mind, emotions, thought, sense of pain, etc. These need not be conscious, just like we do not need to be conscious to still mentally exist, as in sleep or coma, but they have to at least exist. With a newly fertilized egg, there is no "someone" who we can mourn. The only thing that we can mourn is what that newly fertilized egg might have become.I can understand if you cherish the newly fertilized egg for what it will become. However, you still haven't explained what it is that you cherish about the newly fertilized egg in what it is *at that moment*. If you say that the newly fertilized egg is a person even if it will never continue to develop and the only meaning you attach to the term "person" is 1) full set of human DNA and 2) not an integral part of another's metabolism, then, frankly, your definition of person is so empty that it is almost meaningless. Perhaps you seriously think that there is a "someone" in that newly fertilized egg - more than just a cell but a cell with a mental existence. Is that your view?

A man in a temporary coma still has a mental existence - not conscious, just subconscious. Just because the rudimentary mind is subconscious doesn't mean that it does not exist. All I require is a rudimentary mental existence. When people feel sympathy for another in not wanting that other to be hurt, a mental existence is automatically assumed. Otherwise, there is no other "someone" to speak of. This has a lot of meaning to a lot of people.I have answered your challenge. Now it is only fair that you answer mine. Do you or don't you think that the fertilized egg has a mental existence? If not, then what characteristics do you include in your definition of it as a "person"?

Another opinion answered the first bit perfectly well, so I'll reply to this.You don't especially care about conciousness, its not something that is pariticular important to you compared to anything else about the fetus, or so it seems anyway (not wanting to misrepresent your position but clearly something else is more important to you if you are adament about protecting from a fertilised egg onwards, or at least an implanted one).I don't think you can argue here in favour of something that might be, in practically every other circumstance regarding the law we only use what was done rather than what may be done in the future (classing intent as a crime, it is something someone physically does). Its a tricky question and will open a lot of issues either way if you start counting what might have happened later on if you had not done something. With any definition, the more precise you start making it the more things that you feel should fit in the category find themselves outside - alternatively if you try to broaden it then you start including things you feel shouldn't be in there at all. If think that looking for some form of conciousness and trying to reduce suffering is probably the closest we can get to protecting all of what we consider important without including too much extra or excluding things that are considered important.If you want to exclude cancer, but keep fertilised embryos - what traits do you consider being important and worth protecting of one and not the other?

A slightly odd thought, the trouble with there being no difference between what happens to a fetus if its aborted by humans, or due to some other reason (spontaneus abortion by God for the sake of the arguement) - exactly what is God punishing as all that is happened is a soul has been guaranteed access to heaven rather than having to risk eternal damnation by actually living. Unless of course a fetal soul is significantly different from an adult one (lacking an system of morals and having made no choices) in which case the whole issue of god chosen spontaneous abortions suddenly seems a bit of a grey area (it does seem a little out of character as far as intervention appears to be).

I'll second that, however if God is responsible for all these things we are really treading on the toes of Free Will here let alone the issues where people seem to get a really hard lot in life right from the start. If God is responsible (directly rather than just creating the original seed) for all the food I may eat, then surely he is just as responsible for the heroin a junkie may OD on?Course I suppose this is sort of alright if God has a true long term plan that will eventually cause the greatest good for a population infinitely more than ours, however that it requires this much work and this much sacrifice surely calls God's omnipotence into question?

Personally, I don't think God exists at all so no. However if God is responsible for everything, or even just all natural things that exist outside free will then possibly (the heroin is a product of a natural source and the tendancy to become addict is likely a genetic tendancy combined with being in a situation to be exposed to it).I just can't see the dividing line that would seperate God from being responsible for spontaneous abortion and every other biochemical process ever.

It's true I am a male, but how does that relate at all? Any man can have a say in this matter and so can a boy. It's like saying unless you've been killed, you can't say anything against the murderer who killed someone else. You don't know what it felt like, how can you complain?I happen to know that pro-choicers seem to think that 16 year old girls who get pregnant early on can have a say and even make a decision regarding this issue. Simply because I cannot get pregnant and that I'm male makes no difference.And my world is hardly limited. I can't avoid this abortion issue anywhere I go. The newspaper, the internet, it's everywhere. I know a lot more than you assume and remember this. I am the fourth in a family of eleven children. I know what things go on during pregnancy and labor and birth. I have had seven brothers and sisters born after me. Would you like to withdraw that little assumption?Whether Michelle agrees with me or not doesn't mean I can't debate this. If she thinks I'm not worth debating or thinks I'm too young to try and convince her otherwise, she can leave. But as long as she stays and debates, I will try just as much to change her view on this issue.Simply because I'm young and a male makes no difference. I can still have a say in this matter and I can still debate this with older people.So please, don't make such assumptions when you want to debate.

Just to add another view to the list on this subject:As I had noted in many older posts, I and many others trust various scientific sources that argue that the beginnings of the mind cannot happen before the beginning of the third trimester. Therefore, I have no problems with abortion before the third trimester because there is no mind involved yet and, therefore, no person, and because the woman's right to her own body should supercede that of a living human fetal body that is not yet mentally existing.However, once that mental existence comes into play then I believe that the woman should have to carry that dependent person since, after all, she had six months to decide and she knew what was coming. I acknowledge extenuating circumstances such as a risk of the mother's death or serious risk to her health as warranting exceptions. As for when that point of personhood would be determined, it is apparently easier to scientifically determine when it is too early for a mind to exist than it is to determine when a mind does start to exist. However, I, personally, would be willing to err in law on the side of caution and set that point at the beginning of the third trimester.

It is hard to answer a scenario question with no scenario.Your sentence classified it as so."Parasitic twins are removed all the time and left to die."Perhaps I misunderstood you but it seems as if you were referring to two people here.An extra limb is not another person.

blinks and smiles according to the article. Hard to say though...I don't think they provided enough information. So I may agree it was a person and I may not. Can you provide more information on it?

So basically you are backing out of your original assertion that removing a conjoined twin or parasidic twin resulting in death is killing a person?

far from it. My original assertion was conjoined twins you might recall.There are cases where you could have two conjoined twins that if you removed one then he/she would die. They might be fully functional outside of say a major artitary being shared (this is only a hypothetical) and otherwise be two unique people. However, in your world view, you would say that it is one person. I'd like to see you go up to the one that would die and say "hey! you aren't a person....time to die". Unlike you, I don't choose to not classify humans as better than another....we tried this before and it resulted in much blood. Perhaps if you thought of all humans as the same then we would actually achieve some measure of equality.

You either believe a twin is a different person or part of another person no matter what the situation.You might be able to answer the question if you knew what you based pershood on,BTW I was wondering what do you base personhood on?

Seeing as I am limited in time I will answer only the first part and the rest later. The first part is inaccurate because there are different kinds of twins. It doesn't have to be an abosolute as you claim it to be...even if we took your absolute standard you would have to say that conjoined twins are not a person in all situations...in fact, since you said "twins" even non-conjoined twins would be one person.

So are you saying that the personhood and value of a twin deppends on certian situtaions yet you condem pro-choicers for giving value status on fetus deppending on certian situations? Like you stated in another post " a limb is not a person" s it logically follows that a human body made up of limbs and organs in not a person,so that means you don't base personhood on mere biology alone..? Then WHAT do you base personhood and value on?

Obviously you believe that an embryo is a unique *person* a parasitic twin was at one time a seperate embryo that just merged with the other embryo.In the case of * Fetus in fetu* to seperate "unique individules* is involved.http://www.thefetus.net/page.php?id=287 So I have given you a specific situation.Now,is it morally wrong to remove a Fetus in Fetu even if it results in it's death and even if it is done for convience?

No a parasitic twin is very much living *biologically*and to remove it would result in it's death. As in the case of the girl born with her parasitic twins head emerging from hers.The other head (although head no seperate body) was very alive ,it even would laugh and smile.No this isn't the case the Fetus in Fetu is very much alive growing with it's twin and hardley ever causes any physical harm. So can you re-answer?

I told you with the "other head" there was not enough information to make a determination. From what I have read, it either is dead..dieing or will cause the death of the host. Out of the 90 reported cases this has been what happens.In the impossible scenario that the child could remain alive with no harm done to the host (death) then it would not be ok to kill this human.

No thats not true.http://www.thefetus.net/page.php?id=290 And no the Fetus in Fetus is very much alive and growing with the host.

There was one case (out of the 90) where the baby was dead inside a boy.The quote doesn't mention that it will become harmful to the host and deadly considering that they mention the twin continues to grow.Another case had a women with the twin in her neck.http://www.jultrasoundmed.org/cgi/co...full/24/9/1313Perhaps you could live without a liver.

A Fetus in Fetu IN MOST CASES in no more harmful that a cyst.

this is not backed up by any evidence...if true though...like I said...than it would be wrong to kill.

I gave you a link from a medical site,that stated it was harmless in most cases.Why? Are you a Hindu?

I agree with Steeeeve. To say that just because someone is male is sexist. I disagree that because some women make this argument, that it is invalid. This is attacking the person because of there sex, and not dealing with the argument. If males cannot have a say on this subject, then the Roe v Wade decision should be overturned. If I remember correctly, most if not all of the Justices where men.
attacks
This is the biggest fallacy done of these forums. Being male has nothing to do with it because I know many females with the same views as me and the original poster. So right there your arguement is irrelevant. Even more so though, we all understand the situation because we were all once a fetus. I guess, by your own admission, that if you are white you can't say slavery is wrong with any authority. Furthermore, if you were supposed to be aborted and were not yet you are a male you have no say in the issue. LOGICAL FALLACY
