I know at least one person from the Netherlands who owns a pistol. Are you sure that it is ENTIRELY illegal to own a firearm, or is it possible to obtain a permit for one?Also, the whole "school shooting" business in the US is not really any sort of major problem. The thing is, the media reports every single incident making it seem more common than it really is.As far as uses for a gun: In the US lots of people live in rural areas where it could take police about an hour, or even longer, to respond. People in that situation cannot rely on police protection. In addition, our police force is NOT obligated to serve as a protection force for citizens. Instead, our police are supposed to solve crimes after they occur.People in the US grew up with firearms and shooting sports. Hunting, trap and skeet, and target shooting are important parts of American culture. In fact, our government thought it was so important for citizens to be able to use firearms that they created the Civilian Marksmanship Program (CMP). The CMP sells high-powered military surplus rifles at cost, to US citizens.Joszi and Bram, what experience with firearms do you have? Maybe a day at the range would change your opinions. :) pickleweaseler--The US of A (the REAL best country to live [in])

I am afraid, Bram and Joszi, that you have not been exposed to all the facts. For example, your country, the Netherlands, actually has a higher rate of homicide than Norway. In the Netherlands, less than five percent of homes contain legally owned firearms. In Norway, more than thirty percent of homes contain legally owned firearms.In short, Norway has more guns, yet less people killing each other.In fact, a look at the statistics will reveal that homicide rates for developed nations remain fairly level no matter what the volume of firearms available to the public. In fact, I have just such a scatter chart already prepared.

I am from the U.S. Yes I own guns, but the reason I do is because I hunt and they supply the neccasary means to drop an animal so I can eat. So if we don't have guns I cant eat. Are you trying to starve me to death emoticonXConfused because hunting is my main source of meat. I would also like to point out the fact of when you ban guns crime rates increase here in the U.S. so I would like to take the chances of keeping guns in my house to hunt, shoot and keep me safe. If you want the facts for here in the U.S. about guns go to www.justfacts.com/gun_control.htm it shows that guns keep the U.S. safer.

This is true. Less guns doesn't mean less homocide (but it does mean less violent death as my scatter chart from the same data showed). What Adept's chart neatly shows is that the USA is a ridiculously violent country by "developed" country standards. Take away their guns and they'd probably just kill each other with knifes, baseball bats etc.

It is true clive that the rate of violence in the U.S. is high, but you have to look at the other side of the coin, we have a large population in this country and with larger population means more crime. Also look at the crime rate percentage because we have a larger population. But the majority of our crime is done with illegaly owned firearms as well. So if you did take away our guns the criminals who already are getting them illegally will just get more illegally and us law-abiding citizens will be left defensless. It is shown in our history the less legal guns the more illegal gun violence. As shown in Washington D.C. ( that is our country's captial ) they banned all handguns, and in one year the crime in Washington D.C. sky-rocket 200%. But in Florida they adopted the right to carry a concealed firearm and the crime rate decreased 41%. So all you people against guns need to relize more guns in the U.S. makes us safer ( hence we have never been taken over and our government has never been removed) I'll take my chance with my guns.

Not strictly true. In fact, looking at the scatter chart plotted above, the US has a vastly disproportionate rate of homicide (at the time the data was taken).All one can reasonably conclude is that more firearms does not increase the homicide rate, nor does less guns reduce it. The two appear to be un-related.

Ireland (a region wracked by decades of near civil war, military occupation and terrorism).Can you back up this claim?Not true.

In my opinion, there are fundamental problems with cross-national/cultural comparisons of firearm homicide rates. I believe you really are talking about apples and oranges when we try to do this. You can’t compare the Netherlands or England, for example, with the United States and draw any logical conclusions without considering the vast difference in social and economic issues which drive the violence rates. The same problem arises when those on my side of the debate try to compare America with Switzerland, which has an extraordinarily high percentage of private gun owners while enjoying an extraordinarily low violent crime rate. You can’t compare these nation’s crime rates with America’s because the social and economic issues which drive violent crime in these countries are different. I do know this from experience, though. The presence of the weapon does not give rise to the motive to use it for criminal ends. There are no evil little voices calling from the gun cabinet to plague American homeowners. England and the Netherlands have not avoided these sinister voices advocating gun violence with a ban on guns. The people of Switzerland are not collectively so hard of hearing that they have proven immune to the subliminal demands of their guns to be loaded and unleashed on the innocent.I have seen people on my side of the debate argue that if a crime rate drops after a state passes a CCW statute then the deterrent effect of armed citizens must be responsible for the drop. Listen, I am as strong a supporter of the individual RKBA as there is, but I cannot find sufficient evidence to suggest that crime rates go down because we pass a CCW bill. It’s the same problem gun control proponents have: we all want to believe what we want to believe, and we are prepared to claim that a statistical correlation equals cause and effect when it suits our purpose. What I do know, however, is that the overall violent crime rate in America is not tied to the number of privately available firearms. More guns does not equal more violence. Here is why I say this:First see the latest 10 year survey of firearm violence statistics conducted by your government:http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/guns.htm#findingsThis is a sample of what you would find:“Firearm-related crime has plummeted since 1993.”“Nonfatal firearm crime rates have declined since 1994, reaching the lowest level ever recorded in 2002 and 2003.” ”After 1994, the proportion of nonfatal violent incidents involving a firearm declined.”“Incidents involving a firearm represented 7% of the 4.9 million violent crimes of rape and sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated and simple assault.”Now compare this trend of decline in firearm-related violence with the following ATF website, which lists new firearms manufactured for sale by domestic firearms manufacturers from 1998 to 2003 (the latest years available):http://www.atf.treas.gov/firearms/stats/index.htmFrom 98 to 2003, 19,185,247 new firearms were produced for consumer retail in the U.S. by domestic firearms manufacturers. Of these, 5,098,722 were handguns. I can’t say how many were produced from 1993 to 1997, because the web page stats only went back to 1998. Yet, if you look at the year to year stats from 1998 to 2003, you will see a markedly similar number of firearms produced each year by categories of handgun, rifle, and shotgun, which strongly suggests the number of newly available firearms each year from 1993 to 1997 increased at near the same rate. [note: a very small percentage of these firearms were exported out of our market, but likewise this survey does not include the larger number of firearms imported to our market from abroad. Additionally, these statistics exclude NFA controlled firearms like the weapons which were produced for military/law enforcement and not civilian consumption)When you set these two surveys side by side, what you see is this:In the last ten year study, we had a marked decline in firearm violence during a period in which we added millions of new firearms to those available for criminal mischief--nearly 20 million new firearms alone from 1998 to 2003. I cannot say that millions more guns in the civilian marketplace is the cause of this crime rate drop. (in fact, I have another theory for the crime rate drop). What I can say, however, is that adding millions of new firearms to our civilian market did not cause the streets to run red.

Well C14 My quote on 41% decrease is true considering when they adopted it and in 9 years it did go down 41% so that was my claim and it is backed up by facts go the website I provided in my previous statement. Another fact that only 18 of the permit holders ever commited a crime too so it aint the law abiders doin the crime. So it's criminals who don't care about the licenses and laws who are breaking them and the law abiders who are defending themselves. And what if I told you that I myself used a gun in self-defense and that I didn't shoot but it was enough to scare him off? Is that enough proof to show that people like me who are law abiders protect ourselves legally?? How about there are 16 guns in my house not a single one has been used in crime, just in hunting and protection. What about all the hundreds of thousands of people who use guns to defend themselves each year? I'm telling you facts and I have my backup go to either www.justfacts.com/gun_control.htm or www.pulpless.com/gunclock/noframeindex.html There is the facts. Show me proof of legal law-abiding citizens wreaking havoc with there legal guns is more than the percentage of those who have legal guns and don't cause crime and I might believe you that guns cause crime.

Sorry if I wasn't perfectly clear there. I'm talking about people who have had guns for their entire life, got them legaly and are using legaly owned guns in the majority of crime.

Giving them up when everyone who wants to abuse the law can just stock up before disarmament is a bad idea imo.Over here in the UK, we're not saturated with guns.

But why should that be a reason to discriminate against the people who do want to use guns? It has no appreciable effect on homicide rates, and appears to only have a positive effect on violent crime rates.

Well I can think of one good reason to have a gun. Target shooting. It is really fun and it is pretty much a sport. If we all did target shooting our population would be much better marksmen and that means our millitary would be stronger. If you take away the guns there would be none of this. And also if you took away the guns people would use knives or a blunt weapon. There are infinite blunt weapons. Criminals would start making swords. And it is possible this could shoot us back to ancient times although i have to admit that is unlikely. People are always going to hate, there will never be hate, and people will always kill. So ask your self this would you like the victims to experience no pain with a a gun or with lots of pain with blunts or blades? HanselP.S. Netherlands is almost all athiestic, abortion is legal, old people can ask the doctor to kill them, drugs are legal. There are no morals. Are you sure this is the best place to live?

Oh, boy...Criminals would start making swords? You make me laugh. I think that they'd just use clubs and knives, personally. Or they'd still use guns, despite their being illegal. Shoot us back to the ancient times? What do you mean, like when people used knives and heavy objects to kill each other? Please. Get real.And what's this, no pain with a gun?

If we all did target shooting our population would be much better marksmen and that means our millitary would be stronger. If you take away the guns there would be none of this. And also if you took away the guns people would use knives or a blunt weapon. There are infinite blunt weapons. Criminals would start making swords. And it is possible this could shoot us back to ancient times although i have to admit that is unlikely. People are always going to hate, there will never be hate, and people will always kill. So ask your self this would you like the victims to experience no pain with a a gun or with lots of pain with blunts or blades? HanselP.S. Netherlands is almost all athiestic, abortion is legal, old people can ask the doctor to kill them, drugs are legal. There are no morals. Are you sure this is the best place to live?

I'm not questioning the intellegence of other countries. I am just stating that I feel it was a smart move for our country to allow our citizens to carry a firearm, and to protect themselves. If I offended anyone in any way, I appologize I did not wish for my comment to be taken the wrong way. :)Now back to the original discussion on gun control. It does not deter crime here in the states. Some of my supporting facts are that in our nations capital they put a ban on hand guns and their handgun homicide rate sky-rocketed up 200%!! but when they allowed Florida to carry concealed firearms there crime went down, in 9 years there handgun homicide decreased 41%, wow, funny how that works. Gun control in the U.S. does not equal crime control.

Oh, boy. There's another forum devoted to discussing abortion, assisted suicide, and morals. Please go there if you want to discuss it.P.S. the US is largely Christian, anti-homosexual, brain dead people are forced to keep on living by being hooked up to machines, the country's debt just hit 8 trillion dollars, it has one of its most ineffectual presidents ever, it's disliked by most of the rest of the world, and it's got a high rate of violent crime. Are you sure this is the best place to live?

Most 'law-abiding' citizens wouldn't buy guns because it's not really in our culture. If someone wants a gun for practical purposes such as shooting rabbits or putting down horses they can apply to have one. I see no reason why they should get access to handguns however. I don't want any idiot running around with a handgun, nor do I wish to own one myself.-Wez
attacks
But why should that be a reason to discriminate against the people who do want to use guns? It has no appreciable effect on homicide rates, and appears to only have a positive effect on violent crime rates.

Sure. But given that increased gun ownership does not result in increased rates of homicide or violent crime (or any kind of crime, for that matter), is there any rational reason to deny handguns to people who want them?

IMO, no. Unfortunately, logical reasoning normally loses when faced with established cultural presence, belief systems or dominating political manipulation. To many insecure US citizens their cultural nightmare consists of an atheist gay being allowed to marry the same sex and receiving a concealed weapons or class 3 license. In other nations the weapon would be the only perceived negative.

Evidence from a society/country that has gun from no-gun ownership to gun-ownership?I don't mind gun-ownership where it's practical, for example shotguns on farms. Casual handgun ownership does however irk me.-Wez

I feel the same way about SUVs, but that doesn't mean I think it's a good idea to ban them unless you can demonstrate a genuine need for one.

I wouldn't actually be all that opposed to banning SUVs unless you needed on. emoticonXWow With regards to the issue at hand. I don't see why a law-abiding citizen would buy a handgun, other than for 'sport', but I do see reasons why shop-lifters and 'gangs' would get them. Our police don't even have guns most of the time and I quite like it this way. You feel safe, even if statistically, you may not be safer, and to me that means quite a lot.-Wez

Wow. What about TVs?1 - Defence. If I could legally own and carry a handgun for defence, I would. And apart from the odd speeding fine, I'm a totally law-abiding citizen.2 - Fun. Plinking away at targets, or just shooting at stuff is good fun. I used to shoot the pegs of the clothes line with a .22 when I was a kid. Mum didn't like it, but I had a great time.Well thats just wrong. How can you feel safer, even though you know it isn't true? Isn't it better to be just sa safe, perhaps even safer, and to let other people do what they want as well?

Don't mind TVs., just most reality TV.From who and what? In England, the vast majority of burglars just run when confronted. Why should they stay? If you have a baseball bat or sword in your room (as I do), you know any burglar won't be sticking around. If said burglar had a gun though, even if I also had one, it would be different.Drugs, flick-knives and various other things are fun, but I don't want to legalise them.For the same reason people are scared of spiders, small sharks and such things. You know you're safe, but you don’t feel it.I'd dispute "safer" (on lack of evidence) and even "just as safe" as I can't get a gun.-Wez

I bet all those stranded survivors felt safe in New Orleans without guns knowing the Police was there to protect them.How about the Police that went around and confiscated guns from legitimate owners on "thier own property" and not do anything illegal.In some places armed gunowners actually banded together and secured thier neighborhoods and NO looters at all.I wonder what would happen in the UK if such an event were to take place over there.

We would probably sit down with a cup of tea, say jolly and gosh a lot and ask everyone who threatened us to go away(very politely of course) ;)Actually we would not have same problem as New Orleans simply because we would not have gangs of people roaming about with guns threatening people. Mainly because it is very difficult to get a hold of guns in the UK. The only way I see a gun being useful(in the UK) is if there was some sort of Zombie plaque ala Night of Living Dead, if that happens I will try to get a gun.

So you are saying that guns are almost non-existant and basically unavailable over there?Would it be better if there were gangs armed with machete/swords/other weapon? Do you think a whole gang armed with the above would mess with one person with ONE firearm?

Yes, I have never seen a gun, touched one, heard about one getting used in my area(in the UK).The first time I had ever seen a gun was when I went over to Spain on holiday, when I saw the police carrying them in the airport. In fact it felt weird because on the whole even the Police do not carry guns, the only exceptions are armed response units(UK equivalent to SWAT teams).Yes they probably would not mess with that person, but I think you are comparing apples with oranges really.

:)I should clarify my post, I think it is not a valid to compare the New Orleans and the UK.First of all it would be better to select a region of the UK, then you would need to select a Region with a similar Economic problems, same kind of ethnic divisions. Also I may add UK is a very centralised state, unlike the US we don't have a very strong Local Government where the State has a lot of control over disaster control. Traditionally disaster management and recovery will probably be controlled the National Government.

Ever since the 1997 ban in England crimes with firearms has been on the rise.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3195908.stmSo who will keep law and order? Can you rely on your local police to protect you?No...you cannot. You can only rely on yourself and here in the US the Police are NOT obligated to come to your aid so that you are responsible for your own well being.It is very valid.... humans are humans and you WILL have some that steal because it's easier that way. The big difference is do you have anyone willing(or able) to stand up to the bands of thugs when you local police can't come to your "rescue".No thank you...I don't expect them to come save me. It is my duty as a citizen of the US to help maintain law and good order in times of need. People of like minds will band together and help each other get through in great times of need such as Katrina. While others will shrink to the lowest level and not do anything for themselves but prey upon the weak and defenseless.I ask you again...HOW will you in the UK stand up to bands of ARMED (with guns) thugs in the event of a large disaster and the police presence in gone? Don't say it can't happen, because it just did a few months ago.

Dodging the question...eh?Scotland is part of the UK so in effect those stats apply as a whole. So maybe "Scotland" isn't on the rise the Country itself is on the rise even though you have a "ban" that is supposed to make the gun problem go away.Let me see if I can word this so you might understand..."Hypothetically" Hurrican Katrina hits the UK (Scotland to be precise)and...

:p I'd keep it on me, to enable myself to defend myself and my loved ones (and yes, my property as well) from those who would wish me ill. It's not likely I'll ever be attacked, or ever feel like I need a gun. I'll certainly concede that point. However, I don't consider that to be a reason to prohibit me from having one.Alcohol and nicotine are drugs as well. We only ban the ones that are extremely harmful, and cause large ammounts of peripheral crime. And don't contribute to government coffers.On the flipside things like bungee jumping, drinking, rally driving and rock-fishing are dangerous, but we don't ban them.But thats just stupid...Look at the statistics from your own home office. Despite tighter gun laws, crime (interestingly, armed robbery and gun related crime has also increased) has increased across the board. You are more likely to be a victim of crime now, than you were before the gun laws were tightened. Thus, you are less safe. I won't try and link the two, but the fact remains.If you cannot demonstrate that more citizens owning guns leads to more violent crime, if the stats in fact support the opposite, what reason is there to ban guns?

You can of course compare that to something like "people feel safer with all [insert ethnic minority here] dead" or something similar, which is fair enough. However, I don't see anyone other than gun traders, 'losing out' with illegal guns. If anyone really feels threatened, by all means they can go out and buy a shotgun, that's fine by me.

Obviously tarawa12 he doesn't relize the fact of putting a scenrio to play. Also I would like to point out that if they don't need them there the threat might not be high. But here in the U.S. the threat is high, they need to relize that here we do, it is a freedom, it is non-negotiable so they need to stop talking about our freedoms being bad. Because what if we didn't save them during the reign of Hitler? Hitler would have invaded and the average citizen would have been rounded up and thrown in camps like it happened to the jews. Honestly I still think they are mad that when we had guns we revolted and broke away, and they don't want that happening again. :) Ask Hitler, Gun control works.

By all measures, I'd be considered a gun nut. I collect them, display them, use them, kill animals with them, even built a couple from components and consider that my privilege under the laws of my country (US). I do not critique the gun laws of other countries, nor do I attempt to impose my country's firearms mentality on them. While your statement sounds like a great NRA ad, the US is a violent country and our socio/economic circumstances are far different than any other country. Having the highest per-capita rate of incarceration in the developed world allows other countries to understand why we prefer being personally armed.

Let me tell you one of the reasons why I fight to protect my RKBA, Bram and Joszi. I believe that the Bill of Rights to my constitution (including the RKBA) is the greatest pronouncement of civil liberties which has ever been assembled to restrain a government from oppressing those it was created to serve. It is no coincidence that the Bill of Rights was drafted by revolutionaries who took up arms to secure their freedom. Many people in my country today view the revolutionary war as one fought against England as if it were a foreign power. Too many have forgotten that in reality my founding fathers fought their own government--a government that was bent on disarming them and using its standing army to oppress them. My nation was born from the courage of those who fought their own government and wrested from its grip the possession of the basic rights of man. When it came time to form a new government, these same men pledged to form one which would protect their natural and inalienable rights--the rights to life, liberty, property, and pursuit of happiness listed in their Declaration of Independence from tyranny. To preserve these natural rights, they chose to shackle their new government with the obligation to recognize certain civil liberties—liberties which by their nature preserve and protect these natural rights. The right to keep and bear arms was one of these civil liberties: “Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States. A military force, at the command of Congress, can execute no laws, but such as the people perceive to be just and constitutional; for they will possess the power, and jealousy will instantly inspire the inclination, to resist the execution of a law which appears to them unjust and oppress.” Noah Webster, "An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution" (1787) in Pamphlets on the Constitution of the United States (P. Ford, 1888).See also the great Anti-Federalist Patrick Henry, who urged the rejection of a constitution which did not enshrine protections for civil liberties, including the RKBA: “Is it necessary for your liberty, that you should abandon those great rights by the adoption of this system?. . . Will the abandonment of your most sacred rights tend to the security of your liberty?. . . .I am fearful I have lived long enough to become an old fashioned fellow: Perhaps an invincible attachment to the dearest rights of man, may, in these refined enlightened days, be deemed old fashioned: If so, I am contented to be so. . . . Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it, but downright force: Whenever you give up that force, you are inevitably ruined. . . .My great objection to this Government is, that it does not leave us the means of defending our rights; or, of waging war against tyrants. . . .The Honorable Gentleman who presides, told us, that to prevent abuses in our Government, we will assemble in Convention, recall our delegated powers, and punish our servants for abusing the trust reposed in them. Oh, Sir, we should have fine times indeed, if to punish tyrants, it were only sufficient to assemble the people. Your arms wherewith you could defend yourselves, are gone. . . . Did you ever read of any revolution in any nation, brought about by the punishment of those in power, inflicted by those who had no power at all? You read of a riot act in a country [England] which is called one of the freest in the world, where a few neighbors cannot assemble without the risk of being shot by hired soldiery, the engines of despotism. We may see such an act in America. A standing army we shall have also, to execute the execrable commands of tyranny: And how are you to punish them? Will you order them to be punished? Who shall obey these orders? Will your Mace-bearer be a match for a disciplined regiment? In what situation are we to be? . . . .What resistance could be made? The attempt would be madness.” Patrick Henry, Speeches of June 5 and 7, 1788, before the Virginia Ratifying Convention, reprinted in The Anti-Federalist Papers and the Constitutional Convention Debates, pages 199-216, Mentor Books, 1986, edited by Ralph Ketchum.This was the spirit of the times, Bram and Joszi, when these revolutionaries considered how best to frame protections for their liberties. When my Bill of Rights was drafted, it accepted Henry’s criticism and included an individual RKBA:“Mr. Madison has introduced his long expected amendments. . . .It contains a bill of rights [including] . . . .the right to keep and bear arms.” Fisher Ames, 1 Works of Fisher Ames, pp. 52-53 (1854) [Letter to Thomas Dwight, June 11, 1789].“The rights of conscience, of bearing arms, of changing the government, are declared to be inherent in the people.” Fisher Ames, 1 Works of Fisher Ames, pp. 53-54 (1854) [Letter to F. I. Minoe, June 12, 1789].“Last Monday, a string of amendments were presented to the lower house; these altogether respected personal liberty. . .  .” William Grayson, 3 Patrick Henry, p. 391 (1951) [letter from Grayson to Henry, June 12, 1789].Why and individual RKBA, you might ask? For the reason set forth by one of the founders, who explained the purpose of the 2nd. Amendment as follows: “As civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens, the people are confirmed by the article in their right to keep and bear private arms.” Tench Coxe, Remarks on the First Part of the Amendments to the Federal Constitution. Published under the pseudonym, "A Pennsylvanian" in the Philadelphia Federal Gazette, June 18, 1789 at 2 Col. 1. (Emphasis added)Here is my point, Bram and Joszi. These lofty ideals of securing individual liberty are often lost on today’s generation. Many of my countrymen today gladly live under the shelter of these rights, yet they would not lift a finger to defend them if attacked by opportunists who argue that these fundamental rights must yield to the goal of some present day expediency. For many these rights have become bland clichés which deserve nothing more than lip service as defense from encroachment.You will find that within my country there are great differences of opinion on this subject. If you follow the confirmation process of the newly-appointed Supreme Court justice candidate you may even see the issue of the RKBA addressed in that forum. Indeed, I think the discussion of the RKBA likely during this confirmation process, because there are those involved in the process who would attack the RKBA as anachronistic and even dangerous. Those who believe that it should be separated from its sister rights and abolished, that the government should no longer be forced to respect this basic right of man. In my opinion, it is because of men and women like this that my rights are protected by a constitution: “The great ideals of liberty and equality are preserved against the assaults of opportunism, the expediency of the passing hour, the erosion of small encroachments, the scorn and derision of those who have no patience with general principles, by enshrining them in constitutions, and consecrating to the task of their protection a body of defenders.” Justice Benjamin Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process, New Haven, 1921.In my opinion, Bram and Joszi, those who attack my RKBA because they personally dislike the right unwittingly weaken the entire fabric of my constitutional liberties. By attacking one liberty they view with disgust, they encourage others to exercise the same zeal in attacking liberties that they happen to be biased against. This is the primary reason why I oppose such opportunistic demagoguery seeking to ban my RKBA. Even if I were not a gun owner, and this were the only reason I had to consider the RKBA, then I would still defend it for this principle alone.---“Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.” Justice Brandeis, Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 485 (1928).

By all measures, I'd be considered a gun nut. I collect them, display them, use them, kill animals with them, even built a couple from components and consider that my privilege under the laws of my country (US). I do not critique the gun laws of other countries, nor do I attempt to impose my country's firearms mentality on them. While your statement sounds like a great NRA ad, the US is a violent country and our socio/economic circumstances are far different than any other country. Having the highest per-capita rate of incarceration in the developed world allows other countries to understand why we prefer being personally armed.

Our gun crime is, compared to many other Western countries, low. We have guns, just not very many.Protect me from who and what? You might have roaming armed gangs on the streets (at times), but we certainly don't. You can compare our two countries' crime rates if you want to and see why many in the UK see no need for guns.-Wez

The japanese started in the market as cheap, entry level vehicles.

Their quality was garbage and they knew it, but there was not a lot of option for a long time. When the japanese imports finally got it "right", it was too late for American automakers.

How does this equate to being a "sissy" if you own a gun for self defense?Actually, if you buy a gun for self defense, the most likely outcome is that you will never shoot ANYBODY with it. Next in line is that you will use it in self defense, most likely after that is that you will intentionally shoot yourself with it (suicide) and finally, there is a very slim chance that you will accidentaly shoot yourself with it. Ironically enough, nearly 90% of accidental self inflicted gunshot wounds are cops who for whatever reason can't seem to remember basic safety rules when dealing with firearms.This isn't really a valid argument. Whether you want to kill yourself or not has little bearing on the issue at hand and thsoe who accidentally shot themselves...well...a little chlorine in the gene pool isn't always a bad thing. I mean, a gun is not a particularly complicated piece of machinery, and there is really only one dangerous end. If you can't figure out how to operate it without shooting yourself, any offspring youare likely to have would just serve to further the geentic degredation of the human race. The last thing we need is more XXXXXX breeding.

Next in line is that you will use it in self defense, most likely after that is that you will intentionally shoot yourself with it (suicide) and finally, there is a very slim chance that you will accidentaly shoot yourself with it. Ironically enough, nearly 90% of accidental self inflicted gunshot wounds are cops who for whatever reason can't seem to remember basic safety rules when dealing with firearms.This isn't really a valid argument. Whether you want to kill yourself or not has little bearing on the issue at hand and thsoe who accidentally shot themselves...well...a little chlorine in the gene pool isn't always a bad thing. I mean, a gun is not a particularly complicated piece of machinery, and there is really only one dangerous end. If you can't figure out how to operate it without shooting yourself, any offspring youare likely to have would just serve to further the geentic degredation of the human race. The last thing we need is more XXXXXX breeding.

believe it or not, some people actually enjoy shooting as a hobby. Although I haven't shot in years, I like knowing that when the spirit moves me, I can. In the meantime, anybody that tries to break into my house will suffer acute lead poisoning, guaranteed.BTW, my brother actually used his gun to prevent a burgulry of his house. His wife woke him up as someone was trying to get in the front door. My brother threw open the door holding a gun in his hand and the perp damn near shat himself. emoticonXWow

If you buy a gun for self defense, the most likely outcome is that you will never shoot anybody with it?Why buy one in the first place?Sounds paranoid to me.

The vast majority of vehicles never need their spare tire. Do you throw it away, or haul it around in the trunk because only a complete idiot runs around without a spare? A gun is the same way. You hope you never need it, and odds are that you won't. BUT, when you DO need it, you need it RIGHT NOW, you need it REALLY BAD, and nothing else will substitute quite as well. Is is paranoid to accept that there are bad people in this world, and that if you come up against one of them, nobody is going to be able to help you but you? No. That is simply reality. To refuse to accept that is delusional at best. Basically, if you are willing to take a long hard look at the world, accept the fact that there are some unsavory elements in it, and take responsibility for ensuring your own safety, and the safety of your loved ones, then you should probably have a gun. If, on the other hand, you prefer to pretend that the world is all flowers and sunshine, or are too cowardly or insecure to take responsibility for your family, then you probably don't need one.Besides, as JP points out, shooting can be fun. I have participated in multiple mistol events and machine gun shoots, and they are always a good time. I have a pretty good sized gun collection ranging from italian dueling pistols to M-60 machine guns. In many cases, your guns are also a good investment, especially when it comes to machine guns. My wife about blew her top at one time because I spent a small fortune on a crate of M-60 machine guns. Those guns are now worth about 20x what I paid for them.

Most likely no one will try to break into your house. Do you still lock your door? Most likely you'll never get into a major car accident. Do you still wear a seatbelt? Most people won't have their house get destroyed. Do you still buy insurance? Are you just paranoid?

WRONG. We already covered this. Even if we go with your wording, which forces us to use shootings as opposed to defensive use in general (which would be a more proper measure) you are still statistically safer having a gun than not.In reality, the number of accidental shootings is very low. It looks like a big number, because you are working from a pool of 300,000,000 people. In 2001, there were only 804 accidental shooting deaths nationwide. That is .00000268% of the population. Lott ahs a bit about accidental shootings at http://www.lewrockwell.com/lott/lott19.html He DID miss something, though. In addition to cars and bathtubs, toilets and 5 gallon buckets also kill more children than guns do, and certainly kill MANY more accidentally.

Exactly the way I look at gun ownership for personal protection. I may never need them for that purpose, but like other forms of readily available and inexpensive insurance I'd have only myself to blame for being without it in a time of need.

Actually I don't think I have a spare tire either. Basically the dealer tightens them so much that we literally can't get the tires off without their equipment. We found that out last time we needed new tires. Luckily the tires were still ok to drive on, so we drove in and had them change the tires.

First of all, what the heck is "gun-ho"? I think the term you were looking for is "gung-ho" which is a term borrowed from the Chinese meaning "enthusiastic." It has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with actual firearms. Secondly, are you really ignorant enough to believe that only American culture has violence in TV and video games? Japanese CARTOONS depict graphic violence and even sex frequently. Have you actually read anything about the real old west or do you get all your information from movies? You sound like a whiny, angry, anti-American that has no clue what you are even talking about. This is clearly displayed by your last line which you make an idiotic generalization about every American's favorite movie line. Do you know every American personally? By the way, the line is "I love the smell of napalm in the morning."

Do not attempt to associate the gun with violence. A gun is a life saving tool in the hands of a great citizen, and in the hands of a criminal, its deadly. Guns have no effect on crime, as statistics have shown. Violence does. Why do you view the gun different than any other tool, such as a screwdriver, or a hammer? Airplanes are much more dangerous, and have the possibility to do much more harm than guns, so why arent you associating airplanes with violence?A gun is an inaminate object. There is a difference between a gun and a bomb. A bomb wipes out everyone in a set area, and you cannot control who dies. With a gun, you know excatlcy who you are shooting, and you cannot kill more than 1 or 2 people with 1 bullet. I really dont understand why Anti-gun zealots dont go after banning cars, or airplanes, or other dangerous machines.You are one of the people the Brady Campaign has brainwashed. You associate guns with "bad" or "violence" when they are far from it. A gun is a tool, and everyone should learn how to use that tool safely. It is also our freedom.Remember the holocaust? Imagine what would've happened if all of the jews had guns. There probably wouldn't have been as many jews tortured and killed, and a lot of germans probably would've had their head blown off, which is good. I also dont see why Anti-gun zealots arent trying to clamp down on crime instead of guns.http://www.putfile.com/pic.php?img=3706480

Guns and violence appear in every form of art and entertainment; it is engrained in the culture as a symbol of power, freedom and even sensuality. Every boy grows up learning violence from TV and games, where violence is glorified. Problems are always solved with violence. Charlton Heston said that the reason Americans need there guns is because America was founded in violence. The old Wild West movies depict the beginning of a gun-ho America where everything is settled with the gun. Today we have an America that is equally as gun-ho but at an international scale with MOABS, cluster bombs, Tomahawk missiles, napalm bombs and nuclear weapons. “I love napalm in the morning” for example, is every American’s favourite movie line.

The USA spends more money in weaponry than the rest of the world combined. It’s obsession with guns harks back to its war of Independence. It’s insecurity has spread thru the American psyche across the generations like a disease. Americans are a bunch of insecure little boys who think that guns transform them in macho men.

Do not attempt to associate the gun with violence. A gun is a life saving tool in the hands of a great citizen, and in the hands of a criminal, its deadly. Guns have no effect on crime, as statistics have shown. Violence does. Why do you view the gun different than any other tool, such as a screwdriver, or a hammer? Airplanes are much more dangerous, and have the possibility to do much more harm than guns, so why arent you associating airplanes with violence?A gun is an inaminate object. There is a difference between a gun and a bomb. A bomb wipes out everyone in a set area, and you cannot control who dies. With a gun, you know excatlcy who you are shooting, and you cannot kill more than 1 or 2 people with 1 bullet. I really dont understand why Anti-gun zealots dont go after banning cars, or airplanes, or other dangerous machines.You are one of the people the Brady Campaign has brainwashed. You associate guns with "bad" or "violence" when they are far from it. A gun is a tool, and everyone should learn how to use that tool safely. It is also our freedom.Remember the holocaust? Imagine what would've happened if all of the jews had guns. There probably wouldn't have been as many jews tortured and killed, and a lot of germans probably would've had their head blown off, which is good. I also dont see why Anti-gun zealots arent trying to clamp down on crime instead of guns.http://www.putfile.com/pic.php?img=3706480

You seem very sensitive to any opposing views. Lighten up! I agree that it’s not just Americans that are obsessed with violence. All you need to do is go to a football match in the UK to see the joys of violence. My point is that art and entertainment glorifies violence, and that our children are brought up with this pollution of violence on TV, movies and games. Another reason why guns are so available in the US is because the Arms industry thrives on it, therefore they can afford to have many lobbyists ensuring that gun laws are never introduced, which is the same reason why America is always involved in wars. The arms industry kills more people than the tobacco industry, yet it is cigarettes that are banned, not guns.

First of all, what the heck is "gun-ho"? I think the term you were looking for is "gung-ho" which is a term borrowed from the Chinese meaning "enthusiastic." It has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with actual firearms. Secondly, are you really ignorant enough to believe that only American culture has violence in TV and video games? Japanese CARTOONS depict graphic violence and even sex frequently. Have you actually read anything about the real old west or do you get all your information from movies? You sound like a whiny, angry, anti-American that has no clue what you are even talking about. This is clearly displayed by your last line which you make an idiotic generalization about every American's favorite movie line. Do you know every American personally? By the way, the line is "I love the smell of napalm in the morning."

Hi Shootandproud,Judging by you choice of name and attire, you are obviously obsessed with things that shoot and kill. You say that these are just tools, such as a screwdriver, and that guns and violence are not related. You say that I’ve been brainwashed yet your arguments come straight from the pro gun lobbyists. The love for guns and military equipment is inherently human. I can understand how an F15 or an Apache helicopter can be seductive, especially to a young mind. Men have a need to be in control with the power to defend themselves, and guns make all men equal. It gives man the ability to feel secure. Without a gun a man feels naked, defenceless, and insecure. My opinion is that men with guns are cowards, and the obsession with guns is perverse.If you need to defend yourself use a pepper-spray. Very effective and doesn’t kill anyone.

You need to understand statistics. A person can commit a violent crime without using a gun. Muggings, burglaries, rapes, assault and battery are all examples of violent crimes that don't require a gun. Guns may be used in such crimes, but often that adds a completely new charge like "assault with a deadly weapon." Please apply some common sense. What do the majority of gun owners use their guns for? Hunting, sport, and self-defense. People who use guns to commit crimes against other citizens are in the minority of the population. Gun laws are only going to harm law-abiding citizens. By definition, laws will not affect the behavior of criminals. If they are obeying the laws, they wouldn't be criminals in the first place, right? Think about it. If you were a criminal, would you rather target somebody who is unarmed or somebody who has a gun?

Do you really think he could have killed 30+ people if they had all been shooting back?Do you actually believe he legally owned and registered the guns he used?Do you really think that he would have followed the law in regards to firearms ownership, after he had consciously decided to break the law in regards to murder?First you need a few handy facts.1 - Crimes commited with guns is a meaningless statistic. If X people are killed, then X people are killed, and it doesn't matter if they were shot, or beaten to death with a high-heeled shoe.2 - Gun laws were tightened in England and Australia in 1996.After we absorb those two facts, we can then look at rates of reported crime:http://www.crimestatistics.org.uk/output/Page39.asphttp://www.aic.gov.au/stats/crime/violence.htmlBy which we can see that rates of violent crime (including assault, homicide and sexual assault) have either remained constant, or actually increased despite the tightening of firearms laws and expensive gun buy-back schemes.How is that relevant?If one country has 300 murders, but they were all stabbed, is it a safer country that has fifty murders where the victims were shot? No, of course not.What if you were to ban guns, and the second country now has sixty murders, who were all stabbed. Deaths caused by guns has dropped by 100%! But the country is still less safe.

Our children are brought up with the poison of violence from the day they are born. In some European countries for example, sex in movies doesn’t offend as much as violence in movies, in the US it’s the opposite. This doesn’t mean that Americans are more violent than Europeans, but it does show that arts and culture does have an influence on the population.2. There wouldn’t be as many guns in the streets (and there would be less wars) if the Arms industry didn’t need to make even more of a profit, and there would be more gun control in America if it didn’t bow to the interest of the Arms industry. Unfortunately, most of our lawmakers also have shares in the arms industry, which means that the way things are now; Americans are free game for the Arms industry, just as they were for the tobacco industry, until something was done.A last word on statistics: statistics would have us believe that more guns leads to less violence. Just the tobacco industry led us to believe that smoking didn’t lead to lung cancer.

Oh, i misunderstood you. I thought you were trying to dismiss my arguments because you thought i was addicted to guns.I say, america has a violence problem, not a gun problem. Guns wont fix our violence problem, only we can.The Tobacco statistics were proved false, but the gun control statistics are raw numbers conducted by the government, with no speculation. Tobacco statistics require a lot of speculation. The arms industry is making better guns at a faster and cheaper rate.

I disagree. Guns are part of what makes a civilized society. Without them, the biggest and the most violent are free to prey on the smaller and weaker at will. it is the law of the jungle. There is an old saying "God created men, Sam Colt made them equal". There is some degree of truth to this. Metered application of force in order to control the population is what makes a society civilized.

Neither are televisions. Your point?By the by, I have yet to recieve a response to this...First you need a few handy facts.1 - Crimes commited with guns is a meaningless statistic. If X people are killed, then X people are killed, and it doesn't matter if they were shot, or beaten to death with a high-heeled shoe.2 - Gun laws were tightened in England and Australia in 1996.After we absorb those two facts, we can then look at rates of reported crime:http://www.crimestatistics.org.uk/output/Page39.asphttp://www.aic.gov.au/stats/crime/violence.htmlBy which we can see that rates of violent crime (including assault, homicide and sexual assault) have either remained constant, or actually increased despite the tightening of firearms laws and expensive gun buy-back schemes.

Interestingly enough, there was a letter to the editor in the National Post (Canadian newspaper) today regarding Australia's gun laws.The author is Philip Alpers, a professor at the University of Sydney.Unfortunately you must be a subscriber to access the article online but I will summarize the key points:-from 1986-96 Australia suffered 11 mass shootings (5+ people killed) in which 100 people were shot dead. This includes the tasmania shooting in 1996 that killed 35 and seriously wounded 18 people-The tasmania gunman was law-abiding until that day when he shot 53 innocent people, and he used a legal semi-automatic weapon-12 days later John Howard introduced gun laws, for example banning semi-automatic long guns -In the decade since then there have been no mass shootings-In the 7 years after the reforms Australia's overall toll of firearm fatalities fell from a 17-year average of 617 to an annual average of 331-the robbery rate and the proportion of robberies involving a firearm fell to 10-year lowsPhilip Alpers concludes that stringently limiting access to guns lessens the risk they pose to public health and safety.Thoughts?

Neither are televisions. Your point?By the by, I have yet to recieve a response to this...First you need a few handy facts.1 - Crimes commited with guns is a meaningless statistic. If X people are killed, then X people are killed, and it doesn't matter if they were shot, or beaten to death with a high-heeled shoe.2 - Gun laws were tightened in England and Australia in 1996.After we absorb those two facts, we can then look at rates of reported crime:http://www.crimestatistics.org.uk/output/Page39.asphttp://www.aic.gov.au/stats/crime/violence.htmlBy which we can see that rates of violent crime (including assault, homicide and sexual assault) have either remained constant, or actually increased despite the tightening of firearms laws and expensive gun buy-back schemes.

It is the #1 thing that keeps a civilized society civilized. Almost all civilized socitys today have guns. Remember before guns were invented? You call that civilized? Maybe we have different ideas of what the word "civilized" mean.

Gun control has very little effect on crime. Look at Switzerland, where everybody owns an AK47, AK74, M16, M4, MP5 etc, and there is very little crime. Now look at the UK, crime spike ever since they established gun control. Now look at Japan, the most Draconian gun laws, yet very little crime. Now look at California and New York, very high crime and a lot of gun control. Now look at Vermont, they enacted Right-To-Carry laws awhile ago and have had very little crime ever since. Now look at Illinois, with very strict gun control. Now look at Virginia, very low Gun control and Very low crime. Now look at Canada, same availibility of guns as in the US, and very little crime. It doesnt make sense. I think Violence and culture effect crime, not guns.

Actually, he killed 35 and wounded 22.No, he was using an illegally obtained prohibited AR15.12 days later John Howard introduced gun laws, for example banning semi-automatic long guns -In the decade since then there have been no mass shootings[/quote]Discounting of course the Monash shooting 2002. Of course, he only managed to kill two people and wound five others (not for lack of trying) so can conveniently be ignored for the sake of making a dramatic point.Meanwhile, rates of homicide have remained constant. How lucky for those 286 people that they were beaten, strangled, stabbed or poisoned, rather than being shot.Interesting. Mr Alpers perhaps forgot to mention that rates of armed robbery doubled between 1997 and 1996? I'm sure he meant to mention it.I think a quick look at the Australian Institute of Criminology reveals Mr Alpers, who I have no doubt is genuine in his concern for public safety, as incorrect. People are still killing one another at the same rate, and people are more likely to be assaulted, robbed or sexually assaulted. I believe that people could be made safer by increasing funding to hospitals, increasing police numbers, and carefully analysing the efficacy of the legal system.

Sorry if I wasn't perfectly clear there. I'm talking about people who have had guns for their entire life, got them legaly and are using legaly owned guns in the majority of crime. It is not the legal gun doing the crime it is the illegaly owned guns, so if you take my guns the criminals have no one to stop them since they have guns we don't. Sorry bout that not so clear statement that is what I meant.

I have said this before, but I’ll repeat it again. I have been fighting violence in all its forms for years. I do not believe that we have a gun violence problem in America. I believe we have a violence problem. I do not believe that gun control is the answer to this problem because it does not address the root of the problem. Instead of focusing on the more difficult question of why someone would feel justified or feel the need to take another person’s life, I see gun control advocates taking the easy, feel good route of blaming the inanimate object the killer used to act out his desire. I view it to be about as effective as re-arranging the deck chairs on the Titanic that were knocked askew by the collision with the iceberg. It makes you feel good because it is a visible sign that you re-imposed some order on a chaotic situation, but it does not save lives. What gun control does is make the innocent suffer for the crimes of the guilty. It tells millions of people that they should be marginalized,--that their lawful, safe ownership of private property should be criminalized. Listen, I also like beer. Just like my firearms, I use alcohol in moderation, and have never once been a problem for others or myself because of my use of this lawful product. If prohibition returned today, I imagine it would be in the guise of something like this: I get a knock on my door from the police demanding that I give up the Michelob in my fridge. When I ask them why, they say “because we just caught a guy driving drunk who hit somebody across town, and now you have to surrender your alcohol because we have decided that it is just too dangerous to allow anyone to have it.” Take a pause and ask yourself how you would respond to such a demand on your front doorstep. I would tell them, politely, to go to hell.Now ask yourself why my answer should be different when the property sought to be taken from me costs much, much more, and where I also believe it is protected as a fundamental civil right? ---“The great ideals of liberty and equality are preserved against the assaults of opportunism, the expediency of the passing hour, the erosion of small encroachments, the scorn and derision of those who have no patience with general principles, by enshrining them in constitutions, and consecrating to the task of their protection a body of defenders.” Justice Benjamin Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process, Lecture II, 1921.“Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent.

The shooting will probably decrease. To compensate, the stabbings, beatings and stranglings will increase.If we follow on from the increase in assault, homicide and robbery after the Howard government tightened gun laws in 1996, we would probably see a severe spike in those areas. At least, thats what the evidence seems to suggest.By the by, you still haven't addressed my previous post with regards to the effects of restricting guns on rates of crime.

Exactly why our society would be safer with them. Think about it. Look at the big picture, not the narrow-minded one.Lets make a scenario, what if everyone ages 12+ carried a handgun, and knew basic gun safety. There would be virtually no crime, because if you tried to commit a crime with your gun, then someone else would shoot you. It makes society a safer place by deterring crime.Lets make another:A baseball bat weilding man breaks into your house at 3am in the morning, what do you do?With gun control: You call 911 and hide in your closet, but unfortunately the crazy assailent kills you before the poliece arrive.Without gun control: You grab your smithy 66 revolver under your bead, and shoot the burglar dead.If you're unarmed when an armed assailent breaks into your house, you should already be making funeral arrangements.I want to be calling 911 to be telling them that i just shot an intruder, i dont want to be calling 911 because im about to be shot. You will never disarm the criminals, and most people use their guns for targets or hunting anyway."Someone mugged and murdered isnt morally superior to someone with a smoking barrel and a dead assailent at their feet".

Why not incapacitate the assailant with a taser until the police arrive?If a crazy man with a baseball bat broke in at 3 am and you feared for your life, I would say he was intending to murder or seriously injure you because if he wanted to steal your stuff he would have broken in during the day when most people are not at home.

For instance, I understand why a gang member would feel the need to sleep with a gun under the pillow.However, it seems like paranoid behaviour to me. I live in a safe community; I cannot think of a single instance of violent crime in the 4 years I have been here. Nevertheless, a security guard patrols outside my building. So someone who wants to break into my room at 3am will have to get past a security guard, break into my unit, and climb a few flights of stairs to reach my locked, secure bedroom door. I am not involved in crime at all, nor are my friends or family. In short I don't believe anyone has any reason to harm me.Therefore I sleep just fine at night without a gun.Also, you say that in the scenario with gun control you do not have a gun.

The same reason we don't give our soldiers tasers when we send them off to war. When police use tasers, their backup ius generally another officer holding a shotgun or a submachine gun. A taser is a great thing, if you have a shotgun pointed at the guys head as well. Otherwise, the only way to be sure to stop the bad guy is to kill the bad guy. It sounds to me like you have basically had to resort to locking yourself in a fortress with multiple levels of security in order to feel safe. Sad. Really sad.

A taser is only effective at a very close range, and mace or OC is only effective if you point it at the face. Keep in mind that everyone doesnt live in a gated, guarded, and locked community. You probably dont need a gun, but some people in more unsafe communities, or just for sporting pursposes do.

Makes you think, doesnt it Winston?Japan also has a cultural difference. You should think of countrys like Austrailia or the UK, ever since gun control, there has been a crime spike. Also makes you think, doesnt it? It seems you want to make this country as dangerous as Austrailia or the UK.And for the record, i will not argue with your flawed opinion on hunting, because this usually leads nowhere.*Applause*

give every man woman and child a gun and let them fend off for themselves. what a great idea!! we can do away with the Police, security guards etc. Give Bush a gun and do away with the Secret Service. Just like in Iraq today and what a great place that is.Guns are only killing machines be it for killing humans or animals. The so called hunters are just killers hiding behind the word: sport.All guns ought to be banned. And every country would become as safe as Japan.

I agree with your last statement. As a matter of fact it was going to be covered by AM on ABC radio today; unfortunately I missed it, forgot to tune to the ABC while drivng to workI remember that subsequently to the gun controls laws, the ownership of swords, knives, machetes, hunting bows etc was also controlled.

Only a vegan can claim no guilt over killing animals, and even they have to destroy life to live. At least a hunter is honest about what he (or she) does.So how can you explain the rises in assault, robbery, homicide and sexual assault after Australian gun laws were tightened in 1996? I think it's a pressing question which you need to answer, lest your credibility be irretrievably shattered.

I agree that guns kill. I agree that a firearm ownership ban coupled with effective confiscation methods would dramatically reduce the number of murders committed by individuals with firearms. But I do not believe that a gun ban will make us any safer. Gun control has ever been the tool tyrants use to consolidate power. Here are some examples: “The inhabitants of Boston being confined within that town by the general their governor, and having, in order to procure their dismission, entered into a treaty with him, it was stipulated that the said inhabitants having deposited their arms with their own magistrates, should have liberty to depart, taking with them their own effects. They accordingly delivered up their arms, but in open violation of honor, in defiance of the obligation of treaties, which even savage nations esteemed sacred, the governor ordered the arms deposited as aforesaid, that they might be preserved for their owners, to be seized by a body of soldiers; detained the greatest part of the inhabitants in the town, and compelled the few who were permitted to retire, to leave their most valuable effects behind.The general, further emulating his ministerial masters, by a proclamation bearing date on the 12th. of June, after venting the grossest falsehoods and calumnies against the good people of these colonies, proceeds to '[D]eclare them all, either by name or description, to be rebels and traitors, to supersede the course of the common law, and instead thereof to publish and order the use and exercise of the law martial.'”The DECLARATION OF THE CAUSES AND NECESSITY OF TAKING UP ARMS (July 6, 1775).---“That no freedman, free negro or mulatto. . .not licensed to do so by the board of police of his or her county, shall keep or carry fire-arms of any kind, or any ammunition, dirk or bowie knife. . . .” Laws of Mississippi, 1865, p. 165 (November 29, 1865).“In Mississippi rebel State forces, men who were in the rebel armies, are traversing the State, visiting the freedmen, disarming them, perpetrating murders and outrages on them. . . .”-- Congressional Globe, 39th. Congress, 1st. Session, part 1, at p. 40 (December 13, 1865) [Speech of Senator Henry Wilson (Republican-Massachusetts)]“Editor Loyal Georgian: Have colored persons a right to own and carry firearms?--A Colored CitizenAlmost every day we are asked questions similar to the above. We answer certainly you have the same right to own and carry arms that other citizens have. You are not only free but citizens of the United States and as such entitled to the same privileges granted to other citizens by the Constitution. . . .Article II, of the amendments to the Constitution of the United States, gives the people the right to bear arms, and states that this right shall not be infringed. Any person, white or black, may be disarmed if convicted of making an improper or dangerous use of weapons, but no military or civil officer has the right or authority to disarm any class of people, thereby placing them at the mercy of others. All men, without distinction of color, have the right to keep and bear arms to defend their homes, families or themselves.” From issues of the Loyal Georgian, January 20, 27 and February 3, 1866.---“Among the many misdeeds of the British rule in India, history will look upon the Act of depriving a whole nation of arms, as the blackest.” 2 M. Gandhi, An Autobiography of the Story of My Experiments with the Truth, (M. Desai, trans. 1927).---“The most foolish mistake we could possibly make would be to allow the subject races to possess arms. History shows that all conquerors who have allowed their subject races to carry arms have prepared their own downfall by so doing. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that the supply of arms to the underdogs is a sine qua non for the overthrow of any sovereignty. So let's not have any native militia or native police. German troops alone will bear the sole responsibility for the maintenance of law and order throughout the occupied Russian territories, and a system of military strong-points must be evolved to cover the entire occupied country.” Adolf Hitler, dinner talk on April 11, 1942, quoted in Hitler's Table Talk 1941-44: His Private Conversations, Second Edition (1973), Pg. 425-426.---“With a basis in § 31 of the Weapons Law of 18 March 1928 (Reichsgesetzblatt I, p. 265), Article III of the Law on the Reunification of Austria with Germany of 13 March 1938 (Reichsgesetzblatt I, p. 237), and § 9 of the Fuhrer and Chancellor's decree on the administration of the Sudeten-German districts of 1 October 1928 (Reichsgesetzblatt 1, p. 1331 ) are the following ordered:§ 1Jews (§ 5 of the First Regulations of the German Citizenship Law of 14 November 1935, Reichsgesetzblatt 1, p. 1332) are prohibited from acquiring, possessing, and carrying firearms and ammunition, as well as truncheons or stabbing weapons. Those now possessing weapons and ammunition are at once to turn them over to the local police authority.§ 2Firearms and ammunition found in a Jew's possession will be forfeited to the government without compensation.§ 3The Minister of the Interior may make exceptions to the Prohibition in § 1 for Jews who are foreign nationals. He can entrust other authorities with this power.§ 4Whoever willfully or negligently violates the provisions of § 1 will be punished with imprisonment and a fine. In especially severe cases of deliberate violations, the punishment is imprisonment in a penitentiary for up to five years.§ 5For the implementation if this regulation, the Minister of the Interior waives the necessary legal and administrative provisions.§ 6This regulation is valid in the state of Austria and in the Sudeten-German districts. Berlin, 11 November 1938Minister of the Interior Frick” http://www.jpfo.org/NaziLawEnglish.htm ---We have seen many oppressive governments in the last century. Can anyone here name a Latin American dictator, or Fascist or Communist head of state, who did not favor the use of gun control as a means to maintain power? Could it happen in my country? Ask the descendants of those newly freed slaves in the south. Ask your Japanese American friends whether their parents were allowed to possess firearms during their incarceration in American internment camps. Ask your Native American friends if they felt safer because of laws which denied them the RKBA, laws which were not finally abolished until the Carter Administration saw reason to do so. We have had our share of wars in the last century, but far more unarmed innocent civilians were killed in the 20th century by their own governments than by foreign troops in wartime. Gun control’s chief rallying cry is that it will make you safer. Would the unarmed millions who lie buried in the Russian steppes agree? Would the ghosts of Auschwitz agree? Would the bleached bones lying in the killing fields of Cambodia agree? Would the families who cowered in fear of government death squads in Latin America agree? Would the unarmed victims of Serbian ethic cleansing agree? You may not like the RKBA and wish it did not exist. But ask yourself this: When it is a right you do treasure, and when your own government uses the same safety argument to encroach on that right, like your right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure—“but we need this surveillance law to keep you safe from terrorists”—will you be so quick to agree the benefits outweighs the risks to your freedom?Yes, gun violence is a problem in my country. But more guns do not equal more killings with them. Neither will a ban on guns equal a ban on the motives that cause us to kill each other. Gun violence is a complex human behavioral problem. It is not, as gun control supporters incorrectly view it, a simple economic supply problem to be placed in the constitutional scales in the blithe hope that it outweighs a fundamental liberty interest which they find repulsive. The reason why we protect fundamental rights by putting them into constitutions, the reason why we do not let partisans who detest these rights strip them from our constitutions for the purpose of destroying them in the scales of public opinion, is first and foremost because we cannot trust them to keep their thumbs off the scales, and secondly because we fear the encouragement that their “it’s a cut and paste constitution” arguments give to others who secretly see other rights hindering their own desires. One of the enduring legacies of our constitutional freedom is the premise that no man has the moral authority to deny another the free exercise of a fundamental right unless and until that person forfeits it by misusing it. Blanket gun control, whether sought by Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, or by ordinary well-meaning Americans who want to do something to combat gun violence, runs counter to this principle of ordered liberty. ---“The great ideals of liberty and equality are preserved against the assaults of opportunism, the expediency of the passing hour, the erosion of small encroachments, the scorn and derision of those who have no patience with general principles, by enshrining them in constitutions, and consecrating to the task of their protection a body of defenders.” Justice Benjamin Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process, Lecture II, 1921.“Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.” Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 485 (1928) (dissenting opinion).“For those who beat their swords into plowshares will plow for those who didn’t.” -Bryan

In UK we have had gun control for a long time & basically no-one is the worse for it and no (despite rumours) we do not have a despot in power desperate to keep the people down (despite rumours:) )On the other hand we do suffer from the occasional madman and the increasing number of criminals with illegal weapons.The most recent legislation did nothing to deal with the criminals but did manage to upset the vast majority of people in gun clubs and the like none of whom were criminals nor madmen.

'most of the time' is not good enough. Killing animals is murdering members of other species and those same guns can be used and are used for killing humans. The same applies to guns used for target shooting. You can take them home, have them stolen and then used to commit a crime; or your son can take them to school and shoot a few dozens kids.

Flawed logic for the third time. How is most of the time not good enough? And, should we capture every fox in the world and pull out their teeth because they murder animals too? Even though you don't like hunting, it is completely legal and legit, so is target shooting. School shooting are so rare its not even funny, and banning guns wont do a damn thing to stop the school shootings. Guns are almost never stolen, and if someone wanted to commit a crime with a gun, they would get one from the black market. Have you read this? Or this?

Well, I am not saying a school massacre has ever taken place in the USA or Canada; don't get me wrongOswald only used his gun for hunting, didn't he?

Nappen, attorney at law, all knives with any kind of a point, that aren't blunt, INCLUDING KITCHEN KNIVES, are now banned in the United Kingdom.Of course, they had an amnesty period between 2-20-06 and 3-31-06 where "Bins will be placed outside Police stations in Croydon during the above dates, where you can bin a knife without fear of arrest."Hey... "It's A Fact---Knives Take Lives!"Anybody else read this? I highly recommend it.This is heralds the downfall of civilized man. In the very beginning of "civilized man" man invented the pointy knife as he found it useful for everything necessary for his survival. Now, those that think they are the most civilized men on the planet think that it's time to get rid of them and those that don't agree.What's next? Rocks? Sissors? Paper?

Flawed logic for the third time. How is most of the time not good enough? And, should we capture every fox in the world and pull out their teeth because they murder animals too? Even though you don't like hunting, it is completely legal and legit, so is target shooting. School shooting are so rare its not even funny, and banning guns wont do a damn thing to stop the school shootings. Guns are almost never stolen, and if someone wanted to commit a crime with a gun, they would get one from the black market. Have you read this? Or this?

Im guessing that was a joke?

While it's true that being a hypocrite doesn't make a person wrong, you have yet to demonstrate why I, a human, should value the life of a cow or deer more than I value the life of a potato or strawberry.Please be accurate. They are tools designed to make small pieces of metal travel very fast. Those small pieces of metal can be used to cause injury and death.Can you please explain the relevance of this in relation to making society a safer place? On the surface it would seem obvious. Remove weapons, and people will stop getting hurt. Unfortunately, the data simply doesn't support that. As I have pointed out several times, rates of assault, homicide, rape and sexual assault have all increased, and remain at higher rates now than before the gun laws were tightened.The bottom line is that, despite the removal of weapons, our society is still more dangerous than it was. The prevalence of items which can be used to kill is, seemingly, irrelevant.However, one could certainly conclude that banning cars would result in a much lower road toll, making our society far safer than banning guns did. However, I see no calls for to have cars banned.

but they also save lives.Abduction interruptedOakland Hills home invasion ends in shootout; women safe; police seek suspectA masked man abducted an Oakland Hills woman and her maid at gunpoint Friday before driving the pair to a Vallejo marsh, where authorities speculate he was about to kill them when a property caretaker interrupted the crime. The suspect had just forced one of the women to lie down in a ditch when the caretaker, armed with a shotgun for protection against thieves, arrived around 2 p.m., authorities said. The suspect and caretaker exchanged shots before the suspect sped away in the Oakland woman's Lexus sport-utility vehicle. No one was hit, and the women were not injured, though they had been bound and gagged. Tape could still be seen around one woman's neck as investigators questioned her at the Highway 37 scene. The suspect had unsuccessfully robbed the women, and authorities suspect he was trying to find an isolated spot to kill them. "I don't know why else he would take her over there and make her lie in the ditch," Sheriff's Sgt. Jeff Brackett said. The shaken-up caretaker, Doug Paul of Vallejo, said: "I think he was doing something bad. It's pretty f---ed up to have a woman gagged and bound." Authorities are on the lookout for the dark gray 2006 Lexus RX 400H Hybrid with California license plate number VMSUSS. The suspect is described as a large white man, at least 6 feet tall and 200 pounds. He was wearing a tank top, black gloves and possibly blue jeans. Authorities ask anyone who spots the vehicle to call 9-1-1 or the Solano County Sheriff's Dispatch at 421-7090. Because the suspect is considered armed and dangerous, authorities warn anyone who sees the vehicle not to approach it or the suspect. After interviewing the women and caretaker, Brackett said this is what investigators believe happened: The suspect allegedly invaded the upscale Oakland home in the first block of Sheridan Road and demanded cash from the 44-year-old homeowner and her 29-year-old maid. The women told authorities they do not know the man. Armed with a gun and knife, the suspect handcuffed them at the wrists and ankles, and taped their mouths with clear packing-style tape. He then forced the women into the Lexus and drove around for several hours, saying little to them. He did not say he intended to kill them, but at one point said he might seek a ransom for the older woman. That leads detectives to wonder if he knew the woman or her husband. The suspect pulled into a parking lot off westbound Highway 37 north of Wilson Avenue in unincorporated Vallejo. Leaving the maid in the vehicle, he led the homeowner into the adjacent marsh and forced her to lie down in a ditch behind a berm. Just then, the caretaker and a friend pulled into the lot to conduct the weekly check on the property. The maid got out of the Lexus and screamed for help. As the caretaker and friend were talking to the maid, the suspect emerged from behind 12-foot high weeds and ran toward the Lexus. The caretaker fired a warning shot to stop the suspect from fleeing, and the suspect fired three shots before taking off. The caretaker told the Times-Herald he dodged the suspect's bullets buy ducking in front of his car. "It was amazing I wasn't shot," the caretaker said. "At that time I was counting my blessings." As Paul was calling 9-1-1 from his cell phone, his friend, identified only as Roger, followed the suspect into Vallejo. The suspect fired at least one shot before Roger lost site of the vehicle. The 49-year-old Paul, who said he watches the property for The Oasis Corporation, wiped tears away as he recalled the bizarre incident. Paul said he arms himself because his mobile home at the site is frequently burglarized. "This has never been a safe piece of property," Paul said. Although Paul said he feels lucky to have arrived in time to save the women from the suspect, he said, "Being at the right place at the right time would have been when this a--hole was born." http://www.timesheraldonline.com/ci_4567700unless yuo think some one who would kidnap 2 people, and rob them, would follow other laws.

How is need related to the issue? No one needs an SUV, cigarettes or fast food, all of which are responsible for a more dangerous society than firearms yet are still legal.Certainly no one needs a gun, for any reason. No one needs a couch, fridge or television either. No one needs a car, and we certainly don't need things like swimming pools or computers. But thats not relevant.What is relevant. Indeed, the only thing that is relevant is this: Can the removal of weapons from society be demonstrated to cause a significant decrease in rates of violent crime?In short, are we safer without guns?My response is the same as it was previously. No, we are not safer. The stats support it, both here and in England. Many states in the USA that have taken a shall-issue policy to CCW permits have experienced reduced levels of violent crime, indicating that guns may in fact make us more safe. It doesn't matter if guns can be used to kill. It doesn't matter what they were designed to do, and it doesn't matter if we need them or not. The only thing that matters is whether having them around makes us less safe or not.

Allright, allright! We get it! Because guns are used to shoot things, they are bad. We understand your opening statement.Unfortunately, that seems to be all we can get from you. Because guns are used to shoot things, they are bad.I hope you'll not think me rude if I ask for a little more depth from you?For example, perhaps you could address the following question:How is the intended purpose of an item related to it's impact on a safer society?For example: Obesity kills more people than guns do, so it would make us safer to ban McDonalds than it would to ban handguns, regardless of the fact that a hamburger is meant to be eaten, while a gun is meant to shoot things.Also: More people are killed in car accidents than are killed by guns. If we banned cars, we would save more lives than we would by banning guns, regardless of the fact that a car is used for transport and a gun is used to shoot things.Now, following on from that comes a tricky question. I can only assume that your desire for a safer society is genuine. The passion that can be generated by the gun control debate is a direct result of peoples natural desire to live in a safer world, so when you say you want guns banned, I genuinely believe you want everyone to be safer.However, when confronted with facts (cars, drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, even swimming pools kill more people than guns, and that removing guns hasn't resulted in lower rates of violent crime) you refuse to engage in a discussion and instead continue to insist we should ban guns.My question to you is; why, even though it has been clearly demonstrated that removing guns doesn't make us safer, do you continue to insist we ban them?Why, when it has been clearly demonstrated that there are much more dangerous things in society, do you continue to insist that guns are dangerous enough to ban?

Who said anything about nazism? I ask you this: What if the holocaust victims were armed?Gun crazy? Are you rape crazy for condoning gun control? No? So shut up.Thanks to people like you, we may actually never stand a chance agains the poliece or government. But at least we'd put up a fight, and not become unarmed victims in prison camps being starved to death like the holocaust, which you obviously want. Better to go quietly eh? We acutally probably do stand a chance, since we completely outnumber the poliece and military. But, we cannot do it with so called "hunting rifles". You cant defend yourself with a bolt action. Therefore, we should have the same guns as the poliece and military. Studies have shown that this does not increase crime.The RTBA was created to check the government, and is a part of our delacate system of checks and balances. Trying to condone gun control would be like eliminating one of the three branches. Not a good idea.

what are you refering to SUVS, cigarettes, fast food?if you are referring to gun control being the cause of nazism, I think that the the lead has gone to your brain. If one day for any reason the government of your country decides to declare an state of emergency, and declare martial law. You and your gun crazy ilk better applaud the action taken, for no matter how much weaponry you keep under your pillow you won't have a chance against an army or police or civil guard. so keep playing with your guns and fantasising your are protected or whatever other fantasies you may dream about

Well to match the US military in weaponry in case the citizenship has to defend itself from those it elected, (an absurd notion, but what the heck) every citizen ought to have the right to purchase nukes,and associated delivery systems, at least a fighter plane, a bomber, an aircraft carrier and any other kind of weapon in the US Defense inventory. Only then would the citizenhip feel safe and secure, and confident that the fate of European Jews under nazism will never be the forerunner of similar events in the USA.I have learned so much reading this thread about..... paranoia, insecurity, fantasies, security blankets etc.

Nukes can cause civillian casualties, and therefore are going to be useless in combat against ourselves. We can already own fighter planes, just no bombs, which arent really needed anyway. The government wouldnt use it on us, just like they didnt use it to forced the jews into camps. They used guns, and thats what its going to come down to. Look at Vietnam, they didn't have any jets, bombs, nukes, whatever. And they still won. Look at Iraq. We have the most advanced weapondry in the world and were still getting our a$$es kicked by a bunch of rag-tag terrorists.You also cant ignore the fact that criminals push for gun control. Infact, almost all criminals push for gun control, it is their best friend. And, considering a rape crazy person such as yourself, you would want your victims to be defenseless just like any other rapist out there. Therefore no wonder you would push for gun control.

Well, I havent read through all the previous post replies but i can simply say that we own several shotguns for hunting purposes, hunting animals, not people. they are safely locked away and the slugs are never kept in the same area. after each use they are double checked by both me and my husband to make sure there are no slugs left in the chamber and the safety is on. Our daughter is just a baby but we will be sure that when she gets old enough to understand, that we teach her that guns are not toys and she is not to touch them! eventually she WILL be taught to use them to hunt and will ONLY be able to use them under our supervision. In my opinion kids that get ahold of guns and accidentally shoot someone, are not taught that they are not toys and in some cases its poor parenting by leaving guns laying around loaded. My husband wants to teach our daugther to hunt and how to use a .22cal real young, like his buddy did with his son, his son knows that he is not to go near the locked cabinet unless his dad is there with him and he knows proper etiquette. But I still think that even he is too young; even with parental supervision something can happen!

My 5 year old second cousin leaned to shoot when he was 5 with a .22LR. I learned at 7. Anyway, im glad to see you are teaching your children to hunt young, its a great outdoor sport. I believe you are correct about kids shooting each other. IMO, schools should have a gun safety course, and parents should be encouraged to make their kids take a gun safety class down at the range.

The RTBA is only an effective check to the government 1) if the government uses force of arms to impose its will, and 2) if those who oppose it are able to organise and mobilise strength of numbers. The current American administration has far subtler and more effective means of achieving its objectives at its disposal, and is merrily undermining your right and ability to oppose them on those fronts. The demonising of political opponents, ever-weakening privacy protection, imprisonment without trial - all calculated to make organising effective opposition impossible. All this republican hollering about RTBA is merely a sop to the electorate; it's meaningless in any analysis of balance-of-power.In terms of personal protection, statistics are widely abused on both sides, making an accurate determination difficult. It is hard to make a clear-cut case either way, especially when cultural influences are taken into account, let alone the psychological influence the current status-quo would have on any enforced policy changes. I'm reminded of a study in Sweden (if memory serves) where flouride was first added to the water supply and later removed because the incidence of tooth decay actually rose - not because of the flouride, but because the population, aware of the change, stopped brushing their teeth as dilligently. The consequences of banning - say - handguns in America would be very unlikely to mirror the current situation in countries where guns have already been outlawed for a considerable time. Whether violent crime would eventually stabilise at a 'better' level is more or less irrelevant when any initial increase would see a ban repealed almost immediately before it could do any good.In the final analysis, I think America is probably stuck with gun ownership for the forseeable future simply because most paths from the current situation - though they may eventually lead to a better one - initially appear to head downhill.

You haven't really made any convincing argument or relevant point here. Saying that the RKBA is only an effective check if .... (fill in excuse here) is a pointless argument that could be used for any topic. For example, making rape illegal is only effective if we are able to catch rapists and punish them. Therefore, if any rapists are able to escape, does that mean we should just go ahead and legalize rape? Of course not.As for your personal protection argument, that is just flat wrong based on simple logic. Of course statistics can be manipulated to prove a point; it is done all the time with everything. However, all you have to do is ask yourself a simple question. If you are a criminal, would you rather your victim be armed or not? The answer is clear. So if criminals would be in favor of banning guns, does that mean it would be in the best interest of society? Probably not.

What makes a government a government is the pseudo monopolization of force to impose its will. All governments rule by fear of consequences. We pay our taxes becuase we are afraid of being arrested if we don't. We don't break laws because we are afraid of the consequences. That is the basis of all government everywhere. #2 is exactly why we have the RKBA. All governments eventually become tyranical. It is axiomatic. Every government in the history of the world has eventually gone down that road. The RKBA is SUPPOSED to ensure that we as citizens have the tools at our disposal to mobilize strength of numbers if needed and not be slaughtered for our trouble becuase we were forced to stand unarmed against a heavily armed government.

With respect, I'm not quite that stupid :)Imagine for a moment that ammunition was illegal, and the ban enforcible. In that case you could bear all the arms you liked and it would avail you not at all, because something crucial to making your weapons potent would be denied to you.Ammunition isn't illegal, of course, but for your loaded gun to make you anything other - in the eyes of the world - than a crazed loner brought down after a lengthy siege by the gallant officers of the FBI, you need to be able to organise, speak out against the government, have your words heard by a thoughtful - rather than a nervous and blindly patriotic - public, rally the people and bring your one advantage, weight of numbers, to bear. The government can, and is, taking the right and ability to do those things from you with every hundred-page 'homeland security' bill it passes in the middle of the night and with every chest-thumping us-and-them god-bless-America speech it makes, while you sleep secure in the knowledge that your precious gun is close at hand.If the government ever comes for you bearing arms, rest assured they will ensure you are outnumbered and publicly reviled first. You will die alone and with your grievances unheard.That's not the only simple question one can ask, however. Take this one: If you were a criminal, would knowing that your victim is likely to be armed make you more, or less edgy and likely to shoot first, or in response to an unexpected move?Perhaps I'm wrong, but it seems to me that any argument you make for a more heavily-armed population being a safer one, you could also apply to - say - the nuclear brinkmanship of the cold war. What kind of country would you want as an enemy: a nuclear power or a non-nuclear power? When they are going to be thinking the same way, is the answer as clear as you'd like it to be?As I said, though: it's difficult to make a determination, and the reality of the current situation drastically limits our options. Before you get all hot under the collar about me wanting to ban guns, you might reflect for a moment on the fact I never said we should.It's a heartwarming image, but the reality is that RTBA can and has been rendered irrelevant.

It circumvents it - leverages it, even, by telling a frightened public that they can keep the RTBA, but that they must sacrifice their RTFS and RTA in the name of homeland security.Think for a moment, and try to imagine a situation where you could actually exercise your RTBA to meaningful political effect. Now consider that your hypothetical enemies, who are not stupid, are fully aware of what that situation would be and are perfectly capable of avoiding it ever coming to pass whilst still getting everything they want.

Well let me say that I agree we need to be on our guard to protect more than just the RKBA. I have never been a supporter of the current administration’s crime/terrorism fighting strategy where it encroaches on civil liberties. Listen, it is already frighteningly easy for law enforcement to lawfully break into your home. I know. I have on many occasions drafted the search warrants they use for this purpose. I’ve gone with officers and watched them break open doors. I’ve gone into houses with them, and watched them round up people and force them to lie face down at gunpoint in their own living rooms. I’ve watched officers rifle through clothes drawers, pull down and go through boxes of family photographs from the top shelves of closets, share a laugh when they find embarrassing sex toys, shout in triumph when they find a big wad of cash or drugs, take computers and other digital media away for later analysis, go through file cabinets in search of bank records, etc. I’ve later listened to tape recordings of phone calls made by the targets of search warrants, and heard how they complain to their wives/girlfriends/parents/children about how the house was violated and trashed during the search.The first and primary defense against this kind of power being abused is the trust you have to place in the officers themselves—the trust that they will know and obey the law and not lie to obtain probable cause on a search warrant. The second defense is your right to go to court after your privacy has been violated and demand that the government prove it did not violate your civil liberties by the search. Our civil liberties need people who are willing to stand up and protect them--everyday. I agree that we cannot be so focused on the RKBA that we forget the other rights in the Bill of Rights. Indeed, in my opinion the RKBA was listed in the BoR as a measure for protecting these other liberties. At the same time, I have little patience with dilettante civil libertarians who chant trendy slogans about protecting our rights only to blanch and fall silent when the RKBA is threatened. In my opinion, the Constitution is not a cut and paste document. We cannot safely treat the RKBA like it is the ugly red-headed step-child of the family of civil liberties. We cannot safely urge the government to destroy or even silently watch the government consume this liberty interest. If we do so, then we encourage others to attempt to eliminate portions of the Constitution which they find undesirable. It is too easy for a successful government sponsored slogan of “it’s too dangerous to allow people to have guns in such a violent culture” to be turned into “well it’s also too dangerous to have a 4th. Amendment in the face of such violent Islamic terrorism.” How many of our civil liberties are we willing to sacrifice at the altar of expediency in this fashion? For me, the answer is not one. Not now, not ever.---“The great ideals of liberty and equality are preserved against the assaults of opportunism, the expediency of the passing hour, the erosion of small encroachments, the scorn and derision of those who have no patience with general principles, by enshrining them in constitutions, and consecrating to the task of their protection a body of defenders.” Justice Benjamin Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process, Lecture II, 1921.“Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.” Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 485 (1928) (dissenting opinion).“For those who beat their swords into plowshares will plow for those who didn’t.” -Bryan

Now consider that your hypothetical enemies, who are not stupid, are fully aware of what that situation would be and are perfectly capable of avoiding it ever coming to pass whilst still getting everything they want.

You speak eloquently and persuasively. The point I'm trying to make, however, is that one should recognise that the golden age of the RKBA (apologies for previous misspelling) as a front-line defence against the erosion of civil liberties is - for now at least - over. The pen may be mightier than the sword, but the routine sifting of internet traffic, the cell-phone trace, and the television set make the gun look faintly ridiculous. The power to drive hot pieces of metal into another person's flesh is, on an individual level, devastating, but feeble compared to the power leveraged by convincing a nation they are all - from the cities to the sticks - in imminent danger of death-by-terrorist.I do not doubt you are correct, but times have changed, and now it is only strong defence of those other liberties that makes the RKBA mean anything at all. It is frightening to me to see a nation that coined and still clings to the phrase 'from my cold dead hands' voluntarily surrender far more potent and valuable liberties, either reluctantly out of fear or - in some cases - eagerly, to facilitate the moulding of America into something that better fits their personal beliefs. I feel it in some ways mirrors the way America itself has behaved on the world stage in recent times; from being an enlightened and powerful nation it seems now to be merely powerful. I apologise if readers find that offensive; I can only humbly submit that the face America presents to those within is not that seen from the outside.

I’ve watched officers rifle through clothes drawers, pull down and go through boxes of family photographs from the top shelves of closets, share a laugh when they find embarrassing sex toys, shout in triumph when they find a big wad of cash or drugs, take computers and other digital media away for later analysis, go through file cabinets in search of bank records, etc. I’ve later listened to tape recordings of phone calls made by the targets of search warrants, and heard how they complain to their wives/girlfriends/parents/children about how the house was violated and trashed during the search.The first and primary defense against this kind of power being abused is the trust you have to place in the officers themselves—the trust that they will know and obey the law and not lie to obtain probable cause on a search warrant. The second defense is your right to go to court after your privacy has been violated and demand that the government prove it did not violate your civil liberties by the search. Our civil liberties need people who are willing to stand up and protect them--everyday. I agree that we cannot be so focused on the RKBA that we forget the other rights in the Bill of Rights. Indeed, in my opinion the RKBA was listed in the BoR as a measure for protecting these other liberties. At the same time, I have little patience with dilettante civil libertarians who chant trendy slogans about protecting our rights only to blanch and fall silent when the RKBA is threatened. In my opinion, the Constitution is not a cut and paste document. We cannot safely treat the RKBA like it is the ugly red-headed step-child of the family of civil liberties. We cannot safely urge the government to destroy or even silently watch the government consume this liberty interest. If we do so, then we encourage others to attempt to eliminate portions of the Constitution which they find undesirable. It is too easy for a successful government sponsored slogan of “it’s too dangerous to allow people to have guns in such a violent culture” to be turned into “well it’s also too dangerous to have a 4th. Amendment in the face of such violent Islamic terrorism.” How many of our civil liberties are we willing to sacrifice at the altar of expediency in this fashion? For me, the answer is not one. Not now, not ever.---“The great ideals of liberty and equality are preserved against the assaults of opportunism, the expediency of the passing hour, the erosion of small encroachments, the scorn and derision of those who have no patience with general principles, by enshrining them in constitutions, and consecrating to the task of their protection a body of defenders.” Justice Benjamin Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process, Lecture II, 1921.“Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.” Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 485 (1928) (dissenting opinion).“For those who beat their swords into plowshares will plow for those who didn’t.” -Bryan

The battle of the people to retain civil liberties wages on, even though the weapons and battleground itself may be changing. In the past, governments were able to control people because they simply had more firepower. To an extent this remains true today. No matter how many guns I stockpile, I am not going to be able to stop a tank. However, the new weapon is information and the new battleground is the internet. But this doesn't mean we should be willing to give up our guns. And we certainly shouldn't be forced to do so.

You speak eloquently and persuasively. The point I'm trying to make, however, is that one should recognise that the golden age of the RKBA (apologies for previous misspelling) as a front-line defence against the erosion of civil liberties is - for now at least - over. The pen may be mightier than the sword, but the routine sifting of internet traffic, the cell-phone trace, and the television set make the gun look faintly ridiculous. The power to drive hot pieces of metal into another person's flesh is, on an individual level, devastating, but feeble compared to the power leveraged by convincing a nation they are all - from the cities to the sticks - in imminent danger of death-by-terrorist.I do not doubt you are correct, but times have changed, and now it is only strong defence of those other liberties that makes the RKBA mean anything at all. It is frightening to me to see a nation that coined and still clings to the phrase 'from my cold dead hands' voluntarily surrender far more potent and valuable liberties, either reluctantly out of fear or - in some cases - eagerly, to facilitate the moulding of America into something that better fits their personal beliefs. I feel it in some ways mirrors the way America itself has behaved on the world stage in recent times; from being an enlightened and powerful nation it seems now to be merely powerful. I apologise if readers find that offensive; I can only humbly submit that the face America presents to those within is not that seen from the outside.

If the US Government ever turned tyrannical the US citizens would get squashed fairly quickly, unless they adopt the same tactics as the insurgents in Iraq. They might just have a chance in a protracted conflict.To me on the outside of the US the RKBA seems archaic, back when it was devised a citizens militia armed with muskets could hold its own against a regular army. The Army and the Militia would be essentially armed in the same way, the only difference would be training. This is not true today when you have armed forces armed with all sorts of high tech equipment, aircraft, tanks, precision guided bombs. A citizen that owns a hand gun would be no match to the might of a modern armed forces like the US Government has at its disposal. So in my opinion the argument that RKBA protects you from a Tyrannical Government is a erroneous one in this day and age.I must stress that I would never ban guns in the US, you guys have too many in circulation and it would probably just leave the criminals with a large cache guns.

The only chance that our government could turn tyrannical and stay in power is if foreign troops were used to support it. Our young soldiers aren't going to go door-to-door shooting their relatives and that's what it would take.

Soldiers are trained to obey orders, I view the Military(like the Police) as just another manifestation of state violence over the citizen. Sure some will probably lay down there arms but most will follow orders because that is what they are trained to do.

I agree with his statement. In no way become disillusioned to think a rifle can go against a tank or jet fighter. The Vietnamese had more than just rifles in the Vietnam "security measure", they were provided with large numbers of SAMs from Russia/China, they had light tanks, RPGs, mines, mortar and artillery pieces. Even the Iraqis have RPGs, explosives, grenades and shoulder mounted SAMs (stinger missiles). Even with that, Iraqi rebels aren't close to "winning" the war or even taking over any significant territory.

Your post brings few thoughts to mind. The intent behind the Second Amendment was to turn the adult citizenry of the nation into an effective fighting force. A force that the nation could depend on for its defense. If we really wanted to follow the Second Amendment people would need to be required to keep and train with all sorts of military weapons such as machine guns, explosives, greanades, shoulder mounted SAMs etc. But not even the NRA is advocating this. People on both sides of the debate are just not interested in following the Second Amendment.

In Vietnam the public opposition to the war grew so great that eventually it was decided it was best to stop fighting. North Vietnamese forces could have never beaten the US Army had it decided to stay and fight. Their casualties were much, much greater than ours. The interesting thing about Iraq is that rebellion has been a much more frequent occurence since the US invasion. People were much more afraid to rebel against Hussein because they knew the retribution by Hussein would be horrible.... mass torture, executions, imprisonment etc. That's what happened when someone from Dujail shot at Hussein but missed. So when a successful rebellion is most needed (when a true tryrant is in power) people are least likely to attempt it.

I'll have to disagree with part of that. Acceleration of the US draft to a pointwhere it would have provided the additional troops required to occupy N. Vietnam was the domestic political block, public opposition would have been expressed in riots. Internationally, China's position was if the US decided to invade and occupy N. Vietnam, China would aid N. Vietnam with material and troops rather than having a million US combat troops with air support sitting on that border with the then hostile to China USSR on the other side. Not much of a decision for the US to get out of Vietnam.

I agree with this statement. Neither Pro or Antis are following the constitution to the intent of which it was written. The government is breaking the 2nd amendment already by "infringing" on the rights of "the people" to own ARMS. A ban is in effect for biological weapons. The same companies that contract artillery/missiles out to the military are not allowed to sell to the public. "The people" include ex-criminals or else why are they allowed in the country? The 2nd amendment is archaic in this sense. No one abides by it's true meaning. Most people want their guns MOSTLY for entertainment. Why are auto-loading pistols so prolific? When in need why use a pistol design that is more susceptible to jamming/FTF? Is it the capacity? I can almost guarantee you that if you unload an entire magazine on a criminal you will get charged. So why aren't revolvers anywhere as popular as auto-loaders? They pretty much never jam and in case of FTF you just pull the trigger again. Why do people even buy 9mm? Because it's fun to unload 17 light rounds into the backstop at the range instead of 6 hand smashing .44mags....also an auto-loader is in "style". There's nothing wrong with having guns just for fun, I don't see why anyone doesn't admit to it. When asked why do you have guns? You always see..."For self protection". Why do you keep an AR-15? "For home defense." Seriously folks...for home defense? How many of you AR-15 folks stock nothing but FMJs? What happened to the shotgun? You can get auto-loading 12 gauges with detachable 20 round mags for half the price of an AR. Why are folks so hard to admit that guns are fun and that's a valid reason to have guns?

"Why are auto-loading pistols so prolific?"1. Because they recoil less and carry more rounds than a revolver. You also have a limited choice of revolvers for calibers such as .45 ACP and 9 mm."When in need why use a pistol design that is more susceptible to jamming/FTF?"2. This has not really been the case for many, many years now. The modern semi-automatic handgun is remarkably reliable. In fact I have never had a jam/FTF in my G30 with over 3,000 rds. fired and there are many people out there with similar experiences."Is it the capacity?"3. Partly yes. If I happen to miss a bad guy who is trying to hurt me should I be punished because I could not hit him with my first 5 or 6 rds.? There is a video floating around of a cop who shot a BG 5 or 6 times with his G21(.45 ACP) and the man was still able to advance on him. Most people shot by a handgun do NOT die. Handgun calibers are notoriously poor at killing people. A determined threat makes this even more of an issue."I can almost guarantee you that if you unload an entire magazine on a criminal you will get charged."4. You're kidding right? This is simply not true and I would like to know how you can "almost guaruntee" this. There was a shooting here in Ft. Myers Beach a couple of years ago where a guy did just that. A father woke up in his hotel room with a guy on top of him. Another guy pulled his daughter into the bathroom. The father and BG#1 struggled. Father grabbed gun from under pillow and killed BG#1 then proceeded to unload into BG#2. Both BG's died and no charges were filed. Of course this was Florida and here if someone breaks into your house in is considered a threat to your life and or a threat of bodily harm. You can shoot them and have immunity to civil and criminal charges."So why aren't revolvers anywhere as popular as auto-loaders? They pretty much never jam and in case of FTF you just pull the trigger again.5. You are right about the jamming/FTF issue; for the rest see #1-#4."Why do people even buy 9mm? Because it's fun to unload 17 light rounds into the backstop at the range instead of 6 hand smashing .44mags"6. It is also easier to maintain rapid fire control for some people with the 9mm and yes as I said you mayneed more than just a few rds. to defend yourself. It is also, as you say, fun not to mention cheaper than .44mag."Why do you keep an AR-15? "For home defense." Seriously folks...for home defense?"7. I keep an AR-15 for fun/home defense. The 5.56 is remarkably well suited for defense within the home. It will penetrate drywall less than the more common pistol calibers. The 5.56/.223 has a tendency to fragment; the same thing that makes it good for hurting people if needed. Why do you think most police dept. in America use the AR-15/M-16 or M-4 for building entry? It was designed for fighting for God's sake! How can you even ask this question? I guess because it is also good for targets out to 800m in some cases that you assume that long distance-mediam range shooting is it's only purpose.Before you say that the military uses it just for this, consider that most combat engagement ranges are at 300m and less. Even more are at the 100m and less mark. I suppose that you might just not know these things and there is nothing wrong with that. "How many of you AR-15 folks stock nothing but FMJs?"8. I do. See my comments on fragmentation at #7."What happened to the shotgun? You can get auto-loading 12 gauges with detachable 20 round mags for half the price of an AR."9. I have a shotgun too. They are great for home defense. You are right, they are cheaper than an AR. They do penatrate walls more than a 5.56mm/.223 which makes them more dangerous to innocent family members and bystanders/neighbors. Then there is the fact that I may want to go to the range and shoot 100m to 400m distances. Can't do that with a shotgun with the same accuracy.I hope response has been informative. If you have anymore question just ask. You may learn something.

First of all, who says that another country won't aid the american rebels? Second, if Iraqi's aren't close to winning, then what the hell is going on? We're suffering heavy casualties, when we have only scraped the tip of the iceberg on militia fighters. Firepower isn't all that can win a war. It takes will. If a people are truly determined to win, and they have some firepower at all, then they will win.

But thats not the point. The point was that we pulled out.Were Hussain's subjects even allowed to bear arms? Hussain is way different than anything that can happen in the US.

There is some false in that statement. Nothing in the amendment says that states cannot regulate the sale of arms.It can fire faster for one thing, and hold more rounds. If you are in a situation where you need to defend yourself, you can't shoot as well under pressure. Thats what larger mags are for.I personally am a fan of the revolver over the autoloader, but I'm sure its because of the way that autoloaders look so much cooler.What do you mean "no one admits it"? I know plenty of people who use their guns for recreational shooting (targets, skeet, trap etc.), and hunting. I also know a lot of people who's guns are strictly for self-defense purposes only, although they don't deny the fact that its hell-a-fun going to the range and shooting up a target.I don't know anyone who keeps an AR for self defense, but I'm sure its for the same reason that police keep an AR for defense.

So home defense becomes equivalent to forced entry assaults? Police stock shotguns as well more, often than ars. I've yet to see reports that the PD in my area even carry rifles. Also, unless some of you have enough people trained in your home for a fire team what advantage is there for an ar over a shotgun for HD? As for overpenetration, let's be realistic. .223 will go through 12 + sheets of drywall despite fragmentation. So unless you have 6+ rooms between every person in your house or re-inforced metal walls, using .223 purely because it fragments is not a factor. If anything shotguns with birdshot are the only option you have for not penetrating drywall. You can also have much more variety in load power with shotguns that don't penetrate as far as .223. Check theboxotruth. So where in CCW do they teach you to unload an entire mag? In my state I've seen people convicted because they shot after the guy went down. If a guy is still coming after you after 6 rounds of .45 ACP it means you should probably move up to 6 rounds of .44 mag. There are plenty of caliber choices for revolvers that cover the whole spectrum from .32 to .500 s&w. For personal defense ammo price shouldn't be a large factor, because you're not practicing to be good enough for a tattered hole at 40 yards. For HD there are better options than a pistol. We're talking about HD, not urban assault. Planning for SHTF and zombie attacks is a whole different scenario. Then say you have an ar for "When civilization breaks down" when people ask you why you have an ar. As for pistol jamming, I've shot Ruger mkII & mkIII, browning buckmarks and glock 19. I've had 1 FTF on the glock and numerous jams on the rugers & buckmarks. This is probably b/c of extensive use and infrequent cleaning (they weren't my guns). I'm sure there's less chances if you keep your guns clean and double check your ammo. But that's still a liability, don't make it like it's nothing. The chances are few it will happen, but the chances are few that you'll get murdered. What about things you can't check? I've had FTF with factory centerfire ammo. It'll probably be one out of 5,000 rounds but it's still there. How about hot loads? An autoloader will lock up, but a revolver you just pull the trigger again. The whole point is I don't see many people admit in a serious argument that guns are fun to use. The response to why do you need guns is always : "For defense".

1. "So home defense becomes equivalent to forced entry assaults?"I never said that; you did. I said that police depts. all over the country use them for entry.

So home defense becomes equivalent to forced entry assaults? Police stock shotguns as well more, often than ars. I've yet to see reports that the PD in my area even carry rifles. Also, unless some of you have enough people trained in your home for a fire team what advantage is there for an ar over a shotgun for HD? As for overpenetration, let's be realistic. .223 will go through 12 + sheets of drywall despite fragmentation. So unless you have 6+ rooms between every person in your house or re-inforced metal walls, using .223 purely because it fragments is not a factor. If anything shotguns with birdshot are the only option you have for not penetrating drywall. You can also have much more variety in load power with shotguns that don't penetrate as far as .223. Check theboxotruth. So where in CCW do they teach you to unload an entire mag? In my state I've seen people convicted because they shot after the guy went down. If a guy is still coming after you after 6 rounds of .45 ACP it means you should probably move up to 6 rounds of .44 mag. There are plenty of caliber choices for revolvers that cover the whole spectrum from .32 to .500 s&w.

I'm sure there's less chances if you keep your guns clean and double check your ammo. But that's still a liability, don't make it like it's nothing. The chances are few it will happen, but the chances are few that you'll get murdered. What about things you can't check? I've had FTF with factory centerfire ammo. It'll probably be one out of 5,000 rounds but it's still there. How about hot loads? An autoloader will lock up, but a revolver you just pull the trigger again. The whole point is I don't see many people admit in a serious argument that guns are fun to use. The response to why do you need guns is always : "For defense".

How else do I interpret this correlation between AR-15, police raids and HD that you refered to? Police use them for entry, not home defense. I see the shotgun having more edge than ars in a pure HD situation.Police usage of ar-15s is probably not for HD situations. I'm not arguing that the police made the wrong choice of issuing ar-15s for their roles.It's also a disadvantage to use light 5.56 rounds instead of #00 buckshot. Also, with a shotgun you can use a pump with less chances of jamming. You can also get a semi-auto with detachable 10 round mags for fast reloading. With your target range of max 20 yards inside a house, accuracy difference between a shotgun and AR is not an issue. If anything the shot pattern would have reached a torso sized spread at 20 yards making it more likely to hit than an ar.Then use a heavier load. A shotgun has so many more power varieties compared to a 5.56.Where is enough? You can go all the way up to 100 round drums for your pistol, which is hard to conceal but not impossible. 6 rounds should be enough and with reliability concerns on the side of autoloaders taking the hit and only getting 6 rounds is a safer solution.As above, where are the bad guys who can take 6 .44mags and keep going? If they really are around, we should carry rifles instead.Then learn to shoot well with the .44 mag. Do you recommend people to use .22lrs for CCW or tell them to take the time and learn to use something heavier?As above, for CCW concerns it's not going to be a long range shot. Until they learn to handle the difference they can get a .357/.38 and practice using .38s and go up to .357. There are existing 9mm, .45acp and .40 cal revolvers that are reliable as well, but why do they have to use these rounds?There's a point where enough is enough. I learned how to hit a paper plate target at 50 ft in about 3 sessions with 100 rounds. Strictly for SD purposes that's good enough. Going to the range once a month and shooting a box should keep the average person to retain that much accuracy, at least for me it did.When people have no clue, do you tell them to use a pistol for HD? There are so many advantages to using a shotgun instead of a pistol for HD that it would be wrong to misguide people in this area.Exactly, an ARs use is primarily for fun. Secondarily it could be used for HD, hunting and mid-range firefights. However for the purposes of HD I say shotgun trumps with no other factors.It's much much quicker to pull the trigger again instead of having to reach over, rack the slide and pull the trigger. That half second could mean your life, since an adult can cover 50ft in 2 seconds. What happens if you had to spend more time to clear a jam? What happens if there's a hot load and your gun is stuck? So exactly with your fire extinguisher idea...shouldn't you use a revolver in case it happens?I didn't specifically target you. I used it as a general statement that most of the time I read a gun control thread someone asks "why you need a gun?" and you repeatedly see "for self defense", but rarely do you see "for fun".That's entirely in your head.

Let me interject myself for a moment and take a swing at the question of “why do you need a gun?” I’ve had anti-gunners ask me this question before. Here is my smart-XXX answer to that question:I can think of several reasons to own a gun. I could hunt with it. I could have fun shooting tin cans with it. I could practice with it and try to represent my country at the Olympics with it. I could use it for home defense. I could use it for personal protection when I am away from home. I don’t have to have any reason to own a gun, but it just so happens that I do have some reasons. And the time is not right yet for you to be entitled to know my reasons. Oh, I know you now want to ask “When, Bryan, will that blessed day come—that day when I am entitled to demand that you gird your loins like a man and justify to me why you bought a gun?” Here is when I think that time will be:It will be when I am entitled to demand that a person justify his reasons for refusing to consent to a police search of his car—it will be when I become entitled to demand to know why he asserted his right to counsel and refused to answer my officer’s questions—it will be when I no longer need to obtain a search warrant to break into your home and rifle through your dresser drawers—it will be when I find a KJV Bible in your house and feel entitled to demand that you justify to me why you own that Bible, and to know your reasons for having a KJV instead of a Good News translation—it will be when I become entitled to demand that you tell me whether that Bible is for personal use or will it be used to convert others to your faith. When these things come to pass, then you will know that the long-desired time has indeed come. That will be the day when the Constitution will no longer protect me from your seizure of the power to review and veto my personal decisions regarding how I will exercise my individual rights. But since the day has not yet come for your ascension to that throne of tyranny, I feel no particular need to justify to you why I might choose to exercise any right my Constitution protects. ---“The great ideals of liberty and equality are preserved against the assaults of opportunism, the expediency of the passing hour, the erosion of small encroachments, the scorn and derision of those who have no patience with general principles, by enshrining them in constitutions, and consecrating to the task of their protection a body of defenders.” Justice Benjamin Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process, Lecture II, 1921.“The natural progress of things is for liberty to yield and government to gain ground.”—Thomas Jefferson“The saddest epitaph which can be carved in memory of a vanished liberty is that it was lost because its possessors failed to stretch forth a saving hand while yet there was time.”—Justice George Sutherland

Unusually warm winter we are now having in Europe and USA is due to so called climatic weapon used by Americans imo.Well, they had been exploring this sort of weapon for quite a long time and I guess success attended them.

LOL!!!!!!I too would like to see some evidence to support your posts.As for the additional troops putting a strain on our economy. You may need to rethink that one as well. If I remember correctly troop strength in Iraqhas in the past been close to 160,000. We reduced numbers to a little over 100,000 and now this "Surge" of an additional 21,500. That would mean we will still be below past numbers. The current increase is closer to a fluctuation in my opinion; a much needed one.

The fights conducted by police raid units are usually different than one conducted by a homeowner. There are extraneous requirements for the police that is not imposed on the homeowner. I disagree. The shotgun is going to be heavier unless you are using a 20'' varmint barreled AR. The shotgun can also be loaded with shells of equivalent power or less power than a 5.56 thereby making recoil the same or more managable.Anything that can penetrate to get to vital organs will penetrate several layers of drywall. There is no option around this even frangible rounds will go through several layers. Therefore, over penetration should be a given no matter what you chose. (Unless you chose birdshot, which still has tactical advantages and is an available option if you use a shotgun).For a CCW situation, it is more than likely that you are in an environment where you should not take a shot that you are unsure of. Missing can have dire consequences especially if you are in a populated area. There may not be people present, but your shot can still deflect or over penetrate into areas populated. Stressing training is the only thing to be done at this point. So therefore you should have been a better shot. An "adrenaline pump" can make it difficult to take your shot, but it won't make it impossible, especially considering the distances you will be dealing with in a pure SD situation. You can train stressed shooting.How many fires have you had at your house? Do you still buy fire extinguishers? You brought this example up yourself. It is not a negligible statistic. I live in the city. Rapid firing is not an option in most places in my daily routine. This may be different in rural areas or some other situation I can't think of.People should learn to move to the largest caliber then can handle. Learning to handle recoil is either a mental handicap or a physical handicap. For most of us without a physical handicap, learning to shoot and dealing with recoil is a practicing issue to get over the mental handicap. If you can qualify your precision at the range you will be using for the whole purpose of SD then there is little need to go beyond. Unless for fun...They are the most popular because they are more commonly available for auto-loaders. 100 years ago that wouldn't be the case. You are going to get penetration issues with pretty much any caliber.Actually that's not me, it's stated by the DPS for my state. In order to qualify for a CCW license, applicants must pass a range test on a 45'' by 24'' silhouette at a maximum range of 15 yards and with a minimum of 2 seconds between shots. You are starting to drift from my point on this topic, which is that if people wanted a handgun purely for SD they would not need to be at the range so much as to incur thousands of dollars of expenses each year. Having fun at the range will of course justify a new reason as to why they own a handgun.Bringing enough firepower should trump over minor maneuverability issues. There should be a strategy developed where family members convene at an easily defensible point of the house and you don't need to maneuver to clear areas. I may agree with your strategy if you had someone behind you with a shotgun.Preference by training can simply be changed by training with the other weapon. There may be situations in rural areas where combining a hunting/defense firearm may be advantageous as a NEED, but I fail to see how they give an advantage otherwise.Jamming is a noticeable risk. I am a proponent of more power/reliability versus more capacity. There must be a line drawn somewhere, else everyone would have calico 100 round drum .22 pistols. 6 shots should serve most needs for SD otherwise more training is required.Then you would not be inclusive of "most people I see". The purpose of my argument is that I call them out when they propose using ar-15s for purely for HD and semi-autos purely for SD.I do dislike some people's choices regarding firearms. If purely for SD/HD a revolver/shotgun combo is optimal. Adding recreation is another matter. Would you dislike someone's choice of using a .22lr for defense?

Those dastardly Europeans have countered with a cold ray which is currently pummeling Colorado and Nebraska. This ray has caused over 40 deaths so far. How do I know? It's all over the news!!!Hysterical, in both senses of the word.

As far as the AR vs. the Shotty It seems we disagree on about every issue. You say that you can change your load in the shotty to reduce your recoil but I have already stated that I do not like the idea of defending myself with birdshot. Simply put, if someone chose the AR over the shotgun I could very well understand their decision.When I mentioned adrenaline dump I spoke from some experience. I had extensive training in the Army with the M-16. Trust me, you will not be as accurate as you think when a target presents itself. In my situation a shotgun would have probably got me killed. Not because it is ineffective but because the AR/M-16 is faster with followup shots. I still value the shotty for typical civilian use but can understand why someone might prefer the AR.With regards to the semi. vs. revolver, my comments about the fire extinguisher still stand. I have modern examples of chemical style extinguishers. I do not have the old pressurized water filled ones. The would both work but I choose the chemical variety. Revolvers and semi's would both work for SD but I choose a semi. I am a better shot with my semi than my revolver. I can shoot faster with more accuracy. Not everyone is the same in that regard, let them choose accordingly. I will remind you that 6 shots is enough for you but may not be enough for someone else. If someone want to carry a 100 rd. drum of .22 so be it. I think I already addressed this but I will state it again. I do not recommend anyone use a .22 for self defense UNLESS it is the only weapon available or for some reason it is the only weapon you can shoot well. There are other calibers out there that most people should be able to handle, be it in a revolver or a semi auto.The training that people need is determined differently in different states. I don't think people should be forced to train just to own and carry a firearm. I know it sounds dangerous but I see it as an infringement on our rights. I am not the one to say who is trained enough and who is not, I will try to only speak for myself. I suggest you do the same. If someone makes a mistake and hurts another person then let them be responsible for their error. On the fun issue, Half of the reason why most people shoot is probably for fun. It is no secret, that is why people hunt(it's fun), that is why people go to the range(not just for proficiency). I understand that most people whom you have contact with have not told you so but I believe it to be true. As I said before I think it is obvious. Guns are a blast!!!Would you ever consider limiting people's choices of guns? For example, would you make it harder or impossible for someone to buy an semi auto pistol or an AR-15 via laws or regulations? How do you feel about mag capacity limits?

The fights conducted by police raid units are usually different than one conducted by a homeowner. There are extraneous requirements for the police that is not imposed on the homeowner. I disagree. The shotgun is going to be heavier unless you are using a 20'' varmint barreled AR. The shotgun can also be loaded with shells of equivalent power or less power than a 5.56 thereby making recoil the same or more managable.Anything that can penetrate to get to vital organs will penetrate several layers of drywall.

Let me address the issue raised in this thread of self-defense and shooting after an attacker “goes down.” Shooting an attacker after they “go down” can be criminal. The right of self defense is not an automatic right to kill someone who threatens you. The right of self defense is often called a law of necessity, and this is because it makes it lawful to engage in violent conduct (like shooting someone) that is ordinarily criminal. There are two (although these are not the only two) important qualifications to the right of self defense:1. In exercising self-defense you can use no more force than was reasonably necessary to prevent the harm threatened, and in particular you cannot apply or use deadly force in self-defense unless you reasonably feared, under the circumstances as they appeared to you, that you or another innocent person was in danger of being killed or in danger of suffering great bodily harm. Violating this is termed using excessive force and is criminal conduct. 2. The right to assault another in self-defense ends when the threat ends and you have a reasonable opportunity to see and understand that the threat has ended. Violating this is typically viewed as retaliation or acting out of a motive for revenge, and is criminal conduct. These are some of the old common law rules for self defense, and they are the current law in my state of Virginia. Please bear in mind that the law may be different in other states, but these rules tend to be uniform. An example of violating rule #1 would be shooting a 10 year old who threatens to whip you with a switch. You have a right to defend yourself from his threatened assault, but not to respond with deadly force. An example involving rule #2 would be shooting someone 6 times while they continue to advance upon you with a knife. This, in my opinion, would not constitute using excessive force or retaliating. Once you are threatened with death or great bodily harm, then you can continue to respond with deadly force, even to the point of killing the aggressor, until the threat to you ends. But that is where the right ends. To take the example further: Let’s say you shoot the same knife-wielder once and watch him fall to the ground and drop the knife. Then you walk over to him and shoot him again while he is on the ground. This would violate rule #2. You were justified in using deadly force for the first shot, but the second shot would be viewed as retaliating because the threat has ended and you have had an opportunity to realize this and understand it was no longer necessary to protect yourself by shooting him again. ---“And indeed, gentlemen, there exists a law, not written down anywhere but written in our hearts; a law which comes to us not by training or custom or reading but by derivation and absorption and adoption from nature itself; a law which has come to us not by theory but from practice, not by instruction but by natural intuition. I refer to the law which lays it down that, if our lives are endangered by plots or violence or armed robbers or enemies, any and every method of protecting ourselves is morally right. When weapons reduce them to silence, the laws no longer expect one to await their pronouncements. For people who decide to wait for these will have to wait for justice, too--and meanwhile they must suffer injustice first. Indeed, even the wisdom of the law itself, by a sort of tacit implication, permits self- defense, because it does not actually forbid men to kill; what it does, instead, is to forbid the bearing of a weapon with the intention to kill. When, therefore, an inquiry passes beyond the mere question of the weapon and starts to consider the motive, a man who has used arms in self-defense is not regarded as having carried them with homicidal aim”. Cicero, Selected Political Speeches, p. 222 (M. Grant, trans. 1975)“If a slave, says Plato, defends himself, and kills a freeman, he ought to be treated as a parricide. This is a civil law which punishes self-defense, though dictated by nature. . . .It is unreasonable. . .to oblige a man not to attempt the defense of his own life. . . .Who does not see that self-defense is a duty superior to every precept. . . .[T]he laws of an Italian republic [Venice], where bearing fire-arms is punished as a capital crime and where it is not more fatal to make an ill use of them than to carry them, is not agreeable to the nature of things.”Montesquieu, The Spirit of Laws, pp. 59, 60, 64, and 79-80 (trans. T. Nugent, 1899).“And I cannot see, why arms should be denied to any man who is not a slave, since they are the only true badges of liberty. . . .The possession of arms is the distinction between a freeman and a slave. He who has nothing, and belongs to another, must be defended by him, and needs no arms: but he who thinks he is his own master, and has anything he may call his own, ought to have arms to defend himself and what he possesses, or else he lives precariously and at discretion. And though for a while those who have the sword in their power abstain from doing him injury; yet, by degrees, he will be awed into submission to every arbitrary command.” Andrew Fletcher, Political Works, pp. 35 and 221 (1749)“And we have seen that these rights [in the 1688 English Bill of Rights]. . .consist, primarily, in the free enjoyment of personal security, of personal liberty, and of private property. So long as these remain inviolate, the subject is perfectly free; for every species of compulsive tyranny and oppression must act in opposition to one or other of these rights. To preserve these from violation, it is necessary that the constitution of parliaments be supported in it[s] full vigor. . . .And lastly, to vindicate these rights, when actually violated or attacked, the subjects of England are entitled, in the first place, to the regular administration and free course of justice in the courts of law; next to the right of petitioning the king and parliament for redress of grievances; and lastly, to the right of having and using arms for self preservation and defense.” Sir William Blackstone, 1 Commentaries on the Laws of England, p. 140 (1st. ed. 1765, reprinted 1979).“Instances of the licentious and outrageous behavior of the military conservators of the peace still multiply upon us, some of which are of such a nature, and have been carried to so great lengths, as must serve fully to evince that a late vote of this town, calling upon the inhabitants to provide themselves with arms for their defense, was a measure as prudent as it was legal. . . .It is a natural right which the people have reserved to themselves, confirmed by the [1688 English] Bill of Rights, to keep arms for their defense; and as Mr. Blackstone observes, it is to be made use of when the sanctions of society and law are found insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression. It is certainly beyond human art and sophistry, to prove that the British subjects, to whom the privilege of possessing arms is expressly recognized by the Bill of Rights,. . .are guilty of an illegal act, in calling upon one another to be provided with them, as the law directs.”O. Dickerson ed., Boston Under Military Rule, p79 & 61 (1936) [quoting from what was at the time the most widely circulated periodical in the colonies, A Journal of the Times].“The right of self-defense is the first law of nature; in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest possible limits...and [when] the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any color or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction.” Sir George Tucker, Judge of the Virginia Supreme Court and U.S. District Court of Virginia, in I Blackstone COMMENTARIES, Sir George Tucker Ed., 1803, pg. 300“The inhabitants of Boston being confined within that town by the general their governor, and having, in order to procure their dismission, entered into a treaty with him, it was stipulated that the said inhabitants having deposited their arms with their own magistrates, should have liberty to depart, taking with them their own effects. They accordingly delivered up their arms, but in open violation of honor, in defiance of the obligation of treaties, which even savage nations esteemed sacred, the governor ordered the arms deposited as aforesaid, that they might be preserved for their owners, to be seized by a body of soldiers; detained the greatest part of the inhabitants in the town, and compelled the few who were permitted to retire, to leave their most valuable effects behind.” From the DECLARATION OF THE CAUSES AND NECESSITY OF TAKING UP ARMS (July 6, 1775).

That was a very good explanation. I will add that here in Florida if a person enters your house illegaly the law assumes that they are there to do harm and thus you are allowed to use deadly force. Of course I do not recommend shooting a 10 y/o committing a B&E. To be clear, I never proposed shooting anybody after they were "down" or no longer a threat. In fact I believe I stated that I would shoot until the threat to me was stopped.

On a slightly different note, I thought some of you would find this funny.40 Reasons to Ban Guns 1. Banning guns works, which is why New York, DC, Detroit & Chicago cops need guns.2. Washington DC's low murder rate of 69 per 100,000 is due to strict gun control, and Indianapolis' high murder rate of 9 per 100,000 is due to the lack of gun control.3. Statistics showing high murder rates justify gun control but statistics showing increasing murder rates after gun control are "just statistics."4. The Brady Bill and the Assault Weapons Ban, both of which went into effect in 1994 are responsible for the decrease in violent crime rates, which have been declining since 1991.5. We must get rid of guns because a deranged lunatic may go on a shooting spree at any time and anyone who would own a gun out of fear of such a lunatic is paranoid.6. The more helpless you are the safer you are from criminals.7. An intruder will be incapacitated by tear gas or oven spray, but if shot with a .357 Magnum will get angry and kill you.8. A woman raped and strangled is morally superior to a woman with a smoking gun and a dead rapist at her feet.9. When confronted by violent criminals, you should "put up no defense - give them what they want, or run" (Handgun Control Inc. Chairman Pete Shields, Guns Don't Die - People Do, 1981, p. 125).10. The New England Journal of Medicine is filled with expert advice about guns; just like Guns & Ammo has some excellent treatises on heart surgery.11. One should consult an automotive engineer for safer seat belts, a civil engineer for a better bridge, a surgeon for internal medicine, a computer programmer for hard drive problems, and Sarah Brady for firearms expertise.12. The 2nd Amendment, ratified in 1787, refers to the National Guard, which was created 130 years later, in 1917.13. The National Guard, federally funded, with bases on federal land, using federally-owned weapons, vehicles, buildings and uniforms, punishing trespassers under federal law, is a "state" militia.14. These phrases: "right of the people peaceably to assemble," "right of the people to be secure in their homes," "enumerations herein of certain rights shall not be construed to disparage others retained by the people," and "The powers not delegated herein are reserved to the states respectively, and to the people" all refer to individuals, but "the right of the people to keep and bear arms" refers to the state.15. "The Constitution is strong and will never change." But we should ban and seize all guns thereby violating the 2nd, 4th, and 5th Amendments to that Constitution.16. Rifles and handguns aren't necessary to national defense! Of course, the army has hundreds of thousands of them.17. Private citizens shouldn't have handguns, because they aren't "military weapons'', but private citizens shouldn't have "assault rifles'', because they are military weapons.18. In spite of waiting periods, background checks, fingerprinting, government forms, etc., guns today are too readily available, which is responsible for recent school shootings. In the 1940's, 1950's and 1960's, anyone could buy guns at hardware stores, army surplus stores, gas stations, variety stores, Sears mail order, no waiting, no background check, no fingerprints, no government forms and there were no school shootings.19.

That was a very good explanation. I will add that here in Florida if a person enters your house illegaly the law assumes that they are there to do harm and thus you are allowed to use deadly force. Of course I do not recommend shooting a 10 y/o committing a B&E. To be clear, I never proposed shooting anybody after they were "down" or no longer a threat. In fact I believe I stated that I would shoot until the threat to me was stopped.

You don't have to go all the way down to birdshot. You can use #4 buckshot or a goose load.I disagree, the shotgun should have a quicker follow up shot, because the shotgun can be heavier and loaded lighter (and not just birdshot either). Same reasoning behind not using the .22lr for defense. You should use as much power as possible. I've not seen people take 6 .357 or .44 and still function. If you take all 6 shots and miss 4 you could be endangering others especially if these shots were made within city limits, after all with the adrenaline would you be waiting for a safe backstop? There has to be some requirements to operating some tools. Otherwise states should not require driver licenses or any form of exam to prove knowledge on operating a vehicle. Driving may be a privilege on public roads, but so is walking on public sidewalks.I believe the 2nd amendment should be enforced with the intention that it was written so the populace can engage against invasion by domestic/foreign forces.

On a slightly different note, I thought some of you would find this funny.40 Reasons to Ban Guns 1. Banning guns works, which is why New York, DC, Detroit & Chicago cops need guns.2. Washington DC's low murder rate of 69 per 100,000 is due to strict gun control, and Indianapolis' high murder rate of 9 per 100,000 is due to the lack of gun control.3. Statistics showing high murder rates justify gun control but statistics showing increasing murder rates after gun control are "just statistics."4. The Brady Bill and the Assault Weapons Ban, both of which went into effect in 1994 are responsible for the decrease in violent crime rates, which have been declining since 1991.5. We must get rid of guns because a deranged lunatic may go on a shooting spree at any time and anyone who would own a gun out of fear of such a lunatic is paranoid.6. The more helpless you are the safer you are from criminals.7. An intruder will be incapacitated by tear gas or oven spray, but if shot with a .357 Magnum will get angry and kill you.8. A woman raped and strangled is morally superior to a woman with a smoking gun and a dead rapist at her feet.9. When confronted by violent criminals, you should "put up no defense - give them what they want, or run" (Handgun Control Inc. Chairman Pete Shields, Guns Don't Die - People Do, 1981, p. 125).10. The New England Journal of Medicine is filled with expert advice about guns; just like Guns & Ammo has some excellent treatises on heart surgery.11. One should consult an automotive engineer for safer seat belts, a civil engineer for a better bridge, a surgeon for internal medicine, a computer programmer for hard drive problems, and Sarah Brady for firearms expertise.12. The 2nd Amendment, ratified in 1787, refers to the National Guard, which was created 130 years later, in 1917.13. The National Guard, federally funded, with bases on federal land, using federally-owned weapons, vehicles, buildings and uniforms, punishing trespassers under federal law, is a "state" militia.14. These phrases: "right of the people peaceably to assemble," "right of the people to be secure in their homes," "enumerations herein of certain rights shall not be construed to disparage others retained by the people," and "The powers not delegated herein are reserved to the states respectively, and to the people" all refer to individuals, but "the right of the people to keep and bear arms" refers to the state.15. "The Constitution is strong and will never change." But we should ban and seize all guns thereby violating the 2nd, 4th, and 5th Amendments to that Constitution.16. Rifles and handguns aren't necessary to national defense! Of course, the army has hundreds of thousands of them.17. Private citizens shouldn't have handguns, because they aren't "military weapons'', but private citizens shouldn't have "assault rifles'', because they are military weapons.18. In spite of waiting periods, background checks, fingerprinting, government forms, etc., guns today are too readily available, which is responsible for recent school shootings. In the 1940's, 1950's and 1960's, anyone could buy guns at hardware stores, army surplus stores, gas stations, variety stores, Sears mail order, no waiting, no background check, no fingerprints, no government forms and there were no school shootings.19. The NRA's attempt to run a "don't touch" campaign about kids handling guns is propaganda, but the anti-gun lobby's attempt to run a "don't touch" campaign is responsible social activity.20.

I misread and skipped over "yet".That really speaks for how weak the 5.56mm round is not the shotgun. I found an article that explains some of why the police use 5.56mm and also about the new factory reduced recoil loads addressing that issue. http://www.findarticles.com/p/articl...51/ai_n7581217Not only that, you can get heavier shotguns or shotguns with recoil reduction built in like the Berretta Xtrema 2. http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/gadgets/b...ter-185473.phpFurthermore at the ranges we're talking about, followup shots isn't all that hard to adjust to. Here's someone bump-firing a 12-gauge semi without recoil reductions built in.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KqR2vPVPxEI see "can not use" as someone who has a physical handicap that prevents them from firing accurately. Shooting badly, because you have a twitch that grows exponentially with magnum loads is something that needs to be taken care of in the first place.I didn't say we disagree, that was the answer to your question.

Take it however you want to, but factory "tactical" loads are being made available for civilians. Us common folk probably can't achieve the same accuracy he has, but for an average sized man he was able to squeeze of rounds very quickly without muzzle rise, which is one of the points of that demonstration.Bump firing is hardly something that requires much training. The importance of what he did is that he's practically using one hand to hold steady a 12 gauge during rapid fire. I fail to see why more training is required of it. Again, "recoil sensitive" is not a real excuse unless it a derivate of a physical handicap. You weren't very clear about that point.I think I've answered this twice already. Anything regarded as ARMS under the purpose of defense against foreign/domestic forces should not be infringed on. A magazine being a necessary component of a firearm really should be aligned under the generalization of ARMS. So if high capacity weaponry is deemed necessary by these forces then it should be deemed necessary by the populace.

My biggest disagreement is that I think one should carry any weapon one decides to. As well one should be free to shoot whichever caliber he/she wants. In your previous post you imply that a revolver is all that you should need. That may be fine for you but until you are challenged with a particular situation we will never know. The same goes for me and wanting a semi-auto. At least I will have more rounds and I have yet to have a malfunction.When you talk about shotguns vs. an AR; those were great videos. I don't think you can shoot a shotgun that well. I can't, therefore I stand by my assertion that an AR can provide a higher rate of fire. I base that off of my 20 years of experience although I will admit that I do not know everything.I stand by my claim that almost, indeed; most everyone will agree that you can attain a higher rate of fire with an AR or similarly chambered weapon than a shotgun.

"Want" and "need" are two seperate issues. "Need" is the point of discussion, not "Want". It may be impossible to plan for all situations, but for the specific purpose of SD against the common criminal confrontation on the streets a revolver is all you should "need". You keep saying you shoot better/faster with an AR because you trained with it more. That's an unfair advantage in that you could've trained with the shotgun instead. Again, "Want" and "need" disparity. I fail to see what arduous training is required to rapid fire at 10 yards. You can keep your claim.I'm saying there's a lack of evidence as to why an AR will have a significantly faster follow up shot than a shotgun with the same load.

Yes I have a lot of training with an AR but I don't think that is the only reason. As I have posted before, I don't think a load light enough in a shotgun to allow the same rapid fire as an AR would have the desired effect on the threat. I would feel better with a standard load in a shotgun and shoot slower.

If I ever prepare for "Needing" to shoot more than 6 rounds in a situation, I would bring a rifle. I can't think of a situation other than gang ups and firefights where I would really need that.I don't understand, if the same power out of a shotgun is insufficient then why would a 5.56 round be sufficient?

.410 with 1/2oz. shot produces more, but comparable recoil to a 5.56mm. (7.1ft lbs to 5.5 ft lbs) according to chuck hawk. Since we're talking about less than 50 feet, pretty much all of the muzzle energy will reach your target.

Well if you want to literally match the recoil of a 5.56mm then you may need to reload the shells yourself with a tad less powder, but a .410 is 22% more recoil than a 5.56mm, which is comparable. Alongside, the .410 1/2oz also has 36%+ more energy than the 5.56mm (according to chuckhawks) and should penetrate some 4+ inches of ballistic gel at the ranges we're talking about .

I hear you but just don't subscribe to what you are saying. There are guys much smarter than me that suggest a minimum of 12-13 inches of penetration in ballistic gel to be effective in an SD role. Whether or not that is truly necessary is up to debate I suppose, but I tend to agree with them.

I also put the shotgun in line first before the AR in an HD role. I prefer a 12 guage in 00 but I live in a concrete block house which reduces penetration issues. It is very important to remember to be aware of your back stop no matter what load or caliber you choose.

Let me add my two cents. I use an old Remington state police 8 shot 12 gauge pump gun for home defense, but I’m not saying it is the best gun for that purpose. I just grew up on a pump gun, and I have confidence in my ability to operate it in an emergency. I used to use #4 shot, thinking I needed the extra power. But back in ’02 I witnessed the aftermath of a shotgun double homicide inside a house. Federal brand light target 2 ¾ #8 was used, and I can tell you that at home defense distances it is a man killer. I have seen the aftermath of wounds inflicted by many types of firearms before, including large caliber rifles and handguns up to .44mag. But I have never seen wounds more devastating than those caused by #8 shot fired at a distance of 15-20ft. It also has more penetration power than you might think. It is capable of penetrating dry wall and of punching a silver dollar sized hole clean through a 1 ½ inch thick pine head board. I am convinced that if you choose a standard 12 gauge shotgun for home defense then #8 is all you will ever need.

I also put the shotgun in line first before the AR in an HD role. I prefer a 12 guage in 00 but I live in a concrete block house which reduces penetration issues. It is very important to remember to be aware of your back stop no matter what load or caliber you choose.

Bryan,I am sure you are right based on the experience you have just related. I think the discussioun at hand though has evolved into the minutia of what is faster to fire, AR vs. shotgun and what is more accurate while fireing fast AR vs. shotgun.We have strayed quite a bvit from the original intent of the first post.

It's sad to see that in a country of such great strength, courage and conviction, that at a time when it seems obvious to the rest of the world that gun control works, that the citizens of the US will react to shootings like the one in Virginia, by purchasing more firearms.What is it in their society that makes them so scared ?Is it people with guns maybe ? Is it the media's fascination with all things horrific and the way they broadcast them into homes every single day, never really letting the idea of a crazed gunman bursting into their home, school or workplace ever leave their minds ? Whatever it is, it should be seriously looked at. There are arguments that " Guns Kill People "There are arguments that "People kill People, not guns"When the truth is " People with GUNS, kill people" but i do not mean that all people with guns are killers.

Sorry if I wasn't perfectly clear there. I'm talking about people who have had guns for their entire life, got them legaly and are using legaly owned guns in the majority of crime. It is not the legal gun doing the crime it is the illegaly owned guns, so if you take my guns the criminals have no one to stop them since they have guns we don't. Sorry bout that not so clear statement that is what I meant.

Tell me newbie, what would you have done if you were an unarmed Tutsi in Rwanda in the spring of 1994 when hoardes of Hitu were going door to door, dragging your neighbors out of their houses and hacking them to death with machettes (because Rwanda was a "gun free zone" ) ?

I don't think it is obvious that gun control worksemoticonXConfused Remember one thing. In a place like America, with so many guns in existence that you will NEVER make them go away. No gun control measure will EVER get rid of all the guns. Once everyone wakes up to that fact then we can move on to the next one.

What is it in their society that makes them so scared ?It pains me to say that in US society, poverty and other injustices run rampant. Although a majority of this is caused by themselves, people try to find someone to blame. Unfortunately, there is no telling if that someone will be you, a relative, or a close friend. Even if guns werent available, these people so bent on revenge willfind some other object with which to commit their action. I would rather have my own firearm ready to combat these villains if (God forbid) they ever invade my home, than to be stuck with them holding one weapon to my none. It is for the same reason that I educate my family on the proper usage of firearms.Do you want a real reason to be scared of gun control? One of Hitler’s first acts was to make Germany “safer” by slowly restricting firearms and eventually banning them. In six years, thirteen million were exterminated without a defense. One of Stalin’s first acts was to make the USSR “safer” by slowly restricting firearms and eventually banning them. In twenty-four years, twenty million were exterminated without a defense. In China, communist rulers made it a priority to make China “safer” by slowly restricting firearms and eventually banning them. In fifty-eight years, twenty million were exterminated without a defense. Leaders made Turkey “safer” by slowly restricting firearms and eventually banning them. In two years, 1.5 million were exterminated without a defense.Also, guns are not all about self defense. I've been around firearms since I was a toddler, and hunt or target shoot regularly. To me, shooting is more of a hobby and more for enjoyment purposes than defense. That's just one more added benefit.

How can we exercise gun control and nuclear disarmament while America is going on with nuclear genocide? Firstly, America must plead guilty in the WWII genocide of the Japanese! The Japanese civilians got killed in American nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are surely victims! And the mortality figures among those who suffered for years with radiation sickness make the level of genocide even more scary.Secondly, America must plead guilty in more recent such cases among alliance forces in Afghanistan and Iraq and among civilians in these countries. They all fell victims of illegal American tests of new types of nuclear weapons there!! The fact is staying hidden from rest of the world. America is going on with nuclear genocide! And international community should exert immediate pressure on American administration to stop that crime against humanity by the USA!

The question of country’s accession to independence here, in Scotland, is especially acute now, although the background of it numbers over 300 years. Of course, in our Scottish state we have both the supporters of secession from Britain, and opponents. But one thing is clear and important for all, who live on this land: our independence from Britain will deliver the Scottish people from the necessity of participating in war against terror, which was dictated to UK by USA and which turned our country into easy target for international terrorists of all types. Moreover, if we find our own feet, there will no longer need to invest our money in various London’s programs for maintaining status of UK as a great power, specifically, to support cost intensive programs for modernization of UK nuclear arsenals.

While our health and safety inspectors begin examining laboratories of US private pharmaceutical firm Merial Animal Health, which is the most likely source for the return of foot and mouth disease due to our government’s officials, I venture upon a suppose that this epidemic could be initiated by local Islamists as their revenge for our participation in military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Why not? Indeed, it looks like a well-planned diversion, directed to serious undermining of our economy in its agricultural sector. It is enough to remember that previous outbreak of foot and mouth in 2001 cost us 8 milliard pounds sterling! Now EU has already banned importation of British beef. And I’m not surprised if UK meets with many other similar acts of Muslim’s retaliation soon, especially taking into account those unsatisfactory conditions of biosecurity at our research laboratories that are in urgent need of government’s investments. Certainly the Pirbright complex, which was largely built in the 1940s, is not close to the standard expected of a modern biomedical facility of such importance. And our enemies make full use of it. Most likely that in this case the disease virus was tested by them in Surrey for its further usage against us and our US allies during our future possible military actions against Iran…

I am afraid, Bram and Joszi, that you have not been exposed to all the facts. For example, your country, the Netherlands, actually has a higher rate of homicide than Norway. In the Netherlands, less than five percent of homes contain legally owned firearms. In Norway, more than thirty percent of homes contain legally owned firearms.In short, Norway has more guns, yet less people killing each other.In fact, a look at the statistics will reveal that homicide rates for developed nations remain fairly level no matter what the volume of firearms available to the public. In fact, I have just such a scatter chart already prepared.

You have more violent crimes than we do here in the US. I don't just mean you have a higher violent crime rate, you have more violent crimes total!Gun crime in the UK was always low, but since you banned all non-antique handguns your gun murder has risen and your overall non-arigun gun crime has risen a lot!Banning handguns did nothing to reduce gun crime in the UK and I am glad you guys banned handguns. I am glad because everytime someone tries to claim that banning handguns reduces gun crime, I just say "look at the UK".

Maybe in the US. You're pretty saturated with guns and I think you should keep yours. Giving them up when everyone who wants to abuse the law can just stock up before disarmament is a bad idea imo.Over here in the UK, we're not saturated with guns. Gun crime is very low and obtaining a gun isn't as easy as newspapers would lead you to believe. We have no need for guns, and most law abiding citizens wouldn't want one. As such, I don't think we should legalise them over here.-Wez

You and the governement "need" to have a reason to limit my acquisition of a firearm I "want".I can find a reson for needing a particular handgun for self defense, but that is not my requirement. The onus is on you and others to demonstrate why I even "need" to defend my reasoning for having one.Some revolvers do not fit well with some people for their purposes based on utilitarian reasons. It is wrong to limit people's ability to defend themselves on a "one size fits all" handgun approach. If I feel I need or don't need a polymer frame handgun that holds more than ten rounds, then it is my choice for whatever reason I decide, not you or anyone else.

"Want" and "need" are two seperate issues. "Need" is the point of discussion, not "Want". It may be impossible to plan for all situations, but for the specific purpose of SD against the common criminal confrontation on the streets a revolver is all you should "need". You keep saying you shoot better/faster with an AR because you trained with it more. That's an unfair advantage in that you could've trained with the shotgun instead. Again, "Want" and "need" disparity. I fail to see what arduous training is required to rapid fire at 10 yards. You can keep your claim.I'm saying there's a lack of evidence as to why an AR will have a significantly faster follow up shot than a shotgun with the same load.

Christopher M Gibson / Compilation of other Sources2 November 2008Second Amendment: The Right to Bear ArmsThe Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States America states that, “A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.” With much controversy, the right to bear arms has been disputed for many years. Do weapons benefit our community or is it the contrary? Should we be for the use of weapons such as guns or against? Guns do benefit the community when not in the hands of a negligent user. We keep guns for our personal protection from the world that surrounds us. Unfortunately we keep them to protect us primarily from other people who possess guns. A famous slogan by the Colt firearm manufacturer stated, “God made man, but Sam Colt made man equal.” This is an odd way to look at things, but isn’t it true? The weak are inadequate to the strong without some kind of defense; thus, weapons are produced to protect the individual in foreign and domestic attack. In a desperate struggle to save herself from being raped and abused, a 57-year old woman from St. Louis shot and killed her assailant. She had been beaten and raped only a week before by the same man, and when attempting to rape the woman again the attacker met his match, a shotgun. Police will not persecute the woman because she acted in self-defense. (Ratcliffe) In moments of peril, what would you do? Weapons are made for defense. This woman was alone in a dark home and was defenseless without her gun. She had been desecrated and left with a sense of being worthless and used. She did what she had to do to protect herself from this man before he committed this terrible act again. As many as 200,00 women use a gun every year to defend themselves against sexual abuse. (RTKBA) Having a gun for one’s personal protection is a justified means of self-defense. Dick Heller, a D.C. special policeman, registered for a personal handgun used for self-defense in the home. He was rejected based on the law in D.C. that states that no gun is permitted unless used by law enforcement or registered before 1975. Heller and some lawyers pursued a case stating that prohibiting firearms in D.C violates the Second Amendment. The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit’s Judge Henderson claims that the District of Columbia is not a state and that it doesn’t fall under the amendment. (Heller) The District of Columbia is the capital of the United States and for some reason Judge Henderson doesn’t think that the Second Amendment applies to it. After surpassing the Court of Appeals, Heller’s group took the case to the Supreme Court where the decision was made to rid of D.C. gun law that violates the Second Amendment. Washington D.C. was once known as the “murder capital” of the United States. By 2006, the crime rate had dropped drastically due to the District of Columbia v. Heller case. (Washington, D.C.) Having driven the issue, Dick Heller not only regained his rights to possess a handgun, but also helped the community’s crime rate lower. Willie Wood, a store clerk in Greenville, South Carolina, stumbled across the misfortune of being robbed one evening. The two robbers, one armed with a knife and the other a pistol, demanded Willie to give them all of his money in the cash register. He hesitantly handed over his daily earnings of $3000 and refused to get on the ground when commanded to. The gunman shot Willie once in the hand and it skimmed his chest. The gunman ran for the car and the other jumped over the counter tackling the wounded clerk to the ground. Willie’s mother, hearing the fight from the other room, came running to help him by latching onto the suspect and trying to pull him away. In the battle, Willie’s mother was fatally stabbed in the chest. Willie grabbed his pistol from underneath his shirt and squeezed five rounds of into the suspect, killing him instantly. (Yates v. Evatt) It is in cases like these where store clerks have to fend for themselves against armed robbers. Robbers usually have a well-planned scenario and firearms to supply the fear factor. Willie did the right thing to arm himself with a handgun to protect his store and himself. It is the right of any persons claiming citizenship in this country to own a firearm. The Second Amendment of the United States protects that right. I believe that everyone should own a firearm with no intentions to use it in a harmful manner. Guns are used for protection against the evils of this world and it’s hard to do without. In two different cases, I have enlightened you with stories of victims having to use guns for their safety from those evils. There are different views on gun control and during this election each side has an opposing standpoint. On one side, McCain is for the use of guns and on the other Obama would like to get rid of guns; either way has its pros and cons. I feel that even if guns were taken away that violence would still be in existence. Guns only make your world a safer place when you use it for your defense. So I ask: Pro gun or no gun?
