Well I'm neither rational nor a theist, but still!I could put in a comment about what I personally believe the nature of God to be, but I'm sure you've all heard it before so I won't bother!In the end I don't think it is an easy question to answer, it is asking to define the undefinable. Humans are limited creatures, we can give a dictionary definition of these things, we have a rough idea of the concept of infinity but can never begin to truly comprehend or define it.

Your question itself is a problem. God is 'He who is', not a 'what'.You are a self-confessed atheist. What do you care what people believe other than attempt to ridicule? Hence your question 'what is God?' which is rather loaded by already de-personalising God.Secondly, why would it matter to you about someone trying to define God, who paradoxically, is be definition, undefinable?Do you believe that you will hear an understanding of God that you've not heard before, or are you of the belief you are open-minded on the subject, and might well have an epiphany?

phuntin,So now you have said that god is undefinable or often said "supernatural".So the discussion follows...T:I believe in GodA:What is God?T:I dont know.Montalban,You've avoided the question. God does not fill the word "who" because to most accounts he is not a person, or being. But for your sake I will restate the question.Who is God?Describe God to me. What is that you believe in?Yes I am an atheist.But I wish to debate the existance or possibility of an existance of God.No such debate can exist without a precise idea of what God is.Consider the following conversation.A: "I believe in a unie"B: "What is your evidence?"A: "It has rained for three consecutive days, that is my evidence"Both are at fault here for not laying out exaclty what a unie out. A has failed to defy unie and B has failed to ask what it is that A believes in.By definition is undefinable?So then God you cannot claim that god is: loving, good, omnipotent, ominiscent, etc....Or do you claim such.Again I ask you describe what it is that you believe in?Is your answer than you believe in the undefinable of which you do not know any further?I'm not going to go into what is wrong with the idea of God without knowing it is what we mean we speak the word.Excuse me if I am mistaken, but it seems that you are getting defensive on your belief before I even begin a debate. I'm simply looking for any one wishing to participate on the nature / existance of God.If you find my questions to be complete nonsense and that I'm only here to critize theism than you need not participate.thebootfitter,True but this progesses nothing twoards a conversation because you have no told me the nature of such an existance.You have said if A is then A=A.... thats saying a lot without saying anything at all because you have failed to provide what A is.

I am suggesting that (assuming a God exists) the nature of God is unknowable in the realm in which we exist. Unlike a square or a rock or a chair or a tree which are of this physical realm, and for which we can make a definition and then test the object to determine if it fits the definition, we cannot do this with God, simply because there is no way to 'test' God within the physical realm in which we exist. Many different people have many different ideas, none of which have evidence independent of their interpretations. These individual interpretations have no bearing on the true nature of God (again assuming a God exists). It is possible that some of these individual interpretations coincide with some aspect of the true nature of God. It is also possible that no individual interpretation comes close to defining the true nature of God. Ultimately, it is unknowable in the physical realm in which we exist.By asking the question that you are asking, you may get responses from individuals with their personal interpretations of the God as they see God. None of these will have any 'proof.' I recognize that regardless of what anyone believes, God is as God is (assuming a God exists).Certainly, discussion beyond what I pose is possible, but ultimately doesn't get us any closer to knowing the true nature of God, nor does it get us any closer to determining whether or not a God exists. That is the realm of belief. There are a multitude of beliefs about the nature of God (including a belief in the non-existence of God). What I stated is one thing that can be said of God with certainty.

I believe God to be X, Y, and Z.Instead of making up X, Y, and Z, I recognize that making up X, Y, and Z is irrelevant to the question of 'What is God.'

bootfitter,Well of course they can include that while they are not absolutely certain of X,Y,Z they (according to some reason such as the Bible) believe God to have the x quality.My question can be taken both ways. By saying "What is God" and "What do you believe God to be" I am essentially attempting to ask the same thing. What they answer for God to be is obviously their belief.Yes but again you have told me nothing except that you know nothing about what you believe. In which case you have failed to define in relative terms of what you beleive.With only this definition to say "I believe in God" is senseless and establishes nothing.The same is comprative to the following:A: I believe in a unie.B: What is a unie.A: A unie is as a unie is.All right then under this technically I re-pose my question: Teach me about God. (Although I thinking asking what God is is asking essentially the same thing)I do not have a belief in God. I'm am an atheist. So this question does not apply to me.But I have heard answers before from Christians which attempt to descibe the nature of the God they believe in.The descriptions are usually somewhat the same. They assign qualities such as: all loving, omnipotent, omniscience, wise, just, all good, incapable of evil, enfallable, etc...

Within the context of this discussion, I have not indicated that I 'believe in' a God. Regarding your 'unie' example, the same point applies:If a unie exists, then a unie is as a unie is.Without a clear definition of a unie, we cannot know for certain whether or not a unie exists. The same applies to God. And since a clear and ultimate definition of God is unattainable in this realm, then we cannot know with certainty whether or not a God exists. We can only believe. If we believe that a God exists, we may also assign attributes to this God that we believe this God possesses.Not I, nor anyone in this physical realm, can teach you about God as God is, assuming God exists. I, along with everyone else, could only teach you what may or may not be true about God according to some perception of God (and again, assuming God exists).I understand this now. It was not clear to me initially, as there is a distinction between the two question. One asks what IS, as in reality. The other asks what do you BELIEVE is.

All right. I think I agree for the most part.I understand your point. All right. It appears we have reached common ground.- - -So I repose my question.Teach me what you believe God is. What is it that you believe God is?What is the nature of which you believe? (They all amount to the same point of the perceptional idea of God, which I am asking of all theists)I don't understand why my question still lacks an answer. Perhaps you all were under the impression that my question dealt with actual reality, but I doubt that. I thought I would be swarmed with answers.Theists....Where are you?

To SilentPoet:I might as well give it ago, I am just a tad bored, you know what I mean?What is God as best defined by you? Describe the nature of God. What is it that you believe in? Before I start, I am a Christian and will as a result be trying to answer your question from a Biblical point-of-view. An introduction to the Trinty:There is only one God; but He consists of three distinct persons, Father, Son and the Holy Spirit. The word "Trinty" is not found anywhere in the Scriptures, but it is name given by Christians to express the doctrine of the unity of God as consisting of three distinct persons. So your question becomes sort of illogical. For more information on the Trinty and the Christian doctrine regarding it, I would strongly suggest and recommend that you visit the Bible Dictionary for "Trinty" on the Christian Answers website. Because this part isn't really my strongsuit - I believe it but I have trouble explaining this, I have copied this information from the Christian Answers website:TRI-UNITY -- The teaching of the Bible concerning the Trinity might be summarized thus. God is a Tri-unity, with each Person of the Godhead equally and fully and eternally God. Each is necessary, and each is distinct, and yet all are one. The three Persons appear in a logical, causal order. The Father is the unseen, omnipresent Source of all being, revealed in and by the Son, experienced in and by the Holy Spirit. The Son proceeds from the Father, and the Spirit from the Son. With reference to God's creation, the Father is the Thought behind it, the Son is the Word calling it forth, and the Spirit is the Deed making it a reality.We "see" God and His great salvation in the Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, then "experience" their reality by faith, through the indwelling presence of His Holy Spirit.Though these relationships seem paradoxical, and to some completely impossible, they are profoundly realistic, and their truth is ingrained deep in man's nature. Thus, men have always sensed first the truth that God must be "out there," everywhere present and the First Cause of all things, but they have corrupted this intuitive knowledge of the Father into pantheism and ultimately into naturalism.Similarly, men have always felt the need to "see" God in terms of their own experience and understanding, but this knowledge that God must reveal Himself has been distorted into polytheism and idolatry. Men have thus continually erected "models" of God, sometimes in the form of graven images, sometimes even in the form of philosophical systems purporting to represent ultimate reality.Finally, men have always known that they should be able to have communion with their Creator and to experience His presence "within." But this deep intuition of the Holy Spirit has been corrupted into various forms of false mysticism and fanaticism, and even into spiritism and demonism. Thus, the truth of God's tri-unity is ingrained in man's very nature, but he has often distorted it and substituted a false god in its place.The above is basically the Christian belief summed up. Simple and effective. That appears to answer your questions, curtsey Christian Answers

SP: Hello again. I hope you are well. God is difficult to define. One would not expect a finite being such as myself to define clearly and completely an infinite being such as God. However, as with any person God has defined himself. We all definie or identify, ourselves by various methods. What we like and dislike. What we do, where we go, where we have been. God has done this as well in the bible. He has mades statements about the things he likes and dislikes (The ten commandments for instance). He tells what he does (he is a creator for instance, He loves, he has mercy and grace.) He tells us where he has been (He is the God that is, was, and will be, in otherwords exists outside of time).There are other things naturally. I can tell you some because as a finite being I will take a life time getting to know him. This is true with any person. You cannot completely define your closest and dearest friend. It is impossible because people are infinitely complex. You can know your friend none the less. This is true of God as well. You have heard me talk about God on this forum for quite sometime. This is how God is defined. You ask an impossibly broad question. Sglaine seems to imply that theists will only hamper you with illogic when it comes to defining God and they will eventually say they don't know. I know some not all. So do you. This is right. To assume that we should be able to define God completely and accurately is illogical.

Montalban,Ha. Nice one.Montalban you are beginning to bother me. If you are not interested in a discussion then by all means do not discuss and completely ignore this thread.This is a new approach to a theistic/atheistic discussion so you perhaps you would actaully like to listen to what I have to say instead of telling others to pay not attention.If you have nothing productive or meaningful to contribute to the ACTUAL discussion the please shut up.dreamweaver,Excuse my apparent ignorance, but this description is not sufficent.I do not know what the "Supreme Being" is that you are referring to."The" points to something specific which you have designated as "Supreme Being" but I do not know what "Supreme Being" you are speaking of or anything about this "Supreme Being".Also when you say "Being" is this in the same sense that we (people) consider beings? Beings are in all case (to my knowledge) finite beings that exist in the physical realm. How could this apply to God, which by most accounts I have heard, who is supernatural and does not exist within the "physical realm"?unkerpaulie,Thank you. Finally a definition I can work with to understand.All right we have come up with "extremely powerful" "credited to creating the universe and life" "nurturing" and "benevolent".First I need to clear up "extremely powerful". Are you excluding God from being omnipotent (all powerful)?In other words, is God all powerful, or extremely powerful?Next I'd like to present a belief of mine in relation to "credited to creating the universe and life":I have very few concrete beliefs. But one of this is an axiom. This axiom is that "existance exists". I do not find existance to be a perceptual thing, but rather existance exists outside of perception.Life, the universe, existance itself is independent. It does not rely on the perceptions of others to exist, rather it exists.As part of this axiom existance (as a whole) cannot be simply created. Nor can existance (as a whole) be destroyed. Existance is and always will be in form of another of: Matter, Space, Energy, Light, Heat, etc...That is my axiom. Which although it may not seem relevant now I am certain it will eventually come up if the conversation continues and we can refer back to this.Now you have said that God is "extremely powerful" (powerful enough apparently make existance out of non-existance) and that he created the universe and life in which we know live. Also you have stated that God is benevolent. And so down the rabbit hole we go...Every action, every deed and every occurance of anything in the unvirse is allowed by God to occur. If God is extremely powerful and all good how does this fit in with the travestys that befall mankind. War, Death, Rape, Thievery, etc.... In respect to the idea of good and evil (which we have come to understand) this universe, this life, is surely full of evil.When asking this question before I have received the answer that evil and bad befall man because of the "origonal sin" Adam and Eve made. While I don't think this argument holds up when you bring in some claims of God's omniscience I will leave this alone.But while this claim might be able to defend the allowance by God of man affecting man it does not cover up for God's allowance of the natural travestys and disasters that befall man, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, etc...So if God is truly benevolent why does he allow such natural disasters which kill and wreck lives to occur? If God was not all good would he surely not stop these incidents from occuring?

Epaphras_faith,Sorry I did not reply to your message in the one before this, you must have responded when I was replying.And the same to you.Understood that you could claim that you cannot COMPLETELY define God.But none of this tells me what God is.But surely there is a more specific definition you can give than incomprhensible / undefinable. Otherwise I'm not entirely sure you what you believe in as the discussion would follow:T:I believe in GodA:What is God?T:I dont know.A:Well then what is it that you believe in?The theist (under the undefinable definition of God) is forced to answer:T: I dont know And so I would ask you now:"Well then in what sense is your statement even relevant?How does your beleif any different from no beleif at all"Yes but I can assign attributes to my friend, while not having to full define him.I am not asking for a full definition of God, because that would seem impossible if he is truly undefinable would it not?Instead I am asking for attributes to describe in some way the nature of God to me.(This can also be done in relationship to my closest friend, while not having to full define him.)

Also you have stated that God is benevolent. And so down the rabbit hole we go...Every action, every deed and every occurance of anything in the unvirse is allowed by God to occur. If God is extremely powerful and all good how does this fit in with the travestys that befall mankind. War, Death, Rape, Thievery, etc.... In respect to the idea of good and evil (which we have come to understand) this universe, this life, is surely full of evil.When asking this question before I have received the answer that evil and bad befall man because of the "origonal sin" Adam and Eve made. While I don't think this argument holds up when you bring in some claims of God's omniscience I will leave this alone.But while this claim might be able to defend the allowance by God of man affecting man it does not cover up for God's allowance of the natural travestys and disasters that befall man, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, etc...So if God is truly benevolent why does he allow such natural disasters which kill and wreck lives to occur? If God was not all good would he surely not stop these incidents from occuring?

SilentPoet,No; "being" is used in many senses and ranges quite significantly depending on its context. There cannot be a better definition for God than Supreme Being. And, as you have probably noticed, it is certainly a common one. From the modifying qualifier, "Supreme" we can actually speculate on the majority of the properties of such a being. To put it simply, it means unrivalled and best. With regard to existence, such a being is that which exists necessarily; and, this tells us several things, once again. For example, that all that exists is contingent upon its existence; it can never be destroyed, etc...To your original question: "What is God?" People have various ideas of what "God" is, and they vary quite significantly. Some think there are a plethora of gods, some think there to be only one. I assume you are referring to the God of Classical Theism, however. Such a being has various attributes, and, I'm sure you know of them. So, just what is the point of this thread? See the Catholic's take on God. Not all people claim that God is undefinable; and, that is rather a sweeping claim.

Epaphras_faith,Sorry I did not reply to your message in the one before this, you must have responded when I was replying.And the same to you.Understood that you could claim that you cannot COMPLETELY define God.But none of this tells me what God is.But surely there is a more specific definition you can give than incomprhensible / undefinable. Otherwise I'm not entirely sure you what you believe in as the discussion would follow:T:I believe in GodA:What is God?T:I dont know.A:Well then what is it that you believe in?The theist (under the undefinable definition of God) is forced to answer:T: I dont know And so I would ask you now:"Well then in what sense is your statement even relevant?How does your beleif any different from no beleif at all"Yes but I can assign attributes to my friend, while not having to full define him.I am not asking for a full definition of God, because that would seem impossible if he is truly undefinable would it not?Instead I am asking for attributes to describe in some way the nature of God to me.(This can also be done in relationship to my closest friend, while not having to full define him.)

dreamweaver,Dictionary: Sumpreme BeingDefintion 1: GodDefintion 2: I must assume that for the sake of progession that you were referring to the second defintion (because the 1st would lead to nothing (What is A, A=A thus no progession) ).And so with this I will accept this as your defition and attempt to disect it.Supernatural through disection amounts to unconceivable.Supernatural is by implication and definition outside of the physical realm and outside of natural laws. The supernatural is completely independent of any established laws of the universe and existance. It lies beyond the realm of human comprehension. I assume we can agree on this.A perfect supernatural God?What true relevancy does the quality of perfection hold on the supernatural. Since the supernatural lies beyond human understand and we can have no comprehension of the supernatural the perfect or imperfect supernatural would hold no bearing as we as people could not differentiate between the two.How would one know claim that something beyond our realm of understanding (in the supernatural realm) is perfect. Perfect can only been used when described in relationship to something else and since God in the supernatural realm cannot be validly compared in the area of perfection to people, God as the only supernatural idea would neither be perfect nor imperfect.An Omnipotent God?Omnipotent (all powerful). What is meant by this? Is God truly capable of doing anything, even if it defys logical possibility.For instance can God creat a square circle? No of course not because this is impossible. The assertion that God can do such is absurd.And so the theist must resort to the idea that God can do anything that we can imagine. "If we can think it, God can do it".I cannot imagine a square circle, but I can imagine an acorn changing into an elephant. And while this may appear valid because at first glance it seems to eliminate the "logically impossible" it does no such thing.The mere fact that I can imagine an acorn into an elephant does not make it a possibility. It is impossible for such a thing.Everything in existance has qualities that make it what it is. All of these things simply do not pop out of nowhere but are rather formed by combinations of matter (or energy). One form of matter cannot simply change itself to another form of matter without the required elements and process motivation to do so, and these elements required cannot simply pop out of nowhere.The specifications for an acorn vary greatly in that from an elephant. The acron can by no means change in any way into an elephant. An inanimate object cannot become a concious one. Its logically impossible.Both the "square circle" and "acorn to elephant" are logically impossibilities and to claim them as possible is absurd and irrational.Now the theist has several choices. 1. He can continue to claim that God is omnipotent while ignoring all logical evidence to the contrary. 2. He can abandon his claim of God being omnipotent and change the quality of God to extremely powerful.3. Or he can flee into a form of agnosticism where he claims that God's awsome power is beyond human understand and logic nor reason are able to step into the realm which is God.The 1st choice is irrational.The 2nd is somewhat more logicalThe 3rd falls to:If man is unable to comprehend God how is it that you can claim that this God is omnipotent, if it was truly unable to be comprehended wouldn't you simply not be sure?The Omniscince of GodAll right. But this come under disection of my previous argument adressed to another that I now give to you:If God is extremely powerful and all good how does this fit in with the travestys that befall mankind. War, Death, Rape, Thievery, etc....

To SilentPoet:Suprisingly in all of this you have told me nothing.... May be if you weren't so biased and actually read it, you might have noticed that you question was answered. Firstly and foremost, your question is not only logically flawed, but also physically flawed. You asked for a description of God, but there are three parts to God - which you would know if you actually bothered to read it throughly with an "open mind". So in order to describe God we must define the three parts that make up God, i.e. the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit.Also, how can I explain something that I have no physically observed? Here your question is also logically flawed. I cannot explain the features to something to which I have no positively observed.But I didn't ask for the Trinity. I asked for God which you have told me = the trinity which = God. If I ask the nature of A, (and i do not know the nature of B) and you tell me A=B and B=A I have learned nothing except the relationship of A and B which I know nothing of. You asked me to describe God, and in order to do so, I need to describe or explain the concept of the Trinity. That is, there are three parts to "God" - as weird as that sounds. You were not specific in your question. You asked me to describe God, and God consists of three parts. As you can see, your question is flawed.I am asking the nature / description of what / who the father (God) is. How do you expect me to describe something that I have not seen. Your question is stupid and illogical. If you ask a half decent answerable question, you may get some answers. Basically, God is the "Alpha and the Omega".

Rouge,Suprisingly in all of this you have told me nothing....But I didn't ask for the Trinity. I asked for God which you have told me = the trinity which = God.Thus I know nothing.If I ask the nature of A, (and i do not know the nature of B) and you tell me A=B and B=A I have learned nothing except the relationship of A and B which I know nothing of."The Son proceeds from the Father"...I am asking the nature / description of what / who the father (God) is.Again you have not told me what this "God" is.Side note: I have no problem with you giving me the definition of God through a copy and paste of some other source (unless of course its too long) but please make sure that what you say properly answers the question. Montalban,Ha. Nice one.Montalban you are beginning to bother me. If you are not interested in a discussion then by all means do not discuss and completely ignore this thread.This is a new approach to a theistic/atheistic discussion so you perhaps you would actaully like to listen to what I have to say instead of telling others to pay not attention.If you have nothing productive or meaningful to contribute to the ACTUAL discussion the please shut up.dreamweaver,Excuse my apparent ignorance, but this description is not sufficent.I do not know what the "Supreme Being" is that you are referring to."The" points to something specific which you have designated as "Supreme Being" but I do not know what "Supreme Being" you are speaking of or anything about this "Supreme Being".Also when you say "Being" is this in the same sense that we (people) consider beings? Beings are in all case (to my knowledge) finite beings that exist in the physical realm. How could this apply to God, which by most accounts I have heard, who is supernatural and does not exist within the "physical realm"?unkerpaulie,Thank you. Finally a definition I can work with to understand.All right we have come up with "extremely powerful" "credited to creating the universe and life" "nurturing" and "benevolent".First I need to clear up "extremely powerful". Are you excluding God from being omnipotent (all powerful)?In other words, is God all powerful, or extremely powerful?Next I'd like to present a belief of mine in relation to "credited to creating the universe and life":I have very few concrete beliefs. But one of this is an axiom. This axiom is that "existance exists". I do not find existance to be a perceptual thing, but rather existance exists outside of perception.Life, the universe, existance itself is independent. It does not rely on the perceptions of others to exist, rather it exists.As part of this axiom existance (as a whole) cannot be simply created. Nor can existance (as a whole) be destroyed. Existance is and always will be in form of another of: Matter, Space, Energy, Light, Heat, etc...That is my axiom. Which although it may not seem relevant now I am certain it will eventually come up if the conversation continues and we can refer back to this.Now you have said that God is "extremely powerful" (powerful enough apparently make existance out of non-existance) and that he created the universe and life in which we know live.

If God was not all good would he surely not stop these incidents from occuring?

SP: No. :) I meant the first one (the other wasn't "definition 2" it was another dictionary), just to clarify that it was the best definition for God. With regard to the rest, I told you what we can determine from the lovely modifying qualifier, "Supreme". There is progression - taking that. What parts of it did you not understand; help me out here. ;)I'd love to take the time to answer your questions, but it is quite evident that you didn't check the links that I provided. Check the Catholics take on God - they clarify what they mean by the specific terms too. After that, I'll have no problem answering your questions. With regard to the "problem of evil", I have a few recommendations for a read (I can re-outline a few theodicies/answers to if you like, but I think it wouldn't hurt to learn some theology): Augustine, City of God and Confessions; Aquinas, Summa Theologica; C.S. Lewis, The Problem of Pain; Anselm's Proslogion. Augustine is probably the best place to start. Oh, Irenaeus and Origen would be great too.p.s. I assume you're using The American Heritage dictionary.

SP, your post 24 sums up nicely myperspective on the logic of the definition of God. i believe it was dremweaver that i had a long discussion with about this in another thread.there are many popular beliefs about the nature of God that believers take for granted but which are really illogical if you really look deeper at it. some of the common attributes of God that werent covered in post 24God knows the future and we have free willi wont go into this, but it is clearly illogical that both cannot coexistthe question of evil in the worldfirst of all, in all honesty, the existence of evil/natural disasters does not strengthen the notion that God doesnt exist, nor does it suggest that God is not a perfectly loving God. first of all, is a tsunami or earthquake or flood evil? if these "disasters" occured on Mars or any other unihabited planet, would it be evil? secondly, how do you define a tragedy? is a broken fingernail a tragedy? loss of your job? loss of a limb? loss of your life? tragedies are only defined in the perspective of the person experiencing the event. an event in itself cannot be evil or good, only the perception of the one experiencing it. a winter at one point could have been a natural disaster. a hot summer as well. even a sunset could cause destruction.think about a world where we stop all evil. food is abundant, nobody has to work and nobody feels pain. would that cause people to be more content? or innovative? or competitive? would mankind be as advanced as it is now?the question of testimonyalmost every believer subscribes to some written or passed-on story of past feats of God and historical manifestations of supernatural power being witnessed. but the biggest objection to the existence of God (personally, in my opinion) is the lack of present manifestation. the Bible and other religious books are filled with wonderous stories of miracles and supernatural events. then they would go on to claim that believers would able to achieve these same powers, or at least witness them. however, not a single miracle or supernatural event have been ever witnessed or recorded. i think this weighs even more heavily than the fact that no evidence of past reported miracles have ever been found. for example, if scientist produce confirmed reports that there are no chariots or remains of egyptian armies anywhere in the red sea, and then a man stands at the bank of th red sea and stretches out a stick and makes the water divide all the way down to the sea bed, then any evidence contrary to the story of Moses would be totally irrelevant. the same with many other stories of miracles. if a man could walk across the surface of liquid water, without the water changing and without the man's physiology changing, then there would be no dispute to whether Jesus could do it, or far less if Jesus even existed. but it is abundantly clear that these events are simply not happening in the world at all in this era, and it strongly suggests that they never did

unkerpaulie,That is true, but I dont want to go over everything at once because I don't have the time and I'm not going to refut unmade claims.I understand your point, but its obvious to most that the loss of large amounts of life due to natural disasters are a bad thing to happen. To let large amount of people die, when you have the power to prevent it at no expense to you is not by any means a good thing to do.To the rest of what you have said I do not agree with it all and some of it does not relate to the nature of God but thanks for your input.

SilentPoet,God is the Supreme Being, and the Supreme Being is God, but it does not follow that we have not learnt anything. I’m mentioning this for the third time here, but hopefully it should be alright. This qualifier we have, “Supreme”, tells us a lot of things. We can speculate on the attributes of such a being, Supreme Power; Supreme Knowledge and the like. Now, with regard to modal status, it should be palpable that a Supreme Being would have necessary existence – ontological perfection which, is indeed, the supreme modality; no other existence has more views. I don’t normally provide links to argue my points, but here, it seemed as though you were genuinely trying to find out what theists mean when they posit such an entity as God. I apologise if I misread you, but if you were seeking to truly learn, that link would have been next to ideal for you. It sums up the Catholic doctrine on God. So wait, do you want me to go through these arguments now? Sheesh.I’d like you to expand a little on the “laws of nature” here before we continue. In science, we use the term “law” a lot, but there really are no absolute laws of science. As you know, science is based on empiricism – on induction. It has no room for absolute truths and it would be a mockery to it to suggest that it does. We give names such as “Newton’s Laws”, “Ohm’s Law”, “Kirchoff’s Laws” and the like, but none of these are absolute in any sense. Firstly, that which is reached through induction can never provide absolute certainty; it can only show something to be probable. However, that is not only what we rely on. In fact, we do indeed know that all these are subject to be broken. You’ll note that at the point of a singularity all our “laws” break down – including Relativity and it all; our equations break up and everything is meaningless. Can’t really blame us – how are we meant to comprehend that which is infinitesimal? So, what is meant when you say the "laws" of nature? Scientific laws (which aren't absolute)...? Sorry, but the majority of that point is pure speculation. Granted for the moment that God in “His realm” is not “perfect” (something which the theist is not constrained to accept), as you presuppose, so what? Why would this cause a problem for the theist? The theist might easily superimpose that God, in comparison to homosapiens and all of nature is eternally perfect. Of course you can compare that which is another dimension; your point is saying that we cannot compare football and computer games – because one is a sport and the other is of something different – a computer. Or, that we could not compare two films because they are of a different genre. You’re asking this and you’re telling me that you read the Catholic article? I won’t outline it all now, partly because of lack of time, but: is the point of this thread for you to learn, or to debate? You might say both, but which is primary? If it is to learn, then I think you would do well to read the article on Omnipotence; if not, you can just say and I’ll answer the questions you proffered. The only reason I provide links is because the arguments proposed here are pseudoproblems, answered easily by some mild theology. Particularly the POE.Problem of EvilI wrote the below some time ago on this forum; I think my views are pretty much the same, so it should suffice:Since you have presupposed in your inference three that evil exists, the burden of proof lays on your shoulder to (i) Define evil, and (ii) show that it exists.Since I have a little extra time, I think I'll go on with this. Your terms need to be thoroughly defined. I define God as Supreme Being. I think that God is Love, and I define love as that which facilitates goodness (not original to me). I also define omnipotence as "Supreme Power". Darkness is the absence of light - a lie is the obstruction of truth, evil is goodness denied. Evil, in itself, is not really a substance. It is but a deprivation. When an apple rots, the rottenness itself is not a substance, but simply the privation of freshness. Furthermore, "coldness" does not exist; it is but the absence of heat/energy. When we call a person "cold" we mean that they are one who is lacking in emotion or in sensitivity. In the same way, evil is goodness denied.On another note, let's proffer that it makes sense to say that evil exists. If a Supreme Being allowed this evil to occur, but for it to have a purpose, then things are "all gravy" and there's really no problem. On another note, if this God provided humans with free will moral agency, then it would not mean that he is malicious. What I mean, is that free moral agency is neither good nor evil. It is a mechanism, not an aesthetic, by which love and goodness can occur. Of course, it allows the contrapositive to occur since it is necessary - decision. One does not call a line crooked without some idea of a straight line. It can be easily argued that evil exists for us to consciously identify it from good. Paul writes, “For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.” Finally, the POE can never be used to refute the existence of an almighty being. It only poses as "problem" (if you want to call it that) to those who follow the God of Classical Theism. Therefore, it does not prove the non-existence of a God. On a last note, you suggest that this world is evil; tell me, which world are you comparing it to? You, in particular, speak of “natural evil” – tell me, why should I consider any of this evil. Are you proposing that an objective evil exists? Perhaps a definition (preferably not an example) of evil would suffice, here. On a final note; Poet- if you were provided with the evidence, would you change your stance on the existence of God, truly?

unkerpaulie,That is true, but I dont want to go over everything at once because I don't have the time and I'm not going to refut unmade claims.I understand your point, but its obvious to most that the loss of large amounts of life due to natural disasters are a bad thing to happen. To let large amount of people die, when you have the power to prevent it at no expense to you is not by any means a good thing to do.To the rest of what you have said I do not agree with it all and some of it does not relate to the nature of God but thanks for your input.

it is not necessarily obvious that the loss of a large number of life is a bad thing. the largest threat to mortal man by far is time. if people werent mortal/depreciating and everyone that was born didnt die, that wouldnt be suck a good thing now would it... not that im endorsing genocide, but there are lots of things that are potentially life threating to lots of people, and i think that the presence of hardships/obstacles/natural disasters have brought out the innovation and overcoming nature of mankind and spurred the development to the stage it is atsuppose that God exists, God prevents all evil, and macroevolution is true. do you think that mankind would even exist?secondly, its obvious that a world without evil can not exist, simply because 'evil' is subjective and mankind is by nature discontented. and say God goes on an evil-eliminating campaign. so he ceases all tornados, floods, harsh weather, earthquakes, etc. then he cleans up pollution, then he regulates temperature to ideal climate settings (say 70 in the day, 55 at night). then he removes all cliffs and and slopes, all predators and viruses. what next? make the sea shallow so that noone can drown? make fire at a safe temperature? reduce gravity so that you fall in slowmotion? where do we draw the line?

You are quite correct. You can do these things as can I. I have on different threads and at different times given you (and others which you have read) much of the attributes of God. There are some standards, love (agape, phileo, and eros),mercy, gentleness, kindness, lovingkindness, justice, imenent yet transcendant, omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent, etc. However, these words can only dimly convey what is truly meant by them. GOd spoke in the person of Jesus. Jesus was the exact representation of God. It is one of His purposes for coming. God's love is displayed by the fact that while we were still enemies He died for me on the cross. Jesus said, "greater love has no man than that he should die for his friends." Think about that, Jesus died for His ENEMIES! If you would know who GOd is then discover who Jesus is. If however, you are looking for points from theists to argue with then undoubtedly you will find those also. I am well aware of your stance on God and Jesus,as you are mine. So, suffice it to say that I will finish here. Thanks for responding to me though. I knew we posted at the same time,so I waited. Have a great summer. Hope to argue more soon. emoticonXSmilie

Epaphras_faith,Sorry I did not reply to your message in the one before this, you must have responded when I was replying.And the same to you.Understood that you could claim that you cannot COMPLETELY define God.But none of this tells me what God is.But surely there is a more specific definition you can give than incomprhensible / undefinable. Otherwise I'm not entirely sure you what you believe in as the discussion would follow:T:I believe in GodA:What is God?T:I dont know.A:Well then what is it that you believe in?The theist (under the undefinable definition of God) is forced to answer:T: I dont know And so I would ask you now:"Well then in what sense is your statement even relevant?How does your beleif any different from no beleif at all"Yes but I can assign attributes to my friend, while not having to full define him.I am not asking for a full definition of God, because that would seem impossible if he is truly undefinable would it not?Instead I am asking for attributes to describe in some way the nature of God to me.(This can also be done in relationship to my closest friend, while not having to full define him.)

To all,I apologize for my late response. I have been out of town.Dreamweaver,Unless I have a clear notion (which I don't) of what a Supreme Being is, then I know nothing of God and nothing is learned.So God does not posess all knowledge, but instead the most knowledge? God is not all powerful, but the most powerful?So where do these attributes start and end?So only with the idea that God is the Supreme Being you have a God that could very well lie in the physical realm, correct?When I say this I mean how the physical realm works. Matter cannot be created nor destoryed (same goes with energy). Acorns cannot suddenly zap into elephants. All things (I am aware of) in the universe are finite. Motion laws such as Newtons, etc... There is a certain order to things.I don't agree here. What is not absolute about scientific laws? Science uses logic and experimination and arrives at conclusions based upon these tools. There are no other tools to use and thus it would seem we must assume these conclusions as are truth (or temporary if science develops and conclusions change).Yes of course there are things which science has yet to learn but this does not put it beyond the realm of the finite and understandable nor does it put it beyond the realm of reason and logic.It causes not a problem on the existance of God, but the idea of a perfect supernatural God doesn't make any sense.But there can be made no comparsion between God and homosapians. The theist claims God is beyond human understanding, the physical realm, and beyond reason. The notion of God to some point (claims the theist) is uncomprehensible. Well yes of course you can compare football and computer games. There is a large difference between this and the analogy is not valid.We as people (claims the theist) cannot truly comprehend God who is supernatural. Although we can to large degree understand ourselves. So here we are comparing the unknowable (God) to the knowable (people). This comparison cannot occur.Now as to your football vs. computer game example these are both in the physical realm and are not beyond human reasoning. We understand both of these and are not in any way supernatural or unconceivable.Thus it is the knowable to the knowable.Again the notion of a "perfect" supernatural God is senseless. Instead God would be supernatural since we have no prior notion of the imperfect supernatural. You can only compare things that you can comprehend.No I did not read the entire Catholic article but rather looked for the definition of God to which we can discuss. If there is something specific you would like me to read then please point it out. As far as the article of Omnipotence...I have read the article but I still have a problem with God's "omnipotence". For you see the entire notion of the universe (which includes matter and energy) is logically impossible. Matter / Energy cannot be created or destoryed. You cannot have nothing and simply pop out of it some planet or star. To propose such is to propose the logically impossible as with the acorn to elephant example which I stated earlier.So to claim that God created the universe is an irrational illogical and impossible claim.Oh come on. This is ridiculous. Because evil in the Christian sense is obvious.Dictionary.com - Causing ruin, injury, or pain; harmfulI do not beleive in any kind of absolute evil. So I'll refer to what I am speaking of as "bad" events. These bad events are not good. They cause damage and or pain both physically and mentally. Bad events occur constantly. For these you can turn on the local news. Hear about the rape, murder, robbery, these are all "bad" events. More significant and well known "bad" events in history include various genocides such as in Africa and the Holocaust in Germany.The occurance of these events is undeniable. It is contradictory for a God to be all good, all powerful, and all knowing and still create the world knowing such events would occur (due to his omniscience). Also if one has the option of preventing such bad events (murder, abuse, torture) then one who is good would take the oppurunity.We both know what it is generally I am speaking of when I speak of evil and the idea of "bad" events is obvious.I've heard this argument before but it doesn't hold in the face of obvious misery in the world.Events are not just caused by man's "God given" free will. Natural disasters occur that also cause pain and death to many at the choice of no one.To allow such events to occur and to be all good is contradictory.It doesn't disprove the existance of God. But rather is disproves the existance of an all good God.I'm comparing it to a lack of evil in places of the world which also exist.But to humor you I will restate, in this existance evil exists.www.dictionary.comCausing ruin, injury, or pain; harmful: the evil effects of a poor diet. http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=evilThis discussion isnt about evidence for its existance, but rather what is meant by "its existance". You cannot provide evidence for something that is not understood and expect me to beleive it.Bob: I beleive in a unie.Mike: What is your evidence?Bob: It has rained for three consecutive days... that is my evidence.No one knows what a unie is and thus the entire conversation accomplishes nothing.But as a side not in response to your question:If I was given solid evidence or substantial logic for the existance of God, I would beleive. Do you have some for me?unkerpaulie,My argument is now the evil that occurs as a result of nature. Not all of evil itself. Stick to the issue.I'm not sure. But I don't see how this discredits my argument.Epaphras_faith,See the issues I am discussing with Dreamweaver.Also see post 24 in which I question some of these above proposed qualities..

Ack, sorry for the ultimately late reply; I stopped checking in here some time ago. SilentPoet,Ok, first things first. For the first thing, I'd like to clarify something that might be obvious, but it helps in debate. In debate, whatever I say is what I mean – I don't really have any cryptic secret message and my words are of the standard English. I said the above particularly because some of your notions and rebuttals appear to be attacking a strawman, nothing of what I have said. Did I ever say that the Supreme Being would have the best power but not “all” the power? Never. If one has all the power, anyhow, they automatically have the best power. And, I thought I was pretty clear on the notion especially with regard to existence. God doesn't exist in the most possible worlds; an ontologically perfect being exists in all the possible worlds with regard to possible world semantics. This is the “most” amount of possible worlds that a being can exist in, but it is also all the possible worlds that a being can exist in. God does not exist in the physical realm; that is inconsistent with the idea of the Supreme Being. Such a being cannot change and is beyond time. I'm sorry, and I need no offence to you, but this debate is going to be entirely futile if you're not versed on the make-up and foundation of science with empiricism. It is a mockery to science to even suppose that it is absolute. I know you don't like me recommending things, but you should really check out Popper on this; he's good. I fully explained why science is not absolute above – you just said that you disagreed without any reasons. Science can use logic, great, but it uses induction to reach its conclusion. Hence its non-absoluteness. What? Surely you have a reason for it supposedly not being a valid analogy? For one, the presupposition that matter cannot be created/destroyed rests upon the “laws” of thermodynamics – of science. As you should know, all of the laws of science break down at the point of singularity – an infinetismal (which is where our universe came from), and consequently, we have no reason to trust any law at that point. Including general and special relativity. Check some science out, all sources will agree. With regard to evil, no, what is ridiculous is your initial presupposition that evil exists and the fact that you haven't defined your terms properly. Let's take a look at your definition:Dictionary.com - Causing ruin, injury, or pain; harmfulOk. Scenario: a friend of mine was shot by an arrow. Let's say it got in real deep. In his leg. Now, I, knowing that it would be better to take out the arrow first before anything else, I take it out. It causes him suffering, because the arrow is sharp; it causes him injury, and it causes him pain. It's evil, really? This type of definition, of evil as “something that causes suffering” was shown to be erroneous a very long time ago. I have a more meaningful definition of evil, to which you may not agree, but if you cannot provide one, I will. You can also define “bad events”. And no, it's not obvious; this is philosophy, we question things, we don't just accept them because they might be a popular idea or because a lot of people do (both classical logical fallacies). The dictionary is great, but it often fails when we try to describe things properly; want an example? See "existence". Try to give me a definition for that, if you want; indeed, we are discussing the existence of something.Ok, you don't accept that – that's fine. Now justify your definition of evil as something that causes people to “suffer”. Oh, ok. So you don't think that the world is “evil”? Just a few questions for now; more later.

Heh, you've got an interesting definition of "all"; your "all" here seems to include that which does not exist. You probably don't see the absurdity in the presupposition, but I'll give you an analogy to show the problem:A scenario. We had a test in Math yesterday, and today, we got our test results. A friend of mine asks me, "how many marks did you get right on the test?" I reply, "I got all the marks right" (as if ;)). Now, surely, from this we would think that I got 100% on my test, but by your reasoning, I should have got something like oo%, since, "all" here should also--apparently--include that which is impossible. Of course, that never happens. We are not concerned with the impossible -- the impossible can never occur. Period. Maybe it's best to think of it in terms of Modal Logic, too. When using possible world semantics and we define ontological perfection as that which exists in all the possible worlds, we are not concerned, obviously, with the impossible worlds. Because, quite frankly, because they do not exist. Nevertheless, I'm interested by your presupposition that it is impossible for inaminate objects to be conscious. (i) What do you base this on? (ii) and how do you explain the miracle before your eyes, therefore.I think you've misunderstood the use of possible world semantics. For one, they patently don't only refer to the physical, but to everything, and neither do they make appeals to materialism and/or other types of monism/dualism. As they stand, they at least appear compatible with other metaphysical concepts as such. On another note, possible world semantics makes no such claim to presuppose anything along the lines of that these worlds exist. They are but a tool for understanding different parts of the modal family, in particular -- the popular S5. You seem to be appealing to materialism, however, which would of course pretty much eliminate the concept of a Supreme Being as is described, but lucky for us, materialism as I see it has major flaws. I'll outline them if you wish; just say. No worry there; just check out a little bit of Philosophy of Science; as I suggested, Popper is good, but maybe a little cryptic. Introductory books are normally good, however. Unfortunately not, and that is one of the problems with a definition as such for "evil". They're always either circular or just plain erroneous. Examples are fine and dandy, but definitions are required. Since you are positing that evil exists as one of your central premises, I want to know what you mean by it before I can agree that it exists; surely, that's reasonable, is it not? For thinking about evil, I like to consider some aspects of science and other things as such. For example, light and darkness. If you think about darkness, you'll find that it, itself, has no substance, but that it is only light that has substance. We see a lot of opposites in nature -- electrons and positrons, matter and anti-matter. But, there are those particles that do not have an opposite; for example, a photon is electrically neutral, just like the other force carriers: Z bosons and gluons. When something is light, we know that photons are coming from or being reflected of somethingn and then reaching our eye. Light is photons. However, for darkness, there is no other particle -- no particle that provides darkness. Darkness itself is merely the absence of light.Another parallel might be seen with coldness and heat. Heat comes about from energy, more specifically -- thermal energy. What we call "cold" is but an absence of heat (never a complete absence, since that would propose absolute zero on a Kelvin scale, which, theoretically, we never could really measure -- temperatures for us never get near that low). When we say that a person is "cold" we mean that they are lacking in emotion.And from these, I think it is the same with goodness. Goodness is that which exists and evil is merely the privation of it. It works this way and not the other way around because goodness is the aesthetic, in that case, it is that which morally edifies. Evil is merely the essence of moral emptiness. I think I've said a lot, and I wouldn't want to drag on and say a whole lot more; good luck with your computer and I hope it works out. Hey, when you get back, maybe we can get to the problem of good. ;)

Silent Poet:I too am having difficulty with computer things so I apologize for a late reply.Suffice it to say I am sufficiently out of the loop so I will only respond to one thing you said. You said in an earlier post that you agreed that the presence of evil does not disprove the existence of God just the existence of an ALL GOOD God. I beg to differ. The presence of Evil is necessary to show love. If there were no evil then there would be no need to depend on God and we could suffice just fine without him. This means that he does not get to show His love which is his primary nature. Even if you disagree with the above, which I think you do, it still does not PROVE the non existence of an all Good God. Just because you and I cannot reconcile with the presence of Evil that does not mean that God is not Good. If you say that because evil exists then God cannot be good then you are setting yourself up as the definer of what is good. However, if you accept the existence, or potential existence of a God, any god, then He must be the definer of what is good. By discussing the attributes of God then you necessarily stipulate to His existence. The question is "what is he like?" If he is creator, and no christian would say he is loving or good without also saying he is creator, then you must also accept as creator that HE is the one who defines what is good. Allowing for the possiblity of the existence of evil He has defined as good. Why, because HE, the creator says so. Therefore, it does not disprove the existence of a good god. I also say that it does not prove the existence of a good god. Again, it is a matter of what you believe. No one can prove or disprove. Even our discussion here has had to include some assumptions and therefore beliefs.Have a good week. I may be back in a week or two. Right now this is the most I can post.

Silent Poet:I too am having difficulty with computer things so I apologize for a late reply.Suffice it to say I am sufficiently out of the loop so I will only respond to one thing you said. You said in an earlier post that you agreed that the presence of evil does not disprove the existence of God just the existence of an ALL GOOD God. I beg to differ. The presence of Evil is necessary to show love. If there were no evil then there would be no need to depend on God and we could suffice just fine without him. This means that he does not get to show His love which is his primary nature. Even if you disagree with the above, which I think you do, it still does not PROVE the non existence of an all Good God. Just because you and I cannot reconcile with the presence of Evil that does not mean that God is not Good. If you say that because evil exists then God cannot be good then you are setting yourself up as the definer of what is good. However, if you accept the existence, or potential existence of a God, any god, then He must be the definer of what is good. By discussing the attributes of God then you necessarily stipulate to His existence. The question is "what is he like?"

but like you pointed out, its all relative and comparitive. the existence of severe pain and extreme evil is necessary to define extreme goodness and joy. one cannot exist without the other, and the limit of one correlates to the limit of the other. if you can experience pleasure and happiness, then expect that evil and pain must exist to the same extentif you understand the point above youd realise that without evil, there would be no such thing as good, and therefore a "good" God wouldnt exist. secondly, God only allowed evil to exist, but he is not a source of evil. yes, evil exists because of God, but being evil is a choice people make. to eliminate evil, people have to stop being evil. thats what freewill does. without freewill, everybody would be in a state of emotional numbness, because there would be no evil, therefore no good, and there would be no choices, therefore no experiences of acheivement, satifaction, anticipation or anything like that. you cannot remove the option of evil from the nature of freewillwould you rather have no freewill and no emotion, just so that there would be no pain in the world? how would you be able to experience the joy of a pain-free world without emotion, and how would you experience emotion without freewill?

A being is something that is conceivable as existing...or something that actually exists.A human being is one of us, a homo-sapien, a member of the group of beings known as animals.A rock is a being of inanimate qualities.God is the supreme being, not capable of being understood totally as this would put Him (or It, or She) on the same level as those that He created.We will never be able to define exactly what or who God is!God is great.God is good.Let us thank Him for our food.God is my shepherd.God is my Light.God is my Co-pilot.God is what keeps me from believing that all this (the totality of all things and happenings) came about by accident.When God made man, She was only kidding! ;)

phuntin,So now you have said that god is undefinable or often said "supernatural".So the discussion follows...T:I believe in GodA:What is God?T:I dont know.Montalban,You've avoided the question. God does not fill the word "who" because to most accounts he is not a person, or being. But for your sake I will restate the question.Who is God?Describe God to me. What is that you believe in?Yes I am an atheist.But I wish to debate the existance or possibility of an existance of God.No such debate can exist without a precise idea of what God is.Consider the following conversation.A: "I believe in a unie"B: "What is your evidence?"A: "It has rained for three consecutive days, that is my evidence"Both are at fault here for not laying out exaclty what a unie out. A has failed to defy unie and B has failed to ask what it is that A believes in.By definition is undefinable?So then God you cannot claim that god is: loving, good, omnipotent, ominiscent, etc....Or do you claim such.Again I ask you describe what it is that you believe in?Is your answer than you believe in the undefinable of which you do not know any further?I'm not going to go into what is wrong with the idea of God without knowing it is what we mean we speak the word.Excuse me if I am mistaken, but it seems that you are getting defensive on your belief before I even begin a debate. I'm simply looking for any one wishing to participate on the nature / existance of God.If you find my questions to be complete nonsense and that I'm only here to critize theism than you need not participate.thebootfitter,True but this progesses nothing twoards a conversation because you have no told me the nature of such an existance.You have said if A is then A=A.... thats saying a lot without saying anything at all because you have failed to provide what A is.

I agree with 98% of the rest of your post, but I have to disagree with this. Evil could, at any time, be totally eliminated by God. But, God will not do that...not now, since mankind has to run its course. Mankind has to deal with this life first, choose for himself which direction it will take: Good or evil. Then God will do away with evil and there will be no need for it. Good can exist without it.

in order to remove all the evil from this world, God would have to remove all emotion and conscience from our minds as well as deaden all nerve endings or rewire them so that we have no sense of discomfort. people would still bleed, die, become mutilated or whatever, but we wouldnt be able to identify suffering or pain, even in ourselves.another way is to make everyone immortal and impervious to adversity, so that even if something "bad" happens, it would be inconsequential because it would have no ill effect on us.im sure there are other scenarios, but i cant think of any right nowyes, God could make these changes to humanity. but inevitably humans would also lose the ability to feel joy or pleasure. in other words, you would not be happier, even though you believe it would be a better situation. its a trade offbe careful what you wish for....

The fact that there is a food chain in which animals and plants devour each other is not evil.

We would not be human any more. I agree. In order to be human we be must in direct contact with evil, just as we are in direct contact with good. So as long as we are human, evil must exist.Eden was a place of bliss, a natural wonder...that also contained evil. It had in it the Tree of Life and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, among thousands of other fruit-bearing trees. God told man not to eat of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, but of all the rest they could freely eat - even of the Tree of Life. But, what did man do? You know the rest...It was because evil took us away from good, away from everlasting life (the Tree of Life) that we must now live with evil to take back what it has stolen. Until that happens we are under its influence daily.

evil is subjective. where do you draw the line? if a squirrel gets run over in traffic, is that evil? what if its a small chilld? what if its a family? what if a family starves/burns/drowns to death? what if a plague wipes out a village? what if an earthquake demolishes a city? see where im going?the pain caused by the destruction of natural disasters is the #1 reason atheists discredit that God can be at all a "loving God". the evil of man they have no problems accepting, but when a tsunami kills out the inhabitants of a coastal town, thats when you hear "how can God be loving if he allows these things to happen!"but, for discussion sake, lets just remove the "human evil" from the world. this would mean that all feeling of grudge, guilt, any kind of bad feeling whatsoever. no "bad moods". pretty much, no emotions whatsoever. (if you ever get you hands on a movie called "equillibrium", it portrays a world where humans are void of emotions and therefore no crime. you will not be disappointed if you get this movie). without emotion, we end up in the same predicament, no feelings of joy or pleasure either.

i would even dare say that adam and eve had no concept of what good was before they ate the fruit. they were living in an environment of no pain, but at the same time no joy or pleasure, just harmony and peace. there would be no way for them to even recognize how fortunate they were or how good they had it because there was nothing to compare God's goodness to. the very fruit that they ate was called the knowledge of good and evil. both would have to be introduced similtaneously, and there cannot be one without the other

Yes, in our limited view (from the cradle to the grave) that is logical. After they partook they were naked, physically of course from the beginning, which is a given, but more especially spiritually. God had to slay an animal (shed blood) to cover them, to protect them from evil.But, where the Lord is, there is joy. They experienced the greatest of joy before they fell.

that may be true, but adam and eve could not identify that emotion as joy because they didnt know what sorrow was so they had no relative comparison. so what good would joy be unless you know of the sorrow that you are not experiencing? if everything were one temperature, say 100 degrees, how would we know what hot is and what cold is?

What is it that you believe God is?What is the nature of which you believe? (They all amount to the same point of the perceptional idea of God, which I am asking of all theists)I don't understand why my question still lacks an answer. Perhaps you all were under the impression that my question dealt with actual reality, but I doubt that. I thought I would be swarmed with answers.Theists....Where are you?

The odd thing about this is Muhammedans say that they 'respect' the Holy Books of the Jews and the Christians (viz The Bible) but the Bible itself quite clearly says God is triune in nature.

What Do Muslims Think About Jesus? "Muslims respect and revere Jesus. They consider him one of the greatest of God's prophets and messengers to humankind. A Muslim never refers to him simply as "Jesus", but always adds the phrase "upon him be peace." The Qur'an confirms his virgin birth, and a special surah of the Qur'an is entitled "Mary." The Qur'an describes the Annunciation as follows: "'Behold (O Mary!)' The Angel said, 'God has chosen you, and purified you, and chosen you above the women of all nations. O Mary, God gives you good news of a word from Him, whose name shall be the Anointed (Masih or Messiah), Jesus son of Mary, honored in this world and in the hereafter, and one of those brought near to God. He shall speak to the people from his cradle and in maturity, and shall be of the righteous.' "She said: 'O my Lord! How shall I have a son when no man has touched me?' He said: 'Even so; God creates what He wills. When He decrees a thing, He says to it, "Be!" and it is.'" (Qur'an 3:42-7) Jesus was born miraculously through the same power that had brought Adam into being without a father: "Truly the likeness of Jesus with God is as the likeness of Adam. He created him of dust and then said to him, 'Be!' and he was." (Qur'an 3:59) During his prophetic mission, Jesus performed many miracles. The Qur'an tells us that he said:"I have come to you with a sign from your Lord: I make for you out of clay, as it were, a figure of a bird, and breathe into it and it becomes a bird by God's leave. And I heal the blind, and the lepers, and I raise the dead by God's leave." (Qur'an 3:49) Neither Muhammad nor Jesus came to change the basic doctrine of the belief in One God, brought by earlier prophets, but to confirm and renew it. In the Qur'an, Jesus is reported as saying that he came: "To attest the law which was before me. And to make lawful to you part of what was forbidden to you; I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, so fear God and obey me." (Qur'an 3:50) The Prophet Muhammad said:"Whoever believes that there is none worthy of worship but God, alone without partner, that Muhammad is His messenger, that Jesus is the servant and messenger of God, His word which He bestowed on Mary and a spirit proceeding from Him, and that Paradise and Hell are true, shall be received by God into Heaven."

Who Invented Trinity?"The three monotheistic religions - Judaism, Christianity, and Islam - all purport to share one fundamental concept: belief in God as the Supreme Being, the Creator and Sustainer of the Universe. Known as "tawhid" in Islam, this concept of the Oneness of God was stressed by Moses in a Biblical passage known as the "Shema," or the Jewish creed of faith: "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord." (Deuteronomy 6:4) It was repeated word-for-word approximately 1500 years later by Jesus when he said: "...The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; the Lord our God is one Lord." (Mark 12:29)Muhammad came along approximately 600 years later, bringing the same message again: "And your God is One God: There is no God but He, ..." (The Qur'an 2:163)Christianity has digressed from the concept of the Oneness of God, however, into a vague and mysterious doctrine that was formulated during the fourth century. This doctrine, which continues to be a source of controversy both within and without the Christian religion, is known as the Doctrine of the Trinity. Simply put, the Christian doctrine of the Trinity states that God is the union of three divine persons - the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit - in one divine being. If that concept, put in basic terms, sounds confusing, the flowery language in the actual text of the doctrine lends even more mystery to the matter: "...we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity... for there is one Person of the Father, another of the Son, another of the Holy Ghost is all one... they are not three gods, but one God... the whole three persons are co-eternal and co-equal... he therefore that will be save must thus think of the Trinity..." (excerpts from the Athanasian Creed) Let's put this together in a different form: one person, God the Father + one person, God the Son + one person, God the Holy Ghost = one person, God the What? Is this English or is this gibberish? It is said that Athanasius, the bishop who formulated this doctrine, confessed that the more he wrote on the matter, the less capable he was of clearly expressing his thoughts regarding it. How did such a confusing doctrine get its start? TRINITY IN THE BIBLEReferences in the Bible to a Trinity of divine beings are vague, at best. In Matthew 28:19, we find Jesus telling his disciples to go out and preach to all nations. While the "Great Commission" does make mention of the three persons who later become components of the Trinity, the phrase "...baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost" is quite clearly an addition to Biblical text - that is, not the actual words of Jesus - as can be seen by two factors: 1) Baptism in the early Church, as discussed by Paul in his letters, was done only in the name of Jesus; and 2) The "Great Commission" was found in the first gospel written, that of Mark, bears no mention of Father, Son and/or Holy Ghost - see Mark 16:15.The only other reference in the Bible to a Trinity can be found in the Epistle of John 5:7, Biblical scholars of today, however, have admitted that the phrase "...there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one" is definitely a "later addition" to Biblical text, and it is not found in any of today's versions of the Bible. It can, therefore, be seen that the concept of a Trinity of divine beings was not an idea put forth by Jesus or any other prophet of God. This doctrine, now subscribed to by Christians all over the world, is entirely man-made in origin. THE DOCTRINE TAKES SHAPEWhile Paul of Tarsus, the man who could rightfully be considered the true founder of Christianity, did formulate many of its doctrines, that of the Trinity was not among them. He did, however, lay the groundwork for such when he put forth the idea of Jesus being a "divine Son." After all, a Son does need a Father, and what about a vehicle for God's revelations to man? In essence, Paul named the principal players, but it was the later Church people who put the matter together. Tertullian, a lawyer and presbyter of the third century Church in Carthage, was the first to use the word "Trinity" when he put forth the theory that the Son and the Spirit participate in the being of God, but all are of one being of substance with the Father. A FORMAL DOCTRINE IS DRAWN UPWhen controversy over the matter of the Trinity blew up in 318 between two church men from Alexandria - Arius, the deacon, and Alexander, his bishop - Emperor Constantine stepped into the fray. Although Christian dogma was a complete mystery to him, he did realize that a unified church was necessary for a strong kingdom. When negotiation failed to settle the dispute, Constantine called for the first ecumenical council in Church history in order to settle the matter once and for all. Six weeks after the 300 bishops first gathered at Nicea in 325, the doctrine of the Trinity was hammered out. The God of the Christians was now seen as having three essences, or natures, in the form of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. THE CHURCH PUTS ITS FOOT DOWNThe matter was far from settled, however, despite high hopes for such on the part of Constantine. Arius and the new bishop of Alexandria, a man named Athanasius, began arguing over the matter even as the Nicene Creed was being signed; "Arianism" became a catch-word from that time onward for anyone who did not hold to the doctrine of the Trinity. It wasn't until 451, at the Council of Chalcedon that, with the approval of the Pope, the Nicene/Constantinople Creed was set as authoritative. Debate on the matter was no longer tolerated; to speak out against the Trinity was now considered blasphemy, and such earned stiff sentences that ranged from mutilation to death. Christians now turned on Christians, maiming and slaughtering thousands because of a difference of opinion. DEBATE CONTINUESBrutal punishments and even death did not stop the controversy over the doctrine of the Trinity, however, and the said controversy continues even today. The majority of Christians, when asked to explain this fundamental doctrine of their faith, can offer nothing more than "I believe it because I was told to do so." It is explained away as "mystery" - yet the Bible says in I Corinthians 14:33 that "... God is not the author of confusion..." The Unitarian denomination of Christianity has kept alive the teachings of Arius in saying that God is one; they do not believe in the Trinity. As a result, mainstream Christians abhor them, and the National Council of Churches has refused their admittance. In Unitarianism, the hope is kept alive that Christians will someday return to the preachings of Jesus: "...Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve." (Luke 4:8) ISLAM AND THE MATTER OF THE TRINITYWhile Christianity may have a problem defining the essence of God, such is not the case in Islam. "They do blaspheme who say: Allah is one of three in a Trinity, for there is no god except One God." (Qur'an 5:73) It is worth noting that the Arabic language Bible uses the name "Allah" as the name of God. Suzanne Haneef, in her book WHAT EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT ISLAM AND MUSLIMS (Library of Islam, 1985), puts the matter quite succinctly when she says, "But God is not like a pie or an apple which can be divided into three thirds which form one whole; if God is three persons or possesses three parts, He is assuredly not the Single, Unique, Indivisible Being which God is and which Christianity professes to believe in." (pp. 183-184) Looking at it from another angle, the Trinity designates God as being three separate entities - the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. If God is the Father and also the Son, He would then be the Father of Himself because He is His own Son. This is not exactly logical. Christianity claims to be a monotheistic religion. Monotheism, however, has as its fundamental belief that God is One; the Christian doctrine of the Trinity - God being Three-in-One - is seen by Islam as a form of polytheism. Christians don't revere just One God, they revere three. This is a charge not taken lightly by Christians, however. They, in turn, accuse the Muslims of not even knowing what the Trinity is, pointing out that the Qur'an sets it up as Allah the Father, Jesus the Son, and Mary his mother. While veneration of Mary has been a figment of the Catholic Church since 431 when she was given the title "Mother of God" by the Council of Ephesus, a closer examination of the verse in the Qur'an most often cited by Christians in support of their accusation, shows that the designation of Mary by the Qur'an as a "member" of the Trinity, is simply not true. While the Qur'an does condemn both trinitarianism (the Qur'an 4:17) and the worship of Jesus and his mother Mary (the Qur'an 5:116), nowhere does it identify the actual three components of the Christian Trinity. The position of the Qur'an is that WHO or WHAT comprises this doctrine is not important; what is important is that the very notion of a Trinity is an affront against the concept of One God. In conclusion, we see that the doctrine of the Trinity is a concept conceived entirely by man; there is no sanction whatsoever from God to be found regarding the matter simply because the whole idea of a Trinity of divine beings has no place in monotheism. In the Qur'an, God's Final Revelations to mankind, we find His stand quite clearly stated in a number of eloquent passages: "...your God is One God: whoever expects to meet his Lord, let him work righteousness, and, in the worship of his Lord, admit no one as partner." (Qur'an 18:110) "...take not, with God, another object of worship, lest you should be thrown into Hell, blameworthy and rejected." (Qur'an 17:39) ...Because, as God tells us over and over again in a Message that is echoed throughout All His Revealed Scriptures: "...I am your Lord and Cherisher: therefore, serve Me (and no other)..."

What Do Muslims Think About Jesus? "Muslims respect and revere Jesus. They consider him one of the greatest of God's prophets and messengers to humankind. A Muslim never refers to him simply as "Jesus", but always adds the phrase "upon him be peace." The Qur'an confirms his virgin birth, and a special surah of the Qur'an is entitled "Mary." The Qur'an describes the Annunciation as follows: "'Behold (O Mary!)' The Angel said, 'God has chosen you, and purified you, and chosen you above the women of all nations. O Mary, God gives you good news of a word from Him, whose name shall be the Anointed (Masih or Messiah), Jesus son of Mary, honored in this world and in the hereafter, and one of those brought near to God. He shall speak to the people from his cradle and in maturity, and shall be of the righteous.' "She said: 'O my Lord! How shall I have a son when no man has touched me?' He said: 'Even so; God creates what He wills. When He decrees a thing, He says to it, "Be!" and it is.'" (Qur'an 3:42-7) Jesus was born miraculously through the same power that had brought Adam into being without a father: "Truly the likeness of Jesus with God is as the likeness of Adam. He created him of dust and then said to him, 'Be!' and he was." (Qur'an 3:59) During his prophetic mission, Jesus performed many miracles. The Qur'an tells us that he said:"I have come to you with a sign from your Lord: I make for you out of clay, as it were, a figure of a bird, and breathe into it and it becomes a bird by God's leave. And I heal the blind, and the lepers, and I raise the dead by God's leave." (Qur'an 3:49) Neither Muhammad nor Jesus came to change the basic doctrine of the belief in One God, brought by earlier prophets, but to confirm and renew it. In the Qur'an, Jesus is reported as saying that he came: "To attest the law which was before me. And to make lawful to you part of what was forbidden to you; I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, so fear God and obey me." (Qur'an 3:50) The Prophet Muhammad said:"Whoever believes that there is none worthy of worship but God, alone without partner, that Muhammad is His messenger, that Jesus is the servant and messenger of God, His word which He bestowed on Mary and a spirit proceeding from Him, and that Paradise and Hell are true, shall be received by God into Heaven." (A Hadith from the collections of al Bukhari)"http://discover.islamway.com/articles.php?article_id=15

In the New Testament, we find the clear teaching of one God (I Tim. 2:5), and at the same time we are told that the Father is God (Romans 1:7), the Son is God (John 20:28), and the Holy Spirit is God (Acts 5:3-4).You must remember too that 1 x 1 x 1 = 1. He is still one God.Truthkeeper, you have ignored (again) volumes of evidence (it gives your username an ironic quality).Genesis 126 Then God said, "Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground."The very first chapter of the first book of the Bible has God reveal His nature.Isaiah 68 Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, "Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?"These are further evidences FROM THE OLD TESTAMENT..."1. The use of plural forms.Pronouns, where God speaking, uses "us" and "our": Genesis 3:22 Genesis 11:7 Isaiah 6:8. The most important reference is Genesis 1:26-27; it is here where the plurality is used in connection with the very nature of God. This last reference is the most important (and compelling) one because here God uses plural forms in the context of his own "image and likeness."The plural form for "Lord" used frequently in the Old Testament:'adonai ("Lord," literally, "my Masters"). The vowel in the last syllable of 'adonai was apparently lengthened by rabbis in the post-New Testament period. This is thought to have been done to sharpen the distinction between earthly lords and the Lord God. The Old Testament had a singular term for God, Eloah, which they occasionally used, but the vast majority of the time the plural form of God, Elohim, is used throughout the Old Testament. Had there been only be two persons within God, the Hebrews could have used a dual form Elohiayim, which was typically (although not always) used of things that occured in pairs.2. Usage of "one" in a composite sense.Even though the Old Testament teaches that God is "one," (Deuteronomy 6:4) this does not conflict in any way with Trinitarian beliefs. On the contrary, it actually helps to affirm them. One of the most compelling examples in the Old Testament of the composite sense of "one" is found in Genesis 2:24. Two people (created in the "image" of God) become "one flesh" in the marriage union (and thus a sense of the "image" in a composite sense). The use of the Hebrew word for "one" (eXad) in other passages similarly demonstrates that this word means "one entity" rather than a strictly single, solitary thing. 3. Theophanies, where Christ appears in the form of the "Angel (or Messenger) of the Lord."The Old Testament presents striking examples of a Being who, although He appears in the form of a man, acts and speaks like God and is referred to as God. Mysteriously, He is both identified as God and distinguished from God. We find this in passages such as Genesis 16:7-13; 18-19; 22:11-18; Exodus 3:2-6; 23:20-23; Judges 6:11-14, 20-22; 13:21-23). Note also how Zechariah 12:8 equates God and the Angel of the Lord. These Theophanies were prepartory for the incarnation in that they anticipated the coming of a Heavenly Visitor who would one day be both truly God and man. 4. The "Son" passages:The Old Testament describes a Being who is uniquely a human-divine Son. In the light of the New Testament we see that Jesus in His Being is the fulfillment of the Son of Man, the Son of God, and the Son-King (of which Solomon was a foreshadowing).Proverbs 30:4Isaiah 9:6 He is a son and child, but also the "mighty God." Psalm 2:7-12 (although the translation of "son" in verse 12 can be disputed) This Psalm describes a Son-King who receives the nations as His inheritance. Daniel 7:13-14 This passage forms the background behind Christ's use of the Messianic title "Son of Man." Note that the contexts of Psalm 2 and Daniel 7 have identical strands of thought: the inheriting of all the kingdoms of the earth. The word "Son of Man" does not here mean "a mortal man"--one from among the "sons of men." The point here is not that the Person is perfectly human. The significance of the title "Son of Man' in this passage is fourfold:His exalted personality as the One who comes from heaven and opposes the beastly human powers, which come from earth (Daniel 7:3)His advent in conjunction with the reappearance of the theophanic glory cloud (7:13),His free access to the 'One who is an ancient of days' (God the Father, 7:13), andHis universal and everlasting reign (7:14). (J. B. Payne, Theology of the Older Testament, p. 265.)5. The use of pronouns suggesting more than one Person within God.The LORD talking, uses both "Me" and "Him" referring to the same Being (Christ) in Zechariah 12:10 The Angel of the Lord speaking, uses both "from Me" and "fearer of God" in referring to the same entity (Genesis 22:12). 6. Passages that identify two Beings as God or LORD (YHWH). Genesis 19:23 (YHWH in heaven versus YHWH on earth) Psalm 45:6-7 (God referring to Another as "God") Zechariah 3:1-2 (YHWH calling upon YHWH: "And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan"7. The Holy Spirit is linked with God and given attributes of personality.All three Persons of the Trinity can be seen in Isaiah 63:8-10, but most importantly we see here the personality of the Holy Spirit. He is "vexed, grieved" by disobedience. This verb in Hebrew is always used in conjuntion with persons (or God and gods); never of inanimate thingshttp://www.biblicalresources.info/pa...trinityot.htmlThe ancient Semitic name for God may also contain some hint of plurality in the Godhead. Elohim is the plural of el ?God.? Again, is this merely a grammatical peculiarity or a cryptic reference to the Trinity to be fully revealed in the New Testament? Isaiah 6:3, with the seraphim calling ?Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts,? has also been taken as an indication of the triuneness of God. And it is interesting that the seraphim have three sets of wings with which to veil themselves.http://www.catholic.net/rcc/Periodic...2/trinity.htmlProofs for a Trinity abound in the earliest Christian writings...(note, I am an Orthodox Christian so I will also be giving extra-Biblical quotes as well).Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever. Your argument is that everywhere we've got the Greek mixed up - we who compiled the Bible in Greek!

They are of one accordJohn 521For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it.

We know this because the name Yahweh is applied to both the Father and the Son in the New Testament. Jesus is eternal like GodHebrews 13: 8Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.St. Ignatius of Antioch was a disciple of St. Peter and he wrote...Epistle to the Magnesians"CHAPTER 77:1 Therefore as the Lord did nothing without the Father, [being united with Him],"http://www.earlychristianwritings.c...-lightfoot.htmlThe unity of them is continually repeated...He opens his Epistle to the Philadelphians"Ignatius, who is also Theophorus, to the church of God the Father and of Jesus Christ, which is in Philadelphia of Asia..."http://www.earlychristianwritings.c...-lightfoot.htmlEpistle to the MagnesiansAgain in his opening address to his Epistle the Romans"Ignatius, who is also Theophorus, unto her that hath found mercy in the bountifulness of the Father Most High and of Jesus Christ His only Son; to the church that is beloved and enlightened through the will of Him who willed all things that are, by faithand love towards Jesus Christ our God; even unto her that hath the presidency in the country of the region of the Romans, being worthy of God, worthy of honour, worthy of felicitation, worthy of praise, worthy of success, worthy in purity, and having the presidency of love, walking in the law of Christ and bearing the Father's name; which church also I salute in the nameof Jesus Christ the Son of the Father; unto them that in flesh and spirit are united unto His every commandment, being filled with the grace of God without wavering, and filtered clear from every foreign stain; abundant greeting in Jesus Christ our God in blamelessness."http://www.earlychristianwritings.c...-lightfoot.htmlNote Jesus is His only Son. He is given a special status from that of any other person - no prophet here is mentioned.God and Jesus, Jesus and God.

One Church, three offices of clergy.This reflects the passages in Scripture that say that Jesus was with the fullness of God, that is, they are united, and they are equal.1 Cor 124"...Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God."Which is why Jesus Himself commandedMatthew 2819Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, Thus the Didache* (written after 50 AD but before 120AD; and again, well before some of the books of the Bible were written) states...7:1 But concerning baptism, thus shall ye baptise.7:2 Having first recited all these things, baptise in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit in living (running) water.http://www.earlychristianwritings.c...-lightfoot.htmlThus the Trinity was know well before the Bible was even put together.Peter tells us, "David did not ascend into the heavens; but he himself says, ?The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, till I make your enemies a stool for your feet.? Let all the house of Israel therefore know assuredly that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified" (Acts 2:34?36). Here God is "the Lord" who speaks to "my Lord," Jesus. When one looks at the Old Testament quotation, one finds, "Yahweh says to my Lord: ?Sit at my right hand, till I make your enemies your footstool?" (Ps. 110:1); so here the Father is called Yahweh. In Philippians 2:10?11, we read: "[A]t the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord." This is a reference to Isaiah 45:18?24, which tells us: "I, Yahweh, speak the truth . . . I am God, and there is no other. By myself I have sworn. . . . To me every knee shall bow, every tongue confess. ?Only in Yahweh,? it shall be said of me, ?are righteousness and strength.? " Here Paul applies the prophecy of every knee bending and every tongue confessing to Jesus, resulting in the prophecy that they will "confess that Jesus Christ is Yahweh." The stress on Christ as God is also picked up by the early Church Fathers (e.g., Ignatius, below). Jesus himself declares that he is Yahweh ("I AM," in English translation). In John 8:58, when questioned about how he has special knowledge of Abraham, Jesus replies, "Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM." His audience understood exactly who he was claiming to be. "So they took up stones to throw at him; but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple" (John 8:59). With the personal name of God, Yahweh, being applied to both the Father and the Son, it is almost certainly applied to the Spirit, and thus to all three members of the Trinity. The parallelism of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is not unique to Matthew?s Gospel, but appears elsewhere in the New Testament (e.g., 2 Cor. 13:14, Heb. 9:14), as well as in the writings of the earliest Christians, who clearly understood them in the sense that we do today?that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three divine persons who are one divine being (God).http://www.catholic.com/library/Trinity.aspLastly, if you have the time, there's an interesting article athttp://www.visi.com/~contra_m/ab/sch.../trinoldt.html

Who Invented Trinity?"The three monotheistic religions - Judaism, Christianity, and Islam - all purport to share one fundamental concept: belief in God as the Supreme Being, the Creator and Sustainer of the Universe. Known as "tawhid" in Islam, this concept of the Oneness of God was stressed by Moses in a Biblical passage known as the "Shema," or the Jewish creed of faith: "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord." (Deuteronomy 6:4) It was repeated word-for-word approximately 1500 years later by Jesus when he said: "...The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; the Lord our God is one Lord." (Mark 12:29)Muhammad came along approximately 600 years later, bringing the same message again: "And your God is One God: There is no God but He, ..." (The Qur'an 2:163)Christianity has digressed from the concept of the Oneness of God, however, into a vague and mysterious doctrine that was formulated during the fourth century. This doctrine, which continues to be a source of controversy both within and without the Christian religion, is known as the Doctrine of the Trinity. Simply put, the Christian doctrine of the Trinity states that God is the union of three divine persons - the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit - in one divine being. If that concept, put in basic terms, sounds confusing, the flowery language in the actual text of the doctrine lends even more mystery to the matter: "...we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity... for there is one Person of the Father, another of the Son, another of the Holy Ghost is all one... they are not three gods, but one God... the whole three persons are co-eternal and co-equal... he therefore that will be save must thus think of the Trinity..." (excerpts from the Athanasian Creed) Let's put this together in a different form: one person, God the Father + one person, God the Son + one person, God the Holy Ghost = one person, God the What? Is this English or is this gibberish? It is said that Athanasius, the bishop who formulated this doctrine, confessed that the more he wrote on the matter, the less capable he was of clearly expressing his thoughts regarding it. How did such a confusing doctrine get its start? TRINITY IN THE BIBLEReferences in the Bible to a Trinity of divine beings are vague, at best. In Matthew 28:19, we find Jesus telling his disciples to go out and preach to all nations. While the "Great Commission" does make mention of the three persons who later become components of the Trinity, the phrase "...baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost" is quite clearly an addition to Biblical text - that is, not the actual words of Jesus - as can be seen by two factors: 1) Baptism in the early Church, as discussed by Paul in his letters, was done only in the name of Jesus; and 2) The "Great Commission" was found in the first gospel written, that of Mark, bears no mention of Father, Son and/or Holy Ghost - see Mark 16:15.The only other reference in the Bible to a Trinity can be found in the Epistle of John 5:7, Biblical scholars of today, however, have admitted that the phrase "...there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one" is definitely a "later addition" to Biblical text, and it is not found in any of today's versions of the Bible. It can, therefore, be seen that the concept of a Trinity of divine beings was not an idea put forth by Jesus or any other prophet of God. This doctrine, now subscribed to by Christians all over the world, is entirely man-made in origin. THE DOCTRINE TAKES SHAPEWhile Paul of Tarsus, the man who could rightfully be considered the true founder of Christianity, did formulate many of its doctrines, that of the Trinity was not among them. He did, however, lay the groundwork for such when he put forth the idea of Jesus being a "divine Son." After all, a Son does need a Father, and what about a vehicle for God's revelations to man? In essence, Paul named the principal players, but it was the later Church people who put the matter together. Tertullian, a lawyer and presbyter of the third century Church in Carthage, was the first to use the word "Trinity" when he put forth the theory that the Son and the Spirit participate in the being of God, but all are of one being of substance with the Father. A FORMAL DOCTRINE IS DRAWN UPWhen controversy over the matter of the Trinity blew up in 318 between two church men from Alexandria - Arius, the deacon, and Alexander, his bishop - Emperor Constantine stepped into the fray. Although Christian dogma was a complete mystery to him, he did realize that a unified church was necessary for a strong kingdom. When negotiation failed to settle the dispute, Constantine called for the first ecumenical council in Church history in order to settle the matter once and for all. Six weeks after the 300 bishops first gathered at Nicea in 325, the doctrine of the Trinity was hammered out. The God of the Christians was now seen as having three essences, or natures, in the form of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. THE CHURCH PUTS ITS FOOT DOWNThe matter was far from settled, however, despite high hopes for such on the part of Constantine. Arius and the new bishop of Alexandria, a man named Athanasius, began arguing over the matter even as the Nicene Creed was being signed; "Arianism" became a catch-word from that time onward for anyone who did not hold to the doctrine of the Trinity. It wasn't until 451, at the Council of Chalcedon that, with the approval of the Pope, the Nicene/Constantinople Creed was set as authoritative. Debate on the matter was no longer tolerated; to speak out against the Trinity was now considered blasphemy, and such earned stiff sentences that ranged from mutilation to death. Christians now turned on Christians, maiming and slaughtering thousands because of a difference of opinion. DEBATE CONTINUESBrutal punishments and even death did not stop the controversy over the doctrine of the Trinity, however, and the said controversy continues even today. The majority of Christians, when asked to explain this fundamental doctrine of their faith, can offer nothing more than "I believe it because I was told to do so." It is explained away as "mystery" - yet the Bible says in I Corinthians 14:33 that "... God is not the author of confusion..." The Unitarian denomination of Christianity has kept alive the teachings of Arius in saying that God is one; they do not believe in the Trinity. As a result, mainstream Christians abhor them, and the National Council of Churches has refused their admittance. In Unitarianism, the hope is kept alive that Christians will someday return to the preachings of Jesus: "...Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve." (Luke 4:8) ISLAM AND THE MATTER OF THE TRINITYWhile Christianity may have a problem defining the essence of God, such is not the case in Islam. "They do blaspheme who say: Allah is one of three in a Trinity, for there is no god except One God." (Qur'an 5:73) It is worth noting that the Arabic language Bible uses the name "Allah" as the name of God. Suzanne Haneef, in her book WHAT EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT ISLAM AND MUSLIMS (Library of Islam, 1985), puts the matter quite succinctly when she says, "But God is not like a pie or an apple which can be divided into three thirds which form one whole; if God is three persons or possesses three parts, He is assuredly not the Single, Unique, Indivisible Being which God is and which Christianity professes to believe in." (pp. 183-184) Looking at it from another angle, the Trinity designates God as being three separate entities - the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. If God is the Father and also the Son, He would then be the Father of Himself because He is His own Son. This is not exactly logical. Christianity claims to be a monotheistic religion. Monotheism, however, has as its fundamental belief that God is One; the Christian doctrine of the Trinity - God being Three-in-One - is seen by Islam as a form of polytheism. Christians don't revere just One God, they revere three. This is a charge not taken lightly by Christians, however. They, in turn, accuse the Muslims of not even knowing what the Trinity is, pointing out that the Qur'an sets it up as Allah the Father, Jesus the Son, and Mary his mother. While veneration of Mary has been a figment of the Catholic Church since 431 when she was given the title "Mother of God" by the Council of Ephesus, a closer examination of the verse in the Qur'an most often cited by Christians in support of their accusation, shows that the designation of Mary by the Qur'an as a "member" of the Trinity, is simply not true. While the Qur'an does condemn both trinitarianism (the Qur'an 4:17) and the worship of Jesus and his mother Mary (the Qur'an 5:116), nowhere does it identify the actual three components of the Christian Trinity. The position of the Qur'an is that WHO or WHAT comprises this doctrine is not important; what is important is that the very notion of a Trinity is an affront against the concept of One God. In conclusion, we see that the doctrine of the Trinity is a concept conceived entirely by man; there is no sanction whatsoever from God to be found regarding the matter simply because the whole idea of a Trinity of divine beings has no place in monotheism. In the Qur'an, God's Final Revelations to mankind, we find His stand quite clearly stated in a number of eloquent passages: "...your God is One God: whoever expects to meet his Lord, let him work righteousness, and, in the worship of his Lord, admit no one as partner." (Qur'an 18:110) "...take not, with God, another object of worship, lest you should be thrown into Hell, blameworthy and rejected." (Qur'an 17:39) ...Because, as God tells us over and over again in a Message that is echoed throughout All His Revealed Scriptures: "...I am your Lord and Cherisher: therefore, serve Me (and no other)..."
