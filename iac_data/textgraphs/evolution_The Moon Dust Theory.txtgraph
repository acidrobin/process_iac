The Moon Dust Theory

Saw someone use it last week on the Talk.origins newsgroup. Still not sure if they were just a troll or not though...

It pops up from time to time. Mostly it seems to be from YECs who think that Mr. Kent Hovind is a great scientist.

Yes, it's true, there are "talking points" that become fads for creationists pretty regularly. I've been around long enough to see some of it cycling back again.

Hello, Kronus.Sorry. I was referring to the argument "mutations cannot increase the information of the genome." It purports to use some kind of "information theory" to prove that "information cannot increase". Since the evolution of a human starting with a one-celled organism is "obviously an increase in information" evolution must be false.The usual refutation is to show that the person advocating it does not understand what information theory is.I often point out that, at best, information theory is a mathematical model of some process, and that mathematical models cannot trump actual evidence. If the model shows that evolution cannot happen but the evidence unequivocally demonstrates that it does happen, then there is a problem with the model.

Oh, that one. Yeah, I've seen that before. The whole idea is so stupid I had no idea it had been dignified with a label.

One of the more effective ways to deal with it is:"As youi probably know, information theory describes information mathematically. Show me your numbers."Most creationists aren't very up on math, and the results can be amusing.

Dude, I have seen far too mean creationist lies in the past. From the dino-man prints, to many of the false young earth arguments. I suppose this rhetoric is from others, but they are creationists, not scientists. Have you heard of a webiste called talkorigin.org? They highlight numerous creation lies. They litterally pages, and pages, and pages of the stuff. Creationists have STATED there is NO evidence for a old earth. Liars? No doubt about it. That is nothing in comparsion to the numerous hoaxes of creation. The dinosaur carcass they said was proof was in reality a dead whale. The prints of dino and man resemble litterlly abstract art, (not to mention 12 foot man). You do realize that the vast majority of stars do not go supernova, so the expected remnants of supernovas should be far less then what most creationists expect? A star must be astronomically large to go supernova, our star, which is considered a medium sized star, has no chance of naturally going supernova. Many people think that all stars eventually go supernova, highlighting their own sheer ignorance. Do you want me to give you a list of proven creationist lies? I don't think the server has enough space for those. That is a oxymoron. Creation deals with the supernatural. Science deals with the natural. You can't HAVE a organization that uses science to study creation. That's IMPOSSIBLE. Christian science has always been a contridiction.

Ursus maritimus, it always amazes me how creationists can call scientists liars. The whole faked dinosaur carcass along with blantant disregard of science makes it almost amusing. Creation makes the claim then goes looking for evidence, while ignoring all that doesn't support it. Evolution looks that the evidence then makes the theory. Evolution, unlike creation, did not start off with the entire theory first, it looked at the evidence and then incorporated it into a theory.

Hello, Duo_Maxwell.Yes, I am always amazed at the reach of this "conspiracy" of evolutionists that have managed to keep any and all evidence against evolution out of science.All scientists are individuals working on their own grants.Grant money is awarded many different organizations, with their own sources of money and their own committees to choose the awardees.The scientists work at a multitude of universities, companies, and research laboratories, each one independent of one another and making its own hiring and firing decisions.Science gets published in many different journals, each one with its own board of editors, choosing its own reviewers, and each one independent of everyone else.So, you have science as a prime example of an anarchic, decentralized enterprise, with no central control, no single leadership, no one making rules for everyone else.And yet, somehow, there is a conspiracy that succeeds in keeping unwanted view points out.But I love conspiracy theories, don't you? ;)

Ursus maritimus, it always amazes me how creationists can call scientists liars. The whole faked dinosaur carcass along with blantant disregard of science makes it almost amusing. Creation makes the claim then goes looking for evidence, while ignoring all that doesn't support it. Evolution looks that the evidence then makes the theory. Evolution, unlike creation, did not start off with the entire theory first, it looked at the evidence and then incorporated it into a theory.

Why would I care if you "believe" in evolution?Please show us that you are not one of those creationists mentioned and support your assertion about frauds.First, what is an "ape man"? Which "ape men" are intentional frauds? Can you name any "ape men" that are not frauds? If they are not, then isn't that sufficient to show that the claims of creationists are wrong?

Excuse me again, Nu Leader. When Duo_Maxwell questioned as to whether the moon dust argument was still used by creationists you claimed that he was illustrating his ignorance of the topic. Quite the contrary. As was pointed out, Mr. Kent Hovind and others still use the argument. I'm sure that as enlightened as you are by the folks at AIG, you haven't heard the argument, but the rest of us have. Just for your informatiion, here is a transcript of Mr. Hovind's seminar in which he talks about moon dust.Unless you object to my use of Mr. Hovind's material, please take note of the following email that I received from Mr. Hovind.Unfortunately, Mr. Hovind has withdrawn his seminars from his web site, except for the first two of seven total. He states that it is a problem of resources. Fortunately, I had the forsight to down load all of them, only about 6.6 megabytes, a paultry amount on an 80 gig disk.But I digress. The point is that creationists certainly do use the moon dust argument, along with the shrinking sun, the slowing rotation of the earth, and the receding moon. They also use the human tracks in the Paluxy river andthe changing speed of light. In fact, I have bumped into creationists who argued for a flat earth. Even a Ph.D. physicist who argues that the earth is at the center of the universe and everything else is orbiting a fixed an immovable earth (just like the Bible says).If you really want a good laugh, you should listen to Mr. Hovind's seminars. Oh, wait. Except for the first two, you have to order the tapes from him. Well, I have them - all 7. It shouldn't be a big deal to send them to you if you have a fast connection. They are Real Video files and are around 1mb each.And if you haven't busted a gut laughing about that one, you should visit Mr. Carl Baugh's "Creation Evidence Museum" in Glen Rose, Texas and listen to his version of creation. How ironic that the #11 and #12 nuclear power reactors in the country are just north of there. So much scientific knowledge so close to absolute scientific idiocy.Really, Nu Leader. I've been reading creationist literature and visiting creationist web sites and debating creationists for more than 15 years. Creationists still use all of the above arguments.

Without going into the use of the term 'conspiracy'... I'd like to add that all biologists receiving their grants would be subject to review.They'd have learnt the 'truth' of evolution at school, then at university. They'd have peers reviewing their stuff to make sure that it's also in keeping with materialist evolution.I guess that means there's no pressure on them at all :)But most likely they are willing followers

So...the entire secular university system is brainwashing people. And the religious fundamentalists are preaching the truth. Wow, that's quite a debate topic to just drop in here!!FYI, we've told you time and again that science does not proclaim to be truth, it's a process, and it's always open to interperetation, revision, and can be entirely overthrown.

Big difference.If you can show reasons why one should believe in something else other than evolution as the process by which life on earth diversified...you can. But the operative word there is "reason".Science is about curiosity, discovery, and understanding. I realize you have contempt for these things (as indicated by your use of the word consipracy, which implies harmful or lawbreaking), but realize much of the rest of the world appreciates what contributions science has made to our world, as evidinced by the popularity of the subject in schools and universities.

[5] Encourage the action that will lead to the need satisfaction." see M. McWalters (Ed.), (1993), Understanding Psychology, McGraw-Hill; Sydney, p296ff.The need for people such as Dawkins is expressed in his notion that Darwinism allows one to be a well-rounded atheist.The 'brain-washing' aspect is far too extreme a statement to apply to what I said. All educational processes are socialising processes.You believe materialistic evolution to be 'evolution' and that as such it did happen. And as such it should be taught. There is no 'search for truth' but a teaching of the 'truth' when I comes to evolution.Yet as a social process it can't help but instil values in the educational process. Darwin himself was a prime example of this...reflecting the values of Victorian ideas...."Darwin postulated that females are ''coy,'' mating rarely and choosing their mates carefully, presumably betting their odds on the males with the best genes to contribute to their offspring. For their part, males are ''ardent'' and promiscuous, and fight amongst themselves for female partners. Later theories added that males are promiscuous because they have less to lose by making babies - unlike eggs, sperm are plentiful and small. Plus, females usually do most of the work to raise the offspring?http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_relea...u-sag021003.php?In the mid-nineteenth century, social Darwinists invoked evolutionary biology to argue that a woman was a man whose evolution - both physical and mental - had been arrested in a primitive stage. In this same period, doctors used their authority as scientists to discourage women's attempts to gain access to higher education. Women's intellectual development, it was argued, would proceed only at great cost to reproductive development. As the brain developed, so the logic went, the ovaries shrivel. In the twentieth century, scientists have given modern dress to these prejudices. Arguments for women's different (and inferior) nature have been based on hormonal research, brain lateralization, and sociobiology.?Londa Schiebinger, "History and Philosophy", in Sex and Scientific Inquiry, eds.

Scientists carry the same biases as other people. Education itself is a socialising factor in your life. How you are educated helps you in normalising and rationalising things. Marxists would argue that everything you were taught, including science was for conformity within a western male-dominated capitalistic society. It goes to the stabilization of that society, which is why society is, as a rule, generally cohesive.That is why we have different spins on 'science' (if there really is just 'science'). If you live in a Communist state you would be taught about the evolution of man through his struggles to form collective solutions to problems. Capitalists tend to talk about evolution in terms of 'competition.'Thus..."Einstein (1950) said that everyday knowledge provides a huge store of useful metaphors and ideas. From these, the scientist makes a free selection of a set of axioms, and thereupon begins constructing a theory. Einstein thought the origin of his theory might relate to a childlike exploration of space, and consulted with Piaget on the possible similarities between his personal intellectual development and that of children (Miller, 1986). In analyzing the work of other scientists, philosophers (Black, 1962; Kuhn 1970; Toulmin, 1972) and historians (Miller 1986, Nercessian 1988) emphasize that science is a constructive activity.

We want to bring a different set of values into being, to bring about a new set of ruling ideas?ideas of a society without rulers, a part of a different ideology or world-view.

It can't be because every new 'discovery' is immediately assumed to be part of evolution. If a bug is near invisible to predators; that evolution making it had to find. If the opposite is true; that's evolution making it easy to find - to warn predators. All parts of the spectrum are covered because evolution is dogmatically held to be 'true'... even when it can't make predictions, nor the actual process of evolution be shown.That is why evolutionary scientists can put on the table mutually exclusive theories, and yet still sell evolution as 'the answer'. It's like saying we don't know if 'A', 'B', or 'C' is correct, but whichever, evolution did it!When I was doing pre-history at university our text showed four separate pathways for the ascent of modern man.the Unilinear School;the Polyphyletic School'the Preneanderthal School; andthe Presapiens School(Poirier, F E, "In Search of Ourselves: An Introduction to Physical Anthropology", p346ff)Each was based on the 'evidence'. BUT each was mutually exclusive of the others. But all were taught. Evolution had the answer, even if scientists didn't know which was the answer. Now, I believe there are other theories put forward, and these too are mutually exclusive.Just a note for future reference: This does not mean that I am anti-science.

I would like express my lack of desire to read a lot of raw quotes from other sources not related to the topics. I do not feel any "urge" to go through raw quotes. Please read them, and condense them into specific points or arguments if you expect me to reply to them. You can assume I have read a lot of published books from scientists, philosophers, and many other subjects, and can also read anything you might present. If you then want to debate a specific point, please do so.I can summarize by saying:1. Someone suggested that science is beyond human scruples?? Who did this?Actually, last I understood, science is open to all and is actually formed around EXACTLY the understanding that humans are fallable and not always rational. Hence the decentralized process, the published findings, and the complete and total openess to change once sufficient evidence is presented (and usually a generation time-wise to get over the shock). You're either arguing vs a strawman, or you misunderstand something about science. Or thirdly, someone here was actually suggesting that "science is beyond human scruples".2. If you oppose the scientific process not dealing with things outside the physical universe, then you would seem to be anti-science. I would say irrational as well. That is not an insult, it demands to be used in this context.-Mach

A leading evolutionist, R. Dawkins says "Religion is also, of course, the underlying source of the divisiveness in the Middle East which motivated the use of this deadly weapon in the first place (referring to the September 11 attacks). But that is another story and not my concern here. My concern here is with the weapon itself. To fill a world with religion, or religions of the Abrahamic kind, is like littering the streets with loaded guns. Do not be surprised if they are used." http://www.royal-ts.de/mtarchives/000328.phpThis is the most unique debating post I've yet seen. I gave a statement about scientists being creatures of their times; in presenting evidence. And gave an actual example - in the form of Charles Darwin and his scientific beliefs about female behaviour (influenced no doubt on Victorian ideals of femininity)Then I gave a statement regarding current western science (being influenced in this case by capitalism) and then gave references to support that. You lack of 'urge' to read - and hence to present an argument is, as I said, unique. I've never yet come across this type of retort before. Kudos.You do this. You believe that the science speculation (based on no evidence) about aliens is great, but that the science speculation (based on no evidence) for other things such as the Bunyip, Bigfoot, yeti, trolls etc is not great.To use the classic reply...(Post 67 of the "So, how did they get all those animals on the ark" thread.)But then for something you call 'science fiction' you're quite happy scientists spend squillions of dollars. That you accept so readily this activity is further evidence for my statement... that you'd actually defend them doing such that you yourself deem 'science fiction'.Further, you questioned (as you repeat here again), my very questioning of science. As if questioning of science (as you put forward) is itself indicative of an unstable mind. These are the exact same arguments religious people put when they justify inquisitions.Obviously (given the quote at top) Dawkins has combated the 'illogical' gene. I understand and appreciate your desire to help free me from such irrational thought. Don't give up just yet. :)As stated, I showed epistemological evidences here, and on other posts with regard toa) socialising process of (science) educationb) influences upon scientists from withoutc) a priori beliefs (or, influences from within)If you did really believe in the 'checks and balances', then why do you have a problem with me stating scientists are influenced by factors like any other human engaged in other human activities. You either do believe that they are influenced, or they're not. Please pick a position.But, science is not open to all. Studies too have shown gender and cultural bias here as well.See the comparison between science and religion..."Natural science in the way it is practised is one of the great pillars of patriarchal domination. It is only in the fields of military and church that androcentristic behaviour, thinking and acting, i.e. thinking and acting fixed on men and on masculine ideals is as crucial as in natural science and technology."Gender in Bias in Science and Science Educationhttp://www.physik.uni-bremen.de/phys...t/bellater.htm"Standard Tests" show cultural bias. But why (re-)post them if you feel no 'urge' to read them? Fortunately, I suppose, I post for other people as well - the silent mob who read our debates; and hence do post them again here.I am pro-science. I would like to see scientists freed from your restrictions. :)Here we're back to the 'you must be anti-science'. I am not.I am not in favour of your defining science by your philosophy of science. You and others here are yet to show your definition of science is science as opposed to philosophy of science. In order to demonstrate your view is science, by your own definition of science, you'd have to define it, using scientific method. So far several posters have responded to such a challenge with rhetorical ploys, gnashing of teeth regarding the impossibility of such a challenge, and philosophy - which is odd that there's a need to defend a definition of science by another discipline. (By the way, I have stated that historically there have been many views on the nature of science - including your materialistic one. Over the centuries others have had different views on what is science. This is in fact empirical - that there have been many views - thus my statement that your idea of science is a philosophy of science, is itself based on empirical evidence - given thata) it's historically one of manyandb) your lack of proof for your claim :)Further, I like digital watches, TV, etc. Science provides lots of nice, nifty things. However, because of this, I am not 'bought' and recognise that there are factors affecting scientists. You don't. You believe some massive system of checks and balances exists. Either you are correct - and you've shown only your opinion on this, or I am correct, and I've shown citations that agree with me, or rather, that I agree with. And I must point out that in debating your 'side' on this matter for some time, I get this all the time. I post acres of evidences. The retort is "'no, it just can't be!" Thus again ironically, I present facts from studies, and it's retorted by opinion, or in your case above 'no opinion', which is still making me smile.Oddly enough, you can't claim to be unaware of this avalanche of evidence, because you've seen the "Where does science say we come from?" thread, which I posted such gems as..."The scientific establishment bears a grisly resemblance to the Spanish Inquisition. Either you accept the rules and attitudes and beliefs promulgated by the 'papacy' (for which read, perhaps, the Royal Society or the Royal College of Physicians), or face a dreadful retribution. We will not actually burn you at the stake, because that sanction, unhappily, is now no longer available under our milksop laws. But we will make damned sure that you are a dead duck in our trade."

I would like express my lack of desire to read a lot of raw quotes from other sources not related to the topics. I do not feel any "urge" to go through raw quotes. Please read them, and condense them into specific points or arguments if you expect me to reply to them. You can assume I have read a lot of published books from scientists, philosophers, and many other subjects, and can also read anything you might present. If you then want to debate a specific point, please do so.I can summarize by saying:1. Someone suggested that science is beyond human scruples?? Who did this?Actually, last I understood, science is open to all and is actually formed around EXACTLY the understanding that humans are fallable and not always rational. Hence the decentralized process, the published findings, and the complete and total openess to change once sufficient evidence is presented (and usually a generation time-wise to get over the shock). You're either arguing vs a strawman, or you misunderstand something about science. Or thirdly, someone here was actually suggesting that "science is beyond human scruples".2. If you oppose the scientific process not dealing with things outside the physical universe, then you would seem to be anti-science. I would say irrational as well. That is not an insult, it demands to be used in this context.-Mach

As I said, I've read plenty on the subjects. I have read at least one book by Dawkins (blind watchmaker). I agree with much of his thinking. However, I'm not here debating dawkins, he is not the one here saying things which I find irrational. You can paraphrase their quotes, into your own specific statement tailored for this debate. How would you support the notion that I do this when in just the last reponse I clearly indicate that science is affected in every way shape and form, human fallability and craziness. It's entire design is shaped by this. I don't know of anything humans engage in that isn't affected by them. Why are you using strawman to argue this point? In your second statement, you are confusing human created fiction, with rational theorizing again, let's confine this to the other thread or admit you have no point on this specific issue.No Montalban. Let me say again. It's based on rational knowledge and methods. It's no more fiction than the way we measure the weight of the earth. Did we put in on a big 'ole spring scale and weigh it? No, we didn't did we. Can we go the speed of light? How do we know how fast it is? Were we alive 40M years ago? How do we know this fossil is from that time period? [/QUOTE]They don't spend "squillions", whatever that means. They spend very, very , very little on exobiology, compared to the other fields of science. Exaggeration again. I have already posted links to funding on the other thread, let's see your evidence if you persist in exaggeration.I do not defend research into bigfoot, because there is no reason to believe it's anything other than a product of the human imaginiation. No sufficient evidence. Likewise with god. However, at one time, before it had been researched, looking into bigfoot was reasonable only to the point where it lead to no evidence. It could have easily been a yet unknown animal, however, the consistent lack of evidence has made it a waste of time IMO to continue researching it, unless it's for "fun".You can question it all you want. Everyone questions specifics with regards to science, again, it's designed to be questioned. However, you're using strawman..i.e. attributing specific aspects to science like "science cannot theorize about something otherwise it's just like believing in bigfoot", which are basic misunderstandings of the concepts.Ah, wrong. Go to college. Do well in a particular field of science. Go to graduate school. Continue to get buddy-buddy with various professors and then do a doctorate. Do a thesis on something you think can land you that big research job. Get a job doing research in a field you like. Spend a few years just reading the literature from the thousands of others before you. Then start actually working under another researcher. Maybe one day with enough hard-work, you'll do some novel research independantly. Either that or make a fortune in business then research whatever you want ;)You mean when looking for a job you can run into cultural and gender bias? *shock* Has nothing to do with the scientific proces.Because we aren't debating far-flung, hard-to-understand topics. unless I disagree with a particular point, I don't need reams of links from other people to read, because they serve no purpose if I'm not disagreeing with a strawman. That's why.Strawman. You mean you would like to see science, freed from the constraints of science? Science is a broad term Montalban. I think what you're referring to is you'd like to see pseudo-science and science merged. Well, that's why they use two different terms.Are you seriously telling me you cannot paraphrase this into specific points of a few sentences long? Again, and I don't need the links and quotes from various sources unless I disagree. Otherwise, it's akin to filabustering (sp?)My hope is that you refine in a few sentences your issue with science so we can discuss it in a timely manner :)-Mach

A leading evolutionist, R. Dawkins says "Religion is also, of course, the underlying source of the divisiveness in the Middle East which motivated the use of this deadly weapon in the first place (referring to the September 11 attacks). But that is another story and not my concern here. My concern here is with the weapon itself. To fill a world with religion, or religions of the Abrahamic kind, is like littering the streets with loaded guns. Do not be surprised if they are used." http://www.royal-ts.de/mtarchives/000328.phpThis is the most unique debating post I've yet seen. I gave a statement about scientists being creatures of their times; in presenting evidence. And gave an actual example - in the form of Charles Darwin and his scientific beliefs about female behaviour (influenced no doubt on Victorian ideals of femininity)Then I gave a statement regarding current western science (being influenced in this case by capitalism) and then gave references to support that. You lack of 'urge' to read - and hence to present an argument is, as I said, unique. I've never yet come across this type of retort before. Kudos.You do this. You believe that the science speculation (based on no evidence) about aliens is great, but that the science speculation (based on no evidence) for other things such as the Bunyip, Bigfoot, yeti, trolls etc is not great.To use the classic reply...(Post 67 of the "So, how did they get all those animals on the ark" thread.)But then for something you call 'science fiction' you're quite happy scientists spend squillions of dollars. That you accept so readily this activity is further evidence for my statement... that you'd actually defend them doing such that you yourself deem 'science fiction'.Further, you questioned (as you repeat here again), my very questioning of science. As if questioning of science (as you put forward) is itself indicative of an unstable mind. These are the exact same arguments religious people put when they justify inquisitions.Obviously (given the quote at top) Dawkins has combated the 'illogical' gene. I understand and appreciate your desire to help free me from such irrational thought. Don't give up just yet. :)As stated, I showed epistemological evidences here, and on other posts with regard toa) socialising process of (science) educationb) influences upon scientists from withoutc) a priori beliefs (or, influences from within)If you did really believe in the 'checks and balances', then why do you have a problem with me stating scientists are influenced by factors like any other human engaged in other human activities. You either do believe that they are influenced, or they're not. Please pick a position.But, science is not open to all. Studies too have shown gender and cultural bias here as well.See the comparison between science and religion..."Natural science in the way it is practised is one of the great pillars of patriarchal domination. It is only in the fields of military and church that androcentristic behaviour, thinking and acting, i.e. thinking and acting fixed on men and on masculine ideals is as crucial as in natural science and technology."Gender in Bias in Science and Science Educationhttp://www.physik.uni-bremen.de/phys...t/bellater.htm"Standard Tests" show cultural bias. But why (re-)post them if you feel no 'urge' to read them? Fortunately, I suppose, I post for other people as well - the silent mob who read our debates; and hence do post them again here.I am pro-science. I would like to see scientists freed from your restrictions. :)Here we're back to the 'you must be anti-science'. I am not.I am not in favour of your defining science by your philosophy of science. You and others here are yet to show your definition of science is science as opposed to philosophy of science. In order to demonstrate your view is science, by your own definition of science, you'd have to define it, using scientific method. So far several posters have responded to such a challenge with rhetorical ploys, gnashing of teeth regarding the impossibility of such a challenge, and philosophy - which is odd that there's a need to defend a definition of science by another discipline. (By the way, I have stated that historically there have been many views on the nature of science - including your materialistic one. Over the centuries others have had different views on what is science. This is in fact empirical - that there have been many views - thus my statement that your idea of science is a philosophy of science, is itself based on empirical evidence - given thata) it's historically one of manyandb) your lack of proof for your claim :)Further, I like digital watches, TV, etc. Science provides lots of nice, nifty things. However, because of this, I am not 'bought' and recognise that there are factors affecting scientists. You don't. You believe some massive system of checks and balances exists. Either you are correct - and you've shown only your opinion on this, or I am correct, and I've shown citations that agree with me, or rather, that I agree with. And I must point out that in debating your 'side' on this matter for some time, I get this all the time. I post acres of evidences. The retort is "'no, it just can't be!" Thus again ironically, I present facts from studies, and it's retorted by opinion, or in your case above 'no opinion', which is still making me smile.Oddly enough, you can't claim to be unaware of this avalanche of evidence, because you've seen the "Where does science say we come from?" thread, which I posted such gems as..."The scientific establishment bears a grisly resemblance to the Spanish Inquisition. Either you accept the rules and attitudes and beliefs promulgated by the 'papacy' (for which read, perhaps, the Royal Society or the Royal College of Physicians), or face a dreadful retribution. We will not actually burn you at the stake, because that sanction, unhappily, is now no longer available under our milksop laws. But we will make damned sure that you are a dead duck in our trade."

A great improvement on a simple ballistic shell, it still cannot discriminate particular targets. It could not zero in on a designated New York skyscraper if launched from as far away as Boston. That is precisely what a modern "smart missile" can do. Computer miniaturisation has advanced to the point where one of today's smart missiles could be programmed with an image of the Manhattan skyline together with instructions to home in on the north tower of the World Trade Centre. Smart missiles of this sophistication are possessed by the United States, as we learned in the Gulf war, but they are economically beyond ordinary terrorists and scientifically beyond theocratic governments. Might there be a cheaper and easier alternative? In the second world war, before electronics became cheap and miniature, the psychologist BF Skinner did some research on pigeon-guided missiles. The pigeon was to sit in a tiny cockpit, having previously been trained to peck keys in such a way as to keep a designated target in the centre of a screen. In the missile, the target would be for real. The principle worked, although it was never put into practice by the US authorities. Even factoring in the costs of training them, pigeons are cheaper and lighter than computers of comparable effectiveness. Their feats in Skinner's boxes suggest that a pigeon, after a regimen of training with colour slides, really could guide a missile to a distinctive landmark at the southern end of Manhattan island. The pigeon has no idea that it is guiding a missile. It just keeps on pecking at those two tall rectangles on the screen, from time to time a food reward drops out of the dispenser, and this goes on until... oblivion. Pigeons may be cheap and disposable as on-board guidance systems, but there's no escaping the cost of the missile itself. And no such missile large enough to do much damage could penetrate US air space without being intercepted. What is needed is a missile that is not recognised for what it is until too late. Something like a large civilian airliner, carrying the innocuous markings of a well-known carrier and a great deal of fuel. That's the easy part. But how do you smuggle on board the necessary guidance system? You can hardly expect the pilots to surrender the left-hand seat to a pigeon or a computer. How about using humans as on-board guidance systems, instead of pigeons? Humans are at least as numerous as pigeons, their brains are not significantly costlier than pigeon brains, and for many tasks they are actually superior. Humans have a proven track record in taking over planes by the use of threats, which work because the legitimate pilots value their own lives and those of their passengers. The natural assumption that the hijacker ultimately values his own life too, and will act rationally to preserve it, leads air crews and ground staff to make calculated decisions that would not work with guidance modules lacking a sense of self-preservation. If your plane is being hijacked by an armed man who, though prepared to take risks, presumably wants to go on living, there is room for bargaining. A rational pilot complies with the hijacker's wishes, gets the plane down on the ground, has hot food sent in for the passengers and leaves the negotiations to people trained to negotiate. The problem with the human guidance system is precisely this. Unlike the pigeon version, it knows that a successful mission culminates in its own destruction. Could we develop a biological guidance system with the compliance and dispensability of a pigeon but with a man's resourcefulness and ability to infiltrate plausibly? What we need, in a nutshell, is a human who doesn't mind being blown up. He'd make the perfect on-board guidance system. But suicide enthusiasts are hard to find. Even terminal cancer patients might lose their nerve when the crash was actually looming. Could we get some otherwise normal humans and somehow persuade them that they are not going to die as a consequence of flying a plane smack into a skyscraper? If only! Nobody is that stupid, but how about this - it's a long shot, but it just might work. Given that they are certainly going to die, couldn't we sucker them into believing that they are going to come to life again afterwards? Don't be daft! No, listen, it might work. Offer them a fast track to a Great Oasis in the Sky, cooled by everlasting fountains. Harps and wings wouldn't appeal to the sort of young men we need, so tell them there's a special martyr's reward of 72 virgin brides, guaranteed eager and exclusive. Would they fall for it? Yes, testosterone-sodden young men too unattractive to get a woman in this world might be desperate enough to go for 72 private virgins in the next. It's a tall story, but worth a try. You'd have to get them young, though. Feed them a complete and self-consistent background mythology to make the big lie sound plausible when it comes. Give them a holy book and make them learn it by heart. Do you know, I really think it might work. As luck would have it, we have just the thing to hand: a ready-made system of mind-control which has been honed over centuries, handed down through generations. Millions of people have been brought up in it. It is called religion and, for reasons which one day we may understand, most people fall for it (nowhere more so than America itself, though the irony passes unnoticed). Now all we need is to round up a few of these faith-heads and give them flying lessons. Facetious? Trivialising an unspeakable evil? That is the exact opposite of my intention, which is deadly serious and prompted by deep grief and fierce anger. I am trying to call attention to the elephant in the room that everybody is too polite - or too devout - to notice: religion, and specifically the devaluing effect that religion has on human life. I don't mean devaluing the life of others (though it can do that too), but devaluing one's own life. Religion teaches the dangerous nonsense that death is not the end. If death is final, a rational agent can be expected to value his life highly and be reluctant to risk it. This makes the world a safer place, just as a plane is safer if its hijacker wants to survive. At the other extreme, if a significant number of people convince themselves, or are convinced by their priests, that a martyr's death is equivalent to pressing the hyperspace button and zooming through a wormhole to another universe, it can make the world a very dangerous place. Especially if they also believe that that other universe is a paradisical escape from the tribulations of the real world. Top it off with sincerely believed, if ludicrous and degrading to women, sexual promises, and is it any wonder that naive and frustrated young men are clamouring to be selected for suicide missions? There is no doubt that the afterlife-obsessed suicidal brain really is a weapon of immense power and danger. It is comparable to a smart missile, and its guidance system is in many respects superior to the most sophisticated electronic brain that money can buy. Yet to a cynical government, organisation, or priesthood, it is very very cheap. Our leaders have described the recent atrocity with the customary cliche: mindless cowardice. "Mindless" may be a suitable word for the vandalising of a telephone box. It is not helpful for understanding what hit New York on September 11.

Dawkins? conclusion is summed up in two memorable sentences: ?To fill a world with religion, or religions of the Abrahamic kind, is like littering the streets with loaded guns.

A great improvement on a simple ballistic shell, it still cannot discriminate particular targets. It could not zero in on a designated New York skyscraper if launched from as far away as Boston. That is precisely what a modern "smart missile" can do. Computer miniaturisation has advanced to the point where one of today's smart missiles could be programmed with an image of the Manhattan skyline together with instructions to home in on the north tower of the World Trade Centre. Smart missiles of this sophistication are possessed by the United States, as we learned in the Gulf war, but they are economically beyond ordinary terrorists and scientifically beyond theocratic governments. Might there be a cheaper and easier alternative? In the second world war, before electronics became cheap and miniature, the psychologist BF Skinner did some research on pigeon-guided missiles. The pigeon was to sit in a tiny cockpit, having previously been trained to peck keys in such a way as to keep a designated target in the centre of a screen. In the missile, the target would be for real. The principle worked, although it was never put into practice by the US authorities. Even factoring in the costs of training them, pigeons are cheaper and lighter than computers of comparable effectiveness. Their feats in Skinner's boxes suggest that a pigeon, after a regimen of training with colour slides, really could guide a missile to a distinctive landmark at the southern end of Manhattan island. The pigeon has no idea that it is guiding a missile. It just keeps on pecking at those two tall rectangles on the screen, from time to time a food reward drops out of the dispenser, and this goes on until... oblivion. Pigeons may be cheap and disposable as on-board guidance systems, but there's no escaping the cost of the missile itself. And no such missile large enough to do much damage could penetrate US air space without being intercepted. What is needed is a missile that is not recognised for what it is until too late. Something like a large civilian airliner, carrying the innocuous markings of a well-known carrier and a great deal of fuel. That's the easy part. But how do you smuggle on board the necessary guidance system? You can hardly expect the pilots to surrender the left-hand seat to a pigeon or a computer. How about using humans as on-board guidance systems, instead of pigeons? Humans are at least as numerous as pigeons, their brains are not significantly costlier than pigeon brains, and for many tasks they are actually superior. Humans have a proven track record in taking over planes by the use of threats, which work because the legitimate pilots value their own lives and those of their passengers. The natural assumption that the hijacker ultimately values his own life too, and will act rationally to preserve it, leads air crews and ground staff to make calculated decisions that would not work with guidance modules lacking a sense of self-preservation. If your plane is being hijacked by an armed man who, though prepared to take risks, presumably wants to go on living, there is room for bargaining. A rational pilot complies with the hijacker's wishes, gets the plane down on the ground, has hot food sent in for the passengers and leaves the negotiations to people trained to negotiate. The problem with the human guidance system is precisely this. Unlike the pigeon version, it knows that a successful mission culminates in its own destruction. Could we develop a biological guidance system with the compliance and dispensability of a pigeon but with a man's resourcefulness and ability to infiltrate plausibly? What we need, in a nutshell, is a human who doesn't mind being blown up. He'd make the perfect on-board guidance system. But suicide enthusiasts are hard to find. Even terminal cancer patients might lose their nerve when the crash was actually looming. Could we get some otherwise normal humans and somehow persuade them that they are not going to die as a consequence of flying a plane smack into a skyscraper? If only! Nobody is that stupid, but how about this - it's a long shot, but it just might work. Given that they are certainly going to die, couldn't we sucker them into believing that they are going to come to life again afterwards? Don't be daft! No, listen, it might work. Offer them a fast track to a Great Oasis in the Sky, cooled by everlasting fountains. Harps and wings wouldn't appeal to the sort of young men we need, so tell them there's a special martyr's reward of 72 virgin brides, guaranteed eager and exclusive. Would they fall for it? Yes, testosterone-sodden young men too unattractive to get a woman in this world might be desperate enough to go for 72 private virgins in the next. It's a tall story, but worth a try. You'd have to get them young, though. Feed them a complete and self-consistent background mythology to make the big lie sound plausible when it comes. Give them a holy book and make them learn it by heart. Do you know, I really think it might work. As luck would have it, we have just the thing to hand: a ready-made system of mind-control which has been honed over centuries, handed down through generations. Millions of people have been brought up in it. It is called religion and, for reasons which one day we may understand, most people fall for it (nowhere more so than America itself, though the irony passes unnoticed). Now all we need is to round up a few of these faith-heads and give them flying lessons. Facetious? Trivialising an unspeakable evil? That is the exact opposite of my intention, which is deadly serious and prompted by deep grief and fierce anger. I am trying to call attention to the elephant in the room that everybody is too polite - or too devout - to notice: religion, and specifically the devaluing effect that religion has on human life. I don't mean devaluing the life of others (though it can do that too), but devaluing one's own life. Religion teaches the dangerous nonsense that death is not the end. If death is final, a rational agent can be expected to value his life highly and be reluctant to risk it. This makes the world a safer place, just as a plane is safer if its hijacker wants to survive. At the other extreme, if a significant number of people convince themselves, or are convinced by their priests, that a martyr's death is equivalent to pressing the hyperspace button and zooming through a wormhole to another universe, it can make the world a very dangerous place. Especially if they also believe that that other universe is a paradisical escape from the tribulations of the real world. Top it off with sincerely believed, if ludicrous and degrading to women, sexual promises, and is it any wonder that naive and frustrated young men are clamouring to be selected for suicide missions? There is no doubt that the afterlife-obsessed suicidal brain really is a weapon of immense power and danger. It is comparable to a smart missile, and its guidance system is in many respects superior to the most sophisticated electronic brain that money can buy. Yet to a cynical government, organisation, or priesthood, it is very very cheap. Our leaders have described the recent atrocity with the customary cliche: mindless cowardice. "Mindless" may be a suitable word for the vandalising of a telephone box. It is not helpful for understanding what hit New York on September 11. Those people were not mindless and they were certainly not cowards. On the contrary, they had sufficiently effective minds braced with an insane courage, and it would pay us mightily to understand where that courage came from. It came from religion. Religion is also, of course, the underlying source of the divisiveness in the Middle East which motivated the use of this deadly weapon in the first place.

I do believe that choosing to believe in or draw conclusions from things that have no evidence is irrational. On that level I agree with Dawkins, irrational thought IMO, and his opinion, is dangerous to our human society. One can "hope", for something they have insufficient evidence for, or even "shut out" certain thoughts to avoid dealing with them. But if they were to DENY them, that's the step into irrationality.Many things are dangerous to our human society, opening the door to irrational thought is just one of many. ====If you mean to say that your version of what you term as "truth", is somehow based on rational thought, then we've got a debate. Because it's irrational to believe in something without sufficient evidence...in this case, without ANY evidence.You believe:- Love is god- A human cannot do "good" without god, so god = good.- Life is the design of "god" (Assuming this one, correct me if that's not the case)- The supernatural exists (God, miracles, etc.), and has influence in, the known universe- Not believing in the general theory of evolution as it applies to the origin of the human species (And all other species except the first) is somehow "rational".- You disagree with a concept in biology, a course which you admittedly didn't, or chose not to, understand sufficiently, and you debate language rather than the science. Not understanding it in one course is human. Saying we should not believe it, and choosing not to believe it, is irrational.- The position(s) you hold does two things:1. Requires you to deny that evolution exists despite the evidence2. Leave you without the ability to provide a rational, alternative theory.This is why your entire argument is irrational, and in my opinion, to use Dawkins wording to make sure we know I agree, "dangerous".You can question science, it's meant to be questioned, we all WANT it to be questioned, repeatedly. It's accuracy relies on these questions.That does not however make it a "controversy". Evolution in general, is NOT being heatedly debated my science. It's almost universally accepted in the scientific community, because of the vast amount of evidence obtained from:1. Observation of the physical world (of life around us)2. Observation of the fossil record ( of life before us)3. Observation of the mechanics of our chemical composition, including genetics, and how genetic information is the blueprint of the creation of an organism, and how this genetic information changes, and can change, over time.Once you understand the general concepts, it's plain to see how simple of a theory it is, and how it answers so many questions we have about life, and how there is no evidence that indicates it might NOT be able to answer EVERY question we have about life once we're at the end of our scientific journey in that direction (if there is an end).Why are there males and females? Why do we have sex? Why do I, a man, have nipples? Why do we have different skin hues, hair colors, why do some people have a bad heart, 6 fingers, why do we die. Why is eating (of most foods) pleasurable. Where did other animals come from. Why are there domesticated dogs and "wild" dogs. Why do some mammals live in the ocean, and have finger and toe (tarsal and metatarsal?) bone structure in their flippers? The list goes on, to ever question you could ever have about living organisms....and where did we come from?It's that last one that disagrees with your premise, that "a supernatural god created life", and that's an irrational to believe. You venture further into the irrational behavior when you then DENY things with sufficient evidence that do not agree with this irrational belief. Because you know to believe in any part of evolution, no matter how rational, requires that you accept the conclusion (that humans came to be through evolutionary change), you attack ALL of evolution. There is no need to pick and choose little fringe arguments on the subject. Let's cut right to the root causes.-Mach

In short you have trouble admitting to an error. I admit my mistakes - and short-comings; with regards my science education.Though this now has little to do with the Moon Dust Theory, it goes to show that when opposed some pro-evolutionists are as addicted to religious-like dogma that even when presented with facts in black and white, they still deny, and revert to insults and accuse the opposition (in this case, me :)) of lying.To keep with the religious-like zeal, the irony of Dawkins attack on religion is that he displays the same irrational hatred that he accuses fundamentalists of. Here is part of a reply to one of Berlinski's articles, by one David C Denett..."I love it: another hilarious demonstration that you can publish bull---t at will - just so long as you say what an editorial board wants to hear in a style it favors. Fist there was Alan Soak's delicious unmasking of the editors of Social Text, who fell for his fashionably anti-scientific "proof" that according to quantum physics, the world is a social construction. Now David Berlinski has done the same to the editors of  Commentary, who fell just as hard for his parody of "scientific" creationism. They must really be oppressed by evolutionary theory to publish such inspired silliness without running it by a biologist or two for soundness. Two such similar pranks in a single month make one wonder if this is just the tip of the Zeitgeist. What next? A hoax extolling the educational virtues of the machine gun for tots in the American Rifleman?"David Berlinski; "Letters: David Berlinski and Critics" in Dembski, W. A. (ed) "Uncommon Dissent: Intellectuals who Find Darwinism Unconvincing", p290Note it has the same hallmarks of some of the refutations here - generalised ad hominem and ridicule.David Berlinsk's article reminds me of the tactics employed by a certain creationist with whom I once shared a platform in Oxford. The great evolutionist John Maynard Smith was, of course, easily able to destroy the creationist's case, and in his good-natured way he soon had the audience roaring with appreciative laughter at its expense. The creationist has his own peculiar way of dealing with this. He sprang to his feet, palms facing the audience in a gesture eloquent or magnanimous reproof. "No, no!" he cried reproachfully, "Don't laugh. Let Maynard Smith have his say. It's only fair!" This desperate (sic) pretence that the audience was laughing at Maynard Smith, when in fact it was laughing with Maynard Smith at the creationist himself, reminds me of Mr Berlinski's pretending to misunderstand Jacques Monod and me to the extent of thinking we disagree with each other over the issue of chance.As for the identity of the creationist who tried to pull this little stunt on Maynard Smith, it was none other than David Berlinski. The audience, by the way, saw through his tactic instantly and treated it with hoots of derision"-Richard DawkinsIbid, p288.Neither party really attempts to refute Berlinski, but they are keen to make reference to him being a creationist - a misrepresentation, because he's not. Dawkins goes further to recount an instance of somewhere else (sound familiar?) to where he believes Berlinski was wrong. This is what happens when zealots are even dared questioned.
