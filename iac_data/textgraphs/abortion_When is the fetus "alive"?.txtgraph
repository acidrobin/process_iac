When is the fetus "alive"?

The moment the sperm attaches itself to the egg, that is when it is living, from the very second of conception. One of the evidences is that at that moment it starts to grow.

It is a living organism when the sperm and egg combine their codes.

If the fetus is alive when the sperm and egg combine, then why do people argue that it isn't "alive" until its heart starts beating?

The heart starts beating 3 weeks after conception, and you can't live without a beating heart, but me personally, I think that as soon as the miracle starts, (egg and sperm combine) that is when life begins. I know it's more of a spiritual thing for me instead of a fact. :)

A fetus is human at conception, because it has the HUMAN DNA, which means it's human. (puppies have dog DNA, kittens have cat DNA, fetuses have human DNA, so they are human). 3000 are murdered every day.

Nobody argues that the sperm and ovum aren't living cells. They argue that when they combine, the fetus isn't "alive" until its heart starts beating. Crim:I don't know why you would be worried about abortion. We're all a higher form of animals anyway. Fetuses don't matter because we are all a product of evolution. What do a bunch of balls of tissue matter in the entire scheme of things? So what if they might change our nation for the better? The stronger survive, the weak die. That's just the way things go. There is no right or wrong. Therefore, we should be able to kill all the fetuses that we want. Right?

Higher by intelligence, yes.How does that follow? Fetuses are a necessary step in the reproductive process.At that point, they are doing nothing. Their potential is not quantifiable.Actually, that's not the way things go for social animals; humans especially. Fetuses are not weaker genetically than any other human age groups. At the point of abortion, selection cannot even have occured on them.Who said there's no right or wrong? Just because you require an imaginary boogyman who will poke you with a pitchfork in eternal fires to be good doesn't mean everyone else does.

So what? They aren't worth anything, are they? Does it matter if we kill them? No, in your reasoning it doesn't because there are no absolutes.So why don't we kill them all? They're just nuisances anyway.Mentally challenged babies are weaker than other babies. So are premies. Yes, they are weaker genetically. Why try to save them? They aren't going to help further the development of the human species anyway.Coming from the basis that we evolved, there is no right or wrong. All we have are animal instincts. If I want to kill somebody, why should that be wrong? Monkeys get into fights and kill each other all the time. Was one of them "wrong" and one of them "right"?

How are they nuisances? The vast vast majority of them are wanted.You haven't provided a standard of what is weaker. A complication in a pregnancy can have nothing to do with genes.How do you know what they're going to do?How do you figure? Are Hebrew War Gods who promote rape and slavery the only source of morals?We also have thought.Because you are disrupting social order and infringing on another person's rights.For one, monkeys don't "get into fights and kill each other all the time". Some apes fight over leadership of the clan or for women. Generally, death does not occur in these battles, nor is it the aim.Stop confusing evolution with social darwinism and stop using strawmen.Thanks

No, the vast majority of them are unwanted. That is why there are so many abortions.Weaker: mentally challenged, disabled, premie, etc."At that point, they are doing nothing. Their potential is not quantifiable."How do YOU figure? If we are just evolved from some goo in a swamp and there are no gods (which you have told me very often) then what are morals?In the definition of evolution, thought=animal instincts.Why do we have rights? We're just a higher form of animal.But death does occur, doesn't it. And yes, monkeys kill and eat other species of monkeys. Evolution ultimately leads to what you call "social darwinism".

So you're saying there are vastly more abortions in the world than there are births?Yeah, I said AT THAT POINT. Your statement was about what they would do in their lives. How do you know what would become of any one of them?You didn't answer my question. What part of having a Hebrew War God as a creator instills morals? What necessarily makes any god a 'good' creature? I'd have a hard time believing that you agree with all of the god-given laws in the Old Testament.Morals are the set of actions deemed appropriate by society and individuals through personal experience, thought, and feelings.Is not "do unto others what they would wish have done to them" situational? Wrong. Thought is more than reaction to stimuli. It involves weighing options."Social Darwinism" is an outdated philosophy which was formed BEFORE the theory of evolution. It is based on a fallacy and has little, if anything, to do with the fact of evolution. This has already been discussed in a different thread. I know you'd like to think you're taking some moral high ground because you deny facts, but you're not.I should add...why do YOU think murder is wrong?

You are considered born once your heart starts beating and you exit your mothers stomach. The Fetus is not alive yet, so its not murder. Abortion should not be abused, but there are cases when it should either be used, or the woman should have the right to choose1.If it threatens her live2.If it threatens the child's life3.If the child risks sever health problems4.If she cannot afford to have a child, and the child can't be adopted5.If she lives in China and already has a kidThere would be other reason.

Morfos, it shouldn't matter. The fetus is either and independant human or it's part of the mother. If the fetus is alive, then the fetus has equal rights. However, if it's part of the mother, then the fetus is no more than dead tissue. But it ISN'T part of the mother, it's a completely unique and independant person. Read this (written by yours truly).

Does it really matter if its alive or not? Every single one of theese debates always boils down to some religious debate, statistic or someones sob story, the real question that needs to be addressed (WITHOUT letting your political or religious view getting in the way) is should someone be allowed to choose weather people have the right to choose weather or not to have a child. many of my friends growing up had the type of parents that didnt want them or didnt love them enough etc. . . and most of them are in the process of falling through the cracks and most likely will be the next person to rob you.

Im not saying that the govenment should decide anything about when its ok to have a child, im saying they have no right to ban abortion and therefore limit ones options when dealing with a decision like that.

Skyline,It seems as if you ARE suggesting that abortion be used as birth control. You say that if "people dont want a child...they should have an option to have an abortion." That IS birth control.Also, please consider if the EVIL is the fact that the child was born (and not aborted), or if the evil is that children are thrown in a rubbermaid bin or rotting in a XXXX covered room. I think you are confusing things and calling good evil and evil good. Committing the evil of abortion is not the way to remedy the other evils you describe above. Are we any better as a society if we substitute the evil of abortion for the evil of child abuse or murder after birth? There has to be a different approach to make these people realize the value of children. Do you realize that THE THINKING AND PHILOSOPHY THAT MINIMALIZES CHILDREN AND SAYS THEY ARE SIMPLY OBJECTS UNDER THE SOLE CONTROL AND DOMINION OF THE MOTHER (THE PHILOSOPHY THAT ALLOWS ABORTION) IS THE EXACT PHILOSOPHY THAT MINIMALIZES CHILDREN IN ALLOWING THEM TO BE ABUSED AND PUT IN XXXX COVERED ROOMS OR THROWN IN DUMPSTERS? If one can have an abortion and throw a child into a dumpster afterwards then why can he not throw them into a dumpster a few seconds and a few inches later when birth has occurred?Peace.

It's very difficult to define from when life begins.To define it, we need to define what the life is. Is it just organism or sentient thing? If it's sentient thing, fetus in a womb is not life, I don't think so. I would say right after insemination, say a few minutes, it's not life yet but once it can be recognized fetus, it's a life.Etheically speaking, abortion is same as murder but even murder sometimes is innevitable for entire life on this planet. If people think it's a good way for survival and properity of us, it's the way we go.I think most of abortions are not justified, though.

Nao, How does it get to the point of being a fetus if it is not a living, growing, being? It has a seperate genetic identity from the point of conception and it is obviously established as human. It is a distinct, new living being that came from two other beings. The product of two others becomes a new "other.""If people think it's a good way for survival and properity of us, it's the way we go." Are you saying that the majority is in favor of abortion? Polls of the opinion of the populus might say otherwise. Only a few supreme court justices decided they were in favor of abortion, it was not put to a vote. Even if the majority would be in favor of abortion would you concede defeat if you think this is a moral wrong? Does the majority dictate your morality?

But do you honestly feel this way? Would you so easily destroy the fruit of the love between you and your fiance? Do you think your fiance would value that life over the selfishness of avoiding the temporary discomfort of morning sickness, etc.? Above you seem conceited with materialism but now you seem to value yourself very little. Would you throw away your own flesh and blood without a second thought? Would it truly ruin your life or would you adapt? The problem is that once conception has occurred you are no longer simply making a decision concerning the bodies of you and your fiance. You are making a decision concerning the life of another. The two become one flesh not just at the very time of the act of love/sex (that is you are joined as one body during sex). This union sometimes remains. The two become one flesh in another sense--in another being--part of you, part of her. Would you want to throw that away? It is unique and irreplaceable, there will never be another exactly like it in all of history.

maximus, the objection is the use of pictures of stillborn, SIDS babies, or other deaths not related to abortion as being representative of abortions. I disagree. The vast majority of people in the US eat meat, but who do you know would like to watch a video of the process by which it is gathered? Who would even like to watch a video of a woman giving birth? Just because something is disgusting doesn't mean it necessarily pulls heartstrings.

I think that the term of terrorism more aptly applies to the violent act of ripping a fetus from the comfort of the womb, imposing a death sentence on it without due process, and throwing it away as a meaningless piece of flesh."if traditional birth control fails, I'm not going to let some little ball of flesh and bone spawned from MY sperm ruin my fiancé and My life. I'm not going to watch her have morning sickness, have back pains and feel ugly until we are ready to do so....we therefore also live in a society that a couple can make their own decisions concerning their bodies" Again you acknowledge abortion as a means of birth control. But do you honestly feel this way? Would you so easily destroy the fruit of the love between you and your fiance? Do you think your fiance would value that life over the selfishness of avoiding the temporary discomfort of morning sickness, etc.? Above you seem conceited with materialism but now you seem to value yourself very little. Would you throw away your own flesh and blood without a second thought? Would it truly ruin your life or would you adapt? The problem is that once conception has occurred you are no longer simply making a decision concerning the bodies of you and your fiance. You are making a decision concerning the life of another. The two become one flesh not just at the very time of the act of love/sex (that is you are joined as one body during sex). This union sometimes remains. The two become one flesh in another sense--in another being--part of you, part of her. Would you want to throw that away? It is unique and irreplaceable, there will never be another exactly like it in all of history.

Crim,I'm not trying to be a smart aleck but how do you know what Skyline is arguing? He made no mention of the use of stillborns, SIDS babies, or other deaths. I don't think this was in his line of reasoning. I'm not sure why pro-lifers would do this anyway. They don't need to show pictures of those other deaths. There are abundant examples of abortion deaths in photographs being that approximately 5,000 are aborted daily. See www.blackgenocide.org or www.abortionno.org. Now, there may be some truth to what you say concerning watching grotesque images. But think about this...for a grotesque image to come about there has to be something there to photograph. The photo is not the monstrosity, the subject of the photo is the monstrosity. The act of abortion is disgusting, bloody, and violent.  The images show the truth of this. Now we can admit that photos of a butchered cow might be disgusting and photos of a butchered baby would very well be disgusting. But would we have the same reaction to these two disgusting images? Furthermore, one of the main points of showing these pictures is to abolish the myth put forth by abortionists that this is an inanimate object, a blob of tissue, an appendage of the mother, something lesser than human. The abortion clinics do not give full disclosure of this. The mothers have no idea what that doctor is pulling out of the womb many times. At 8 weeks you can see the little human and I think that many mothers would decline if they saw their child before aborting it. There are people that don't believe the Holocaust of WWII occurred. But can they deny the truth of the pictures? Who wants to look at that horror story? If you looked at those pictures then you would be disgusted. But along with showing the truth of history, it serves the purpose of creating an aversion to actions that bring about this type of slaughter. There is a modern day holocaust going on every day in America and around the world but so many deny it.

maximus, the objection is the use of pictures of stillborn, SIDS babies, or other deaths not related to abortion as being representative of abortions. I disagree. The vast majority of people in the US eat meat, but who do you know would like to watch a video of the process by which it is gathered? Who would even like to watch a video of a woman giving birth? Just because something is disgusting doesn't mean it necessarily pulls heartstrings.

At 8 weeks, it is less than 1/2 an inch long. The abortion is basically sucking the bean-sized embryo out of the uterus. This process is hardly violent or bloody. Furthermore, the embryo is not conscious and is completely unaware of whatever might be occuring to it. The majority of abortions occur around or before this stage.Showing a dead infant stirs more emotions than showing a picture of a lump the size of a fingernail or something flushed out during menstration.

Crim,1. If someone is unconscious can they still be killed and wronged? Consciousness of the victim does not determine if the action against him is moral.2. The clean term of embryo does not take away the fact that it is a living human being. I have held an 8-9 week old "embryo" in my own hands. It may be bean shaped but it is not a bean. Its length does not determine its essence. It had a head with eyes, it had arms and legs. Its humanity was readily discernible.3. Violent or bloody--I consider killing a living human being a violent action.4. A dead infant???Would you oppose abortion once the thing is not a "lump the size of your fingernail?" Does your line of opposition depend on size or length?

I oppose abortion around 18-20 weeks, when the fetus' brain has developed sufficiently so that it can recognized as an actual sentient, feeling being, rather than merely being alive in the same sense that a plant is alive.

In the science of Biology, life is defined as anything that is composed as metabolizing cells.spermatazooa are living, ovula are living and when they combine they make a living thing. A human zygote's cells divide and in order to divide they need chromosomes- human embryos have human chromosomes.So a fetus is actually alive the nanosecond the living sperm hits the living egg.Not only is it life it's human life.

You gave a definition of life, not human life. For a human to have life it needs a whole lot more than just a couple cells. Human life I believe is defined by the ability to think as well as survive. I think a person who is brain dead is no longer truely a human although he is still life. I don't disagree with those who disconnect them from the machines which keep them alive because they are no longer what they used to be.I'm not debating here whether abortion is correct or where the point is that an unborn child is able to think. All I'm saying is that human life requires a functioning brain."I think, therefore I am"

Anything that has cow DNA is cow. Anything with mushroom DNA is mushroom. Anything with amoebic DNA is amoeba.Anything with human DNA is human, regardless of what you think.

I never said anything about human DNA although I do agree human DNA is human DNA. DNA doesn't make a human what it is though. If I had a bag full of human DNA (ewww), would you consider it to be human life? Would you argue that it should be protected under our laws and killing it would be murder? If you want to go really far you could debate that every single sperm cells should be protected under our laws as well because they hold human DNA intended to create life. I doubt this is what you mean to say but look at the context of what your trying to debate and read what your response was. Your trying to say human DNA means human life. Also consider that a virus is DNA yet most people wouldn't consider a virus to be life at all.Ah but your missing something here. I never debated that all life has to have the ability to think before it can be considered to be actual life of that species. I only classifed that as my belief when dealing with humans. Your debating that there are other biological things that occur that make a species what it is. The problem with this though is your trying to compare a human to a jellyfish. A jellyfish never grows a brain and therefore it can be considered to be life before it has a brain. If humans never formed a brain either, they would be considered human life before they had a brain. However, how many humans do you know that literally have no brain? Without a brain, your simply not human. If your brain dead, then pulling the plug on you isn't murder. So even our laws support this fact although the condition of a brain dead person and an unborn child are very, very different. Still you see my point. I agree that a mass of human DNA that will one day become a living human can be considered to be life before it actually has a brain. I just don't believe it can be considered human life until it has the ability to think.Everything is Everything is an equation just as 1 is 1 would be. "I think therefore I am" is a theory. I'm not trying to debate that my quote is the way life should be viewed although I do believe my quote to be a good way to determine what is human life. I do agree with your quote since it is a simple equation but I don't see what purpose it serves in this debate.I can tell that your pretty adimate about your belief that human life occurs very early on. I know that defining that point when human life beings is very objective. You may very much believe your views while I very much believe my views, and the case may be that neither of us are right as far as 'God' may see it. Or maybe were both right.

I never said human DNA was human life. I said if a couple of metabolizing cells had human DNA they were human life. Because they would be human and living. If a man was in a coma and had poor brain activity, you or I say- he's not living- pull the plug.But what if it had happened to him before? What if he had a 50-50 chance? What if he could pull through?Well, a clump of cells with human DNA have more than a 50-50 chance. They are almost guaranteed to grow and become something special and unique. A jellyfish is a jellyfish. It will never change. A fetus is worth more based on it's potential which no other creature has. Your DNA is what makes you human. It is what you are.

First off we were never even discussing anything except what human life was. Your post responding to this was almost completely about DNA. Why is it then that you say human DNA is not human life? I guess I'll ignore this even though I'm confused by what your intentions were.OK, well focusing on the guy in the coma, I'm not saying what if this or that. All I'm saying is that as of the moment he loses the ability to think, he is officially not a human. My definition of human requires the ability to think. I doubt he is viewed as the same person he was before he went into a coma. Something is just missing from him. I'm not saying lets pull the plug just because he isn't human right now because that would be like saying lets abort all babies before they gain the ability to think. It makes no sense especially with the technology we have today. If there is a chance to live, fine, take that chance and keep him alive. My only point is that the person isn't really human life at that point.The fetus potential is what I was speaking of when I mentioned morality. However, this doesn't affect the fact that the fetus isn't alive until it can think and until it gets to that point, I believe it is not moral but also not murder to abort the baby. No one can deny that it is immoral to do an abortion just for the fun of it but realistically the clump of DNA that the fetus is isn't even going to know that it has died. It never even had its first thought so it died without ever even living a human life.Lets be realistic. DNA does not make you human. If a human kept its entire body but somehow the brain of the person was made to be that of a hamster, would that be a human any longer? You may say it is but I believe it is partially what is in the mind that makes you what you are. If a human has the brain of a hamster, it is not a hamster, but it is surely not a human either. Even your quote "Human is a human" would be in agreement with this unless you stretch it a bit. If you believe a circle is a circle, then you cut out a small piece of the middle of one of the circles and replace it with a square, is that still the same circle as it was before? It has the same shape based on what it seems to be on the outside, but what is inside is different.Would the Terminator be a human because it looks like one? Would the Terminator with a human brain be a human because he both looks and thinks like one? Would the Terminator, if born of another human having its original skeleton and organs replaced with cold metal and given incredible strength be a human? What makes a human a human?Also I think I should point out that what you know can change over time. I didn't always agree with abortion until I had to question myself about why I didn't agree with it. What I thought I knew at that time isn't what I know now and what I know now changes almost every day. I would hope it is the same way for you.Wow, we really are starting to cover a lot of topics!

Although this statement is untrue, let’s use it. Being in a coma and being asleep are equal things- both are at states of unconsciousness. If you are asleep, then, are you not a human? Should we allow murder towards people who are asleep? Of course not. That is absurd, because all humans --conscious or unconscious-- are human. We are homo sapiens. If we are human biologically and metaphysically, we are human officially. To say otherwise is a farcical. Whether it knows if it is going to die or not is a red herring. The fetus still has a right to life. Simply because it hasn’t developed the consciousness to decide if it wants to live or die doesn’t mean that you can make the decision for the child. Infants wouldn’t care if they could live or die- frankly they don’t care of the matter. However, as mature persons, parents decide to allow their infant to live, because they know that there is an entire life for the infant to look upon, a life full of challenges, opportunities, and happiness. The fetus, whether awake or asleep, has the right to life. Of course it is! Although it is biologically impossible to mix a hamster’s brain with a human’s brain, since the hamster’s brain is so small the human DNA will dominate the hamster’s DNA and thus this “thing” will be a human. Simply because a part of the body is not of human DNA doesn’t mean the human on a whole isn’t human.I think you’re looking at the DNA argument erroneously. You see, all life forms have a DNA type. Within these types are billions and trillions of different kinds of the species’ DNA. Dogs have dog DNA, cats have cat DNA, et cetera saecula saeculorum. Humans have Human DNA, and thus anyone with Human DNA is human. This does not mean that a liver or kidney is it’s own human, because the liver and kidney has the same DNA as the person it is inside of. However, the fetus (and all other humans) have individual, unique DNAs (except for cloned humans and twins, but the point isn’t that all humans are genetically unique, it is that the fetus(s) is(are) unique to the mother). Another point that I don’t believe anyone has brought up, is that the fetus is human because of biogenesis. Remember, all life comes from pre-existing life, and all life reproduces after it’s own kind. Horses only make Horses, rabbits only make rabbits, and Grey Davis only makes everything worse. It est the fetus is human because humans can only produce humans, and not some other life form.

It sure wouldn't be considered human and wouldn't receive any medicare at that point.That is a good point. In the case of our monster though, it would still be part human IMO but surely not human. Besides, it would be looking to mate with giant hamsters at that point. I could any human babies would come from that.

One question I wish to pose to the readers of this thread is one I've posed to myself before. If your consciousness were to be transferred from your brain to another person brain, which person would you be? Would you be the person who has your body or would you be the person who has your mind?I came to the conclusion that I would be the person who has my mind for I am nothing more than what is in my own mind. From here I determined that humanity is also nothing more than what is in the mind. Taking away the consciousness of a person would take away their very humanity as well as taking away their person from the body. A brain dead person no longer even exists in my view. The body does and the mind can reawaken, but at the time with no consciousness or thought possible, they are no longer the person they were before and also no longer share the traits of a human.I guess this is a big part of what makes be accept abortions on some level since I don't believe that a young fetus has the ability to think and therefore doesn't share the traits of a living human and nor has a person even been installed into the body yet since it is not conscious.

Replace coma with brain dead.Whether it knows if it is going to die or not is a red herring. The fetus still has a right to life. Simply because it hasn’t developed the consciousness to decide if it wants to live or die doesn’t mean that you can make the decision for the child. Infants wouldn’t care if they could live or die- frankly they don’t care of the matter. However, as mature persons, parents decide to allow their infant to live, because they know that there is an entire life for the infant to look upon, a life full of challenges, opportunities, and happiness. The fetus, whether awake or asleep, has the right to life.[/QUOTE]Why does it have the right to live. It is at a stage where it is living off a host. Why shouldn't the host be able to kill it? And should the fetus threaten the hosts life, why should the fetus's life be more important than the hosts?Well you can have that opinion but we all know it would be called an abomination or a monster. It sure wouldn't be considered human and wouldn't receive any medicare at that point.That is a good point. In the case of our monster though, it would still be part human IMO but surely not human. Besides, it would be looking to mate with giant hamsters at that point. I could any human babies would come from that.

Humans in vegetative stages (It est “Brain Dead“) are humans to by no doubt. How can you say that the being isn’t human? Because it doesn’t think? Why should that matter!Why do you have the right to live? Why do I? Why does anyone have a right to live? This question remains unanswered, but it is, again, a red herring. Simply because a child lives off of it’s mother doesn’t mean it’s not human and has no right to live. I lived of my parents when I was four, does that mean I am some tumor and have no right to live? Of course not. Another analogy, say somebody is alive in a hospital, but only because of life support. Does that make this person a tumor of the machines, and thus the mind of the machine, it est a doctor, can kill the human? Of course not. Doctors, but their own oath and law, have to do their best to keep somebody alive. As a matter of fact, the Hippocratic Oath says that Doctors cannot do abortive procedures. Even today Doctors are breaking their own oath and law to make more money. You are not “we”. You’re the one who’s all alone in this issue. See even you believe you have the right to call somebody a monster, and claim that this “monster” has no right to live. See where this is caving in?Your opinion does not matter scientifically speaking. In science, there is fact, and the fact of the matter is anyone who is genetically and biologically human is human, terminum. And no it wouldn’t be looking for other hamsters to mate, because it isn’t simply because of the Hamster’s mind that it decides to mate, it also has to do with the hormones in the body- humans have different hormones.This has been studied upon vigorously, and not conclusion has been made yet. Interesting point, however, this is irrelivant to the discussion. We arn’t debating about where you’re human, we’re debating about when you’re human, and you are human at the moment of conception and therefore by american law, have all the rights and privilages as any American, and in this case one right, and that right is the right that every single person on this earth has- the right to live. And that makes it not human, because it’s not equal to you? That, my friend, is sick. This is also the reason why most handicapped people are pro-life, because they know if Abortion stays legal, they’re next.

One question I wish to pose to the readers of this thread is one I've posed to myself before. If your consciousness were to be transferred from your brain to another person brain, which person would you be? Would you be the person who has your body or would you be the person who has your mind?I came to the conclusion that I would be the person who has my mind for I am nothing more than what is in my own mind. From here I determined that humanity is also nothing more than what is in the mind. Taking away the consciousness of a person would take away their very humanity as well as taking away their person from the body. A brain dead person no longer even exists in my view. The body does and the mind can reawaken, but at the time with no consciousness or thought possible, they are no longer the person they were before and also no longer share the traits of a human.I guess this is a big part of what makes be accept abortions on some level since I don't believe that a young fetus has the ability to think and therefore doesn't share the traits of a living human and nor has a person even been installed into the body yet since it is not conscious.

Hmm, well for one thing I'm stating my own views. Your views will differ. However, I believe that most people would say someone who is brain dead is not the same person they were when they were not brain dead. My jump to saying they are not even human is beyond what most people would believe in and I am not trying to make you believe this. I'm only stating my beliefs to show why I stand where I do on the issue of abortion.We have a right to live because we are human life. Why doesn't a chicken or cow going to slaughter have a right to live? They are not human life. Why is it alright to disconnect brain dead people from machines keeping them alive? Because they are no longer capable of survival anyways. Do you see where we as the living humans have a right to live more than a chicken or brain dead person? That is why I have a right to live and so do you. I hope this answers your question.An unborn child has every right to live. I don't deny this. However, until it has reached the stage where it can think, I believe abortions should be a choice given to the mother. I do think there should be better restrictions on this option than there is presently though.I can also see your twisting my words. I did say that if your completely dependant on your mother before birth, abortion should be an option. I didn't say that a four year old dependant on its mother should be legal to murder especially since that would go completely against my thinking debate and I'm sure you realized this when you wrote it. Please focus on more relevant topics in the future.You make the a point about machines supporting life. We have rules against a doctor simply killing a person without consulting family members. You realize fully that this is also against my belief that laws matter. So this is an off track argument as well. Anyways the patient is on those machines so it can get better presumably. He is also not brain dead. Both go against my thinking and laws view.Consider with the case of doctor abortions, the doctor is sometimes doing what is best for the 'patient'. The patient is not the fetus in the case of abortions. And if doctors didn't do these procedures, they would get done other ways which I'm sure you also don't agree with.Your just being over emotional here. You know that if a random scientist put a hamster brain in a human, protests would go on for miles in all directions to have the monstrocity destroyed. People even wanted that cloned baby destroyed if they could ever find it. Some people just dont like these 'altered' humans because they go against what God made us. I guess just to clarify here, would you accept the human with a hamster brain as an equal to you? Would you allow him on medicare and have him protected by our laws? It would be a mockery of our system of law. Also would you support not only the life of a cloned baby but also the act of cloning? Why not be for it? Cloning would only be making a human in your views I believe. How about genetic altering after that? Thats no different than making it be born/grown with a hamster brain, right?Hmm, you seem to be making up your own science here. You could use this logic against Gays though saying hormones from their body should tell them to go after women, but that doesn't work. Face it, a hamster brain will look for other hamsters just as a brain who looks for men will do so even if it isn't supposed to.Ah but we are debating what is human. Since I believe that without your mind you are not the same person, I can also take it a step further and say without your mind your not human, just as I said before. This leads me to the point where the unborn fetus is not a person until it has a mind and therefore in my view isn't human till it does. If you believe you would be a different person if you switched brains with someone else, then you have to accept you were not a person until you had a brain. The brain is your defining trait, not your body or DNA or anything else. The brain and thinking is what makes a person who they are. I think you will agree with this although you won't go as far as to say a brain makes you human.Hey, is a Dog a human or are you not equal to it? Is that sick? You just told another living thing that it is not equal to you and why? Because it looks different? Because it acts different? Because it thinks different? Well guess what, I could tell you that a human with a smashed face, no legs, and a hamster brain was not human and I bet you would say he is. Your basically going to have to say his DNA makes him what he is and not his mind or body. That means that sperm are life to you, an egg is life to you, and you are not under any circumstances going to agree with me no matter what.I'm not trying to get you to agree with me. I'm simply stating my points of view on why I don't believe in abortion and I want to people to actually think about the fact that a mind makes a person what they are. It isn't looks or DNA. These are traits that help shape who we are but our mind is who we really are. I bet if you had a child and your childs mind was switched with a dogs mind and you had the choice to keep only one of them, you would keep the dog because that is your child. To get rid of him would be cruel and the dog minded baby wouldn't ever be able to grow up and become a human baby anyways because it is a dog. If you don't accept this then I guess I would like to hear how you would come about making the decision that the dog brained child was yours.

He would be equal and should have all the rights and privileges. I disagree with cloning, but once a being is cloned he or she must be protected, even inside of the womb. Same goes for genetic alteration.l However, what does this have to do with the discussion- what is your point?ha! What a ludicrous statement! Have you taken Biology yet? Well if you did, or if you do take it, you will understand that sexual desires don’t always have to do with the mind. What a silly statement! Again, study Biology. You obviously have not taken any courses in it. As for you final statement, the difference between humans and animals is that humans genetically and biologically have free will, while animals rely on instinct to make decisions. This is what differs us. Although a person who is braindead cannot make decisions, he is still genetically part of the homo sapiens species and therefore is human. That is a good question, and honestly I don’t know how to answer it. However, this again is irrelevant. We arn’t asking where the fetus is human, we’re asking when it is human.

By scientific fact, yes, but how about in a more profound way? A dead guy is still human technically but he doesn't get protected by laws.Yes, simply because of that. I've stated my reasoning for this already.But the fetus is brain dead. I've covered this before as well.Well if your that fanatical then what if people started taking people from the grave and bringing them back to life as zombies? Would those be humans?

What exactly does this mean in terms of percentage? I'd like to hear this from a master of biology like yourself.Do you use biology to determine what is living or not? Is a virus living BTW? Is a sperm living? Is a sperm human? Why is the combination of an egg and sperm human to you? Please, use biology to back up your statements if you wish to focus on this.lol, well here is a good fact. Your focusing on the mind here as a defining trait of life. Interesting. So is an animal with a human brain human just as a human with an animal brain is human?It is relevant. I need to know why you should even have to determine which one is your child so I can further my point. Your childs body with a dog brain or a dog body with your childs brain?

*speaks patronistically*- that's because he's dead. Yes. Being gay is something that happens in the childhood. Whether or not the hamster-brained human goes after men or women, he cannot sexually function without hormones. Hormones are what give us sexual urges. A virus and sperm are living, but a sperm isn't human. The reason is because right then and there the zygote has a completely individual genetic code from the mother, right then and there the zygote begins to grow, and right then and there the zygote has a completely new future and plan for him or her prepared. As said before, I don't know. I'de probably choose the dog. But that doesn't make my dog a human, it still makes my son a dog. As awful as it sounds, it's true. My son would officially be a dog. However, he would get the rights and privilages of a human, as well as the human dog thing. It's a very complicated issue.

So this negates your science debate.This shows your waaaaaay further off in the belief of what is life than I am on my abortion beliefs. Can't say that I'm the only one here who has radically unaccepted ideas.This shows you believe you know more about people than science does. You make an absolute blanket claim that all gays are that because of childhood. You also make strange claim that hormones are going to change the brain patterns of a mammal. For instance, if human sextual hormones were put into a hamster, you would claim that hamster will suddenly become attracted to humans. That is idiotic.You once again go against science by claiming a virus is living. You also negate your own idea of human DNA being life by saying sperm is not human life. But I'll grant that this really isn't that important.So something that is not of human DNA nor human features and could not produce a human offspring and which would, in your opinion, be attracted to dogs, can suddenly become human enough to be under our laws and you would be more willing to accept it as your child than your own flesh, blood, and DNA child because the dog simply has the mind of your child. I'm glad you came to this decision because it is the exact point I've been trying to make all along. The mind is what makes us who we are as people. This is a cornerstone in my belief on how we can judge whether abortion should be practiced or not. It shows just how important our mind actually is to our existance. Before the mind, there is just a lump of DNA so killing that DNA doesn't kill a person, it kills an idea of a person. I agree the idea of killing a person is immoral, but your not actually murdering anything except the idea of life. Perhaps you disagree with me on the larger issue but at least we can meet on the common ground that the mind makes the person who they are.I think that pretty much ends my debate with you at least for this topic. I'll give you the final word if you wish.

No, because when you're dead, every thing in your body dies, including your genetic tissue, and DNA. It's all dead.What a silly discussion I'm having with you.

DNA is part of the definition of life. Nothing lives without it. That's why I'm hyping on the importance of DNA.I'll try to make it plain: Say, All the tissue in your body is Hardware.The information an organism's body sends- how to eat, how to photosythesize, is Software. Even skunk cabbages have software. The DNA is the blueprint for building the Hardware, and also for reading the Software.(I got this little allegory from somewhere I don't remember, and I know you'll find fault somewhere, AMD4EVER, cuz I know jack slap :( about technology and my memory sucks, so I had to improvise. But I hope you'll get what I'm trying to say)So would you say a computer isn't a computer just because it has malfunctioning software? Probably not. Computers malfunction all the time! We just fix them. A human with malfunctioning software is just malfunctioning.I know what you mean, without thought a human is kinda 'blah' . That human connection just isn't there. But what I'm saying is: he is still human life, he's just not functioning as the organism he was programmed to be. DNA is what makes you human. You think a person in a coma is out there, try talking to a human with no DNA! Have you ever wondered how a plant could photosythesize and be heliotropic with no eyes to see the sun and no brain to process information?Because it has DNA to tell them what to do. It knows how to function because it has a blueprint. An organisms blueprint is still useful until it dies and it's Hardware can no longer make use of it. (in other words the body dies.)Your definition of human life does not line up with modern science.Having a different brain doesn't make you less human. I know of someone with an autistic brain, an Alzheimer's afflicted brain, a partially damaged brain! I heard about a man who was stabbed in the brain! They are still human, they are still living.Everyone's insides are different. My inside is different from yours.Parcum's inside is different from mine, too. But we are all classified as human. Science doesn't classify the value of what's inside, that's the realm of philosophy and religion, science is what examines order and the way things are. For years, scientists have taught cell biology the way it is.Then, AMD4EVER comes along and disagrees with the central principle.Darling, I wish I had your gall. emoticonXSmilie If the Terminator were to commit murder and left a piece of himself at the crime scene, the forensics lab would not be able to provide a genetic profile. Metal doesn't have DNA. That's how we know he isn't human. He doesn't carry the blueprint. If a dog were to commit murder and had a piece of his fur left at the scene of the crime his DNA would be there. Forensic tests would show a dog had done it. They'd recognize a dog's blueprint..What I know tends to change based on the research and analysis of Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking, Jane Goodall, Aristotle and Galileo Galilei. I trust thier knowledge because they are people of wisdom They become wiser through understanding. I believe in study. I believe in bending over a microscope until your eyes cross and you start to look like a friggin' hunchback.I believe in doing whatever it takes and giving whatever you have for the sake of understanding. And I believe that right and wrong can be understood the same way we understand White Dwarves and cataracts.I am agaisnt abortion because based on study by Theodor Schwann and Jean Baptiste Lemarck, a living organism is a cellular, metabolizing organism. What you know shouldn't change if it's the truth.Yeah. Tell me about it. Let's see, we've covered biology, philosophy, geometry and computers & robots.

First off we were never even discussing anything except what human life was. Your post responding to this was almost completely about DNA. Why is it then that you say human DNA is not human life? I guess I'll ignore this even though I'm confused by what your intentions were.OK, well focusing on the guy in the coma, I'm not saying what if this or that. All I'm saying is that as of the moment he loses the ability to think, he is officially not a human. My definition of human requires the ability to think. I doubt he is viewed as the same person he was before he went into a coma. Something is just missing from him. I'm not saying lets pull the plug just because he isn't human right now because that would be like saying lets abort all babies before they gain the ability to think. It makes no sense especially with the technology we have today. If there is a chance to live, fine, take that chance and keep him alive. My only point is that the person isn't really human life at that point.The fetus potential is what I was speaking of when I mentioned morality. However, this doesn't affect the fact that the fetus isn't alive until it can think and until it gets to that point, I believe it is not moral but also not murder to abort the baby. No one can deny that it is immoral to do an abortion just for the fun of it but realistically the clump of DNA that the fetus is isn't even going to know that it has died. It never even had its first thought so it died without ever even living a human life.Lets be realistic. DNA does not make you human. If a human kept its entire body but somehow the brain of the person was made to be that of a hamster, would that be a human any longer? You may say it is but I believe it is partially what is in the mind that makes you what you are. If a human has the brain of a hamster, it is not a hamster, but it is surely not a human either. Even your quote "Human is a human" would be in agreement with this unless you stretch it a bit. If you believe a circle is a circle, then you cut out a small piece of the middle of one of the circles and replace it with a square, is that still the same circle as it was before? It has the same shape based on what it seems to be on the outside, but what is inside is different.Would the Terminator be a human because it looks like one? Would the Terminator with a human brain be a human because he both looks and thinks like one? Would the Terminator, if born of another human having its original skeleton and organs replaced with cold metal and given incredible strength be a human? What makes a human a human?Also I think I should point out that what you know can change over time. I didn't always agree with abortion until I had to question myself about why I didn't agree with it. What I thought I knew at that time isn't what I know now and what I know now changes almost every day. I would hope it is the same way for you.Wow, we really are starting to cover a lot of topics! This is interesting though. I look forward to your reply.

Definition of a computer: "A device that computes, especially a programmable electronic machine that performs high-speed mathematical or logical operations or that assembles, stores, correlates, or otherwise processes information."A 'computer' that has no ability to think is therefore not a computer. The same applies to humans IMO.To this I have to debate that the mind is what makes a person a person. Do you accept this view? If you had your mind in another body, would that body suddenly become your body and your previous body just someone elses body? Would your friends view your new body as the new you and your old body as someone else?If you accept this then you admit that DNA is not the defining trait of what makes a person a person. This is one step closer to accepting that a human is not a human if they are not a person. But before going deeper into this I need to know your response to the previous questions.This is an obvious point of confusion here. I'm not trying to say science supports my views. I wouldn't expect any scientist to make this sort of analysis because it would offend so many people. This is just my opinion that I'm stating.I never debated that hamsters weren't alive. I even said a fetus is alive, but it just isn't human life.I'm not even talking about brain damage here. I'm talking no brain at all or a completely different brain. No brain at all was my original focus so I'll revert back to that. How can they be human if they are brain dead? Is a dead human still a human until all its DNA dies off? What is the difference between a person who just died a moment ago and a brain dead person kept alive by machines who would die if off the machines? Why is one human and one not or if both are human, how long is a dead person still human?I don't disagree with biology. You can twist my words to do so but I'm not even talking biology, you are. I'm talking mental processes while you focus on DNA. I'm talking about how humans view each other and your talking about scientific analysis. I'm talking about stuff that isn't physical so how can I be going against biology if it is the study of what is physical? I think you have been getting my disagreements with you confused with my actual debate. My debate simply is that DNA is not the defining trait of what makes us human life. Sure DNA helps make us human, but it is what is in our minds that makes us human life. I'm debating that the definition of what makes human life goes beyond our cells and I doubt that the common biologist would disagree with this.I guess you didn't see the movie Terminator. In that movie, the Terminator had human skin as well as blood and all the physical features of a human other than he was a computer with metal infrustructure. To the common eye, he would be human.I think you answered most of my questions. You are still focusing purely on DNA defining what is human. This doesn't answer whether a Terminator with human DNA and a computer brain and metal skeleton can be human if it was never born. What if he had bones and just a computer brain, would he be human? What if he had a real brain and metal skeleton, would he be human? What if he had either of these implanted in him after his birth? Is there no limit to what is human as long as it has human DNA? Would a slight change in our DNA make us not human?You can accept the beliefs of others, but sometimes with questions such as those of aboriton you sometimes will have to question your own beliefs to find what you think is right.Abortion is a very complex issue. Going to have to cover a lot of different areas of knowledge to find a good answer to it.

DNA is part of the definition of life. Nothing lives without it. That's why I'm hyping on the importance of DNA.I'll try to make it plain: Say, All the tissue in your body is Hardware.The information an organism's body sends- how to eat, how to photosythesize, is Software. Even skunk cabbages have software. The DNA is the blueprint for building the Hardware, and also for reading the Software.(I got this little allegory from somewhere I don't remember, and I know you'll find fault somewhere, AMD4EVER, cuz I know jack slap :( about technology and my memory sucks, so I had to improvise. But I hope you'll get what I'm trying to say)So would you say a computer isn't a computer just because it has malfunctioning software? Probably not. Computers malfunction all the time! We just fix them. A human with malfunctioning software is just malfunctioning.I know what you mean, without thought a human is kinda 'blah' . That human connection just isn't there. But what I'm saying is: he is still human life, he's just not functioning as the organism he was programmed to be. DNA is what makes you human. You think a person in a coma is out there, try talking to a human with no DNA! Have you ever wondered how a plant could photosythesize and be heliotropic with no eyes to see the sun and no brain to process information?Because it has DNA to tell them what to do. It knows how to function because it has a blueprint. An organisms blueprint is still useful until it dies and it's Hardware can no longer make use of it. (in other words the body dies.)Your definition of human life does not line up with modern science.Having a different brain doesn't make you less human. I know of someone with an autistic brain, an Alzheimer's afflicted brain, a partially damaged brain! I heard about a man who was stabbed in the brain! They are still human, they are still living.Everyone's insides are different. My inside is different from yours.Parcum's inside is different from mine, too. But we are all classified as human. Science doesn't classify the value of what's inside, that's the realm of philosophy and religion, science is what examines order and the way things are. For years, scientists have taught cell biology the way it is.Then, AMD4EVER comes along and disagrees with the central principle.Darling, I wish I had your gall. emoticonXSmilie If the Terminator were to commit murder and left a piece of himself at the crime scene, the forensics lab would not be able to provide a genetic profile. Metal doesn't have DNA. That's how we know he isn't human. He doesn't carry the blueprint. If a dog were to commit murder and had a piece of his fur left at the scene of the crime his DNA would be there. Forensic tests would show a dog had done it. They'd recognize a dog's blueprint..What I know tends to change based on the research and analysis of Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking, Jane Goodall, Aristotle and Galileo Galilei. I trust thier knowledge because they are people of wisdom They become wiser through understanding. I believe in study. I believe in bending over a microscope until your eyes cross and you start to look like a friggin' hunchback.I believe in doing whatever it takes and giving whatever you have for the sake of understanding. And I believe that right and wrong can be understood the same way we understand White Dwarves and cataracts.I am agaisnt abortion because based on study by Theodor Schwann and Jean Baptiste Lemarck, a living organism is a cellular, metabolizing organism. What you know shouldn't change if it's the truth.Yeah. Tell me about it. Let's see, we've covered biology, philosophy, geometry and computers & robots. I'm havin' a ball emoticonXBouncer!and I've come to look forward to every reply.

Our disagreement is whether human life is defined by Mental activity or Biology.If you and I were to take out our brains we'd be dead because as more complex human organisms, we depend on the brain to help us survive. But the human fetus is at a lower stage of complexity. It has no brain because it doesn't need one yet. Because of it's genetic make-up it is a Homo Sapien.Because it's cells go through mitosis, it is alive. Because it requires nourishment and protection, and it grows, it is living.It is a living homo sapien  that does not compute.And I don't mean to irritate anyone, the reason I use scientific analysis to make a point so often because science is knowledge rather than opinion. Certain things are not matters of opinion. Like space travel or brain surgery you can't just believe, you have to know.I think abortion is a very important issue and just believing something is not good enough. As for the Terminator, he is really a hybrid between a homo sapien  and a machine.That's a whole 'nother issue.

Why is one human and one not or if both are human, how long is a dead person still human?"Just one question... if they are brain dead but not human then what are they? My sister was in a car accident and was kept alive by machines for 4 days, so are you trying to tell me that she wasn't human anymore because she was brain dead? Your brain is basically what keeps you alive,that is true, because without it your vital organs wouldn't work. Here is another example (and I realize that I am a little off the original topic)... my neice has a brain tumor, located inside her brain stem. If the tumor were to grow anymore, it would cause her brain stem to stop working and she would die. There isn't any getting around that, and if your brain ceases to function, you will die without life support (this was told to us by a neurologist at the National Institute of Health in Maryland). But I don't see how that doesn't make you 'human' anymore... I guess how long a dead human remains human is a matter of belief and opinion. ??

Computers are not capable of "thinking." Really they are more comparable to animals in that they have a set series of reactions depending on the stimuli or input. Please tell me where the word "think" is on that list anyway.A person who has their brain in someone else's body will NOT be the same "person." The brain alone isn't what determines the whole of a person's behavior. Hormones play just as big a factor as the brain does.If it's not supported by science then what exactly IS supporting it?First of all, you can't really say that DNA is alive, while it is self-replicating, it is not an organism by itself, so the term "alive" is not applicable. And besides, there are definite lines between when a person is alive and dead. There are no in-betweens. Either its a human, or its dead.If DNA doesn't determine that something is a human being, what does? I guess if you are talking about someone's personality, (and I'm assuming you are) then I would say that the brain isn't the only factor in determining that. Like I and others have said, the body's chemical functions as well as memories and environment are the major determining factors in someone's a personality.Exactly, a slight change (even something like a 2% difference) would cause ENOURMOUS changes, and would infact, not be a human. It would be something else. And the terminator would not be human. It would be a computer that looked like a human, and computers don't think remember?I would also like to comment on the issue of whether self awareness was a factor in determining whether it is a person or not: a person doesn't reach a very good grasp of their self existance or develop a real grounded ego until a few years later in its life from the pregnancy (around 5-6 years of age I think it was, I haven't read up on this stuff for a while ^^) anyway. Just another reason I don't think we should be able to judge based on their mental capabilities, or else we might have children being tossed aside at young ages afer pregnacy (if it doesn't already happen alot).

My questions were pointed at determining someones position on DNA meaning human life. I have no real position on this. However, I can answer your question.For your sister, I would say that if brain dead for 4 days, then in that 4 days she didn't share the characteristics of human life because she couldn't think. Once she could think again, she was human life again. To read more about why I believe this, just read my posts in this thread.Your neice is still human in my opinion as long as she has the ability to think. Being human is nothing more than having the ability to think. She can think therefore I don't have any disagreement with her being human.My question concerning a dead human was based on the person I'm debating saying DNA makes human life. Since DNA remains after death, are they still human at that point? This wouldn't be a matter of opinion to that person if they truely believe DNA is the sole thing that defines human life because without a doubt DNA does exist after death. I was just asking the question to see whether they would waver on their idea of DNA meaning human life or not.

Let us closely examine the phrase 'human life' shall we?If you found a corpse in the woods, how would you figure out what kind of corpse it was?By running a DNA test. If it has human DNA it is a dead human. Now for the life part: if something is composed of metabolizing cells that grow and require nourishment, it is living. Dead things don't have mitosis. Fetuses do. Dead things don't grow the way living things do: by replicating thier cells.I never said DNA wasn't the one  thing that defined human life. It defines your humanity but the functions of your cells are what determines whether your living or not.

Well since you joined in a little late, 'thinking' is what I'm debating as a cause for life. The computer analogy went along with that debate. Think in computer terms isn't 100% accurate but I'm sure you can figure out what I was saying. The computer is not a computer if it cannot think/compute therefore I debate that a human is not human if it cannot think/computer.Personally I'm not debating that behaviors play a role in what makes a person. I'm debating that their consciousness makes them a person. For instance, if your mind were to change bodies, would your consciousness change and replace the one that is currently there? My guess would be no although I could be wrong. So behavior will not change who that person is although it can change how they are viewed and may therefore change how they think. Still, they are the same person at the core with outer changes.Human opinion. What supports the idea of what is right and wrong? Science sure won't and what is right and wrong is pretty necessary for life on Earth. What if our mind is even wrong on what is right and wrong? Is the definition still correct or are we so flawed that some of our very basic ideas will lead to our failure?I can't say that DNA is alive. The person I'm debating is saying that. There are inbetweens as well. If a person is near dead but can still come back to life, I don't think we treat them as a dead person or label them as such. Also, would a sperm that just entered the egg be considered a dead human, a living human, something inbetween, or simply as a sperm that entered the egg and nothing more?I'm not talking personality. I'm talking consciousness. A personality simply changes how we are viewed. With a different personality, we are viewed as a different person but are literally the same person as before in my opinion.You just debated that DNA makes a human. If the terminator had human DNA and had also been born of two human parents and simply had his brain changed to a computer later in life, would he still be human? I think you will say yes to this. How about if his skeleton was changed to metal as well? Still yes or does marrow matter too much? What if he had no changes but was grown using synthetic DNA not of two different humans but shared all the same characteristics of a human and infact there was no proof that any scientist could find anywhere that said he wasn't human?Your definition of thinking must be different than my. Thinking is analysis of information. I believe that reacting requires thinking so bugs think. Computers have a program to run and I would say that they think. You are probably debating that consciousness is required to be labeled as thinking. Well assume that an EXACT copy of the human brain was put on a computer, would it be thinking then? What about a super advanced bioengineered brain not of human origin but organic nonetheless, would that be able to think given a replica of a human minds content?As said before in this debate, I'm not just talking mental capacity. Lets say your brain is thinking at our baseline 100%. At 3 years old lets say it was 70%. At 1 year old lets say 30%. At birth lets say 10%. A week before birth lets say 2% and a week before that .01%. I'm just guessing at these figures but my opinion is they all are alive! Even two weeks before birth or whenever actual thought is possible, a person exists. I cannot prove it is conscious at this point but it has crossed the level I'm willing to debate or make guesses at by this time. Until that is possible for the fetus to do, I debate it isn't alive. Now do I know when in the birth cycle thinking begins? No, and if someone does please post it. Very early on, I don't think a fetus is human life because it cannot think.

I guess if you are talking about someone's personality, (and I'm assuming you are) then I would say that the brain isn't the only factor in determining that. Like I and others have said, the body's chemical functions as well as memories and environment are the major determining factors in someone's a personality.Exactly, a slight change (even something like a 2% difference) would cause ENOURMOUS changes, and would infact, not be a human. It would be something else. And the terminator would not be human. It would be a computer that looked like a human, and computers don't think remember?I would also like to comment on the issue of whether self awareness was a factor in determining whether it is a person or not: a person doesn't reach a very good grasp of their self existance or develop a real grounded ego until a few years later in its life from the pregnancy (around 5-6 years of age I think it was, I haven't read up on this stuff for a while ^^) anyway. Just another reason I don't think we should be able to judge based on their mental capabilities, or else we might have children being tossed aside at young ages afer pregnacy (if it doesn't already happen alot).

So mitosis defines human life then? I guess I've been under the impression DNA is how you defined human life. Give me a list of what you think defines human life.

Let us closely examine the phrase 'human life' shall we?If you found a corpse in the woods, how would you figure out what kind of corpse it was?By running a DNA test. If it has human DNA it is a dead human. Now for the life part: if something is composed of metabolizing cells that grow and require nourishment, it is living. Dead things don't have mitosis. Fetuses do. Dead things don't grow the way living things do: by replicating thier cells.I never said DNA wasn't the one  thing that defined human life. It defines your humanity but the functions of your cells are what determines whether your living or not.

Sorry, I see your list nowBecause of it's genetic make-up it is a Homo Sapien.Because it's cells go through mitosis, it is alive. Because it requires nourishment and protection, and it grows, it is living.

Consider the terminator has the genetic make up of a homo sapien, its cells go through mitosis, and it requires nourishment, but has no brain at all and its bones are made of metal. This metal can expand and contract to meet the needs of the growing body and the head doesn't collapse. It uses a computer to give the body all the information it needs to continue staying alive. However it doesn't have the ability to have consciousness though, it cannot move, it cannot respond to anything, and it needs to depend on other people to feed it else it will die. Is it alive? How about if it has human bones and a computer brain? How about if it had a better computer brain and was capable of all human activity? How about if it had a metal skeleton and a hamster brain? How about if the brain was genetically altered to be not of this world by aliens and the result was something that didn't alter the DNA but changed everything that made it look human or act human?I ask these questions to get a better idea of where you stand. Could you please answer each one. Also, why not test my views as well by asking tough questions like do I think a brain in the vat is human or if I would convict someone of murder for making someone else brain dead?

Our disagreement is whether human life is defined by Mental activity or Biology.If you and I were to take out our brains we'd be dead because as more complex human organisms, we depend on the brain to help us survive. But the human fetus is at a lower stage of complexity. It has no brain because it doesn't need one yet. Because of it's genetic make-up it is a Homo Sapien.Because it's cells go through mitosis, it is alive. Because it requires nourishment and protection, and it grows, it is living.It is a living homo sapien  that does not compute.And I don't mean to irritate anyone, the reason I use scientific analysis to make a point so often because science is knowledge rather than opinion. Certain things are not matters of opinion. Like space travel or brain surgery you can't just believe, you have to know.I think abortion is a very important issue and just believing something is not good enough. As for the Terminator, he is really a hybrid between a homo sapien  and a machine.That's a whole 'nother issue.

Yes. It is alive. It is a living thing. It is a hybrid. A new species. It probably would be protected by law because it lives and it would be the only one of it's kind (I'm assuming.)There are laws protecting orchids and certain species of seashell, so the federal government would think nothing of passing a protective law for a new human hybrid. It would only be capable of all human activity with the right hormones. and chemicals and etc.So assuming it had the right hormones and was capable of all human activity: crying, blushing, eating for the sake of eating rather than nourishment, picking fights, player-hating, using sorry pick-up lines, and all that jazz, I would say it was human. If it had human organs and and skin and all that, it would be a hamster-human-android hybrid. Also a new species also protected by law. Although, i have no idea how something like that would mate.The DNA is everything that makes it look and act human. The DNA is what determines when puberty starts, how it starts, it determines the way you look. DNA determines the biological make-up of a human.Speaking of aliens, do you realize if a simple microscopic organism were found on Mars tomorrow, scientists would pee thier pants with excitement because we will have discovered life on Mars. Well, would you convict a person who caused brain death? Would you convict a man who killed a woman who was 3 weeks pregnant?Would you arrest the hamster-human-Terminator hybrid if it committed murder? Rape? Theft? Parked in the yellow zone? After all he has no brain, would he get away with hurting someone?Do you believe that someone whose brain was closer to nonactivity is less alive than someone whose brain is fully functional?Is a toddler less human than me?What about a newborn? Newborns depend on others to keep them alive. Say a child was born prematurely and needed machines to survive and needed someone to feed them, and did not respond to light or touchand was not fully concious? Is the baby dead even though it digests it's food?

I don't understand why you add hybrids into some of these things if only the mind is being changes. The human with a computer or hamster brains till meets your requirements for what makes it a human. Why is it still not completely 100% human if all these things are met? Should you be adding the mind to your list?As for my alien example, I should have been more clear and said that the aliens gave the human something that would override its DNA yet the DNA would remain. Also, assuming the universe goes to infinity, there is a very good chance that life exists on other planets. Who knows if it goes to infinity though. Big Bang would suggest not and the God theory would suggest only human life exists. Perhaps they are both right and aliens probably don't exist.--Well, would you convict a person who caused brain death? Assuming you mean convict them of murder, I couldn't call it murder but if it were up to me it would be an exact equivilant to murder if it was done intentially and the exact equivilant to manslaughter if not done intentionally. Regardless if the human life is even dead in this case, the person is dead. Perhaps some conditions can be made for if the person ever wakes up though.--Would you convict a man who killed a woman who was 3 weeks pregnant?Assuming you mean double murder, yes I would. This is playing more to the idea that there was a right of ownership here and the ownership were talking about is one human child. The parents were the owners of what would have been a child and therefore I would say it could be treated like a murder of a child. Why it isn't murder when abortion occurs is because the parents are giving up ownership of this unborn child on their own. Should the father be able to accuse a woman of murder if she has an abortion without telling him? Yes, I believe this should be an important restriction on abortion assuming the woman is married to the man. If not, he has no ownership rights.--Would you arrest the hamster-human-Terminator hybrid if it committed murder? Rape? Theft? Parked in the yellow zone? The hamster minded human would be put down in my view. It is a monster. It doesn't fall under our laws at all so if someone were to kill it, they wouldn't be charged with murder although if someone had a claim to the hamster brained human they could be charged with destruction of property. Even in the case of creating a monster we have to deal with things in a civilized mannor. However, the monster would not fall under our laws. Now why is he a monster even though I should be considering him a hamster? He is hamster life. However the definition of the monster is more than just the make up of the mind. It is kind of like a mutt dog. It is a mix of things that don't make up a specific species. The hamster life is more of an idea while the monster is a physical description of it. Would a human mind in a hamster be a monster? Absolutely. Physically it is a monster. Mentally it is human. Should it be put down? Because it is still part human it would not be put down but it wouldn't be given anything more than animal rights at that point. Put it in a cage and keep it locked up until it either dies or is able to be put back in a human body. Putting it under our laws would be a mockery of the system. How about a terminator mind in a human body? As long as it is under the control and ownership of a human and follows the laws of humanity, it is nothing more than a tool. How about if the computer running it is an exact copy of a specific human consciousness? Then it is now human. It simply has tools built onto it to give it more strength and eternal life inside a mechanical body. People are afraid of seeing this sort of day come but I would welcome it and would gladly transfer my mind to a machine if it meant eternal life and a better body. How about a genetically altered human? As long as it doesn't go too far and make it extremely dangerous, it is human. If it is given longer life or immunity to all disease or the ability to look straight at the sun without consequence, it is an evolved human physically and a human life as well. Completely human. This is one place we would part ways I'm sure.--After all he has no brain, would he get away with hurting someone?I wouldn't protect him under our laws other than he could be a possession. A human would likely be held accountable for the terminators actions and therefore they would be accused of accessory to murder or maybe they would be considered the murderer.--Do you believe that someone whose brain was closer to nonactivity is less alive than someone whose brain is fully functional?Tough one and one I've had to think about. Glad you brought it up. To add another belief I've determined at this time, human life is an evolving process. The mind is human life so as the mind evolves, human life evolves as well. Would someone almost brain dead be able to enjoy the same mental/human life as someone who is in perfect health and has a functioning mind? Absolutely not. Your question focuses more on being alive and I know you don't simply mean alive. I agree a fetus is alive, although not necessarily human. Change alive to human life, then the answer to your question is yes. Change alive to human, then the answer is no. To be human requires characteristics be met. It is more of a yes or no question and to say someone is more human than someone else means there must be different brackets of what humans are and therefore we are talking a decision tree (think of Windows Explorer...C:\ is the first category then there are many other options below). For an example here, lets use the color Green. There is light green, dark green, and standard green. Thinking of this based on a decision tree, would something be more green than others? For one thing, they are all under the category of Green just as all humans are under the category of Human. Under the category of Green there are more categories. How do we determine which one means more Green? Determining which is more green than the others is based on how much green is in each one. With humans however, what makes a human human is a large combination of factors that includes but is not limited to the human life within. This is something I'm realizing more and more through our debate. Is the DNA of one human superior while the mind inferior? Is the human physcially made superior? So there would be a large mess of different categories below human but deciding what makes someone more human than another would take a lot of work and wouldn't be more than opinion so everyone would have a different order of what type of human is the most human. Some would debate those on the top need genetic altering while others say anyone who isn't genetically altered is at the top. Were humans meant to be stupid? If so, they are at the top. Were humans meant to live only 20 years and die of cancer? Then they are at the top. So you see, it isn't necessarily the best ones that would be the most humans.--Is a toddler less human than me?Not less human as in a characteristics and physical sense. All characteristics are met for both therefore both are human. Human life, one is more evolved.--What about a newborn? Newborns depend on others to keep them alive. Again, both equally human but a newborn is not evolved human life.--Say a child was born prematurely and needed machines to survive and needed someone to feed them, and did not respond to light or touchand was not fully concious? Is the baby dead even though it digests it's food?Another very good question. Conscious is still necessary for human life in my opinion. So if the parents chose to take him off the machines, I don't accuse them of murder. However, there should be restrictions on drastic decisions such as this as there should be for abortions. With our technology, we can let the machines do their work till human life forms. Does this make us responsible for making this life possible? Touchy subject, since would we want to try and save every baby that is going to be miscariaged if we could? They would grow up to be unhealthy in all likelihood. So judgments such as this have to be made and doctors would suddenly become part of the group that has the rights to help make this life possible, not just the parents. Still, it isn't human life till it is conscious IMO.

I don't see why you say that a person who is unconscious is not human. Ok then, what exactly IS it? Is it a mouse? an elephant? a ball of playdough?What do you mean by putting your "mind" in another body? There isn't some soul or essence you can just stick into a nother person's body. Clarify if you would please.Oh? I thought we were debating on whether an unconscious person was a human being or not? If a person is NEAR DEAD, that would imply that they are not yet dead i.e. still alive. A sperm that has just entered an egg is a living organism, have you even studied biology in school yet? How can something that just formed be considered dead?You may be the same organism, but if your personality changes then you are not the same person. Patients that are given lobotomies are not the same person they were before they had the operation in my view. You are also not the same person you were yesterday, or even five minutes ago the way I understand it.I don't think it would be a human, It would be an amazing recreation of one, but I wouldn't call it real because it had a computer brain. I would call the last example you gave a person however.Reacting in no way recquires thinking. You do know that almost all animals' minds exist almost entirely at the unconscious level? Almost everything they do is based on impulse and recquires little to no thought. This is exactly how computers work. Its given a task and reacts on it based on how its programmed to perform it. It can't make spontaneous decisions on anything, its all based on its program. Humans however, are capable of real cognitive thought because we posess a frontal lobe. I don't know if I would consider the human brain put on a computer to be really thinking in the same sense that a real brain does, because it would still be running off of inorganic hardware. I don't think it is fair that you can determine that a fetus who is not yet conscious not alive. It will eventually become able to do so, so I think it has every right that any other person has. I do draw the line however, at a person who has become braindead and has no hope for becoming conscious again and being hooked up to a machine for however long it can keep its body alive. In the case of a fetus, it has not even been given a chance to develop and grow so you are killing a real person if you decide to abort it. Just my 2 cents.

Well since you joined in a little late, 'thinking' is what I'm debating as a cause for life. The computer analogy went along with that debate. Think in computer terms isn't 100% accurate but I'm sure you can figure out what I was saying. The computer is not a computer if it cannot think/compute therefore I debate that a human is not human if it cannot think/computer.Personally I'm not debating that behaviors play a role in what makes a person. I'm debating that their consciousness makes them a person. For instance, if your mind were to change bodies, would your consciousness change and replace the one that is currently there? My guess would be no although I could be wrong. So behavior will not change who that person is although it can change how they are viewed and may therefore change how they think. Still, they are the same person at the core with outer changes.Human opinion. What supports the idea of what is right and wrong? Science sure won't and what is right and wrong is pretty necessary for life on Earth. What if our mind is even wrong on what is right and wrong? Is the definition still correct or are we so flawed that some of our very basic ideas will lead to our failure?I can't say that DNA is alive. The person I'm debating is saying that. There are inbetweens as well. If a person is near dead but can still come back to life, I don't think we treat them as a dead person or label them as such. Also, would a sperm that just entered the egg be considered a dead human, a living human, something inbetween, or simply as a sperm that entered the egg and nothing more?I'm not talking personality. I'm talking consciousness. A personality simply changes how we are viewed. With a different personality, we are viewed as a different person but are literally the same person as before in my opinion.You just debated that DNA makes a human. If the terminator had human DNA and had also been born of two human parents and simply had his brain changed to a computer later in life, would he still be human? I think you will say yes to this. How about if his skeleton was changed to metal as well? Still yes or does marrow matter too much? What if he had no changes but was grown using synthetic DNA not of two different humans but shared all the same characteristics of a human and infact there was no proof that any scientist could find anywhere that said he wasn't human?Your definition of thinking must be different than my. Thinking is analysis of information. I believe that reacting requires thinking so bugs think. Computers have a program to run and I would say that they think. You are probably debating that consciousness is required to be labeled as thinking. Well assume that an EXACT copy of the human brain was put on a computer, would it be thinking then? What about a super advanced bioengineered brain not of human origin but organic nonetheless, would that be able to think given a replica of a human minds content?As said before in this debate, I'm not just talking mental capacity. Lets say your brain is thinking at our baseline 100%. At 3 years old lets say it was 70%. At 1 year old lets say 30%. At birth lets say 10%. A week before birth lets say 2% and a week before that .01%. I'm just guessing at these figures but my opinion is they all are alive! Even two weeks before birth or whenever actual thought is possible, a person exists. I cannot prove it is conscious at this point but it has crossed the level I'm willing to debate or make guesses at by this time. Until that is possible for the fetus to do, I debate it isn't alive. Now do I know when in the birth cycle thinking begins? No, and if someone does please post it. Very early on, I don't think a fetus is human life because it cannot think.

A mixture of two different species is called a hybrid. If you gave a human a hamster arm and leg it would be a hamster-human-hybrid.It has mixed parts so it's a hybrid. If it has Homo Sapien DNA it is a Homo Sapien, the other criteria defines a living creature. Something that goes through mitosis is alive. It is not 100% human because it's brain cells are hamster cells. Perhaps the computer minded human should be called human, after all it is considered murder to remove life support from a comatose human. Do you mean if the aliens used a human body formed by DNA but gave the body a brain that functioned without DNA?Aliens do exist. I am an alien.If the perpetrator kills someone who is pregnant but not married, should the fetus be counted as a murder, seeing as how the sole owner of the fetus is dead?Why do you say the definition of a monster is more than the make-up of the mind but you say human life isn't more than the make-up of the mind?And how would a human father and a human mother make something that was not human? If it has a human mind it has emotion, it may even feel love, putting it in a cage would be cruel and unjust it would be an even bigger mockery of the justice system, it should be treated as human because having a mind, it has a conscience and it knows right from wrong.It is a sentient being-part human part hamster. It is alive because it metabolizes and goes through mitosis, but a human mind is not what adds the human to the hamster it is the possesion of human cells. You seem to have overlooked the fact that the human brain is also made of metabolizing cells and it contains DNA.The fetus couldn't grow a brain if it didn't have cells. The fetus is what you have before the brain develops. If you have the fetus you have the brain eventually.Saying a fetus is a non-human object is like saying a tomato seed is not a part of the family Solanaceae. You say it is an evolved human. The fetus is a different stage of humanity. It has no brain, but it has mitosis, it has growth and it has Homo Sapien DNA. It is a type of human that does not require a brain. Why have something you don't need?What makes the mind human life?

Newborns and toddlers brains aren't as developed as an adults, but they are just as human as an adult. Newborns do depend on others to keep them alive, but they grow and develop and eventually become dependent on themselves. It does not make them any less human. That is a part of human life.. that's pretty much how it is for most anything that is living.Premies, as you know, are often born before their brains have fully developed. They need machines to survive until their bodies finish developing to the point where they would have been born normally. If you are asking if they are 'dead', why would doctors go to the lengths that they do to keep them alive? My youngest neice weighed a pound when she was born and she was on machines for the first 5 months of her life.. today she is 3 and she is right on time with her development.. I never heard any doctors make the comment that she was 'dead' because she didn't respond immediately...

This is in response to the original question: 'when is the fetus alive?'At the moment of conception, it is called a zygote. At about 4 weeks after conception, it becomes an embryo. At 6 weeks after conception is when the heart forms and starts to beat. It is at this stage when other organs begin to form. At 10 weeks, fingers and toes form, and the nervous system becomes responsive and the organs formed at 6 weeks begin to function. It is at 14 weeks that it becomes a fetus. By the time it becomes a fetus, all its vital organs are working and it is responsive and moves. So if the question is when is it actually alive, scientifically (or medically), it is at about the 4th week after after conception, because it is at this point that the placenta forms, and it gets its nourishment from the mother. FYI: abortions can be done up to 24 weeks after conception.Hope this helps! If there are any more questions about that, I will be happy to answer more and I can post some links.

I thought I'd start a new thread for those newcomers who don't want to be shocked by sick minded nazi XXXX.Anyway... When are fetuses really alive, and how many fetuses are actually aborted (murdered) before that time?

FYI: A person who is declared brain dead is legally dead. Brain death is irreversible loss of all functions of the brain... once they are brain dead, they will never regain those functions. However, a person who is brain dead, and on the use of machines, is still 'alive', because the heart still beats, blood still flows, and vital organs are still functioning, but they would not survive off the machines. If death and brain death were identical and equivalent terms, there would be no use for the term 'brain dead' or 'brain death'.

So if the question is when is it actually alive, scientifically (or medically), it is at about the 4th week after after conception, because it is at this point that the placenta forms, and it gets its nourishment from the mother. FYI: abortions can be done up to 24 weeks after conception.Hope this helps! If there are any more questions about that, I will be happy to answer more and I can post some links.

An unconscious human is simply a human body.Putting mind in another body is meant to be taken literally.I'm using DNA to compare life and death in that paragraph.A person can be defined two ways. #1-person = how other people view them. This is the one you talked about. #2-person = their own consciousness. That is the way I define it. Therefore changing a personality doesn't change the person in my view.Change thinking to computing if you wish. That should solve our disagreement there. In my view, computing is thinking but obviously our opinions differ leaving a level of miscommunication.Obviously we still disagree on abortion. This is to be expected since these were our original views. Hopefully with the debate over we at least better understand our views.

I don't see why you say that a person who is unconscious is not human. Ok then, what exactly IS it? Is it a mouse? an elephant? a ball of playdough?What do you mean by putting your "mind" in another body? There isn't some soul or essence you can just stick into a nother person's body. Clarify if you would please.Oh? I thought we were debating on whether an unconscious person was a human being or not? If a person is NEAR DEAD, that would imply that they are not yet dead i.e. still alive. A sperm that has just entered an egg is a living organism, have you even studied biology in school yet? How can something that just formed be considered dead?You may be the same organism, but if your personality changes then you are not the same person. Patients that are given lobotomies are not the same person they were before they had the operation in my view. You are also not the same person you were yesterday, or even five minutes ago the way I understand it.I don't think it would be a human, It would be an amazing recreation of one, but I wouldn't call it real because it had a computer brain. I would call the last example you gave a person however.Reacting in no way recquires thinking. You do know that almost all animals' minds exist almost entirely at the unconscious level? Almost everything they do is based on impulse and recquires little to no thought. This is exactly how computers work. Its given a task and reacts on it based on how its programmed to perform it. It can't make spontaneous decisions on anything, its all based on its program. Humans however, are capable of real cognitive thought because we posess a frontal lobe. I don't know if I would consider the human brain put on a computer to be really thinking in the same sense that a real brain does, because it would still be running off of inorganic hardware. I don't think it is fair that you can determine that a fetus who is not yet conscious not alive. It will eventually become able to do so, so I think it has every right that any other person has. I do draw the line however, at a person who has become braindead and has no hope for becoming conscious again and being hooked up to a machine for however long it can keep its body alive. In the case of a fetus, it has not even been given a chance to develop and grow so you are killing a real person if you decide to abort it. Just my 2 cents.

But in your view there shouldn't be a hybrid. You didn't even mention a mind as an organ that determined species. Consider a hamster consciousness in a human mind, does that make it a hybrid?Your question basically asks if a person burnt down my house and killed me, should they be charge with just murder or should the burning down of the house matter as well even though the owner is dead?Human life = human consciousnessHuman = human life + body + existance + DNA! + etcThat is why human life can exist without a human being.Basically your saying I'm using a double standard. Your right as well. There simply is no good answer to the human brain inside a hamster that I can think of. It is a monster yet it is human life. What to do with it? I honestly don't know so you stumped me.Your right, the fetus is a different stage of human, but not human life which is what I'm focused on.Its human consciousness does.With that, I must say that I'm finished with this debate although I encourage those I debated with to give their final responses to my posts. I'm happy with the results which far exceeded my expectations. A lot of intellegent debate was put forth here in the past week and I am glad to say that I now have a better understanding of my views on this issue. Many of my ideas have evolved and changed and it will take a while to digest all that I have learned from this debate. To everyone in this debate, thanks for all the feedback and I hope the debate carries on and helps challenge and influences the ideas of many other people.

A mixture of two different species is called a hybrid. If you gave a human a hamster arm and leg it would be a hamster-human-hybrid.It has mixed parts so it's a hybrid. If it has Homo Sapien DNA it is a Homo Sapien, the other criteria defines a living creature. Something that goes through mitosis is alive. It is not 100% human because it's brain cells are hamster cells. Perhaps the computer minded human should be called human, after all it is considered murder to remove life support from a comatose human. Do you mean if the aliens used a human body formed by DNA but gave the body a brain that functioned without DNA?Aliens do exist. I am an alien.If the perpetrator kills someone who is pregnant but not married, should the fetus be counted as a murder, seeing as how the sole owner of the fetus is dead?Why do you say the definition of a monster is more than the make-up of the mind but you say human life isn't more than the make-up of the mind?And how would a human father and a human mother make something that was not human? If it has a human mind it has emotion, it may even feel love, putting it in a cage would be cruel and unjust it would be an even bigger mockery of the justice system, it should be treated as human because having a mind, it has a conscience and it knows right from wrong.It is a sentient being-part human part hamster. It is alive because it metabolizes and goes through mitosis, but a human mind is not what adds the human to the hamster it is the possesion of human cells. You seem to have overlooked the fact that the human brain is also made of metabolizing cells and it contains DNA.The fetus couldn't grow a brain if it didn't have cells. The fetus is what you have before the brain develops. If you have the fetus you have the brain eventually.Saying a fetus is a non-human object is like saying a tomato seed is not a part of the family Solanaceae. You say it is an evolved human. The fetus is a different stage of humanity. It has no brain, but it has mitosis, it has growth and it has Homo Sapien DNA. It is a type of human that does not require a brain. Why have something you don't need?What makes the mind human life?

Murdering a pregnant woman is counted as a double murder.The burning of a house isn't called murder. It's called arson. I have a question, Carman, why is a single-celled organism (like a paramecium or amoeba) counted as life while a single celled organism that posesses human DNA is called non-living?

"Murdering a pregnant woman is counted as a double murder.The burning of a house isn't called murder. It's called arson"If you burn a house down intentionally and there are people inside who die, that's manslaughter... unless you burn down the house KNOWING that the people are inside, and then it's murder.Murdering a pregnant woman is considered double murder in some states (called fetal homicide). It is sort of a double standard I guess, that you can convict someone of that, but not convict a woman for murder for having an abortion. Right now the difference is that the woman chose to have the pregnany terminated, whereas if she was murdered that was not her choice. It's a weird thing...

"You are considered born once your heart starts beating and you exit your mothers stomach."A fetus's heart begins beating 6 weeks after conception. It isn't until around 40 weeks that it is born. And it doesn't exit the mother's stomach, by the way... it isn't in the stomach to begin with.

You are considered born once your heart starts beating and you exit your mothers stomach. The Fetus is not alive yet, so its not murder. Abortion should not be abused, but there are cases when it should either be used, or the woman should have the right to choose1.If it threatens her live2.If it threatens the child's life3.If the child risks sever health problems4.If she cannot afford to have a child, and the child can't be adopted5.If she lives in China and already has a kidThere would be other reason. Having an abortion because "I changed my mind I dont want a kid", that would mean, its too late. You already have decided.

"I have a question, Carman, why is a single-celled organism (like a paramecium or amoeba) counted as life while a single celled organism that posesses human DNA is called non-living?"An embryo is a living organism. If you are asking at what point does it become human, that would just depend on what you believe I guess. Biologists have been debating over that for a long time, and don't have an agreement on it. Some say its not, some say it is. But it definitely is a living thing.
