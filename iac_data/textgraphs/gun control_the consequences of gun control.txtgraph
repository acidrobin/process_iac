Gun control in repressive regimes. What an example! Let's get some stats on modern countries. That looks great, but every nation you named was or still is a repressive regime seeking to destroy all opposition to itself. Canada has gun control in place. Crime rates are far lower in proportion to our country.

Broker, in the past, Americans have had MUCH easier access to firearms, and yet we have, on the whole, suffered significantly fewer casualties. I do not believe your "safer" argument is legitimate.

Broker, I really thought you would be opposed to gun control.How do you think Hitler started off? Slowly by making minor changes here and there, he took total control! Then made it seem okay to do what he was doing. Like I have said a few times before: We illegalized, drugs. Who has the drugs? If we have gun control, the same people will end up having guns. I'm not a criminal, and I live in an area where it is illegal to own a gun. I know people who live in this area who own guns, and even though it is a good neighborhood, there is still a chance of someone breaking into my house. He or she may have a gun, but if they see me standing there with a gun that I own LEGALLY, they will think, "if she shoots me, she won't be in any trouble, and she if fearing for her life so if I don't run right now, she may shoot", and they will probrobly run.

Canada has strict gun control...never said they didn't have lots of guns. Their crime rates are far lower. Gun control in the UK probably would be a bad idea. Those statistics are probably mainly driven by the religious tensions. Hitler was supported by the German people.

I think I understand what Broker is saying. Canada has a high rate of gun ownership, but stricter gun-control laws than the US. An adult who wants to own a gun in Canada has to apply for a license. To get a license to own a firearm you have to do the following:1) Take and pass a mandatory firearms safety course.2) Have no history of violence, drug abuse, or attempted suicide3) Pass a criminal background check4) Two people who have known you for atleast three years must sign a statement saying that you are not a threat to public safety.5) The Chief Firearms Officer of the province you live in will review your application for a firearms license and decide if you are qualified to own a gun. 6) It usually takes about three months to process an application.http://www.firearmscanada.com/faq.html Do you think that the US should have the same requirements for gun ownership? Canada has a lower gun-death rate than the US.

Criminals get guns from strawman purchases. When someone with no criminal record legaly buy a gun to sell to a "friend" with a criminal record.They people who sell criminals guns do not just do it once, they do it again and again. Some of the guns used in Colombine were obtained this way. The seller knowingly sold them to minors and got less that 6 months in jail.Many times these people are not even prosecuted, will still have clean records, and will continue to buy and sell guns to "friends".If your serious about stopping availibility of guns to criminals, then these people should go into the slammer for a long long long time.http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontl...ocon/guns.html

If the legal and justice system was serious about stopping firearm crimes, then "strawmen" men should be put away for a long time.The laws already exist manking this act illegal.. They are not being enforced. The punishments far to lax.It is possible to drastically reduce the criminal supply of firearms without passing new laws or restricting the freedoms of God fearing law abiding citizens.

The Nazi party enjoyed a lot of popular support. Hitler was a very persuasive speaker and good at using propaganda to further his political aims. The Nazis were voted into office. Then they and their allies passed a law which made Hitler a dictator. The Nazis did not pass any gun-control laws until several years after they had gained complete control of Germany. Gun-control had nothing to do with Hitler's rise to power.http://www.guncite.com/gun_control_gcnazimyth.html

I have to agree with Tim about the Nazis... according to guncite.com (see Tim's link), Germany's gun control laws were instituted to control the private militias, for instance, the Nazi party's Brownshirts. Guns actually wouldn't have stopped Hitler, the people were thouroughly deceieved. Just read the stories about how German youth fought our fighting men. Not pretty. I also have to agree with Maynard to a degree. America is fundamentally different from other nations, and while there are helpful examples for both sides (Canada and Switzerland) I believe it boils down to what has historically worked for us.

Even if stats proved that Canada's gun laws lowered crime, what works for Canada isn't necessarily going to work for us.

Very good point wjim but I want to drain the water from the Canada argument and leave it dry. If no statistics saying that Canada's strict gun laws lowered crime then the argument is dry and useless. So far I have found statistics that say gun control results in a rise in crime. No one has disputed this with statistics.FACT: Gun control raises crime.or do you have proof saying the oppositeIf not then the argument saying gun control would lower crime is invalid.Agreed?

Its amazing how fast the Gun Control crowd vacates the scene after the water is let out of their argument. I dont blame them, if they looked at the stats from the U.K. I would avoid these threads also.I also have more on the Canadian gun registry.On Dec. 3 2002 Auditor General Sheila Fraser realeased this:"This (the gun registry) is certainly the largest overrun we've ever seen in this office."Introduced in 95 it had a promised net cost of $2 million (Canadian) now it is going to cost over a billion according to the Auditor General.And to speed the registry up, the audit found that those in charge of the registry have not even been doing background checks on alot of the people. If yall want more ask I got more on this just dont feel like putting it all down, I feel as though I am beating a dead horse.

As for myself, I have serious concerns about research done by Lott."Lott has been unable to provide evidence to back up his claim that 98% of defensive gun uses don't involve the firing of the weapon. When questioned Lott has changed his story several times about where he got the 98% statistic from. The validity of other statistics in his book are also in question because he didn't control for such factors as poverty and drug use. David Mustard, co-author of Lott's study, admitted under oath in Klein v. Mustard that the study left out certain variables which are relevant to the crime rate. Gary Kleck, a pro-gun advocate and researcher, commented on this '[More]likely, the declines in crime, coinciding with relaxation of carry laws were largely attributable to other factors not controlled for in the Lott and Mustard analysis'(Targeting Guns; p. 372).While the case against Lott may not be as strong as the case against Bellesiles, enough questions have been raised about Lott's book that it would be wise to refrain from relying too much on his research."http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg...stomer-reviews

So do Ludwig and Cook. One problem, they really could not find anything wrong with it. They only "THINK" someting is wrong with it. There maybe something wrong with it, but "thinking someting is wrong" and actually being wrong are two different things.Bellesiles is most definately a liar and there is no debate or confusion about it.

They consist now of the whole people, except a few public officers."145 * Virginia Constitution, Art. I, Sec. 13 (1776): "That a well-regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defense of a free State; that standing armies, in time of peace, should be avoided, as dangerous to liberty...." * Richard Henry Lee: "To preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them ....

What is the consequence of gun control? Anti-gunners forget that the United States is the FIRST government to be established based on laws and the rights of common men. Before that you had kings control and own everything; the people, the property, everything. Anti-gunners forget that.Two years of freedom, before that, thousands of years of kings! More people have lived under tyranny of kings than have lived free. The Constitution was designed with hard learned lessons of thousands of years of living under kings. Anti-gunners forget that. They are giving away or taking away hard won freedoms. In the case of lawyers, they are giving it away for MONEY!"Even more ominously, the suits demonstrate how a pressure group can employ litigation to attempt an end run around democracy [...]"Anti-gunners are trying to trash democracy, bottom line.My $.02

Kelvin,I agree with everything you have said here except 1. We are a representative REPUBLIC that utilizes democratic principals. Pure democracy is a tyranny of the majority. Benjamin Franklin said it best:"Democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch.

What is the consequence of gun control? Anti-gunners forget that the United States is the FIRST government to be established based on laws and the rights of common men. Before that you had kings control and own everything; the people, the property, everything. Anti-gunners forget that.Two years of freedom, before that, thousands of years of kings! More people have lived under tyranny of kings than have lived free. The Constitution was designed with hard learned lessons of thousands of years of living under kings. Anti-gunners forget that. They are giving away or taking away hard won freedoms. In the case of lawyers, they are giving it away for MONEY!"Even more ominously, the suits demonstrate how a pressure group can employ litigation to attempt an end run around democracy [...]"Anti-gunners are trying to trash democracy, bottom line.My $.02

Well, read the law carefully. It clearly distinguishes between the organized militia and the unorganized militia.http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/script...tle=10&sec=311 As the courts have interpreted it, the second amendment refers to a well regulated militia which is the organized militia. "Wilbur Hale appeals his conviction of thirteen counts of possession of a machine gun pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. ?922(o) (West Supp. 1992) and three counts of possession of unregistered firearms pursuant to 26 U.S.C. ?5861(d) (1988). He argues....that the indictment violates his Second Amendment right to bear arms....we cannot conclude that the Second Amendment protects the individual possession of military weapons....The rule emerging from Miller is that, absent a showing that the possession of a certain weapon has 'some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well-regulated militia,' the Second Amendment does not guarantee the right to possess the weapon. Miller, 307 U.S. at 178, 59 S.Ct. at 818... 'Technical' membership in a state militia (e.g., membership in an 'unorganized' state militia) or membership in a non-governmental military organization is not sufficient to satisfy the 'reasonable relationship' test. Oakes, 564 F.2d at 387. Membership in a hypothetical or 'sedentary' militia is likewise insufficient. See Warin, 530 F.2d 103...." U.S. v.

Keep Going:"F. Myth #6: The Second Amendment militia is the National Guard. The Founding Fathers made it clear that the Militia was composed of the populace at large. Both the Congress and Supreme Court have affirmed this definition of the Militia. 1. Founding Fathers * George Mason: "I ask, who are the militia? They consist now of the whole people, except a few public officers."145 * Virginia Constitution, Art. I, Sec. 13 (1776): "That a well-regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defense of a free State; that standing armies, in time of peace, should be avoided, as dangerous to liberty...." * Richard Henry Lee: "To preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them .... The mind that aims at a select militia [like the National Guard], must be influenced by a truly anti-republican principle."146 2. U.S. Congress * The Militia Act of 1792. One year after the Second Amendment was added to the Constitution, Congress passed a law defining the militia. The Militia Act of 1792 declared that all free male citizens between the ages of 18 and 44 were to be members of the militia. Furthermore, every citizen was to be armed. The Act stated: "Every citizen... [shall] provide himself with a good musket, or firelock, a sufficient bayonet and belt, two spare flints...."147 The Militia Act of 1792 made no provision for any type of select militia such as the National Guard. * U.S. Senate Subcommittee Report (1982). "In the Militia Act of 1792, the second Congress defined 'militia of the United States' to include almost every free adult male in the United States. These persons were obligated by law to possess a [military-style] firearm and a minimum supply of ammunition and military equipment.... There can be little doubt from this that when the Congress and the people spoke of the a 'militia,' they had reference to the traditional concept of the entire populace capable of bearing arms, and not to any formal group such as what is today called the National Guard."148 * Current Federal Law: 10 U.S.C. Sec. 311. "The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and... under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become, citizens of the United States...."149 3. Supreme Court: U.S. v. Miller (1939). In this case, the Court stated that, "The Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense... [and that] when called for service, these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time."150 "emoticonXKill emoticonXKill emoticonXKill "The Right of the People"

Time is not on my side today. "who are members of the National Guard." brings up several questions 1. There was no national guard when the 2nd amendment was written so how is this constitutional? 2. What is the law's definition of the "National Guard" is this state "National Guard" or federal? If read as I think your point is you must then consider that when this "who are members of the National Guard." was added, it was added contrary to our founding fathers ideas and goals. Read Jefferson, Washington, Franklin, and so on... Read my quotes above from Lee. What exactly then does the right of the people mean then? If we can not take the second part literally then how can we take the first part literally? And so the slope gets slippery, If the people in the second ammendment are not the PEOPLE but Government agents, how are the People in the 1st, 4th, 5th and so on anything else than "government agents". Contrary to belief the Constitution is not a living document to be interpreted by the sway of public opinion. further in a "free society" it is The right of the people meaning that the right itself has always existed. These rights are not there to be granted or taken away by the Government. Natural rights or rights granted by thier creator. Plus as the law is written it is sexist:149 Title 10 of the U.S. Code (Sec. 311) also defines the Militia to include "female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard." The Code then divides the Militia into two groups -- the "unorganized" militia (the body of the people) and the "organized" militia (the National Guard). This two-fold division of the Militia was not added to federal law until 1903. See:The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodiedmales at least 17 years of age, except as provided in section313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, or who have made adeclaration of intention to become, citizens of the United Statesand of female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard.So you may be correct when it applies to women which further makes this law unconsitutional....

Actually to be specific because US Code Title 10 Section 311 violates both the 2nd and 14th amendments of the Constitution it is null and void."All laws which are repugnant to the Constitution are null and void." Marbury vs. Madison 5 US (2 Cranch) 137, 174, 176 (1803)Specifically VoR:In regards to your signature line: ""In 1939, the Supreme Court held that the federal statute prohibiting possession of a sawed-off shotgun was constitutional... Since then, the lower federal courts have uniformly held that the Second Amendment preserves a collective, rather than individual, right...." Love v. Pepersack, 47 F.3d 120 (4th Cir. 1995) "are you citing the 4th ciruit court and or the US Supreme Court? This Fourth Circuit Court decision is a recent--and typical--example of the lower federal courts' unconstitutional interpretation of the Second Amendment.Another argument is that a "sawed off shotgun" had no military purpose and therefore could not aid a "well-regulated" (Read capable) militia. Meaning it was not good enough for defense.The Supreme Court in U.S. v. Miller (83 L. Ed. 1207 (1939)) upheld the regulation of shotguns having a barrel of less than 18 inches in length on the basis that the court had no notice that such a weapon "was part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense."I find this appropriate:"When any court violates the clean and unambiguous language of the Constitution, a fraud is perpetrated and no one is bound to obey it." -- (See 16 Ma. Jur. 2d 177, 178) State v. Sutton, 63 Minn. 147, 65 NW 262, 30 L.R.A. 630 Am. St. 459.Now I am not suggesting one do anything to jeopardize thier liberty but it is a good insight into how our rights are being hijacked today by the ONLY unelected branch of our government.More on the militia and the term "Well Regulated"..From The Oxford English Dictionary during the times of the writing of the 2nd amendment:1709: "If a liberal Education has formed in us well-regulated Appetites and worthy Inclinations."1714: "The practice of all well-regulated courts of justice in the world."1812: "The equation of time ... is the adjustment of the difference of time as shown by a well-regulated clock and a true sun dial."1848: "A remissness for which I am sure every well-regulated person will blame the Mayor."1862: "It appeared to her well-regulated mind, like a clandestine proceeding."1894: "The newspaper, a never wanting adjunct to every well-regulated American embryo city."The phrase "well-regulated" was in common use long before 1789, and remained so for a century thereafter. It referred to the property of something being in proper working order. Something that was well-regulated was calibrated correctly, functioning as expected. Establishing government oversight of the people's arms was not the intent in using the phrase in the 2nd amendment, it was precisely the opposite to render the government powerless to do so.ANDThe Supreme Court in U.S. v. Verdugo-Urquidez (108 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1990)), specifically the bottom of the left column on page 226, indicated that "the term 'the people,' as used in the Constitution's First, Second, Fourth, Ninth, and Tenth Amendments, refers to a class of persons who are part of a national community or who have otherwise developed sufficient connection with the United States to be considered part of that community".

Which violates the 14th amendment.b.

Here's an interesting article. According to the NRA, gun ownership is an individual right. According to court rulings it is a collective right. Why do many people often favor the NRA's view of the second amendment over what the courts have said?"Indeed, media bias in favor of the NRA's view of the Second Amendment (as protecting individual gun ownership) is so pervasive that even many gun-control supporters seem unaware that the federal high courts have never found a gun law to have violated the Second Amendment....The truth is -- and one would hardly know it from the mass media -- that since the Supreme Court's unanimous Miller decision in 1939, all federal appeals courts, whether dominated by liberals or conservatives, have agreed that the Second Amendment does not confer gun rights on individuals...."http://www.fair.org/articles/gun-control.html

He discovered that Ms. Love had been arrested on four occasions...She was convicted of only one of these crimes - a misdemeanor....Citing law review articles, Love argues that she has an individual federal constitutional right to 'keep and bear' a handgun, and Maryland may not infringe upon this right....She is wrong on both counts....In 1939, the Supreme Court held that the federal statute prohibiting possession of a sawed-off shotgun was constitutional, because the defendant had not shown that his possession of such a gun bore a 'reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia.' United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174, 178, 59 S.Ct. 816, 818, 83 L.Ed. 1206 (1939). Since then, the lower federal courts have uniformly held that the Second Amendment preserves a collective, rather than individual, right." http://www.healylaw.com/cases/love.htmIf you go to footnote 1, you see the crime that she was convicted for. "She paid a fine upon conviction in Florida of participating in an obscene show."

Why do you say that? I understand my own signature. I tried to make it very clear that it was just a misdemeanor so that you couldn't say that the court is just saying that felons can't have guns. The court did not recognize an individual right to own a gun in this case.

That was a misdemeanor, not a felony. The law is very clear. Only felony convictions take away your 2nd Amendment rights. You obviously do not understand your own signature.

No. No. No. Love got her gun and she got to keep it. The state kept the right to deny permits to felons. The state kept the right to deny permits when there are open warrents for arrest. The first case gave her the handgun. The appeal was about the right of the state to deny permits to people with an open arrest record. There were 3 charges against Love. One guilty plea to a misdemanor. Two open charges that were never cleared up. When she had a letter from the arresting Sherif stating that the open charges are OK and the guilty plea was a misdemanor, the state still denied the permit. The appeal decided that the state was OK to deny the permit due to the confusion and clerical error, but once it was properly cleared up, no one took her handgun way.As I have said again, you do not understand your own signature.

I never said otherwise. I fail to see your point. Having a gun does not mean she had an individual and constitutional right to have it. You can own a car, but that does not mean that there is a constitutional and individual right to own a car. The federal appeals court specifically rejected her claim that she had "an individual federal constitutional right to 'keep and bear' a handgun"Are we debating the above issues? I thought that the issue we were discussing was the second amendment. Yes.That's what the first case (the state case) was about. She won. Then she filed suit in a district court, "alleging violations of substantive due process, a 'right to contract,' and the Second Amendment". The district court dismissed the case. Love appealed the case to a federal appeals court. "Citing law review articles, Love argues that she has an individual federal constitutional right to 'keep and bear' a handgun, and Maryland may not infringe upon this right. [16] She is wrong on both counts" So not only did the federal appeals court reject the argument that Love's constitutional right had been infringed upon, they also rejected the argument that Love had an individual constitutional right to have a handgun.

"The NRA completely distorts the Supreme Court's ruling in U.S. v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 110 S.Ct. 1056 (1990).

But the issue of whether the right to bear arms is granted to 'the people' only in connection with militia service is not even addressed in the Verdugo-Urquidez decision. At most, the decision implies that the Second Amendment right extends only to U.S. citizens; it does not address the precise scope of the right granted. In no way does the Court's ruling contradict the idea that the right of the people to bear arms is exercised only through membership in a 'well regulated Militia.' ""The real purpose of the Second Amendment was to ensure that the 'state armies' – 'the militia' – would be maintained for the defense of the state. In order to do that it was necessary to grant each citizen the right to maintain arms.

How does section 311 support you? It excludes most of the adult female population and much of the adult male population. Does the word "people" in the first and fourth amendments only refer to males between the ages of 17 and 44? Certain federal appeals courts have disagreed with you about that. For example. "Rather, the claimant of Second Amendment protection must prove that his or her possession of the weapon was reasonably related to a well regulated militia.... 'Technical' membership in a state militia (e.g., membership in an 'unorganized' state militia) or membership in a non-governmental military organization is not sufficient to satisfy the 'reasonable relationship' test." (US v. Hale)http://www.healylaw.com/cases/hale.htmAlso read Article 1 Section 8 of the Constitution. It talks about how the militia can be regulated by the government. "The Congress shall have power to....provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions; To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, reserving to the states respectively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress;"http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitut....html#section8I read the word "people" in the context of the rest of the second amendment. The first part of the second amendment tells us that the purpose of the second amendment is to ensure the security of a free state by maintaining a militia. "A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state..."The word "being" implies that the idea is not complete as in the following sentence-"The door being locked..."So you have to read the 2nd amendment as a whole. The second part of the second amendment is not separate from the first part. "The distortion of the intent of the framers of the Bill of Rights by the gun lobby is glaring, as they focus their argument on the last half of the amendment, while ignoring the first half, on which it was based".--Former Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren E. Burger (1991)The term "bear arms" was most often used to refer to military service in founding era documents. It is evident from James Madison's first draft of the second amendment what the this term meant- "The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; a well armed and well regulated militia being the best security of a free country: but no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person." So what do you end up with? The right of the people to keep and bear arms in a state militia.

Only one way? Federal Appeals Courts have rejected the argument that the second amendment protects an individual right several times in the past. And what has the Supreme Court done about it? Nothing. They've let the rulings of the lower courts stand. If the Supreme Court really thinks that the second amendment protects an individual right, why haven't they bothered to reverse any of the rulings of the lower courts? They've had several chances in the past. Anyway, if the Supreme Court agrees to hear the case and rules that the second amendment protects and individual right, I still don't think they would side with your extremist interpretation of the second amendment. They might say something like it's an individual right subject to reasonable regulation by the government. Again moot and irrelevant. You said that "propterty owernship is protected under the Constitution." You weren't just talking about the act of buying a car. Another thought comes to mind. People have the right to vote.

Yes you are right there is no nail. If the court hears the case, it can ony go one way. You know it.

Several points here. This code that I have seen you reference on numerous occasions clearly violates the "equal protection" clause of the 14th amendment. However the requirment to become part of the militia is that you are an American citizen thats all. it says nothing about enlisting in the governments army. My argument is that "The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed". I use this "311" to show you that although you somehow believe that the government needed a constitutional amendment to arm itself and that it refers to itself as the "people" the fact is the so called "militia" as defined in the section 311 applies to most everyday citizens who are not part of government forces. Again you are ignoring the language by using modern definitions of a term that had a completley different meaning. Well regulated for political reasons today apparently means National guard?!? Whilst the true term as I mentioned before: Well regulated referred to the property of something being in proper working order. Furthermore "several federal appeals courts have disagreed with youl" also.Again by using the term "regulated" you are attempting to mask the true meaning of "well-regulated". This section of the constitution must be taken in context of the times. We had no standing army. This section talks about calling forth the "militia" which were every male between the ages of 17 and 44. The second amendment does not discriminate, the title code and the culture of the times did/does. With respect to Second Amendment rights, New Hampshire recommended a provision that "Congress shall never disarm any Citizen unless such as are or have been in Actual Rebellion." The Virginia, North Carolina, Rhode Island and New York letters are almost identical to each other on this subject.Look at the way it was origonally written:"A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed."With only a comma the sentence takes on its true meaning as was intended. The right of the people to keep and bear arms by itself is what a well regulated militia is.Here is where your argument loses all steam. Your argument is contradictory:All the arms, munitions, armament and equipment of the National Guard is owned and controlled by the federal government, not by "the people" as clearly stipulated in the Second Amendment. So you see there is no way that you can have a Government national guard and call them "the people". They are "the government". "The right of the people" not "the right of the state", nor "the right of the National guard", nor "the right of the federal government". not even "the right of the militia" it is "The right of the people"And finally. You like to mention Madison, here is another quote you may find interesting."The highest number to which a standing army can be carried in any country does not exceed one hundredth part of the souls, or one twenty-fifth part of the number able to bear arms. This portion would not yield, in the United States, an army of more than twenty-five or thirty thousand men. To these would be opposed a militia amounting to near half a million citizens with arms in their hands, officered by men chosen from among themselves, fighting for their common liberties and united and conducted by governments possessing their affections and confidence. It may well be doubted whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops. Besides the advantage of being armed, it forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of. The governments of Europe are afraid to trust the people with arms. If they did, the people would surely shake off the yoke of tyranny, as America did.

How does section 311 support you? It excludes most of the adult female population and much of the adult male population. Does the word "people" in the first and fourth amendments only refer to males between the ages of 17 and 44? Certain federal appeals courts have disagreed with you about that. For example. "Rather, the claimant of Second Amendment protection must prove that his or her possession of the weapon was reasonably related to a well regulated militia.... 'Technical' membership in a state militia (e.g., membership in an 'unorganized' state militia) or membership in a non-governmental military organization is not sufficient to satisfy the 'reasonable relationship' test." (US v. Hale)http://www.healylaw.com/cases/hale.htmAlso read Article 1 Section 8 of the Constitution. It talks about how the militia can be regulated by the government. "The Congress shall have power to....provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions; To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, reserving to the states respectively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress;"http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitut....html#section8I read the word "people" in the context of the rest of the second amendment. The first part of the second amendment tells us that the purpose of the second amendment is to ensure the security of a free state by maintaining a militia. "A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state..."The word "being" implies that the idea is not complete as in the following sentence-"The door being locked..."So you have to read the 2nd amendment as a whole. The second part of the second amendment is not separate from the first part. "The distortion of the intent of the framers of the Bill of Rights by the gun lobby is glaring, as they focus their argument on the last half of the amendment, while ignoring the first half, on which it was based".--Former Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren E. Burger (1991)The term "bear arms" was most often used to refer to military service in founding era documents. It is evident from James Madison's first draft of the second amendment what the this term meant- "The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; a well armed and well regulated militia being the best security of a free country: but no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person." So what do you end up with? The right of the people to keep and bear arms in a state militia.

Excluding males over 44 and most females means that more than half the population is excluded. That's not "most everday citizens." Which federals appeals courts have disagreed with me?What are you saying? So this part of the constitution only applied 200 years ago? Using circular logic. If you first assume that the people= a well regulated militia then you could reach that conclusion. It's not contradictory if you think of it as a collective right.

Several points here. This code that I have seen you reference on numerous occasions clearly violates the "equal protection" clause of the 14th amendment. However the requirment to become part of the militia is that you are an American citizen thats all. it says nothing about enlisting in the governments army. My argument is that "The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed". I use this "311" to show you that although you somehow believe that the government needed a constitutional amendment to arm itself and that it refers to itself as the "people" the fact is the so called "militia" as defined in the section 311 applies to most everyday citizens who are not part of government forces. Again you are ignoring the language by using modern definitions of a term that had a completley different meaning. Well regulated for political reasons today apparently means National guard?!? Whilst the true term as I mentioned before: Well regulated referred to the property of something being in proper working order. Furthermore "several federal appeals courts have disagreed with youl" also.Again by using the term "regulated" you are attempting to mask the true meaning of "well-regulated". This section of the constitution must be taken in context of the times. We had no standing army. This section talks about calling forth the "militia" which were every male between the ages of 17 and 44. The second amendment does not discriminate, the title code and the culture of the times did/does. With respect to Second Amendment rights, New Hampshire recommended a provision that "Congress shall never disarm any Citizen unless such as are or have been in Actual Rebellion." The Virginia, North Carolina, Rhode Island and New York letters are almost identical to each other on this subject.Look at the way it was origonally written:"A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed."With only a comma the sentence takes on its true meaning as was intended. The right of the people to keep and bear arms by itself is what a well regulated militia is.Here is where your argument loses all steam. Your argument is contradictory:All the arms, munitions, armament and equipment of the National Guard is owned and controlled by the federal government, not by "the people" as clearly stipulated in the Second Amendment. So you see there is no way that you can have a Government national guard and call them "the people". They are "the government". "The right of the people" not "the right of the state", nor "the right of the National guard", nor "the right of the federal government". not even "the right of the militia" it is "The right of the people"And finally. You like to mention Madison, here is another quote you may find interesting."The highest number to which a standing army can be carried in any country does not exceed one hundredth part of the souls, or one twenty-fifth part of the number able to bear arms. This portion would not yield, in the United States, an army of more than twenty-five or thirty thousand men. To these would be opposed a militia amounting to near half a million citizens with arms in their hands, officered by men chosen from among themselves, fighting for their common liberties and united and conducted by governments possessing their affections and confidence. It may well be doubted whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops. Besides the advantage of being armed, it forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of. The governments of Europe are afraid to trust the people with arms. If they did, the people would surely shake off the yoke of tyranny, as America did. Let us not insult the free and gallant citizens of America with the suspicion that they would be less able to defend the rights of which they would be in actual possession than the debased subjects of arbitrary power would be to rescue theirs from the hands of their oppressors."-- James Madison,

Brought up because you used it for your basis of a military requirment to own firearms. And yes according to sec. 311"The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodiedmales at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in section313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, or who have made adeclaration of intention to become, citizens of the United States... "It then goes on to describe organized and unorganized. not "well regulated" and "not so well regulated".Its unconstantutionalality aside it clearly defines the people as the militia. U.S. v. Verdugo-Urquidez (1990). "'The people' seems to have been a term of art employed in select parts of the Constitution.... [and] it suggests that 'the people' protected by the Fourth Amendment, and by the First and Second Amendments, and to whom rights and powers are reserved in the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, refers to a class of persons who are part of a national community or who have otherwise developed sufficient connection with this country to be considered part of that community." * U.S. v. Lopez (1995). The Court struck down a federal law which prevented the possessing of firearms within 1,000 feet of a school. The Court argued that the Commerce Clause of the Constitution in no way grants Congress the authority to enact such gun control legislation. * Printz v. U.S. (1997). The Supreme Court ruled the federal government could not force state authorities to conduct so-called Brady background checks on gun buyers. * U.S. v. Miller (1939). In this case, the Court stated that, "The Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense... [and that] when called for service, these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time."150 U.S. Senate Subcommittee Report (1982) :* Courts have used the Second Amendment to strike down gun control: Nunn v. State and in re Brickey are just two examples where the Courts have struck down gun control laws using the Second Amendment.141 * An individual right protected: "The conclusion is thus inescapable that the history, concept, and wording of the second amendment to the Constitution of the United States, as well as its interpretation by every major commentator and court in the first half-century after its ratification, indicates that what is protected is an individual right of a private citizen to own and carry firearms in a peaceful manner."142 US Congress:Fourteenth Amendment (1868):* The framers of the 14th Amendment intended to protect an individual's Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms by striking down state laws that denied this right. As stated by a Senate subcommittee in 1982, "[During] the debates over the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress frequently referred to the Second Amendment as one of the rights which it intended to guarantee against state action."143 Firearm Owners' Protection Act (1986): * The 1986 Law affirms individual right to keep and bear arms: "The Congress finds that the right of citizens to keep and bear arms under the second amendment to the United States Constitution... require[s] additional legislation to correct existing firearms statutes and enforcement policies."144 [Emphasis added.] Firearm Owners' Protection Act (1986): * The 1986 Law affirms individual right to keep and bear arms: "The Congress finds that the right of citizens to keep and bear arms under the second amendment to the United States Constitution...  require[s] additional legislation to correct existing firearms statutes and enforcement policies."144 [Emphasis added.] No it is precisley what I am NOT saying. Because at the time we had no standing army and the militia were the people. The constitution put in the authority for the government to call to arms the people of the united states (the militia) for national defense. which furthers the argument for individual firearms ownership. Circular logic?!?!? Your being a little dismissive wouldn't you agree. Please help me understand how you come to this circular logic argument? I suppose the founding fathers were using circular logic then.* George Mason: "I ask, who are the militia? They consist now of the whole people, except a few public officers."145 * Virginia Constitution, Art. I, Sec. 13 (1776): "That a well-regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defense of a free State; that standing armies, in time of peace, should be avoided, as dangerous to liberty...." * Richard Henry Lee: "To preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them .... The mind that aims at a select militia [like the National Guard], must be influenced by a truly anti-republican principle."146 "A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed."Which is contradictory to EVERYTHING our found fathers intended. No one could have answered the question "WHAT IS THE MILITIA" more beautifully, than Hamilton when he wrote in the Federalist Papers under No. 28:"The militia is a voluntary force not associated or under the control of the States except when called out; [when called into actual service] a permanent or long standing force would be entirely different in make-up and call."Hamilton further stated in the Federalist Papers under No. 69:"The President, and government, will only control the militia when a part of them is in the actual service of the federal government, else, they are independent and not under the command of the president or the government. The states would control the militia, only when called out into the service of the state, and then the governor would be commander in chief where enumerated in the respective state constitution."

Well, if it's unconstitutional why are you using it to support your arguments? Just seems to be contradictory to me. The question was which courts have addressed disagreed with me about the meaning of "well regulated" in the second amendment. This was the topic that we were discussing when I asked this question. Printz v. U.S. was not even second amendment case. The Brady Bill was ruled unconstitutional on the basis of the tenth amendment in that case. So what well-regulated meant is not addressed. Then you also quote U.S. v. Verdugo-Urquidez which says that the second amendment applies to American citizens but doesn't tell us whether it applies to them individually or collectively. The conclusion you're trying to draw from it is quite a stretch. The whole issue was whether the fourth amendment applied to non-Americans. An argument that the courts have rejected. "It is difficult to understand how appellants can assert that Presser supports the theory that the second amendment right to keep and bear arms is a fundamental right which the state cannot regulate when the Presser decision plainly states that '[t]he Second Amendment declares that it shall not be infringed, but this . . . means no more than that it shall not be infringed by Congress.

Just as an example... It is unconstitutional because of the second and 14th amendment implications, even though it was an attempt to limit freedoms and rights guaranteed by the constitution it failed as it stands now.The case for individual rights applies equally to all of the Bill of Rights, and the Constitution. You can not isolate the standard for "people" in one amendment that contradicts the "people" in the other amendments. There is NO evidence that the Framers of the Constitution would ever consider the "people" as government agents. The U.S. v.

Many pro liberty groups cite this case as resolving "any doubt that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right" Again all the arms, munitions, armament and equipment of the National Guard is owned and controlled by the federal government, not by "the people" as clearly stipulated in the Second Amendment. There is no possible way that they would have put the term "The Right of the People" if they meant the government Presser v. Illinois, 1886"this case involving a man's right to assemble a group of armed men without the state's permission, the court ruled that the right to keep and bear arms existed, independently of the Second Amendment, and that the states could not infringe upon this right.""This is one of the amendments that has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the national government, leaving the people to look for their protection against any violation by their fellow-citizens of the rights it recognizes .....""It is undoubtedly true that all citizens capable of bearing arms constitute the reserved military force or reserve militia of the United States as well as of the states, and, in view of this prerogative of the general government, as well as of its general powers, the states cannot, even laying the constitutional provision in question out of view, prohibit the people from keeping and bearing arms,  so as to deprive the United States of their rightful resource for maintaining the public security, and disable the people from performing their duty to the general government.

Only one way? Federal Appeals Courts have rejected the argument that the second amendment protects an individual right several times in the past. And what has the Supreme Court done about it? Nothing. They've let the rulings of the lower courts stand. If the Supreme Court really thinks that the second amendment protects an individual right, why haven't they bothered to reverse any of the rulings of the lower courts? They've had several chances in the past. Anyway, if the Supreme Court agrees to hear the case and rules that the second amendment protects and individual right, I still don't think they would side with your extremist interpretation of the second amendment. They might say something like it's an individual right subject to reasonable regulation by the government. Again moot and irrelevant. You said that "propterty owernship is protected under the Constitution." You weren't just talking about the act of buying a car. Another thought comes to mind. People have the right to vote. People also have to register to vote. Unconstitutional?

U.S. v. Verdugo-Urquidez doesn't address the scope of the right. It doesn't tell us whether the right that the people have is an individual or a collective right. How come the lower courts have not looked to this decision when trying to solve second amendment issues? Since that ruling most lower federal courts have continued to reject the argument that the second amendment protects an indivual right to own a gun. It just seems very far fetched to me to use that case to support your argument. A lot of your arguments would be right if they were made 200 years ago, but this is the 21st Century. The meaning of the word militia has changed. It once referred to a citizen militia. Now it's the National Guard. The Supreme Court explained it this way:"The National Guard is the modern Militia reserved to the States by Art. I. 8, cl. 15, 16, of the Constitution....From the days of the Minutemen of Lexington and Concord until just before World War I, the various militias embodied the concept of a citizen army, but lacked the equipment and training necessary for their use as an integral part of the reserve force of the United States Armed Forces. The passage of the National Defense Act of 1916 materially altered the status of the militias by constituting them as the National Guard." (Maryland v. United States)http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/script...us/381/41.html

The Supreme Court is not always right. This unelected branch of government get "stacked" by Presidents to fit to a particular agenda. This quote above is flawed in that if this is the militia in the 2nd amendment then the people are the government agents. To say that the meaning of the word militia has changed and therefore we must ban guns and make criminals out of 650 million Americans.. The National Defense Act of 1916 while establishing a National Guard did not abolish a peoples right to keep and bear arms. It is truly an absurd notion that "The right of the people to keep and bear arms has nothing to do with the people."Congress has the power… To raise and support Armies, but no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years;The National Guard was raised under Congress's authority to raise standing armies. The National Guard was intended to be sent abroad, while the Militia can't be sent abroad. Standing armies are not the Militia. Congress can dismiss standing armies. If Congress does not appropriate a budget every two years, standing armies are automatically dismissed. Standing armies are not protected by the Second Amendment.Further:Ninth AMendment:The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.people have more rights than listed in the the Bill of Rights, This is the Ninth. Just because a right was not written in the Constitution, this does not mean the federal government can ignore it.The People of the United States inherited an individual right to bear arms from the British. Many citizens have individual rights to bear arms from their various state Constitutions. Just because if you hang upside down and squint sideways, you can read the wording of the Second Amendment as protecting no one from anything, this does not void other places the Right to keep and bear Arms were guaranteed.Your 200 year reference is scary...

U.S. v. Verdugo-Urquidez doesn't address the scope of the right. It doesn't tell us whether the right that the people have is an individual or a collective right. How come the lower courts have not looked to this decision when trying to solve second amendment issues? Since that ruling most lower federal courts have continued to reject the argument that the second amendment protects an indivual right to own a gun. It just seems very far fetched to me to use that case to support your argument. A lot of your arguments would be right if they were made 200 years ago, but this is the 21st Century. The meaning of the word militia has changed. It once referred to a citizen militia. Now it's the National Guard. The Supreme Court explained it this way:"The National Guard is the modern Militia reserved to the States by Art. I. 8, cl. 15, 16, of the Constitution....From the days of the Minutemen of Lexington and Concord until just before World War I, the various militias embodied the concept of a citizen army, but lacked the equipment and training necessary for their use as an integral part of the reserve force of the United States Armed Forces. The passage of the National Defense Act of 1916 materially altered the status of the militias by constituting them as the National Guard." (Maryland v. United States)http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/script...us/381/41.html

Rev. Hellhound:It is obvious to me that the fundamental difference between anti-gunners and pro-gunners is trust.They trust the government. Do not mind being controled by it. Are willing to trade liberty.The Constitution is full of mistrust for the government. Everything about it is about not trusting government. Checks and balances, states rights, the enumeration and protection of rights, and the specific calling out pro-hibited government activity. Almost the whole Constitution deals with what a government is pho-hibited to do. Almost none of it deals with what citizens are pro-hibited to do. As a matter of fact I can not even think of one line item that calls out specific behavior that is prohibited. That is another fundamental flaw with gun control, it deals with what citizens are pro-hibited to do. It specifically calls it out, "you will not have a gun." Only once before was a Constitutional amendment passed that pro-hibited citizens. It was called pro-habition. It was repealled and was a total failure.

The Supreme Court is not always right. This unelected branch of government get "stacked" by Presidents to fit to a particular agenda. This quote above is flawed in that if this is the militia in the 2nd amendment then the people are the government agents. To say that the meaning of the word militia has changed and therefore we must ban guns and make criminals out of 650 million Americans.. The National Defense Act of 1916 while establishing a National Guard did not abolish a peoples right to keep and bear arms. It is truly an absurd notion that "The right of the people to keep and bear arms has nothing to do with the people."Congress has the power… To raise and support Armies, but no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years;The National Guard was raised under Congress's authority to raise standing armies. The National Guard was intended to be sent abroad, while the Militia can't be sent abroad. Standing armies are not the Militia. Congress can dismiss standing armies. If Congress does not appropriate a budget every two years, standing armies are automatically dismissed. Standing armies are not protected by the Second Amendment.Further:Ninth AMendment:The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.people have more rights than listed in the the Bill of Rights, This is the Ninth. Just because a right was not written in the Constitution, this does not mean the federal government can ignore it.The People of the United States inherited an individual right to bear arms from the British. Many citizens have individual rights to bear arms from their various state Constitutions. Just because if you hang upside down and squint sideways, you can read the wording of the Second Amendment as protecting no one from anything, this does not void other places the Right to keep and bear Arms were guaranteed.Your 200 year reference is scary... Lets say the government now thinks certain political speech should be banned.... Screw the constitution its 200 years old... Oh wait Campaign finance reform.... I guess those people in the first are government agents too....

Brought up because you used it for your basis of a military requirment to own firearms. And yes according to sec. 311"The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodiedmales at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in section313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, or who have made adeclaration of intention to become, citizens of the United States... "It then goes on to describe organized and unorganized. not "well regulated" and "not so well regulated".Its unconstantutionalality aside it clearly defines the people as the militia. U.S. v. Verdugo-Urquidez (1990). "'The people' seems to have been a term of art employed in select parts of the Constitution.... [and] it suggests that 'the people' protected by the Fourth Amendment, and by the First and Second Amendments, and to whom rights and powers are reserved in the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, refers to a class of persons who are part of a national community or who have otherwise developed sufficient connection with this country to be considered part of that community." * U.S. v. Lopez (1995). The Court struck down a federal law which prevented the possessing of firearms within 1,000 feet of a school. The Court argued that the Commerce Clause of the Constitution in no way grants Congress the authority to enact such gun control legislation. * Printz v. U.S. (1997). The Supreme Court ruled the federal government could not force state authorities to conduct so-called Brady background checks on gun buyers. * U.S. v. Miller (1939). In this case, the Court stated that, "The Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense... [and that] when called for service, these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time."150 U.S. Senate Subcommittee Report (1982) :* Courts have used the Second Amendment to strike down gun control: Nunn v. State and in re Brickey are just two examples where the Courts have struck down gun control laws using the Second Amendment.141 * An individual right protected: "The conclusion is thus inescapable that the history, concept, and wording of the second amendment to the Constitution of the United States, as well as its interpretation by every major commentator and court in the first half-century after its ratification, indicates that what is protected is an individual right of a private citizen to own and carry firearms in a peaceful manner."142 US Congress:Fourteenth Amendment (1868):* The framers of the 14th Amendment intended to protect an individual's Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms by striking down state laws that denied this right. As stated by a Senate subcommittee in 1982, "[During] the debates over the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress frequently referred to the Second Amendment as one of the rights which it intended to guarantee against state action."143 Firearm Owners' Protection Act (1986): * The 1986 Law affirms individual right to keep and bear arms: "The Congress finds that the right of citizens to keep and bear arms under the second amendment to the United States Constitution... require[s] additional legislation to correct existing firearms statutes and enforcement policies."144 [Emphasis added.] Firearm Owners' Protection Act (1986): * The 1986 Law affirms individual right to keep and bear arms: "The Congress finds that the right of citizens to keep and bear arms under the second amendment to the United States Constitution...  require[s] additional legislation to correct existing firearms statutes and enforcement policies."144 [Emphasis added.] No it is precisley what I am NOT saying. Because at the time we had no standing army and the militia were the people. The constitution put in the authority for the government to call to arms the people of the united states (the militia) for national defense. which furthers the argument for individual firearms ownership. Circular logic?!?!? Your being a little dismissive wouldn't you agree. Please help me understand how you come to this circular logic argument? I suppose the founding fathers were using circular logic then.* George Mason: "I ask, who are the militia? They consist now of the whole people, except a few public officers."145 * Virginia Constitution, Art. I, Sec. 13 (1776): "That a well-regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defense of a free State; that standing armies, in time of peace, should be avoided, as dangerous to liberty...." * Richard Henry Lee: "To preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them .... The mind that aims at a select militia [like the National Guard], must be influenced by a truly anti-republican principle."146 "A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed."Which is contradictory to EVERYTHING our found fathers intended. No one could have answered the question "WHAT IS THE MILITIA" more beautifully, than Hamilton when he wrote in the Federalist Papers under No. 28:"The militia is a voluntary force not associated or under the control of the States except when called out; [when called into actual service] a permanent or long standing force would be entirely different in make-up and call."Hamilton further stated in the Federalist Papers under No. 69:"The President, and government, will only control the militia when a part of them is in the actual service of the federal government, else, they are independent and not under the command of the president or the government. The states would control the militia, only when called out into the service of the state, and then the governor would be commander in chief where enumerated in the respective state constitution."

Of course gun control is about control but it is also about guns. Claiming that it has nothing to do with guns is false as I'm sure you're aware. Gun control is about the control of guns. How could it not have some interest in guns?Here is an example of how I can see gun control being used to protect people from guns. On a small scale and within my own family we have gun control. My dad owns a gun but keeps it locked away. My brother owns a gun but has to keep it locked in a case when he isn't using it so no one else can get at it. My parents are making him do this for the safety of my younger sister and brother. This is an example of gun control and a small level that focuses on guns more than control. Do you agree that this is true? If so, is it possible that the majority of the people in this country wish to have guns controlled by the government to help protect them? Do you think that gun control on a small (family) or large (country) scale will actually offer protection more than lack of gun control could? I hope you will provide a reasonable response to these questions as I do view you as the most logically thinking pro-gun advocate here and I'd like to learn more about your incites on this issue.Your using cars and cigarettes are good examples of deadly items that can kill. Cigarettes have second hand smoke and cars have accidents and can be used as weapons. However I don't think there is a more feared weapon that an individual can legally purchase and possess than a gun. That is why it is the target of so much criticism. Not to say that we should get rid of it or get rid of gun controls, but you have to admit that it is the leader when it comes to causing fear. Cigarettes and cars don't cause as much fear as a gun can. The reasoning behind this is that guns are often used for violence while cigarettes and cars are not. Guns in the US are especially seen as killing machines since we have more gun deaths than almost any other first world nation. That is why I don't think your example works.The government isn’t responsible for our lives unless we want them to be. For instance we have a military that will protect our lives and could also cost us our lives if we are drafted into it. The government is in control of this military. Do you think it is right for them to be able to protect and control our lives in this way? I’m pretty sure your answer will be yes since it is necessary for the government to protect our way of life on a large scale. Isn’t it also alright for the government to protect our way of life from criminals and terrorists by tracking guns and limiting how powerful weapons can be?Do you think that removing gun control would make life better in the US or make our country better. We may have more freedoms as you would say but we would have more crime, more deaths, and less safety unless you had a gun. Would this make happiness easier to achieve? Would it make our society more successful? What I really want to know is what you think the advantages of widespread gun ownership will actually be. I don’t want to hear the negatives about bringing about total gun control because I’ve heard those arguments already. What is the real and logical advantage to removing all gun control laws on small and large scales?

No such link in any of your posts. It is assumed that when you use someone else's exact words and don't put it in quotes and don't cite a source that you are claiming it as your own work. Atleast that's the standard in the academic world. Newspeak? I think that the way the NRA uses the word freedom is more newspeak. On what basis do you say it is a god-given right? People can choose to stop smoking and stop eating unhealthy foods. If someone blows your brains out with a gun, there's not much you can do. Handgun Control Inc was founded by 2 victims of gun violence. Sarah Brady's husband received brain damage due to a bullet wound. These are not people who have a fascination with power and control. These are simply people that have experienced the horrors of gun violence and want to make the world a better place.

An interesting article about John Lott, the author of "More Guns Less Crime" http://www.townhall.com/columnists/m...20030205.shtmlLott is suspected of fabricating data. "Although it's true that all Swiss males are subject to compulsory military service and every solidier is required to keep their service weapon(s) at home, that does not equate to there being a full-auto weapon in every Swiss home.... 14 per cent of Swiss households have a full-auto weapon in them. (With the 625,000 figure, it is 22 per cent.)" http://www.guncite.com/swissgun.html

If you are doing this just to sound elitist and condenscending because your arguments are lacking at best then perhaps you should retreat as it is not working.We can continue this or move on its your choice red.....Deflection.... You claim to want to give people more freedom by restricting freedom. You try to reinterperet the 2nd amendment to fit your totalitarian argument. "The right of the people" means that the right existed BEFORE the constitution and that this "right" that existed before the constitution... Right by whom? Our creator? George Washington? Congress? A Jackalope? Whom then granted this right to us? Exactly how does the NRA use freedom as newspeak? I backed up my claim with a clear example on how you are going to give people freedom by restricting freedom.. You have not... Your "I know you are but what am I tactic" is lacking...The rest of your argument fails the logic test. Remember that old man who mowed down 40 some people in Kalifornia? I didn't here people (you) cry that we should ban cars.... Your argument is that an emotional response to a personal incident is enough to restrict law abiding citizens thier liberty. Hinckley (that was him right?) was/is a criminal and he is paying the price. I am not and I WILL NOT pay the price of a criminal.The OK bomber used gasoline and fertilizer.. Should we ban these deadly materials?

No such link in any of your posts. It is assumed that when you use someone else's exact words and don't put it in quotes and don't cite a source that you are claiming it as your own work. Atleast that's the standard in the academic world. Newspeak? I think that the way the NRA uses the word freedom is more newspeak. On what basis do you say it is a god-given right? People can choose to stop smoking and stop eating unhealthy foods. If someone blows your brains out with a gun, there's not much you can do. Handgun Control Inc was founded by 2 victims of gun violence. Sarah Brady's husband received brain damage due to a bullet wound. These are not people who have a fascination with power and control. These are simply people that have experienced the horrors of gun violence and want to make the world a better place.

An interesting article about John Lott, the author of "More Guns Less Crime" http://www.townhall.com/columnists/m...20030205.shtmlLott is suspected of fabricating data. "Although it's true that all Swiss males are subject to compulsory military service and every solidier is required to keep their service weapon(s) at home, that does not equate to there being a full-auto weapon in every Swiss home.... 14 per cent of Swiss households have a full-auto weapon in them. (With the 625,000 figure, it is 22 per cent.)" http://www.guncite.com/swissgun.html

Yeah, I've seen that website. What's your point? You claimed that every Swiss household has a "A FULLY AUTOMATIC MACHINE GUN". Where on your website does it say that?

You say the antis. Does that mean those who are against anyone owning guns or those who are against eliminating gun control? I'm against eliminating gun control and I can say that my reasoning isn't to restrict law abiding citizens, it is to protect them as well as our way of life in the US. Besides, gun control at least solves a problem by improving our ability to catch criminals and lower gun deaths. Lack of gun control would do that opposite. Also you claim that the government is making us need them. Dropping gun control will make us need them even more for the police force that will be needed to patrol the machine gun gang controlled streets and the terrorists that will take advantage of this opening.I'd rather have the shotgun. But if the 'antis' had there way there would be no shotgun for either person. My look at reality is that if you put a shotgun in everyones hands then the situation of shotgun violence is going to increase. Everyone will need to have a gun to feel safe and that isn't the way it is today. Not everyone needs a gun to be safe since not everyone has a gun. Do you really think it is to everyones advantage that the majority of people have guns, or is it only to your advantage and a few of your friends? In my opinion I don't think most women will be carrying a shotgun around while most men will be doing so. Does that make this a safer country for women?I think that is an inaccurate statement. Any means everything that they do and I don't think everyone realizes how much the government does. I don't understand how your quiz shows me anything either. I've taken it before and scored 50-50.Your Personal Self-Government Score is 40%.Your Economic Self-Government Score is 50%.I got a different score this time because I was tougher on the legalizing drugs issue.--Draft is ok, no restricting freedom of speech, repeal sex regulations, don't legalize drugs, close the freaking border--Business operate w/o subsidies, drop the tariffs for the most part, don't repeal minimum wage, don't end taxes, government and private funds for foreign aid.Fear is not an excuse? Why do you think we went into Afghanistan and Iraq? It was because we feared for our future. Fear drives our country and people to do what is necessary to survive in times of crisis. If people view machine guns being on our streets as a time of crisis, then by God I hope they will act on that fear. I know I will.If you want people to learn about guns then force people to have 1 year in the military before they can purchase a gun. Then they will have surved our country and learned more about weapons. Plus they will have hopefully learned discipline and honor as well as respect for life. If you don't agree with this, what is your solution to teaching people about guns before they purchase them? I'm positive not everyone who owns a gun knows as much about them as I do. How will you deliver them from ignorance?It isn't your guns that enslave us either. I have no problem with you owning a gun as long as it isn't rediculous. I'm thinking more along the lines of a few sniper weapons, a mini gun, and a few assault rifles and body armor. Seeing people walking around the streets like that will make me nervous regardless of how well educated you could make me. I'm for gun control, not the elimination of guns or the unrestricted use of guns. I don't want to see either of those sides prevail because they are both flawed in ways.The military is in place to protect this country. The government is the leader of this country so I guess you could say it is there for their protection first, but it is also for the people.We are the last stand to defend our life and liberty but that doesn't mean we need a gun to do it. Guns are more likely to take a persons life and liberty than to allow them to have it IMO. Do you think that the US would have more gun deaths with complete gun control or no gun control? Do you think that people would be more free to feel safe with complete gun control or no gun control? In my view I think that complete gun control helps solve a major problem in crime and it would allow people to feel safer because they wouldn't need to have a gun to protect themselves.I think you're comparing our government to those who were not that trustworthy to begin with. How many of this 170 million were Americans?I like the Swiss example which is why I'm against complete gun control. That is a good way to protect our nation if people are allowed to have guns. Still it shows the reality of our country. We have more crime than fully armed countries not because we don't have guns. We have guns and we still have crime and lots of gun deaths. It isn't for lack of guns that this is happening.

Your missing the point. Law abiding citizens are not using guns to commit acts of violence against his fellow man. Criminals are. The antis want to restrict law abiding citizens of thier liberty to make them "victims" that need the help of the government overlords. once this cycle of dependancy is in place then they feel that they will maintain power. Look at the welfare state and minorities for an example. That is the aim of gun control. Lets look at the reality of things... How many people dialed 911 for a violent offense against themselves or others by a gun, knife, fist wielding criminal. Taken the amount of time for the police to respond most likley they would be dead... as chuck D once said 911 is a joke. now put FN TPS Shotgun in these victims hands instead of a phone... What do you think the outcome would be... Which one sits better with you? So if you really want to play the numbers game 911 and the slow response time is a much deadlier weapon against the innocents than guns are... hmm....Family level gun control is fine with me. The majority of the people in the US do not favor the government controlling ANY aspect of thier lives that is servitude. Don't believe me? Do me a favor and take this little quiz have your family and friends take it. You may see my point. Fear is not an excuse for legislation. The notion that I own a tool that you are phobic to does not mean that I am the one who should have my inalienable rights infringed upon. Education my friend will deliver you from ignorance... learn all about guns. shoot a few thousand rounds at some paper and stuff... ignore the fear mongers on TV... Fear is what enslaves you not my guns...I do not want them to be.. And no the military of today is to protect the federal government 1st and the people second. There have been cases sighted where judges have thrown out lawsuits against police departments who failed to protect an individual because the police (paraphrasing) "do not have a duty to protect the individual". You are the last stand in defense of your life, liberty, etc. If the government could track criminals that would be one thing but they are not. They are tracking law abiding citizens. Criminals who use guns do not go through legal channels to get guns and therefore the government can not track them. Besides if we put viloent criminals behind bars for as long as we should then this would be a much smaller issue. Crime control not Gun control YES, Yes we would have more freedom but less crime (read book of same title "more guns less crime").I have brought this out so many times... Here we go again....Suggested reading Unintended Consequences by John RossIndividuals are more trustworthy than governments this century alone some 170 million people were killed by thier governments. If you research this you will also see that these people for the most part were disarmed. You say well that would never happen here... Just ask the Bosnians the same question during the olympics in sarejevo then ask them again today... Also do you know why Hitler did not invade Switzerland? It had nothing to do with Switzerland being neutral no.... It was because EVERY SWISS HOUSHOLD IS (STILL TO THIS DAY) REQUIRED TO HAVE A FULLY AUTOMATIC MACHINE GUN. There crime rate is lower than ours! Now you have been spoonfed the doom and gloom prophecies of the government and media overlords that less gun control would result in more crime. but no where in history is this the case. In fact it is the opposite! Remember when they raised removed the 55mph speed limit? the doom and gloom fedgov and the media predicted massacres on the highways! Montana which does not have speed limits on certain highways was often cited... Well it never materialized... Do you see yet where I am going with this? People are more trustworthy than governments....MOLON LABE!

"14 per cent of Swiss households have a full-auto weapon in them. (With the 625,000 figure, it is 22 per cent.)

Your a victim of propaganda my friend. Did you know at one time you could by a fully automatic BAR in the sears catalog? this prediction of doom and gloom had not materialized. Victim disamament.... A big 300lbs rapist comes for the woman 911 will get her killed. a strategically place FN TPS 12 guage pistol grip collapsable stock shotgun will save her life! this is a simple concept. Now 200-300 rapists are shot over a span of a year or 2... What do you think the rapists will start to think when they get that itch..... And no no one is going to be carrying shotguns around, private businesses can dictate to its customers thier gun policy.. (like it should be with smoking).. It does not even have to be a majority... If violent criminals had a fear of getting shot they would think twice before commiting thier crimes.Your projecting an emotion of an individual to the will of a nation. lets keep it on topic.... people are not going to be running around with machine guns.... this is not logical... Personally I would carry a concealed .45 1911 like a Kimber Ultra Eclipse II and two extra clips. Probably not everywhere but definatley some places... But I would like to have that choice. I as a law abiding citizen should cause you no fear. What you should be afraid of is a government that tells you you can not defend yourself against armed criminals.It is not for me to deliver anyone from ignorance. It is up to the individual. This is something core to the American value system. Now lets say this idiot you have in mind goes to a kids soccer game and ends up threatening the coach with his pistole because he wont play his lame kid... Well thats menacing, terroristic threats, assault, and on and on... These are all felonies which would then preclude him from keeping his guns under current law.... That is all you need. If this guy ends up shooting someone well he will pay the consequences. Just because I have a gun does not make me want to go out and use it on the first person to XXXX in my cheerios no more than when some tool cuts me off in my car that I want to ram him. This is how people act.What if I told you that a remington 700 the most common hunting rifle there is makes a perfect "sniper weapon" should it be banned? Whats an assault rifle? A steurmgwuer (german, spelling is off) is a term that was coined by hitler which translates into Assault Rifle. A fully automatic weapon. A semi auto ar-15 is no different than that remington 700 except that the remignton is a much more deadly weapon and has much greater range than a fully automatic AK-47 in the right hands.WRONG WRONG WRONG.. What did you learn in your civics class? WE ARE THE LEADERS OF THIS COUNTRY. THE GOVERNMENT SERVES US! This statment makes me fear for my country. The government are "public servants" no matter what they try and say. Of the people for the people, by the people... Who said that?More... Absolutly more... Complete gun control would turn over our lives to criminals and government tyrannts. Look at scotland whos homicide crime rate is 26.3 or something compared to our 5.3.. (look at my previous posts on this I went into great detail). How is that 90lb woman gonna protect herself from the 300lbs rapist? Taebo?One word.... WACOIn addition AMD I came across this.. Read it as it makes my case very well:[i]Britain, Australia top U.S.in violent crimeSorry to repeat the link in 3 threads but I felt individually consistant points for 3 seperate individuals.Again Scotland has no guns and LOTS of homicides 4-5 times what we have... Guns are not the problem.

Why would a gun hater want to get rid of gun control, the gun haters want to ban the right to bear arms!Gun haters that use the line I am not against you having a gun mean just that. The gun haters want to tell you what you can have. It will eventually be no guns allowed if the gun haters get their way! This is just another gun hater lie to push the gun hater agenda of banning the right to bear arms!The gun haters like to use the line the police and military are here to protect you.
