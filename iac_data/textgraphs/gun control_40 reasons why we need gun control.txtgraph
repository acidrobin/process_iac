Williamson's excellent and witty piece, It's amazing what one has to believe to believe in gun control" 1. Banning guns works, which is why New York, DC, & Chicago cops need guns.2. Washington DC's low murder rate of 69 per 100,000 is due to strict gun control, and Indianapolis' high murder rate of 9 per 100,000 is due to the lack of gun control.3. Statistics showing high murder rates justify gun control but statistics showing increasing murder rates after gun control are "just statistics."4. The Brady Bill and the Assault Weapons Ban, both of which went into effect in 1994 are responsible for the decrease in violent crime rates, which have been declining since 1991.5. We must get rid of guns because a deranged lunatic may go on a shooting spree at any time and anyone who would own a gun out of fear of such a lunatic is paranoid.6. The more helpless you are the safer you are from criminals.7. An intruder will be incapacitated by tear gas or oven spray, but if shot with a .357 Magnum will get angry and kill you.8. A woman raped and strangled is morally superior to a woman with a smoking gun and a dead rapist at her feet.9. When confronted by violent criminals, you should "put up no defense -- give them what they want, or run" (Handgun Control Inc. Chairman Pete Shields, Guns Don't Die - People Do, 1981, p.125).10. The New England Journal of Medicine is filled with expert advice about guns; just like Guns & Ammo has some excellent treatises on heart surgery.11. One should consult an automotive engineer for safer seatbelts, a civil engineer for a better bridge, a surgeon for internal medicine, a computer programmer for hard drive problems, and Sarah Brady for firearms expertise.12. The 2nd Amendment, ratified in 1787, refers to the National Guard, which was created 130 years later, in 1917.13. The National Guard, federally funded, with bases on federal land, using federally-owned weapons, vehicles, buildings and uniforms, punishing trespassers under federal law, is a "state" militia.14. These phrases: "right of the people peaceably to assemble," "right of the people to be secure in their homes," "enumerations herein of certain rights shall not be construed to disparage others retained by the people," and "The powers not delegated herein are reserved to the states respectively, and to the people" all refer to individuals, but "the right of the people to keep and bear arm" refers to the state.15. "The Constitution is strong and will never change." But we should ban and seize all guns thereby violating the 2nd, 4th, and 5th Amendments to that Constitution.16. Rifles and handguns aren't necessary to national defense! Of course, the army has hundreds of thousands of them.17. Private citizens shouldn't have handguns, because they aren't "military weapons", but private citizens shouldn't have "assault rifles", because they are military weapons.18. In spite of waiting periods, background checks, finger printing, government forms, etc., guns today are too readily available, which is responsible for recent school shootings. In the 1940's, 1950's and1960's, anyone could buy guns at hardware stores, army surplus stores, gas stations, variety stores, Sears mail order, no waiting, no background check, no fingerprints, no government forms and there were no school shootings.19. The NRA's attempt to run a "don't touch" campaign about kids handling guns is propaganda, but the anti-gun lobby's attempt to run a "don't touch" campaign is responsible social activity.20. Guns are so complex that special training is necessary to use them properly, and so simple to use that they make murder easy.21. A handgun, with up to 4 controls, is far too complex for the typical adult to learn to use, as opposed to an automobile that only has 20.22. Women are just as intelligent and capable as men but a woman with a gun is "an accident waiting to happen" and gun makers' advertisements aimed at women are "preying on their fears."23. Ordinary people in the presence of guns turn into slaughtering butchers but revert to normal when the weapon is removed.24. Guns cause violence, which is why there are so many mass killings at gun shows.25. A majority of the population supports gun control, just like a majority of the population supported owning slaves.26. Any self-loading small arm can legitimately be considered to be a "weapon of mass destruction" or an "assault weapon."27. Most people can't be trusted, so we should have laws against guns, which most people will abide by because they can be trusted.28. The right of Internet pornographers to exist cannot be questioned because it is constitutionally protected by the Bill of Rights, but the use of handguns for self defense is not really protected by the Bill of Rights.29. Free speech entitles one to own newspapers, transmitters, computers, and typewriters, but self-defense only justifies bare hands.30. The ACLU is good because it uncompromisingly defends certain parts of the Constitution, and the NRA is bad, because it defends other parts of the Constitution.31. Charlton Heston, a movie actor as president of the NRA is a cheap lunatic who should be ignored, but Michael Douglas, a movie actor as a representative of Handgun Control, Inc. is an ambassador for peace who is entitled to an audience at the UN arms control summit.32. Police operate with backup within groups, which is why they need larger capacity pistol magazines than do "civilians" who must face criminals alone and therefore need less ammunition.33. We should ban "Saturday Night Specials" and other inexpensive guns because it's not fair that poor people have access to guns too.34. Police officers have some special Jedi-like mastery over hand guns that private citizens can never hope to obtain.35. Private citizens don't need a gun for self-protection because the police are there to protect them even though the Supreme Court says the police are not responsible for their protection.36. Citizens don't need to carry a gun for personal protection but police chiefs, who are desk-bound administrators who work in a building filled with cops, need a gun.37. "Assault weapons" have no purpose other than to kill large numbers of people. The police need assault weapons. You do not.38. When Microsoft pressures its distributors to give Microsoft preferential promotion, that's bad; but when the Federal government pressures cities to buy guns only from Smith & Wesson, that's good.39. Trigger locks do not interfere with the ability to use a gun for defensive purposes, which is why you see police officers with one on their duty weapon.40.

40 reasons why we need gun control

That is a lot, but I want gun control. I want:1) Instant background checks. No waiting period. No cool off time. No central database of gun owners.2) Larger budget for law enforcement for persecution of firearm offenders. No larger budget for law enforecemnt + unconstitutional gun laws on the same bill before Congress.3) Expanded civilian training such as Civilian Marksmanship Program to include all manner of modern military weapons.4) If the militia is the National Guard, then I want formal seperation of National Guard from Federal authority.

Excatly!As when I said:I would consider a national background check that was universal in nature. Meaning that you would have to go through the same phone call proccess that the NCIC does. Cept it won't know WHY the shop is calling... Driver licenses, becoming a teacher. Guns, opening or operating a daycare, getting your pilots license, applying for the police force, the military... Make it vast enough that it is not a so called gun control law.I would consider it not for the reasons you think.... I would consider something like this to absolve the gun shop owner from any liability for some nutjob and his misdeeds. And I would ONLY consider it if it REPEALED GCA1934, NFA1968, Brady, assault ban, etc.. etc... and became the ONLY factor in checking to make sure your not a convicted felon (of a violent crime) or a crazed (committed at one time) loon.ONLY THEN...Oh and Kelvin....

Here is the definition of militia:Function: nounEtymology: Latin, military service, from milit-, milesDate: circa 16601 a : a part of the organized armed forces of a country liable to call only in emergency b : a body of citizens organized for military service 2 : the whole body of able-bodied male citizens declared by law as being subject to call to military service Ok here is the 2nd amend :A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed. Now if you read the definition of militia as a citizen of America I could be called up to serve in one. But no where can the gun haters produce one document stating a requirement to be in a militia to bear arms. All gun haters want is to do is put limits on the right to bear arms. Once this limit is on the right to bear arms the gun haters will say now that we have a standing military we no longer need militias. So guess what just happened to the right to bear arms. This is why the founding fathers put no limits on our rights. This is why the founding fathers describe our rights as the right of the people!This is why they are not collective rights like the gun haters want to claim. Gun haters like the word collective. Gun haters will use the communist tactics to harass and threaten people gun haters cannot shut up!

***Yawn*** revisionist history... Well here are the facts from http://www.gunowners.org/fs0404.htm:D. Myth #4: Recent gun control laws have reduced the U.S. murder rate. 1. Murder rate was already decreasing before Brady and semi-auto gun ban passed. Those who claim that the two gun control laws enacted in 1994 have reduced the murder rate ignore the fact that the U.S. murder rate has been decreasing from the high it reached in 1991.172 Thus, the murder rate had already begun decreasing two to three years before the Brady law and the semi-auto gun ban became law. 2. Murder rate decrease results from fewer violent youths. The Democratic Judiciary Committee noted in 1991 that, "An analysis of the murder tolls since 1960 offers compelling evidence of the link—the significant rise of murder in the late 1960's, and the slight decrease in murder in the early 1980's follows from an unusually large number of 18-24 year-olds in the general population. This age group is the most violent one, as well as the group most likely to be victimized—and the murder figures ebb and flow with their ranks."173 (Emphasis added.) 3. According to the Clinton Justice Department, crime has decreased even while the number of guns increased. The Bureau of Justice Statistics, the research arm of the Justice Department, reported in 2000 that while the number of firearms in circulation rose nearly 10% during a recent five-year period, gun-related deaths and woundings dropped 33%.174 4. Concealed carry laws have dropped murder and crime rates in the states that have enacted them. According to a comprehensive study which studied crime statistics in all of the counties in the United States from 1977 to 1992, states which passed concealed carry laws reduced their murder rate by 8.5%, rapes by 5%, aggravated assaults by 7% and robbery by 3%.175

***Yawn*** revisionist history... Well here are the facts from http://www.gunowners.org/fs0404.htm:D. Myth #4: Recent gun control laws have reduced the U.S. murder rate. 1. Murder rate was already decreasing before Brady and semi-auto gun ban passed. Those who claim that the two gun control laws enacted in 1994 have reduced the murder rate ignore the fact that the U.S. murder rate has been decreasing from the high it reached in 1991.172 Thus, the murder rate had already begun decreasing two to three years before the Brady law and the semi-auto gun ban became law. 2. Murder rate decrease results from fewer violent youths. The Democratic Judiciary Committee noted in 1991 that, "An analysis of the murder tolls since 1960 offers compelling evidence of the link—the significant rise of murder in the late 1960's, and the slight decrease in murder in the early 1980's follows from an unusually large number of 18-24 year-olds in the general population. This age group is the most violent one, as well as the group most likely to be victimized—and the murder figures ebb and flow with their ranks."173 (Emphasis added.) 3. According to the Clinton Justice Department, crime has decreased even while the number of guns increased. The Bureau of Justice Statistics, the research arm of the Justice Department, reported in 2000 that while the number of firearms in circulation rose nearly 10% during a recent five-year period, gun-related deaths and woundings dropped 33%.174 4. Concealed carry laws have dropped murder and crime rates in the states that have enacted them. According to a comprehensive study which studied crime statistics in all of the counties in the United States from 1977 to 1992, states which passed concealed carry laws reduced their murder rate by 8.5%, rapes by 5%, aggravated assaults by 7% and robbery by 3%.175

There called footnotes The GOA is peppered with them not like the made up XXXX from the brady bunch and other civil rights violators like yourself. Why don't you try disputing facts than making up stories and childishly trying to copy me.Here lets start with this.... Please read and explain to me how (if) any of these 40 things are wrong Mr. Civil-Rights violator:1. Banning guns works, which is why New York, DC, & Chicago cops need guns.2. Washington DC's low murder rate of 69 per 100,000 is due to strict gun control, and Indianapolis' high murder rate of 9 per 100,000 is due to the lack of gun control.3. Statistics showing high murder rates justify gun control but statistics showing increasing murder rates after gun control are "just statistics."4. The Brady Bill and the Assault Weapons Ban, both of which went into effect in 1994 are responsible for the decrease in violent crime rates, which have been declining since 1991.5. We must get rid of guns because a deranged lunatic may go on a shooting spree at any time and anyone who would own a gun out of fear of such a lunatic is paranoid.6. The more helpless you are the safer you are from criminals.7. An intruder will be incapacitated by tear gas or oven spray, but if shot with a .357 Magnum will get angry and kill you.8. A woman raped and strangled is morally superior to a woman with a smoking gun and a dead rapist at her feet.9. When confronted by violent criminals, you should "put up no defense -- give them what they want, or run" (Handgun Control Inc. Chairman Pete Shields, Guns Don't Die - People Do, 1981, p.125).10. The New England Journal of Medicine is filled with expert advice about guns; just like Guns & Ammo has some excellent treatises on heart surgery.11. One should consult an automotive engineer for safer seatbelts, a civil engineer for a better bridge, a surgeon for internal medicine, a computer programmer for hard drive problems, and Sarah Brady for firearms expertise.12. The 2nd Amendment, ratified in 1787, refers to the National Guard, which was created 130 years later, in 1917.13. The National Guard, federally funded, with bases on federal land, using federally-owned weapons, vehicles, buildings and uniforms, punishing trespassers under federal law, is a "state" militia.14. These phrases: "right of the people peaceably to assemble," "right of the people to be secure in their homes," "enumerations herein of certain rights shall not be construed to disparage others retained by the people," and "The powers not delegated herein are reserved to the states respectively, and to the people" all refer to individuals, but "the right of the people to keep and bear arm" refers to the state.15. "The Constitution is strong and will never change." But we should ban and seize all guns thereby violating the 2nd, 4th, and 5th Amendments to that Constitution.16. Rifles and handguns aren't necessary to national defense! Of course, the army has hundreds of thousands of them.17. Private citizens shouldn't have handguns, because they aren't "military weapons", but private citizens shouldn't have "assault rifles", because they are military weapons.18. In spite of waiting periods, background checks, finger printing, government forms, etc., guns today are too readily available, which is responsible for recent school shootings. In the 1940's, 1950's and1960's, anyone could buy guns at hardware stores, army surplus stores, gas stations, variety stores, Sears mail order, no waiting, no background check, no fingerprints, no government forms and there were no school shootings.19. The NRA's attempt to run a "don't touch" campaign about kids handling guns is propaganda, but the anti-gun lobby's attempt to run a "don't touch" campaign is responsible social activity.20. Guns are so complex that special training is necessary to use them properly, and so simple to use that they make murder easy.21. A handgun, with up to 4 controls, is far too complex for the typical adult to learn to use, as opposed to an automobile that only has 20.22. Women are just as intelligent and capable as men but a woman with a gun is "an accident waiting to happen" and gun makers' advertisements aimed at women are "preying on their fears."23. Ordinary people in the presence of guns turn into slaughtering butchers but revert to normal when the weapon is removed.24. Guns cause violence, which is why there are so many mass killings at gun shows.25. A majority of the population supports gun control, just like a majority of the population supported owning slaves.26. Any self-loading small arm can legitimately be considered to be a "weapon of mass destruction" or an "assault weapon."27. Most people can't be trusted, so we should have laws against guns, which most people will abide by because they can be trusted.28. The right of Internet pornographers to exist cannot be questioned because it is constitutionally protected by the Bill of Rights, but the use of handguns for self defense is not really protected by the Bill of Rights.29. Free speech entitles one to own newspapers, transmitters, computers, and typewriters, but self-defense only justifies bare hands.30. The ACLU is good because it uncompromisingly defends certain parts of the Constitution, and the NRA is bad, because it defends other parts of the Constitution.31. Charlton Heston, a movie actor as president of the NRA is a cheap lunatic who should be ignored, but Michael Douglas, a movie actor as a representative of Handgun Control, Inc. is an ambassador for peace who is entitled to an audience at the UN arms control summit.32. Police operate with backup within groups, which is why they need larger capacity pistol magazines than do "civilians" who must face criminals alone and therefore need less ammunition.33. We should ban "Saturday Night Specials" and other inexpensive guns because it's not fair that poor people have access to guns too.34. Police officers have some special Jedi-like mastery over hand guns that private citizens can never hope to obtain.35. Private citizens don't need a gun for self-protection because the police are there to protect them even though the Supreme Court says the police are not responsible for their protection.36. Citizens don't need to carry a gun for personal protection but police chiefs, who are desk-bound administrators who work in a building filled with cops, need a gun.37. "Assault weapons" have no purpose other than to kill large numbers of people. The police need assault weapons. You do not.38. When Microsoft pressures its distributors to give Microsoft preferential promotion, that's bad; but when the Federal government pressures cities to buy guns only from Smith & Wesson, that's good.39. Trigger locks do not interfere with the ability to use a gun for defensive purposes, which is why you see police officers with one on their duty weapon.40. Handgun Control, Inc. says they want to "keep guns out of the wrong hands." Guess what? You have the wrong hands

Correct. The National Guard is nothing more than an 'extension' of the Federal Army (and Air Force). We wear the same uniform as our active duty counterparts as well.You may recall that back in the 60's Gov. George Wallace was powerless to stop the 'Federalization' of National Guard troops which were used against him, by forcing the desegregation of Alabama schools. Regardless of where you stand on the politics of that situation, the Federal government clearly overstepped their authority here and thus established their control over 'National Guard' units henceforth.The National Guard being referred to as the 'militia' is laughable and wholly inaccurate. It's a cop out used by anti-gunners to excuse their attempts to disarm the 'law abiding'.
attacks
The National Guard interpretation of the militia is totally false. The NG is a standing army. The militia is not. The NG can be federalized. The militia can not. They wear the same uniforms. The officers all know each other and play golf together.If the NG is the militia, then I want to have stock plies of weapons at schools, hospitals, libraries, and churches. No federalization of NG. Complete and total seperation of NG from federal influence, communication, and socializatlion, right down to even different uniforms.

Nice try, but no cigar. It's been widely reported, even on liberal-run media, that states with 'conceal carry laws' have had a reduction in overall crime and more dramatic reductions in specific crimes like murder, etc.Myself, I don't worry with providing 'raw data' for lazy liberals who won't be swayed in their rabid hatred of 'gun ownership' anyway.

So what the hell does that have to do with anything... oh and do not tell me that the AWB was the reason... Assault weapons are used in less than .20% of crimes:"Assault weapons are not the weapons of choice among drug dealers, gang members or criminals in general. Assault weapons are used in about one-fifth of one percent (.20%) of all violent crimes and about one percent in gun crimes. It is estimated that from one to seven percent of all homicides are committed with assault weapons (rifles of any type are involved in three to four percent of all homicides). However a higher percentage are used in police homicides, roughly ten percent. (There has been no consistent trend in this rate from 1978 through 1996.) Between 1992 and 1996 less than 4% of mass murders, committed with guns, involved assault weapons. (Our deadliest mass murders have either involved arson or bombs.) "Whats your point?

Even MORE telling is that they cite only one source, which is the FBI's uniform crime reports. While they attempt to make it look like the uniform crime report analysed state crime statistics (which it does not....all the uniform crime report provides is that from 1997-1998 overall crime declined 6.4%, but violent crime ROSE by 2.8%) in order to bolster their claims.Here is a c&p of the message I sent the brady campaign regarding that report:I was interested in a report I saw on your web page entitled "CONCEALED TRUTH Concealed Weapons Laws and Trends in Violent Crime in the United States". Some people have claimed that the numbers used in that report are heavily edited to support your claims. Could you please provide me with a list of sources that was used in the compilation of the report so I can review the data myself and refute their claims?Here is a c&p of their reply:Due to the complex nature of statistical analysis, we do not provide source or raw data information. Often, our studies draw from such a broad range of sources that we are not able to keep track of all of them ourselves! You can be assured that our team of researchers has reviewed all the data available and drawn the correct conclusions.So, what they are saying in the first line is they feel that you are too stupid to look at raw data and formulate a conclusion. In the second line, they are saying that THEY are too stupid to keep track f their sources, and in the third line they are saying, "but it is OK, we won't provide you with any evidence, but trust us anyway".This is a typical "analysis" dne by the brady folks. No sources, they are unwilling to provide source information, they toss out a single source which doesn't even come close to covering all the claims they have made, but they expect us to just trust them.The anti-gunners have a long ways to go if they are going to convince us that their doctored numbers are real. I am not realy fond of the NRA (because I think they are traitors to their memebers), but their reports are generally footnoted, and if you request raw data fromm them you ge either a definitive link, or a HUGE packet of photocopies.

More telling is this continuing trend where crime fell faster in states that have strict carrying concealed weapons (CCW) laws or that do not allow the carrying of concealed weapons at all than in states which have lax CCW laws.""From 1992 to 1998 (the last six years for which data exists), the violent crime rate in the strict and no-issue states fell 30% while the violent crime rate for the 11 states that had liberal CCW laws (where law enforcement must issue CCW licenses to almost all applicants) during this entire period dropped only 15%."http://www.bradycampaign.org/facts/r...truth&menu=gvr

A lot of those points are strawman arguments. The author is saying if you believe in gun control then you believe these things. Well, I believe in gun-control and I don't believe a lot of those things the author just posted. So the author must not be familiar with the arguments that pro-gun-control people make.

The problem is that allowing people to legally carry concealed weapons makes it easier for criminals to carry guns around. And people with a concealed weapons permit are more likely to commit a crime. Florida and Texas have had a lot of problems."From 1996 to 2000, Texas concealed handgun license holders were arrested for weapon-related offenses at a rate 81 percent higher than that of the general population of Texas, aged 21 and older which amounts to more than one weapon-related offense every other day since the law went into effect."http://www.vpc.org/press/0206ltk.htm"Concludes Glick, 'Florida's law has made it substantially easier for individuals with criminal records or criminal intent to go about armed. The findings in Concealed Carry: The Criminal's Companion demonstrate that Florida's concealed carry law is definitely a model one not to be followed.' "http://www.vpc.org/press/9511ccw.htm

Without all of the information that study means nothing. Now apply that logic to cars. Is a person a criminal when they first purchase a car? Is this person a criminal when they use the car to drag race on a public street resulting in an accident? It is a crime to drag race on public streets. So was the drag racer a criminal when they purchased the car or after they used the legal item to violate the law against drag racing on a public street?

So you want to apply your logic to cars? Here goes. "Cars don't kill people. People kill people. Therefore all traffic laws should be abolished. There should be no stop signs or speed limits. The government should not interfere. I have a right to make my own decisions about the way I drive as long as I don't hurt anyone. I'm a law abiding citizen so nothing can go wrong when I'm behind the wheel."

Here's some real info on CCW holders in Texas. There was a rebuttal by the TX Dept. of Public Safety, but the link no longer works. I tried searching on their site, but it times out.# Licensees were 5.7 times less likely to be arrested for violent offenses than the general public - 127 per 100,000 population versus 730 per 100,000.# Licensees were 14 times less likely to be arrested for nonviolent offenses than the general public - 386 per 100,000 population versus 5,212 per 100,000.# Further, the general public is 1.4 times more likely to be arrested for murder than licensees [see Figure I], and no licensee had been arrested for negligent manslaughter.http://www.ncpa.org/ba/ba324/ba324.htmlhttp://www.txchia.org/Sturdevant2000.htmhttp://www.txdps.state.tx.us/adminis...licholders.htmAs far as Florida, the only mention I can find on a quick search is the following:..."The rarity of these incidents is reflected in Florida statistics: 221,443 licenses were issued between October 1, 1987 and April 30, 1994, but only 18 crimes involving firearms were committed by those with licenses (Cramer and Kopel, 1995, p. 691).[7] While a statewide breakdown on the nature of those crimes is not available, Dade county records indicate that four crimes involving a permitted handgun took place there between September 1987 and August 1992 and none of those cases resulted in injury (pp. 691-2)."...http://catb.org/~esr/guns/gunslott.html

Yet another excellent example of a "study" that supplies no sources or refrences. Try contacting the VPC and asking them for reference materials or the raw data they used. They either don't respond (if you ask by e-mail or snail mail) or put you on hold and eventually hang up on you (if you call). I have heard that if you actually show up at one of their offices and request the information, they take a lot more action. They advise you that you are on private property and threaten to have you arrested if you don't leave.A study is supposed to include numbers, and they are supposed to tell you where those numbers came from. The closest they do to this is:Which argues what a valuable source of information arrest data is. It does not say where they got their arrest data, and does not even, in the entire article, claim that they actually USED arrest data in its formulation, They simply cite another article in order to "prove" their claims.The other article they cite is one that THEY have written. It is a very long article, very well written, except for the exclusion of any references to the source material they used. They have a section entitled "Section Two: Details of Specific Arrest Incidents Involving Concealed Handgun License Holders" where they outline 11 individual cases. At the top it says:This is a flimsy attempt to lend the report credibility. They say they used outside sources, but do not name them except in the vaugest of terms. If you contact them (and I ust hung up the phone) they "do not rememeber" specifically where they got the information.In the coclusion, they ust bluff and bluster some more, and STILL do not list a single source.

I have spent years researching this topic, I gave a speech about it too. You can argue numbers as much as you want. It's number wars. Whose are accurate? You can debate back and forth forever. I would trust data straight from the FBI before I would trust a secondary source.I prefer to argue mostly the logic and reasoning of it, then you don't need to bicker about whose numbers are better.While I do consider numbers important, I think we can get much further debate-wise with a logic/reasoning style of debate on this issue.When you create strict gun laws, only those that obey the law in the first place will act in accordance with the new law. Stricter gun laws mainly hurt the law-abiding people that use them responsibly for sport and protection.Conceal and carry laws do NOT make it easier for criminals to carry guns. Anyone can carry a gun with the law, and nobody would know. Making it legal to carry a gun is not what the criminals are waiting for-it's what they are dreading-when civilians can protect themselves-when they are no longer defenseless.Criminals do not obey the law. Basically, to criminals, there is no law, because they do what they want. So why should law-abiding citizens live with restrictive laws that interfere with thier ease of protection, while criminals have no restrictions?Police are too slow and too few. You can't rely on the police to protect you, they can't be everywhere at once.The police are not obligated to protect you, as ruled in (US supreme court?) (I think its called) Warren v. District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department. The police have no obligation to protect individual citizens, but only the public as a whole.When you ban guns, only the criminals have them. They wont magically disappear. Marijuana is illegal, look at how that has disappeared. Killing is already illegal, as is burglary, rape, assault, and vandalism. Just look at how those have all disappeared.No matter what you do, the best defense against crime, is arming the victims. The police are too slow, the criminals have guns whether you do or not, and your life is the last thing that they are worried about.

That is the beauty of the pro-gun standpoint. We can argue based on logic, and we win. We can argue based on nambers, and we win. We can argue based on historical prescedent, and we win. It is the only issue that I am aware of where the facts, evidence, and logic are so unfairly stacked on one side. For a while there were some interesting studies being tossed around by the Brady campaign but they were eventually all discredited. You will note that we no longer hear politicians quoting brady or handgun control inc for their statistics (actually, you don't hear them quote statistics very often, as they have learned that they do not support their cause). OF course, there will always be exceptions, like Feinstein, who ust HAD to get up and quote a buch of lies....er....uh......statistices the other day in support of extending the AWB. OF course, she got spanked pretty badly and was made to look like an absolute idiot and a liar (which we already knew).

OK. Here's the thing. Allowing people to carry concealed weapons make it possible for NON-criminals to carry weapons. It allows people a better opportunity to defend themselves from armed criminals. If you view people that don't want to victimized as potential, or even probable, criminals, then you might as well just imprison the bulk of the population. Remember, hundreds of millions gunowners commited no crimes yesterday. Guns simply do not cause crime. If you view the common population as a threat to your wellbeing, then you, sir, are paranoid to the point which, perhaps you are better suited to seclusion than to society.

If I may suggest to all; 'A repeal of the Second Amendment, alone, will not automatically exclude gun owners from owning firearms. The right to keep and bear arms preceeded the Constitution and Bill of Rights, therefore, it would take a Constitutional Amendment, in and of itself, to deny citizens that right. That is what will not happen, in my estimation. The LIB DIM GGs will continue to incrementally impose restrictions and caveats on honest gun owners, collectively WE will continue to compromise with the buggers, until we are for all practical purposes, disarmed. May I also suggest to firearms owners, to carefully edit from their rhetoric, any mention of them personally owning firearms. Who knows when these forums are being monitored?

What difference would that make? The BATFE (E for explosives, their power grows) already knows you own a firearm if you've ever had a NICS check. They're supposed to destroy the records, but who knows what they do? Might as well let it be known you have some personal experiance in this area.

IF they find you with a gun, they can ask for your permit. That is about the only check in place. OF course, wihout concealed carry permits, you can be assured that EVERYBODY who is carrying a gun is doing so illegally. People have carried illegal concealed weapons for years. I have done it myself a few times. The idea is, it is CONCEALED, so nobody knows.
