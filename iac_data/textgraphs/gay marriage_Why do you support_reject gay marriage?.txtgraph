IMO,Government should not be involved in marriage in the first place. People should not be required to obtain a license (permission) to get married.I suspect marriage licenses probably came into being as way for government to control who married whom; or, to be more precise: to make sure certain people (of a race, religion, nationality) did not marry certain other people (of a race, religion, nationality).Obviously that is how it is being used today, except instead of race, religion or nationality being the "offensive" characteristic, it is instead the sexual preference of certain people that is "offensive."

I agree with this, but the fact is the government is invovled and becasue of that there are certain benies that come from that. Marriage was a pagan ritual in the begining and was primarily for land rights and livestock. It was a way of keeping stuff "in the family" Marriages were arranged by parents to continue wealth. Many Christians claim it is some "thing" instituted by god, but that is not true.

Thanks for starting this thread and reiterating your points so that I do not need to search for them. I will see what I can do about responding to them.I will argue that gay marriage does not create a new class of citizen, it removes a class of citizen. Currently it is the case that there are two types of couples: those who get the benefits of marriage and those who do not. The idea of gay marriage is to consolidate those two types of citizens into one type of citizen. The idea is to give all types of people the same set of rights, and that would precisely merge two classes of citizens into one.Whether or not we are merging an independent class of citizens into a dependant one is a question that can be debated, but if we are, then it would make sense to prevent all forms of marriage using the same justification.Hey, let's not make assumptions on how gay marriage will come about. I would have no problem with gay marriage arising from state legislatures coming to an agreement that this should be allowed, and that may very well happen. The argument I make in favor of same-sex marriage is simply that it should be legal, not that the courts should legalize it.That being said, it is questionable whether this could be considered an unfunded mandate because such a ruling does not imply that the government must spend more money, it only implies that the government must distribute its tax breaks and other benefits equally across all citizens. Research has also suggested that the government would save far more money than it loses in medicaid costs due to workplace-provided health insurance.Businesses are not required to give their employees health insurance nor are they required to spend a certain amount of money on health insurance if they choose to do so, but this bill would make certain that if a business does so, it is not able to pick and choose who gets that insurance and who does not.More importantly, like many of your arguments, if this argument can be used as a reason to disallow same-sex marriage, it can equally be used as an argument to disallow opposite-sex marriage.Many of those battles are already being fought in court, and this sort of cost is likely negligable due to countless factors introduced by marriage. For example, child support services must pay far less when the government no longer has to pay to fund an adopted child.Again, this argument can be used to disallow opposite-sex marriages.Refer to what I said about about the costs of same-sex marriage. Also note that this argument can be used to disallow marriage for opposite-sex couples.Understand that this same loophole exists in our current system of opposite-sex marriage, and it can thus be used as a reason to deny opposite-sex couples marriage. Isn't a better solution to fix the loopholes and give everyone the same rights?Okay, you've heard me mention that many of your arguments can be used to deny opposite-sex couples marriage rights as well. Let me explain why this is important. Because our society prides itself on freedom, equality, and happiness, we try to give equal rights to everyone and allow people to be as free as they like so long as they do not harm others. This means that we do not arbitrarily give extra tax breaks and extra rights to random groups of people. Currently, you have listed no reason that opposite-sex couples deserve these rights but same-sex couples do not. That is really the heart of the debate. You aren't debating that same-sex marriage is wrong, you are debating that marriage itself is wrong. What is missing from your argument is what everyone is talking about: why do opposite-sex couples deserve the right to be married but same-sex couples do not?I have no problem with you using your arguments to support banning marriage, but they only make sense in the context of banning marriage for everyone. If that is your intention, then I don't really think that gay rights play a factor here. If not, your argument only follows if you give reasons why one group of people deserves all of these marriage rights, but a different group does not.Let me know what you think.

If you had followed the original thread, you would have seen that I acknowledged that straights currently have all those benefits that you mention above because society sees the promotion of heterosexual marriage as a benefit to society on a whole. Your task is to get society to see gay marriage's benefits to that same group.Just as many people support AA, which gives an unfair advantage to minorities in return for a, supposed, good reason, giving advantages to targeted groups in the US isn't unheard of. There's lots of precedence.

That is in effect, what gays are doing. In their case they are doing it by changing the standard we use to determine what suffices for a marriage: opposite gender couples.

As I posted in another thread, the state I live in is in the process of creating legislation that would allow gay couples the legal means to achieve marriage benefits on a par with heterosexual couples. While a state ban on gay marriages was reaffirmed in the last general election, the very Republican senator who pushed the ban is constructing new legislation to accommodate gay domestic circumstances. We're not a community property state, which invites litigation if the state recognizes inheritance and other pertinent statutes on a selective basis of marriage, and at that point the issue of civil rights being trampled by selective legislation is a fact.When religion is removed from this issue, or any other moral issue, bigotry and rationalization seem to vanish. I wouldn't have the personal patience exhibited by gays. Putting the gay movement under a church umbrella and challenging mythology with mythology would seemingly be a quicker solution to their problem of acceptance and one the supreme court would review on the basis of religious freedom without the federal bigamy laws used to trim Mormon beliefs. A new, new, new testament would get things interesting.

For the sake of space, I'll reply to #'s and not quote the whole text.1. Same sex spouse = new class of dependent2. By adding a new class of dependent, the costs associated need to be funded by Uncle Sam. Without Congress evaluating how it will pay for this new class, it is illegal. http://www.usmayors.org/uscm/us_mayo...d_mandates.asp3. This new class of dependent, if made legal, must be given the same benefits as hetero couples. This is an increased cost to employers who have no say in the matter. The only alternative to paying for this increased coverage is to withdraw healthcare from all of its employees and their families and in that instance, gay marriage certainly impacts straights.4. The new dependent class will have "new" legal rights (for them as a group)and claims to others' property that don't exist today. For example, a gay couple living together in which one partner owns the house. Today, the other partner has no legal claim to that property, but under marriage laws, would be entitled to at least part of its value. Child custody cases, bankruptsy, inheritance battles that don't exist today because the second party has no legal standing would change overnight as the second party is given a "new" legal status.5-7. You can't argue that the costs would be no different than with hetero married couples because we have already established that those costs are already borne by a willing society that sees hetero marriage as an overall benefit worth supporting financially. The same argument can't be made for gay marriage. You haven't convinced John Q. Public that there is a carrot for them.In closing, I'd like to respond to the claims of fairness. While fairness is a goal that I believe we should embrace, the fact is that there are all sorts of unfair practices that are embraced by our society. AA is a prime ean unfair practice that was instituted to help ONE group at the expense of another. Maybe if gay activists campained for "fairness" across the board John Q.

The reason I got interested in this debate at all was because I was utterly astounded when people started rallying against it. It didn't seem to me like 2 gay people getting legally married would affect anyone else. To me it seemed like freedom was being increased in this country, and all I saw were people that were opposed to more freedom.Now point by point(I'm sure others have the same points).1. Gay marriage creates a new dependent class of citizenThis doesn't even make any sense. What class and how are they dependent?2. It is an unfunded mandate and therefore, illegalThis doesn't even make any sense. Is hetero marriage an unfunded mandate?There would be nothing put upon Congress, everything would be left to the states. http://www.spectacle.org/196/unfund.html3. It forces additional costs on an employer via healthcare benefitsSo they should not provide healthcare benefits at all. Problem solved.Besides if gay people don't need health insurance surely straight people don't.4. It adds costs to the court system via increased litigation over custody, property, inheritance, etc.,Isn't this an argument from the OTHER side?Isn't one of their goals to REDUCE the amount of custody litigation, etc.Again, if this is such a problem for society then hetero marriage should be outlawed.5. It allows more people to lay claim to finite SS and other entitlement benefitsSo does having children. We'd better ban that while we have the chance.6. It establishes a loophole to transfer property without payment of inheritance taxes.??? Again, the same could be said about hetero marriage.It's not a "loophole" if there is a legally defined avenue for the transfer of property from one spouse to another.7. It establishes a mechanism to bypass the payment of taxes on life insurance payouts.??? Is this a problem with hetero marriages?There are WAY more of them than gay marriages.I'm sorry but these arguments are lame.

I will reply to all #s at once.John Q Public was not sold on many of the civil rights the courts pushed in the past.Allowing blacks to serve on juriesAllowing women the right to an abortion (roe vs.wade)desegragation of public schools (brown vs board of ed)I am not so sure I agree that John Q. Public needs to be given a carrot. I don't really see where it matters that the oublic accepts equality for all. History has shown that John Q Public doesn't need to approve of civil rights because the 14th ammedment provides for the minority.I also don't see how any of your objections differ from straights marrying. If we had a heterosexual marriage boom...all of these things would happen anyway. If you are an employer and one of your employees gets married and wants healthcare for their new spouse you provide it in someway. How is 1% of the population of gays getting married going to make any substantial dent in these things.

I agree with this statement! If the gay population is only 5% and say only half of them get married, we are not talking a significant enough amount to make these huge drastic changes that you are implying here. It is not like they are all going to run out and get married at once. It will take time for these changes, they will be gradual.You also claim there will be more litagation. More than there is now trying to sue for the right to marry? and pass ammendments? I think the litagation costs will be small by comparison.

No problem. It seemed like a reasonable request by a reasonable person.In actuality, there are three types of couples: married, gay and heterosexual unmarried. Only the first group get the benefits of marriage. If we broaden the definition of marriage to include same sex couples, wouldn't heterosexual unmarried couples still be discriminated against? And if we did that, then we'd have two new classes of citizens with claims to others' property that they didn't have previously.The point that our society willingly pays for breaks given to heterosexual couples can't be trivialized by saying that it should be all or nothing. Society, as it stands today, is willing to partially subsidize hetero couples and NOT same sex couples. Now, admittedly, those reasons aren't always strictly financial, but I've limited my discussion to those issues.I agree that IF gay marriage is made legal it should be done through the legislature and not the courts. We have also recently seen in the Nov elections that many states aren't comfortable with gay marriage yet.The unfunded mandate law also extends to businesses. If the total cost of instituting gay marriage costs >$50Million, Congress must take that fact into consideration. A cost increase to businesses, state and federal employers of $50Million is certainly going to be surpassed over the lifetime of the statute.You've just made my point for me. It would have the net effect of being an unfunded mandate to businesses and they would have to respond by stopping ALL insurance or adding additional coverage for gay couples. What if that business was a religious institution that was morally opposed to gay marriage. They would be forced to support it, regardless of their moral stance. Isn't the so-called separation of church and state really a double-edged sword designed to protect the church FROM government intervention as well?Agreed except that society has already ruled on whether or not it wants to provide financial incentives to targeted groups, such as minorities and married couples. Court costs will undoubtedly increase as there are property disputes amongst gay partners with new-found rights. It's unavoidable, especially in cases of inheritance. Imagine an elderly gay man dies who had a hetero family prior to a gay marriage and there is a dispute over inheritance. I can foresee many such realistic scenarios.See above comments on society's acceptance to subsidize hetero couples.Fair question. I stated above that society was willing to subsidize hetero marriage because it saw benefits in doing so, but I never enumerated those benefits.Society's Benefits from Marriage:1. Financial security for woman and children 2. Exclusivity for man/woman with penalties for violations of that exclusivity3. Property succession and dissolution upon divorce/death4. Protection from forced testimony about partner5. Societal stability6. Perceived as a sacrament to religious followers7. Establishes legal guardianship of childrenI'm sure that I can think of others, but that should suffice for the time being.The latter, of course. I'm not anti-marriage. In fact I've been "institutionalized" with the same woman for 26 great years so far. I just don't see the benefits to society for promoting gay marriage. All I see are increased chances for abuse of the law, additional costs and a promotion of a lifestyle that I , personally, believe is deviant. (not deviant as in "sinister", but in the sense of "abnormal") But that's not to say that I'm closed minded and can't be persuaded otherwise. There are other things that I consider deviant, but can tolerate, none-the-less.

Research has also suggested that the government would save far more money than it loses in medicaid costs due to workplace-provided health insurance.Businesses are not required to give their employees health insurance nor are they required to spend a certain amount of money on health insurance if they choose to do so, but this bill would make certain that if a business does so, it is not able to pick and choose who gets that insurance and who does not.More importantly, like many of your arguments, if this argument can be used as a reason to disallow same-sex marriage, it can equally be used as an argument to disallow opposite-sex marriage.Many of those battles are already being fought in court, and this sort of cost is likely negligable due to countless factors introduced by marriage. For example, child support services must pay far less when the government no longer has to pay to fund an adopted child.Again, this argument can be used to disallow opposite-sex marriages.Refer to what I said about about the costs of same-sex marriage. Also note that this argument can be used to disallow marriage for opposite-sex couples.Understand that this same loophole exists in our current system of opposite-sex marriage, and it can thus be used as a reason to deny opposite-sex couples marriage. Isn't a better solution to fix the loopholes and give everyone the same rights?Okay, you've heard me mention that many of your arguments can be used to deny opposite-sex couples marriage rights as well. Let me explain why this is important. Because our society prides itself on freedom, equality, and happiness, we try to give equal rights to everyone and allow people to be as free as they like so long as they do not harm others. This means that we do not arbitrarily give extra tax breaks and extra rights to random groups of people. Currently, you have listed no reason that opposite-sex couples deserve these rights but same-sex couples do not. That is really the heart of the debate. You aren't debating that same-sex marriage is wrong, you are debating that marriage itself is wrong. What is missing from your argument is what everyone is talking about: why do opposite-sex couples deserve the right to be married but same-sex couples do not?I have no problem with you using your arguments to support banning marriage, but they only make sense in the context of banning marriage for everyone. If that is your intention, then I don't really think that gay rights play a factor here. If not, your argument only follows if you give reasons why one group of people deserves all of these marriage rights, but a different group does not.Let me know what you think.

I know you were responding to someone else, but...Heterosexual unmarried couples are discriminated against now. BUT, they can get married and no longer be discriminated against. Are you saying that gays are being discriminated against because they can't get married to each other?Whose society is it? Republican christians? or everyone?You're just making this up.Where do you get $50million?Where do you get it costing anything at all?Do you mean the cost of passing laws or nullifying them?The US congress would spend $0 then, because this would be a state's issue.It would cost state governments the same amount that it costs them to re-write tax codes like they do almost every year anyway, or to gerrymander congressional districts or any number of things they normally do anyway.OMG this is pure stupidity.If the "business" were religious, then they probably wouldn't hire gay people (doh! that's illegal so it must be an unfunded mandate to have to hire gay people and black people, shouldn't the govt pay to hire gay people?)I mean this is like saying, "what if my business is against hiring black people. Now I have to give benefits to black people. It's an unfunded mandate!"To hell with the rest of it....

No problem. It seemed like a reasonable request by a reasonable person.In actuality, there are three types of couples: married, gay and heterosexual unmarried. Only the first group get the benefits of marriage. If we broaden the definition of marriage to include same sex couples, wouldn't heterosexual unmarried couples still be discriminated against? And if we did that, then we'd have two new classes of citizens with claims to others' property that they didn't have previously.The point that our society willingly pays for breaks given to heterosexual couples can't be trivialized by saying that it should be all or nothing. Society, as it stands today, is willing to partially subsidize hetero couples and NOT same sex couples. Now, admittedly, those reasons aren't always strictly financial, but I've limited my discussion to those issues.I agree that IF gay marriage is made legal it should be done through the legislature and not the courts. We have also recently seen in the Nov elections that many states aren't comfortable with gay marriage yet.The unfunded mandate law also extends to businesses. If the total cost of instituting gay marriage costs >$50Million, Congress must take that fact into consideration. A cost increase to businesses, state and federal employers of $50Million is certainly going to be surpassed over the lifetime of the statute.You've just made my point for me. It would have the net effect of being an unfunded mandate to businesses and they would have to respond by stopping ALL insurance or adding additional coverage for gay couples. What if that business was a religious institution that was morally opposed to gay marriage. They would be forced to support it, regardless of their moral stance. Isn't the so-called separation of church and state really a double-edged sword designed to protect the church FROM government intervention as well?Agreed except that society has already ruled on whether or not it wants to provide financial incentives to targeted groups, such as minorities and married couples. Court costs will undoubtedly increase as there are property disputes amongst gay partners with new-found rights. It's unavoidable, especially in cases of inheritance. Imagine an elderly gay man dies who had a hetero family prior to a gay marriage and there is a dispute over inheritance. I can foresee many such realistic scenarios.See above comments on society's acceptance to subsidize hetero couples.Fair question. I stated above that society was willing to subsidize hetero marriage because it saw benefits in doing so, but I never enumerated those benefits.Society's Benefits from Marriage:1. Financial security for woman and children 2. Exclusivity for man/woman with penalties for violations of that exclusivity3. Property succession and dissolution upon divorce/death4. Protection from forced testimony about partner5. Societal stability6. Perceived as a sacrament to religious followers7. Establishes legal guardianship of childrenI'm sure that I can think of others, but that should suffice for the time being.The latter, of course. I'm not anti-marriage. In fact I've been "institutionalized" with the same woman for 26 great years so far. I just don't see the benefits to society for promoting gay marriage. All I see are increased chances for abuse of the law, additional costs and a promotion of a lifestyle that I , personally, believe is deviant. (not deviant as in "sinister", but in the sense of "abnormal") But that's not to say that I'm closed minded and can't be persuaded otherwise. There are other things that I consider deviant, but can tolerate, none-the-less.

The laws on marriage don't discriminate against gays now. Anybody has the right to marry a single person of the opposite sex. What you want is a change in the definition of marriage that excludes the provision stating "opposite sex". Right now, as written, marriage laws apply equally to all. They just aren't as inclusive as you would like them to be.Thank you for the link. I'll take a look and reply.Again, thanks for the link.I have never disagreed that marriage is a special dependent class. My point is that it is a society-sanctioned special class.Any new law that, as a result of its enactment, increases the costs to state or businesses by >$50Million is subject to mandatory Congressional review.The costs associated with gay marriage, and you provided one estimate from the CBO above, thank you, will far exceed that number and therefore, is an unfunded mandate.

I will first state that I fully support gay marriage because it would provide equal rights for individuals under the law.Your argument about additional financial cost to to governmens are simply incorrect. I refer you to a recent study prepared by the Congressional Budget Office at the request of Congress:http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=5559&sequence=0In summary, it states:Your argument regarding increased cost to businesses is also incorrect. I refer you to:http://barbelgin.typepad.com//hrc-businessimpact.pdf(Adobe Acrobat Reader required)If anything, the special dependant class already exists in the form of the heterosexual married couple, funded by the rest of society, married or not. Any "loopholes" that exist are now only to the exclusive benefit of heterosexual married couples.I fail to see where any "unfunded mandate" is involved. Could you please explain?

I'm not married and I don't want your class to be dependent on my class.Sorry, "society" says I have to. Well, soon society may be telling you to support some new "dependent class."The US Congress has to review STATE laws?It wouldn't even be a mandate.The US congress would not be doing the law passing.

This is an argument against marriage itself, not against gay marriage.Legislatures may pass any legislation they want, if they can get the majority of politicians to agree. The courts have a role to play in determining whether or not the legislation is Constitutional. Costs will increase if straight couples keep getting married also. As will the other costs you cite.

"Husband" is not a new class."Wife" is not a new class.Or, as many laws are now written, "spouse" is not a new class.That the "husband" or "wife" is part of a same-sex couple would have absolutely no bearing on his or her legal rights -- that's the point of equality -- so the "new class" your arguments are based on is a fantasy.

If you had followed the original thread, you would have seen that I acknowledged that straights currently have all those benefits that you mention above because society sees the promotion of heterosexual marriage as a benefit to society on a whole. Your task is to get society to see gay marriage's benefits to that same group.Just as many people support AA, which gives an unfair advantage to minorities in return for a, supposed, good reason, giving advantages to targeted groups in the US isn't unheard of. There's lots of precedence.

I will be very interested in your reply as to what an office of the federal government has to say about the cost impact of gay marriage.

It already has happened many times in the past. Ever hear of ADA, Welfare, AA?A valid question, so I'll respond. I don't believe that a State-by-state approach to gay marriage will work. We have already seen that. Advocates will attempt to use the "full faith and credit act" in order to force other states to recognize gay marriage without their consent. This won't sit well with the more conservative states, as we've already seen, hence the ballot initiatives in 19 states that actually rolled back some of the potential gains made in some instances. I believe that the only chance for gay marriage being made legal is a national initiative. State-by-state, it'll get creamed.

I'd like to take issue with the numbers and claims of additional financial burden on government and private industry being a factor for disallowing same sex marriages. Prior to the 1960s a majority of female and male gays were living in publicly sanctioned heterosexual marriages to satisfy peer groups for purposes of employment and family approval to avoid the public stigma of homosexuality being worse than a communicable disease.I lived in San Francisco, within the city, from 1967-1973 and again 1978-1981. The majority of gays, female and male, that I met and knew during both of those periods had been in heterosexual relationships, including raising children and all the American Dream trappings, before coming out of the closet. Using your terminology and definitions, same sex marriage is creating a new class of dependents, but in name only, yet another label. There's a corresponding decrease in an 'old' class of dependents, pseudo heterosexual marriages.Dismissing the financial aspect of disagreement with same sex marriage, as it should be, brings the argument back to mythological belief system persecution of non-believers. Unless one happens to think homosexuality is a new phenomena, and most arguments against it are based on Christian bible proclamations, it reeks of bigotry regardless of how many people in The Land of the Free support it.

Also some would say they view it to be a 'separate but equal' catagory, though I don't have a problem with that. It IS separate--gay couples are not straight couples.Civil unions would probably bring on the same financial problems that gay marriage would, although I don't agree with JP on all of this. I think he is right that anyone could try to claim the marriage loopholes by saying 'hey, THIS is a marriage too', but I don't agree that it's necessarily going to be that much more expensive on our economy if that happens, even given the fact it's gay people who are currently doing that.

Inheritance and child custody are two things I oppose along with the statist recognition of marriage. These things are authoritarian and inegalitarian. But health insurance? Correct me if I'm wrong, but single people can get health insurance. You don't need marriage for that.

This new class argument dosesn't work.You have straight couples who currently get married. If gay couples get married, straight couples will continue to be married. All couples will be entitled to the same benefits and will have the same responsibilities, gay or straight. We don't know how many gay couples will want to be married, but that doesn't matter. We don't know how many straight couples will marry either. The only difference is that some couples will be gay, some will be straight.Will more total couples be married? Possibly. But having more marriage isn't bad, unless you believe marriage is bad. So what is the problem? Is it that some of the couples are gay? I can think of no other logical reason. Would you want to keep straight marriage to a minimum, or not recognized at all, in order to keep the costs of benefits down?

Making gay marriage legal would create new curriculums to help students learn about, and make decisions about this new "freedom" that they will have. More social engeering means less time for practical learning. Considering what the numbers clearly show us about how our children currently compare with other countries in the practical learning department, WE CAN'T AFFORD IT.

HAHAH.School performance of students is directly related to who adults have sex with. What a funny comment.-Mach

I suspect his complaints about civility are directed at me. My posts aren't very friendly anymore. Frankly, I'm pretty sick and tired of self-righteous a-holes asking me to be "polite" when all they do is come on to gay-rights boards and yank people's chains month after month after month.Anyway, I suppose I shouldn't have been rude, because all it's done is given him an opportunity to ignore the point that "husband" and "wife" are not new classes and there is no legal distinction between a "gay husband" and a "straight husband". On the other hand, it does relieve a bit of stress to stop being nice to people who get such fulfillment from taunting gay people.

What were you referring to specifically that is not civil and logical? I think most of us are trying to deal with your opinions logically, and we are showing your fallacies of logic. What is not civil and inflammatory?

3 Things . . .a.) This is a debate forum, here for the purpose of debating the issue of gay rights. By its nature, it invites and encourages people of various viewpoints regarding this subject and others. People of views from all sides of the aisle come here assuming is is ok to argue their views. One assumes that, by coming and posting in a debate forum as you have, that you would be prepared for the fact that there are other views here than your own.b.) I have seen nothing in JP's posts that indicate he is here to 'taunt' you. Or 'yank your chain' as you say. Why can you not accept that he is here to debate? That is what this forum is for, is it not? Please indicate, no . . . cite where JP has taunted you. With this accusation, you need to pony up the evidence. For that matter JP even started this thread with the admonition that it be civil. Did you not even read the first post?c.) You say you shouldn't have been rude because it gives him an 'opportunity to ignore your point'; but why would not want to avoid being rude, period, if you don't want people being rude to you? Hearing something you don't like to hear and calling it "taunting" or "yanking people's chains" just because it is a different opinion that you can't seem to win over doesn't do anything for the discussion. Frankly, you have been more rude JPSarte himself. Perhaps it is you who is here to 'yank people's chains.'

The term "classes of citizens" suggests that each class is treated differently. If we have two "classes" which both recieve the same treatment under the law, those classes are really the same class. So by legalizing same-sex marriage, we are not creating any new class, we are allowing more people to enter an already-existing class. It is acceptable to make distinctions about the differences between people in a class, but it is all the same class. That being said, I understand that more people will be moving into a class in which they are granted more benefits under the law. Your statement above does not yet introduce any new ways that allowing more people to join this class is a bad thing.You did suggest that unmarried heterosexual couples would still be discriminated against, even if we allowed same-sex couples to marry. This is simply not the case. If we allowed same-sex couples to marry, the government would be extending the offer to as many people as possible. It gives everyone the freedom to choose whether or not to accept the benefits it offers. It discriminates against no one. Rights are not something that should be handed out only if the politician in charge approves. They are not something that should be taken away simply because your society doesn't want you to have rights. Even annoying people have rights.Aha, this is the type of argument that your previous post was lacking. Your previous post could not be understood as standing against same-sex marriage without making the distinction that you believe those things are okay, but only if society willingly approves them. Now that I have this information, I am able to formulate a response.First, I should point out what has already been mentioned: that it is possible society would be paying less money in taxes if same-sex marriage is passed. I do not claim to know the answer, but I'm sure I can look up some solid facts presented by those who know more on this topic than I do and relay the information to you as well as posting a link to it.However, the reason that I do not know for certain whether society will be paying money or saving it is that I do not believe it matters. I do not believe the laws we pass on how money is spent should be related to the will of the society to pay that money. The reason for this is that we are not actually talking about the will of society, we are talking about the will of the majority. Let me pose this situation: we have a society of ninty percent white and ten percent is black people. The white people vote that the black people must must pay a fee each month. This fee would then be distributed equally into the bank accounts of all of the white people. Basically, the white people vote that the black people must pay them money. Is this justifyable? I think we will both agree that it is not. But couldn't it be said that it is the will of society? I mean, ninty percent of the people voted for it, right? Well, yes, ninty percent of people voted for it, but that doesn't mean it is acceptable for people to pass such a law. It also isn't really the will of everyone in the society, it is the will of the majority, which is abusing their power. The majority is making the minority suffer to benefit itself.Now, you may be thinking "that's a totally different situation than same-sex marriage." But is it really? The majority and minority don't have to be black and white, they could be Christian and Muslim, German and Italian, or even straight and gay. It doesn't matter what group of people we're talking about; it is absurd to think that the minority should have to benefit the majority, even if the majority of people in a society vote for that to happen. Now if we assume that marriage does cause dependency and does force people to pay for it (whether those people be businesses or individuals), then we must concede that those non-married people are somehow paying or losing out in order to benefit the married people. We are also saying that only the majority, heterosexual couples, are allowed to get married; they are the only ones entitled to this benefit. Tell me, do you really think that homosexual couples agree to a definition of marriage that does not include same-sex relationships? Would you vote to pay for someone else's marriage if they would not return the favor for you? Even if same-sex couples did agree to this, it would be out of compassion, not because it is any more fair than whites forcing blacks to pay them.So my point above is that simply because society "agrees" to something does not mean that is morally correct to obey them. In fact, it may be just as likely to be morally incorrect. This reason is why we have legislators whose job it is to think these things through in the first place. Our federal government was designed not only to balance power across its different branches, but to balance out the power that the majority has to oppress the minority (but that is a different discussion, more of which can be read about in the Federalist Papers).I should also point out here that even though you make the claim that society has not decided to pay for same-sex marriage, my argument here is not that we should force it upon society against its will but that the individuals in the society should change their viewpoint. People like you and I should be willing to grant marriage to any two people in love, not just a specific kind of two people. In effect, you are arguing that people should think same-sex marriage is wrong because society thinks same-sex marriage is wrong. But people make up the society, so you're really arguing that people should think same-sex marriage is wrong because people think same-sex marriage is wrong. I do not think that I can agree with that chain of logic.I should start by saying that this is not a reason to disapprove of same-sex marriage. Certainly if the legislature passed same-sex marriage, it could not be called an unfunded mandate. Also, is an argument not about why same-sex marriage causes harm or is otherwise unjustiable, it is an argument about why a specific method of legalizing same-sex marriage might be considered illegal. So whether you think this is an unfunded mandate or not, it is really not justification to disagree with same-sex marriage.That being said, such a ruling would not be an unfunded mandate. As I think examples illustrate points very well, let us assume that some businesses are paying people different amounts of money depending on their race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or something equally absurd. The courts get this case and rule that the business must not use race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or whatever the trait may be as a factor in determining salary. This is not really an unfunded mandate; it isn't telling a business that it has to raise the salaries of the oppressed group of people to match everyone else's, it is simply saying that the salaries must be distributed evenly. The business would certainly be justified in lowering everyone's salary, splitting the total salary budget up equally, or partaking in whatever method it chose in order to meet the court's ruling. The same could be said of health care; if the court rules that the sex of the people involved in a marriage cannot be used as a factor in determing whether those people get health care benefits and they allow same-sex marriage, then businesses would not be forced to increase costs, they would be forced to treat each of their employees equally in whatever way they saw fit. The same budget could certainly be dispersed equally in health care benefits.Another factor to consider is that businesses are not really the subject here, we are only considering allowing more people to engage in marriage. We wouldn't be forcing a business to immediately take action, they would continue their standard pattern of giving people health care benefits based on their marital status. More people would be allowed to get married, and they would thus have more benefits to disperse, but certainly no business policy is changed in any way. As an example, the courts might extend the definition of what is considered "handicap". Perhaps they issue a ruling that blind people are now officially added to the "handicap" list. The courts aren't forcing businesses to make new accomodations in this case, they are simply telling businesses to keep doing what they've been doing, though more people might be allowed to take part in the existing accomodations.A final note to consider is that disallowing same-sex couples from getting the same marriage benefits from businesses in effect gives businesses a loophole through which they can hire people without having to give those people benefits. Not the best argument, but you seemed interested in creative loophole concepts.This is addressed in my writings about society possibly saving money and how it wouldn't matter even if they did not in my writings above.Excellent, now let me list the benefits of same-sex relationships:1. Financial security for women and children.2. Financial security for men and children.3. No exclusivity for man/woman with no penalties for violations of that exclusivity4. Property succession and dissolution upon divorce/death5. Protection from testimony about partner6. Societal stability7. Periceved as sacrament to religious followers.8. Establishes legal guardianship of children.And that is just the beginning! Did you know there are over 1,000 benefits granted to married couples? All those could benefit both same-sex couples and opposite-sex couples if we allowed same-sex marriage.As you can see, the same set of arguments that you use in support of opposite-sex marriage can be used to support same-sex marriage. I think some of them speak for themselves, but if you have more questions on them, let me know. As for the ones that don't, I will go into more detail.1 and 2: Just as there are male-male couples, there are female-female couples. Considering that same-sex couples very often have children, it is just as important to make them financially secure and able to raise those children as it is to do so with opposite-sex couples.3: This I feel is an important one. I don't see your exclusivity of marriage to be a good thing for any reason whatsoever. First of all, there is absolutely no reason to suggest that same-sex parents would make worse parents than opposite-sex parents. I've heard a few comments like "the kids will be teased more in school", but in truth, a kid is just as likely to be teased because his parents are overweight, don't speak English, are too protective, or any of a million other reasons that don't matter. I've heard the same said about the child feeling different, and those same examples can be used to show a child feeling different. In truth, every child has to come to terms with his or her families' differences, but just because a child's family is different from someone else's doesn't make it worse.Now then, I did write that the lack of exclusivity is a bad thing. Some of the reasons I wrote this are because of equal rights for all couples, freedom to live the way you choose, and granting everyone the same opportunity at happiness. I think you understand that these are very good things, and perhaps you get a good idea of how same-sex marriage promotes these things from what I wrote above. If not, I will go into more detail. But another very important benefit comes from giving same-sex couples the right to marry that may not be so intuitive. These couples have more incentive to have children. It is true that often same-sex couples have their children because of previous relationships, but it is equally common that they get their children through adoption or foster parenting. This is a very good thing. The life of a child in an adoption home or child placement center is a very horrible one. The child lives with no family and the government is forced to pay for all of his or her living expenses. Such a home is no place for a child to grow up, and we have far more children in these homes than people are willing to take in. Allowing same-sex couples to marry would give these children loving, caring families, and that is something that changes the lives of those children for the better in every way possible.7: Same-sex couples certainly have religion, and are very often Christian. Marriage is as important religiously to them as it is to anyone else. Now, I know that any sort of religous marriage is already legal and that it is only government recognition of the partnership that is lacking, but as you said, it is religious perception. It is usually just as religiously important to same-sex couples to be married as it is for opposite-sex couples, and no one should be able to tell those people that the government cannot recognize their relationship.8: Well, I think I explained this well in point 3.Well, it may surprise you that I believe that it is deviant to believe that same-sex marriage is immoral (in the sense that it is abnormal). This is because I believe that it is normal for most people to want to treat others the way they wish to be treated themselves. I believe it is normal for others to work toward the happiness of others, especially when that happiness does not interfere with their own happiness. But it does not follow for me that one can oppose same-sex marriage and follow those rules. It seems to me that people have been told or told themselves that same-sex marriage is bad for so long that they have sort of convinced themselves to deviate from human compassion on this one issue. Well, I suppose what I just said doesn't really mean much of anything, just that someone who want to spend his or her life with the one he or she loves does not qualify as "deviant" behavior in my book. It is not something that must be "tolerated", it is something that should be enjoyed for the good present in its nature.You wrote that you do not see the benefits of same-sex marriage. I know I went into the benefits of allowing same-sex couples to adopt, but I also spoke on same-sex marriage promoting equality, freedom, and happiness. Let me expand on that.Equality seems very simple to explain. Currently those who love someone of the opposite sex and choose to enter a relationship with that person are granted a set of benefits under the law. This same set of benefits could be extended to those who love someone of the same sex, but it is not, and they are still forced to pay any costs in taxes that salary cuts from businesses that might be accrued through these benefits being bestowed upon someone else. This simple fact violates equality, and I think this is clear and easy to understand. What may not be clear is why equality is so imporant. Granting a set of rights to one group of people that another does not have elevate the first group over the second. The more equality is removed, the more one group is elevated over the other and the more that first group is leeching off of the second group. If the first group could provide those same bonuses to the second group without causing any real harm, the first group is obligated to do so. For the powerful to take things for themselves that they could just as easily share with the weak crosses the line of moral evil.Freedom might be a bit more difficult to understand. Though the government is not granting the same set of benefits that it gives opposite-sex couples to same-sex couples, it is not actually taking any anyone's freedom to behave in the manner they please. Or is it? By benefiting one lifestyle over another, the government is directly promoting that specific lifestyle. Taken to the extreme, the government could just as easily imprision those who don't live the way the government commands and claim that those people have complete freedom, they just don't have the "benefit" of walking around that other people get. The lack of these benefits could be considered a fine for not living the way the government intends, or more accurately, the government is promoting one lifestyle over another. To any extent which the government does this, we all lose a bit of freedom to behave in the manner that we want. Of course there are good reasons to restrict freedom, taking into consideration murder and stealing, however those are actions that cause harm to people; they are restricted to protect the rights of others, to stop harm. I do not think that any of the reasons you listed are harms that opposite-sex marriage does not also imply, and I think most of the harms you listed are not really harms at all as explained above. In fact, same-sex marriage brings plenty of benefits (again, as I explained above). This in no way warrants the restriction of freedom.Finally I come to happiness: this is the end of all governments. Governments exist to make as many of their citizens as happy as possible, or at least give them all as much an opportunity to persue happiness as they can. The ideas of freedom and equality are really only a means to help people achieve happiness, to help the achieve the best standard of living they can, to help them be able to do the things in life they want to do, to help people in any way they can. With same-sex marriage, we have the opportunity to help a set of people without bringing harm to anyone. We have the power to give the same rights that we hold to a group of people different from ourselves. We have an opportunity to help people, and I am forced to conclude that we cannot call ourselves equal, we cannot call ourselves the land of the free, and we cannot call ourselves a morally good society if we do not take that opportunity.
attacks
No problem. It seemed like a reasonable request by a reasonable person.In actuality, there are three types of couples: married, gay and heterosexual unmarried. Only the first group get the benefits of marriage. If we broaden the definition of marriage to include same sex couples, wouldn't heterosexual unmarried couples still be discriminated against? And if we did that, then we'd have two new classes of citizens with claims to others' property that they didn't have previously.The point that our society willingly pays for breaks given to heterosexual couples can't be trivialized by saying that it should be all or nothing. Society, as it stands today, is willing to partially subsidize hetero couples and NOT same sex couples. Now, admittedly, those reasons aren't always strictly financial, but I've limited my discussion to those issues.I agree that IF gay marriage is made legal it should be done through the legislature and not the courts. We have also recently seen in the Nov elections that many states aren't comfortable with gay marriage yet.The unfunded mandate law also extends to businesses. If the total cost of instituting gay marriage costs >$50Million, Congress must take that fact into consideration. A cost increase to businesses, state and federal employers of $50Million is certainly going to be surpassed over the lifetime of the statute.You've just made my point for me. It would have the net effect of being an unfunded mandate to businesses and they would have to respond by stopping ALL insurance or adding additional coverage for gay couples. What if that business was a religious institution that was morally opposed to gay marriage. They would be forced to support it, regardless of their moral stance. Isn't the so-called separation of church and state really a double-edged sword designed to protect the church FROM government intervention as well?Agreed except that society has already ruled on whether or not it wants to provide financial incentives to targeted groups, such as minorities and married couples. Court costs will undoubtedly increase as there are property disputes amongst gay partners with new-found rights. It's unavoidable, especially in cases of inheritance. Imagine an elderly gay man dies who had a hetero family prior to a gay marriage and there is a dispute over inheritance. I can foresee many such realistic scenarios.See above comments on society's acceptance to subsidize hetero couples.Fair question. I stated above that society was willing to subsidize hetero marriage because it saw benefits in doing so, but I never enumerated those benefits.Society's Benefits from Marriage:1. Financial security for woman and children 2. Exclusivity for man/woman with penalties for violations of that exclusivity3. Property succession and dissolution upon divorce/death4. Protection from forced testimony about partner5. Societal stability6. Perceived as a sacrament to religious followers7. Establishes legal guardianship of childrenI'm sure that I can think of others, but that should suffice for the time being.The latter, of course. I'm not anti-marriage. In fact I've been "institutionalized" with the same woman for 26 great years so far. I just don't see the benefits to society for promoting gay marriage. All I see are increased chances for abuse of the law, additional costs and a promotion of a lifestyle that I , personally, believe is deviant. (not deviant as in "sinister", but in the sense of "abnormal") But that's not to say that I'm closed minded and can't be persuaded otherwise. There are other things that I consider deviant, but can tolerate, none-the-less.

They're not legally recognized because they don't meet the legal criteria for marriage, ie one man, one woman. A cat doesn't meet the legal definition of a dog. Do we change the definition of dog to appease the cat? That's the real question to be answered by society.Actually, I pulled the number out of the air for illustrative purposes only, but after reading the CBO report, I see that I wasn't far off. They predicted 600,000 gay couples would want to get married it allowed.
attacks
So the fact that it is not legally recognized is the problem. What is the reason it's not legally recognized? Because the couple is gay.Where do you get the figure of 500,000 gay couples who want to immediately be married? Would these gay couples beat the straight couples in some kind of a race to the weddings occurring at the same time, or occurring over the course of a month or a year?

That's a legitimate point of contention, IMO. I think that the debate should be undertaken as any other policy debate is handled. What are the costs (both monetary and social) and benefits (both monetarial and social) of enacting such a law.We've disagreed civily in the past even when our words were misinterpreted. As I stated in an earlier post, I believe that gay marriage has to be undertaken from a federal standpoint. The 1996 Defense of Marriage Act defines a marriage as a union between one man and one woman. If a state redefines marriage differently than the federal statute, then it is likely to be challenged in the SCOTUS. Agreed. There's no ground in which to debate gay marriage if you follow a strict Christian interpretation of the Bible. I have to keep backing up to the point that society on a whole accepts the costs associated with hetero marriages because it sees the benefits in them.I believe that most married couples file jointly, but I'll do a little research before stating it's a fact.SS, Medicare and employer paid healthcare bennies aren't state issues, so I don't understand your assertion. emoticonXConfused

Some sort of marriage is needed when you need to deal with health insurance, inheritance and child custody. The point is that marriage was created for these reasons and served it purpose well. It just is not extended to all couples.I appreciate JP's feeling that this should be a civil debate. I hope that I have come off as civil (or as best as I can being the sarcastic boy that I can be). My problem with many of your arguments is the are Federal argumetns and marriage is a states' issue. How do you account for that?Your arguments (and rightfully so) are mostly financial, which I have to say is much more interesting a debate than the normal religious stuff. BUT I can't see where the line is drawn between the christian right wanting more couples to marry and gay couples marrying. Both by your arguments would have the same effect, but again you keep talking in federal terms and marriage is a states' issue. Although many of the benefits are Federal, likejoint tax returns. Most heterosexual couples don't file joint returns either. There needs to be a large difference between the two incomes for that to be a good way to file. Other than that the rest of the benefits are at the state level.How do you respond to that?

I guess I'd have to reluctantly admit that it didn't take long for some....but I'm an eternal optimist and think civility will prevail. Besides, I try not to judge everybody by the acts of a few.I prefaced my argument by saying that I wouldn't address the religious argument, only the financial ones.I agree in some respects and disagree with others. What bothered me in previous debates was the intellectual dishonesty exhibited by most supporters when I would make the assertion that "it's all about the Benjamins".They said that they supported gay marriage "on principle" not fiscal grounds.Jaxian was one of the first to admit that economics was a significant part of the issue.
supports
Heh, well we'll see how long they can do it.It seems that the bulk of your opposition to gay marriage is based on financial reasons. Am I to assume then that if it turned out gay marriage cost nothing more to society financially, and perhaps even helped society in that regard, you'd no longer be opposed to gay marriage?To some extent I agree with you, in that any group could come along who didn't want to have to pay property taxes to transfer property or wanted to claim SS entitlements and simply try to be recognized as a group for which marriage benefits should apply. That is in effect, what gays are doing. In their case they are doing it by changing the standard we use to determine what suffices for a marriage: opposite gender couples.

You do, generally, if you want your spouse's employer paying for it. And the cost of private health insurance isn't trivial. It can be several thousands/year for young people and $10 thousand/year for older couples.
supports
Inheritance and child custody are two things I oppose along with the statist recognition of marriage. These things are authoritarian and inegalitarian. But health insurance? Correct me if I'm wrong, but single people can get health insurance. You don't need marriage for that.

It isn't unconstitutional because any citizen is free to marry a member of the opposite sex as defined by The Defense of Marriage Act of 1996.Ah yes, another slippery slope. The same slippery slope that bigamists can slide down in the future if marriage can be redefined yet one more time. And that's what happens when something doesn't meet the definition of a bakery. You get short-loafed instead. :)

YOu have some good points here, but the problem with this society right now is that Civil Unions are seen as "not as good". Why do some get marriage and some get civil unions. There is no other place in the legal system where this sort of separtion of class exists. Why it is unconstitutional. It defies equality.Civil unions are like marriage light. Would straights be allowed to have civil unions if they don't want to marry?What will people say when the first straight couples sues for a civil union saying they want the same rights as gays.Civil Unions are sorta why have a loaf of bread when everyone else gets the whole bakery?

This is circular reasoning however. It's stating that marriage simply is heterosexual, and so completely ends debate.

I'm not "married" (pun imtended) to the term class. I could just as easily said "new group" or new "category". The key point was "new".I didn't go into enough detail with respect to unmarried hetero couples. Right now, most states have "common law" marriage statutes in which a partner of the opposite sex can lay claim to a portion of their unmarried partner's property if they've lived together for a defined period of time. Allowing gay marriage without also rewriting common law statutes discriminates against unmarried heteros living together. Without legal gay marriage, gay partners don't have to worry about common law statutes being used against them by their partner. Does that explain it better?Sorry for my lack of clarity in prior posts WRT society's willingness to foot the bill.The CBO estimate was ~$1Billion/ year in additional costs for legalizing 600,000 gay marriages.An interesting scenario. Let me reply with an example of my own. The top 5% of wage earners pay over 30% of all Federal Income Taxes in the US because the majority of US citizens supported higher taxation on the wealthy. Is that not similar to your scenario, except that in your scenario the blacks footed the bill and in mine the wealthy footed the bill? But I digress.To get back to your point, there are "inalienable rights" and there are social standards. Gay marriage doesn't fall in the category of inalienable rights, IMO, it falls in the area of social standards. Social standards are subject to evolution, adaptation and refinement as determined by society as a whole. These types of laws aren't carved in stone, so to speak, but are semi-fluid and change as social mores change.Right now, the majority of Americans DO believe that gay marriage IS wrong. This has been demonstrated in 19 states that overwhelmingly voted against gay marriage. You have your work cut out for you in trying to convince the majority of Americans that there is a benefit to society in allowing gay marriages.If the cost of initiating gay marriage is >$50Million, then it is an unfunded mandate by definition and as the CBO calculated, the costs will far exceed $50Million.It is one of several reasons enumerated, not the only one. Your arguing apples and oranges. There are laws already on the books, prior to the unfunded mandate statute, that prohibit discrimination in employment.Gays partners have no legal status today, so the granting of legal status to them will result in increased expenditures by business.Not true. If the government changes the definition of handicapped to include a previously non-covered group, and the net effect is to increase costs >$50Million, it is an unfunded mandate. Back during GW1's presidency, they changed the definition of disabled and incurred increased costs through the ADA to pay drunks and drug addicts benefits. http://www.usccr.gov/pubs/ada/ch4.htmThe redefining of "disabled" did, indeed, cost a sizeable amount of money.It's not a loophole if the gay partner has no legal standing. As far as the employer is concerned, the partner is a non-issue. Now, if you could prove that an employer didn't hire you because YOU were gay, that'd be a whole different ballgame.To which I would refer you back to my previous paragraph on mores and inalienable rights.Yes, I read the CBO report. :)You assume that the majority want gays to enjoy those same benefits. That's a big assumption.By exclusive, I meant monogomous. Surely you aren't going to argue that promiscuity is a benefit to society? ;) I'm not familiar with any religion that promotes gay marriage. Enlighten me.Homosexuality is deviant in the sense that it isn't "the norm". That doesn't mean that it can't have benefits that outweigh its 'abnormal" nature. I'm a very strong advocate for kids and I believe that any loving couple is better than a single parent home or similar.The concept of equality is a lot easier to conceptualize than to put into practice. We, as a society, preach equality in principle, but practice inequality in all aspects of our lives. As I mentioned above, the tax code is a great example of institutionalized inequality. Businesses practice institutionalized inequality daily. For example, I am considered, by my employer, to be an HCI (highly compensated individual). As a result, I pay a much higher rate for the same healthcare coverage that my fellow employees get. Is that fair? I guess as I get older, I worry less about abstract concepts that sound good in theory but don't exist in practice.Interesting. What you call a fine for non-compliance, I call a benefit FOR compliance. There are lots of examples of laws designed to promote social changes. Tax codes that favor married couples is but one example. Another would be IRAs. Uncle Sam rewards people for saving money by deferring taxes on that money. It rewards home owners with deductions for mortgage interest. I don't see rewarding hetero marriage as being any different. The government is promoting hetero marriage.I'd like to see freedom and equality myself. I'd like to see Uncle Sam get out of the business of social engineering, restricting my personal freedom and enslaving my children and grandchildren with ever-growing debt. maybe gays and Conservatives should join forces and bring about changes that will benefit all of us and make us all happy.

The term "classes of citizens" suggests that each class is treated differently. If we have two "classes" which both recieve the same treatment under the law, those classes are really the same class. So by legalizing same-sex marriage, we are not creating any new class, we are allowing more people to enter an already-existing class. It is acceptable to make distinctions about the differences between people in a class, but it is all the same class. That being said, I understand that more people will be moving into a class in which they are granted more benefits under the law. Your statement above does not yet introduce any new ways that allowing more people to join this class is a bad thing.You did suggest that unmarried heterosexual couples would still be discriminated against, even if we allowed same-sex couples to marry. This is simply not the case. If we allowed same-sex couples to marry, the government would be extending the offer to as many people as possible. It gives everyone the freedom to choose whether or not to accept the benefits it offers. It discriminates against no one. Rights are not something that should be handed out only if the politician in charge approves. They are not something that should be taken away simply because your society doesn't want you to have rights. Even annoying people have rights.Aha, this is the type of argument that your previous post was lacking. Your previous post could not be understood as standing against same-sex marriage without making the distinction that you believe those things are okay, but only if society willingly approves them. Now that I have this information, I am able to formulate a response.First, I should point out what has already been mentioned: that it is possible society would be paying less money in taxes if same-sex marriage is passed. I do not claim to know the answer, but I'm sure I can look up some solid facts presented by those who know more on this topic than I do and relay the information to you as well as posting a link to it.However, the reason that I do not know for certain whether society will be paying money or saving it is that I do not believe it matters. I do not believe the laws we pass on how money is spent should be related to the will of the society to pay that money. The reason for this is that we are not actually talking about the will of society, we are talking about the will of the majority. Let me pose this situation: we have a society of ninty percent white and ten percent is black people. The white people vote that the black people must must pay a fee each month. This fee would then be distributed equally into the bank accounts of all of the white people. Basically, the white people vote that the black people must pay them money. Is this justifyable? I think we will both agree that it is not. But couldn't it be said that it is the will of society? I mean, ninty percent of the people voted for it, right? Well, yes, ninty percent of people voted for it, but that doesn't mean it is acceptable for people to pass such a law. It also isn't really the will of everyone in the society, it is the will of the majority, which is abusing their power. The majority is making the minority suffer to benefit itself.Now, you may be thinking "that's a totally different situation than same-sex marriage." But is it really? The majority and minority don't have to be black and white, they could be Christian and Muslim, German and Italian, or even straight and gay. It doesn't matter what group of people we're talking about; it is absurd to think that the minority should have to benefit the majority, even if the majority of people in a society vote for that to happen. Now if we assume that marriage does cause dependency and does force people to pay for it (whether those people be businesses or individuals), then we must concede that those non-married people are somehow paying or losing out in order to benefit the married people. We are also saying that only the majority, heterosexual couples, are allowed to get married; they are the only ones entitled to this benefit. Tell me, do you really think that homosexual couples agree to a definition of marriage that does not include same-sex relationships? Would you vote to pay for someone else's marriage if they would not return the favor for you? Even if same-sex couples did agree to this, it would be out of compassion, not because it is any more fair than whites forcing blacks to pay them.So my point above is that simply because society "agrees" to something does not mean that is morally correct to obey them. In fact, it may be just as likely to be morally incorrect. This reason is why we have legislators whose job it is to think these things through in the first place. Our federal government was designed not only to balance power across its different branches, but to balance out the power that the majority has to oppress the minority (but that is a different discussion, more of which can be read about in the Federalist Papers).I should also point out here that even though you make the claim that society has not decided to pay for same-sex marriage, my argument here is not that we should force it upon society against its will but that the individuals in the society should change their viewpoint. People like you and I should be willing to grant marriage to any two people in love, not just a specific kind of two people. In effect, you are arguing that people should think same-sex marriage is wrong because society thinks same-sex marriage is wrong. But people make up the society, so you're really arguing that people should think same-sex marriage is wrong because people think same-sex marriage is wrong. I do not think that I can agree with that chain of logic.I should start by saying that this is not a reason to disapprove of same-sex marriage. Certainly if the legislature passed same-sex marriage, it could not be called an unfunded mandate. Also, is an argument not about why same-sex marriage causes harm or is otherwise unjustiable, it is an argument about why a specific method of legalizing same-sex marriage might be considered illegal. So whether you think this is an unfunded mandate or not, it is really not justification to disagree with same-sex marriage.That being said, such a ruling would not be an unfunded mandate. As I think examples illustrate points very well, let us assume that some businesses are paying people different amounts of money depending on their race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or something equally absurd. The courts get this case and rule that the business must not use race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or whatever the trait may be as a factor in determining salary. This is not really an unfunded mandate; it isn't telling a business that it has to raise the salaries of the oppressed group of people to match everyone else's, it is simply saying that the salaries must be distributed evenly. The business would certainly be justified in lowering everyone's salary, splitting the total salary budget up equally, or partaking in whatever method it chose in order to meet the court's ruling. The same could be said of health care; if the court rules that the sex of the people involved in a marriage cannot be used as a factor in determing whether those people get health care benefits and they allow same-sex marriage, then businesses would not be forced to increase costs, they would be forced to treat each of their employees equally in whatever way they saw fit. The same budget could certainly be dispersed equally in health care benefits.Another factor to consider is that businesses are not really the subject here, we are only considering allowing more people to engage in marriage. We wouldn't be forcing a business to immediately take action, they would continue their standard pattern of giving people health care benefits based on their marital status. More people would be allowed to get married, and they would thus have more benefits to disperse, but certainly no business policy is changed in any way. As an example, the courts might extend the definition of what is considered "handicap". Perhaps they issue a ruling that blind people are now officially added to the "handicap" list. The courts aren't forcing businesses to make new accomodations in this case, they are simply telling businesses to keep doing what they've been doing, though more people might be allowed to take part in the existing accomodations.A final note to consider is that disallowing same-sex couples from getting the same marriage benefits from businesses in effect gives businesses a loophole through which they can hire people without having to give those people benefits. Not the best argument, but you seemed interested in creative loophole concepts.This is addressed in my writings about society possibly saving money and how it wouldn't matter even if they did not in my writings above.Excellent, now let me list the benefits of same-sex relationships:1. Financial security for women and children.2. Financial security for men and children.3. No exclusivity for man/woman with no penalties for violations of that exclusivity4. Property succession and dissolution upon divorce/death5. Protection from testimony about partner6. Societal stability7. Periceved as sacrament to religious followers.8. Establishes legal guardianship of children.And that is just the beginning! Did you know there are over 1,000 benefits granted to married couples? All those could benefit both same-sex couples and opposite-sex couples if we allowed same-sex marriage.As you can see, the same set of arguments that you use in support of opposite-sex marriage can be used to support same-sex marriage. I think some of them speak for themselves, but if you have more questions on them, let me know. As for the ones that don't, I will go into more detail.1 and 2: Just as there are male-male couples, there are female-female couples. Considering that same-sex couples very often have children, it is just as important to make them financially secure and able to raise those children as it is to do so with opposite-sex couples.3: This I feel is an important one. I don't see your exclusivity of marriage to be a good thing for any reason whatsoever. First of all, there is absolutely no reason to suggest that same-sex parents would make worse parents than opposite-sex parents. I've heard a few comments like "the kids will be teased more in school", but in truth, a kid is just as likely to be teased because his parents are overweight, don't speak English, are too protective, or any of a million other reasons that don't matter. I've heard the same said about the child feeling different, and those same examples can be used to show a child feeling different. In truth, every child has to come to terms with his or her families' differences, but just because a child's family is different from someone else's doesn't make it worse.Now then, I did write that the lack of exclusivity is a bad thing. Some of the reasons I wrote this are because of equal rights for all couples, freedom to live the way you choose, and granting everyone the same opportunity at happiness. I think you understand that these are very good things, and perhaps you get a good idea of how same-sex marriage promotes these things from what I wrote above. If not, I will go into more detail. But another very important benefit comes from giving same-sex couples the right to marry that may not be so intuitive. These couples have more incentive to have children. It is true that often same-sex couples have their children because of previous relationships, but it is equally common that they get their children through adoption or foster parenting. This is a very good thing. The life of a child in an adoption home or child placement center is a very horrible one. The child lives with no family and the government is forced to pay for all of his or her living expenses. Such a home is no place for a child to grow up, and we have far more children in these homes than people are willing to take in. Allowing same-sex couples to marry would give these children loving, caring families, and that is something that changes the lives of those children for the better in every way possible.7: Same-sex couples certainly have religion, and are very often Christian. Marriage is as important religiously to them as it is to anyone else. Now, I know that any sort of religous marriage is already legal and that it is only government recognition of the partnership that is lacking, but as you said, it is religious perception. It is usually just as religiously important to same-sex couples to be married as it is for opposite-sex couples, and no one should be able to tell those people that the government cannot recognize their relationship.8: Well, I think I explained this well in point 3.Well, it may surprise you that I believe that it is deviant to believe that same-sex marriage is immoral (in the sense that it is abnormal). This is because I believe that it is normal for most people to want to treat others the way they wish to be treated themselves. I believe it is normal for others to work toward the happiness of others, especially when that happiness does not interfere with their own happiness. But it does not follow for me that one can oppose same-sex marriage and follow those rules. It seems to me that people have been told or told themselves that same-sex marriage is bad for so long that they have sort of convinced themselves to deviate from human compassion on this one issue. Well, I suppose what I just said doesn't really mean much of anything, just that someone who want to spend his or her life with the one he or she loves does not qualify as "deviant" behavior in my book. It is not something that must be "tolerated", it is something that should be enjoyed for the good present in its nature.You wrote that you do not see the benefits of same-sex marriage. I know I went into the benefits of allowing same-sex couples to adopt, but I also spoke on same-sex marriage promoting equality, freedom, and happiness. Let me expand on that.Equality seems very simple to explain. Currently those who love someone of the opposite sex and choose to enter a relationship with that person are granted a set of benefits under the law. This same set of benefits could be extended to those who love someone of the same sex, but it is not, and they are still forced to pay any costs in taxes that salary cuts from businesses that might be accrued through these benefits being bestowed upon someone else. This simple fact violates equality, and I think this is clear and easy to understand. What may not be clear is why equality is so imporant. Granting a set of rights to one group of people that another does not have elevate the first group over the second. The more equality is removed, the more one group is elevated over the other and the more that first group is leeching off of the second group. If the first group could provide those same bonuses to the second group without causing any real harm, the first group is obligated to do so. For the powerful to take things for themselves that they could just as easily share with the weak crosses the line of moral evil.Freedom might be a bit more difficult to understand. Though the government is not granting the same set of benefits that it gives opposite-sex couples to same-sex couples, it is not actually taking any anyone's freedom to behave in the manner they please. Or is it? By benefiting one lifestyle over another, the government is directly promoting that specific lifestyle. Taken to the extreme, the government could just as easily imprision those who don't live the way the government commands and claim that those people have complete freedom, they just don't have the "benefit" of walking around that other people get. The lack of these benefits could be considered a fine for not living the way the government intends, or more accurately, the government is promoting one lifestyle over another. To any extent which the government does this, we all lose a bit of freedom to behave in the manner that we want. Of course there are good reasons to restrict freedom, taking into consideration murder and stealing, however those are actions that cause harm to people; they are restricted to protect the rights of others, to stop harm. I do not think that any of the reasons you listed are harms that opposite-sex marriage does not also imply, and I think most of the harms you listed are not really harms at all as explained above. In fact, same-sex marriage brings plenty of benefits (again, as I explained above). This in no way warrants the restriction of freedom.Finally I come to happiness: this is the end of all governments. Governments exist to make as many of their citizens as happy as possible, or at least give them all as much an opportunity to persue happiness as they can. The ideas of freedom and equality are really only a means to help people achieve happiness, to help the achieve the best standard of living they can, to help them be able to do the things in life they want to do, to help people in any way they can. With same-sex marriage, we have the opportunity to help a set of people without bringing harm to anyone. We have the power to give the same rights that we hold to a group of people different from ourselves. We have an opportunity to help people, and I am forced to conclude that we cannot call ourselves equal, we cannot call ourselves the land of the free, and we cannot call ourselves a morally good society if we do not take that opportunity.

I'm not sure it's circular reasoning, exactly, but is an interesting reference to make, since we're changing a law, and we change laws every day. Still, the reference seems a little valid, maybe: Should we change our laws? Absolutely yes, if there is reason to do so. Should we change the definition of dog to include cat? Absolutely yes, if there is reason to do so.

This is circular reasoning however. It's stating that marriage simply is heterosexual, and so completely ends debate.

It would descriminate against unmarried people, gay or straight. However, as it offers gay couples the same benefits and protections and respsonsibilities and rights as straight couples, the cost is worth it, just as the cost is worth it for straight couples. Gay couples have the same needs for these things, as straight couples have.The majority isn't always right. It's true that advocates of marriage equality have a lot of work to do. But again, the cost is worth it, just as it is with straight couples, as it will benefit gay couples in the same ways. It will mean better employee health and job satisfaction and increased productivity for the gay employees just as it will for the straight employees.This doesn't mean that allowing gay couples to marry is an unjustifiable decision. It doesn't mean gay couples shouldn't have the same rights, responsibilities, and benefits as straight couples.Unitarians, Metropolitan Community Church, the United Church of Canada.We can talk about other forms of inequality too, against other groups of people, such as the poor and the homeless. But it doesn't address the issue of marriage inequality for gays and lesbians. Gay people don't even have the option of getting married so they can enjoy those tax codes.

I'm not "married" (pun imtended) to the term class. I could just as easily said "new group" or new "category". The key point was "new".I didn't go into enough detail with respect to unmarried hetero couples. Right now, most states have "common law" marriage statutes in which a partner of the opposite sex can lay claim to a portion of their unmarried partner's property if they've lived together for a defined period of time. Allowing gay marriage without also rewriting common law statutes discriminates against unmarried heteros living together. Without legal gay marriage, gay partners don't have to worry about common law statutes being used against them by their partner. Does that explain it better?Sorry for my lack of clarity in prior posts WRT society's willingness to foot the bill.The CBO estimate was ~$1Billion/ year in additional costs for legalizing 600,000 gay marriages.An interesting scenario. Let me reply with an example of my own. The top 5% of wage earners pay over 30% of all Federal Income Taxes in the US because the majority of US citizens supported higher taxation on the wealthy. Is that not similar to your scenario, except that in your scenario the blacks footed the bill and in mine the wealthy footed the bill? But I digress.To get back to your point, there are "inalienable rights" and there are social standards. Gay marriage doesn't fall in the category of inalienable rights, IMO, it falls in the area of social standards. Social standards are subject to evolution, adaptation and refinement as determined by society as a whole. These types of laws aren't carved in stone, so to speak, but are semi-fluid and change as social mores change.Right now, the majority of Americans DO believe that gay marriage IS wrong. This has been demonstrated in 19 states that overwhelmingly voted against gay marriage. You have your work cut out for you in trying to convince the majority of Americans that there is a benefit to society in allowing gay marriages.If the cost of initiating gay marriage is >$50Million, then it is an unfunded mandate by definition and as the CBO calculated, the costs will far exceed $50Million.It is one of several reasons enumerated, not the only one. Your arguing apples and oranges. There are laws already on the books, prior to the unfunded mandate statute, that prohibit discrimination in employment.Gays partners have no legal status today, so the granting of legal status to them will result in increased expenditures by business.Not true. If the government changes the definition of handicapped to include a previously non-covered group, and the net effect is to increase costs >$50Million, it is an unfunded mandate. Back during GW1's presidency, they changed the definition of disabled and incurred increased costs through the ADA to pay drunks and drug addicts benefits. http://www.usccr.gov/pubs/ada/ch4.htmThe redefining of "disabled" did, indeed, cost a sizeable amount of money.It's not a loophole if the gay partner has no legal standing. As far as the employer is concerned, the partner is a non-issue. Now, if you could prove that an employer didn't hire you because YOU were gay, that'd be a whole different ballgame.To which I would refer you back to my previous paragraph on mores and inalienable rights.Yes, I read the CBO report. :)You assume that the majority want gays to enjoy those same benefits. That's a big assumption.By exclusive, I meant monogomous. Surely you aren't going to argue that promiscuity is a benefit to society? ;) I'm not familiar with any religion that promotes gay marriage. Enlighten me.Homosexuality is deviant in the sense that it isn't "the norm". That doesn't mean that it can't have benefits that outweigh its 'abnormal" nature. I'm a very strong advocate for kids and I believe that any loving couple is better than a single parent home or similar.The concept of equality is a lot easier to conceptualize than to put into practice. We, as a society, preach equality in principle, but practice inequality in all aspects of our lives. As I mentioned above, the tax code is a great example of institutionalized inequality. Businesses practice institutionalized inequality daily. For example, I am considered, by my employer, to be an HCI (highly compensated individual). As a result, I pay a much higher rate for the same healthcare coverage that my fellow employees get. Is that fair? I guess as I get older, I worry less about abstract concepts that sound good in theory but don't exist in practice.Interesting. What you call a fine for non-compliance, I call a benefit FOR compliance. There are lots of examples of laws designed to promote social changes. Tax codes that favor married couples is but one example. Another would be IRAs. Uncle Sam rewards people for saving money by deferring taxes on that money. It rewards home owners with deductions for mortgage interest. I don't see rewarding hetero marriage as being any different. The government is promoting hetero marriage.I'd like to see freedom and equality myself. I'd like to see Uncle Sam get out of the business of social engineering, restricting my personal freedom and enslaving my children and grandchildren with ever-growing debt. maybe gays and Conservatives should join forces and bring about changes that will benefit all of us and make us all happy.

I understand, but it sounded as though you were saying that there is some sort of special treatment going on, and I wanted to clear it up that we are moving people without the special treatment into an already existing category.Well, I disagree that it discriminates against unmarried heterosexual couples; those couples still have the choice to get married to recieve the benefits of marriage or stay unmarried. Same-sex couples do not have that choice currently, and all we are talking about is giving them that choice. Unmarried heterosexual couples are not affected and have the same choice available to them.Though now that I think about it, you may be saying that the common law statutes are applies to unmarried opposite-sex couples but not to unmarried same-sex couples? Well, in all honesty I think that is very unfair regardless of marriage status. The same common law rules should apply to both heterosexual and homosexual couples. I see no reason why this wouldn't be updated along with marriage.As for common law statutes being used against same-sex partners, well again, that is an argument against marriage or common law statutes, not against same-sex marriage specifically. It isn't a reason to disallow marriage to same-sex couples but allow it for opposite-sex couples.Well, HRC estimates that the costs would be negligable and that some governments would actually save money. They site many studies on the issue, which I have not taken the time to look up, as I think this sort of statistic is worthless. It is unreasonable to ask same-sex couples to pay for the marriage of opposite-sex couples without asking opposite-sex couples to return this payment. Still, you seem very concerned about it, so I will provide this link:http://www.hrc.org/Template.cfm?Sect...entDisplay.cfmIt is an interest group in favor of gay rights, yes, but that doesn't make them wrong. I did have a link to an actual study on the topic, but I cannot seem to find it. I'm sure if I scoured the Internet more, I could come up with something.I did not say that I agree with a tax incline, and perhaps that is a discussion for a different time. However there is a difference that I should point out. There is a reason for the tax incline: those with little money will suffer a lot more if they have to pay hijgher taxes. Those with high taxes are much more able to give money without losing those things essential to a decent standard of living. Is it equal? Interestingly it could be viewed as an attempt to give everyone a more equal income, however it could also be viewed as an inequality involving one group of people paying lots of taxes and another group paying not as much. I won't debate whether it is the type of equality we want to promote, I'll just assume that a tax incline removes equality. But remember, there is a reason behind that tax incline. The goal of government is to promote happiness as much as possible. In this case, the government could be viewed as sacrificing equality in favor of happiness. But whether that tradeoff is really working or is really a good idea is all up for debate. The point is: there is reasoning behind a tax incline based on income. There is no good reason behind giving marriage benefits to people based on their sex and there are plenty of reasons to do just the opposite. Or at least it is my goal to prove that in these posts.I don't think every law is carved into stone such that there is one right way to do it that lasts throughout the ages. I do, however, think that there are some actions which are inexcusable at any point in history. One of those actions is taking away or denying benefits to people that you give to yourself without a good reason. I believe that using the law in such a fashion is an example of the majority abusing its power, of mob rule in a sense. It is an example of the powerful group of people elevating themselves over the minority, and whether or not that is acceptable generations from now, I know that it is not morally right today.Well, certainly I don't expect to change the minds of millions of Americans, and that is not my goal. My goal is to convince readers of my writing that Americans SHOULD agree with same-sex marriage because it is morally correct to do so.Yes, but what I meant about the legislature passing it is that the legislature could fund it. If there is funding, it becomes a funded mandate. As I've said in the past, though, whether it is classified as an "unfunded mandate" or not does not suggest that same-sex marriage is wrong or right.You are right, but my argument in that paragraph was intended to show that this particular reason does not suggest same-sex marriage is wrong. I discussed your other reasons in other places in my writing.But there were not always laws on the books that prevented these things. I was presenting a hypothetical situation in which those laws are not already on the books. The situtation was intended to show only that a ruling allowing same-sex marriage would not have to cost companies a dime.Oh, well I'm not saying that companies won't be paying more money in health insurance. My point is that allowing same-sex marriage doesn't really change company policy. The company's policy is currently based on the government's definition of marriage. If the government simply allows more people to choose to classify themselves as married, the company may see more more married couples apply for jobs, and it may see more of its employees decide to become married. As it sees these things happening, it can feel free to change its policies as it sees fit. What I mean is that this ruling would not mandate the businesses to make any payments to facillitate a change; all that would happen is a few more of its employees might begin to classify themselves as married and it might be a bit more likely that the company hires in a married person. There is no mandate sent out to the company, there is no change in company policy, and there is no payment that the company is dishing out. If as more married people show up in the workplace, the company decides to change its health care coverage, that is up to the company, but it is not mandated to make any change.Now maybe you can still classify this as an unfunded mandate, but I'm not really so sure that it legally qualifies under the circumstances. Regardless, I've been saying that its status as an unfunded mandate is irrelevant in determining whether it is right to agree with same-sex marriage or not; the fact that companies might have to provide all couples with health care equally instead of only giving health care to couples based on the sex of those involved is a change worth making. Quite a few companies already do it, in fact.Well earlier you seemed interested in the idea that a loophole might exist that allowed people to avoid taxes. In this case I was only suggesting that a loophole could exist which allows companies to save money by hiring gay people instead of straight people in order to cut health insurance costs. As I said, it isn't really a strong argument, but maybe an interesting one.I'm not sure I get what you mean. Are you saying that it is detrimental to society if marriage is not exclusively between a male and a female? If so, you'll need some justification for that. Or are you referring to monogamy here? If so, I'll address that in your comment about monogamy below.If the jury is out on this one, yet you believe it is not out for opposite-sex couples, then I am led to believe that you think somehow marriage keeps opposite-sex couples together in a way that applies to negligable amounts of same-sex couples. To assume that virtually no same-sex couples are held together by marriage indicates to me that you imagine some fundamental difference in same-sex couples that prevents marriage from having any affect on keeping any same-sex couples together. That seems a very unfounded and unreasonable claim; certainly marriage would keep some same-sex couples together. Now, if you are trying to say that marriage might work to a lesser degree on same-sex couples, I would probably agree with you, not based on some fundamental problem with homosexuality, but based on the fact that only the most sexually liberal people are willing to admit to homosexuality in a society where many people look down upon it. Still, if you have any observing or taking part in a same-sex relationship, you probably realize that they aren't much different than opposite-sex relationships and that marriage will undoubtedly have a stability effect on some, though maybe more or maybe less same-sex marriages. But this is still a benefit, and thus it still belongs in my list.I assume nothing of the sort. That statement only relies on that fact that if same-sex couples were allowed to marry, the marriage rights of opposite-sex couples would be unaffected and would remain completely intact.Ah, well that statement does make more sense after rereading what you wrote here. I must first point out that I see no benefits in promoting male/female monogamy over monogamy in general. That could be extended even to say that I don't think promoting specifically male/female monogamy is a good thing because it implies that same-sex monogamy is not a good thing. I do not see any reason to belive that one form of monogamy is better than another.It primarily sounds like you were trying to say that gays are promiscuous. Well, I think that's a complete myth, and that's all there is to it. As evidence, I can present only my own experiences and give you my word that they are the truth. Due to a variety of organizations and clubs that I am a part of, I am familiar with the dating experiences of no less than twenty-five gays and bisexuals. Of those, the one who has dated the most people has dated only three people in the same year. The average number of dates per year in that group is probably less than one. Not a single one of those people has ever cheated or dated more than one person at the same time as far as I am aware. Looking at my heterosexual friends, I know several who have cheated on their girlfriends, and some even choose to engage in sexual activities with girls they've never met before in rooms with other people in them. It is clear to me which group is more promiscuous, though you have only my word to take on the subject. I don't mean to imply that there are no promiscuous homosexuals nor do I mean to imply that my heterosexual friends are representative of heterosexuals as a whole, but I do mean to imply that based on my experiences, there has got to be very significant numbers of homosexuals who are not promiscuous and to whom a your statement above cannot apply. I suspect I may even be describing the vast majority of homosexuals and bisexuals, but I do not have evidence to show this for certain.Also, I should say that even if same-sex couples were very promicuous (which again I do not think is true), allowing them to marry would certainly not make them more promiscuous, it would only reduce that promiscuity, and it would thus be acceptable to include reduced promiscuity on my list of benefits of same-sex marriage.I do not know of any religion that promotes same-sex marriage as something better than opposite-sex marriage, but there are plenty of religions that accept same-sex marriage as equal to opposite-sex marriage. These include: Buddhism, Secular Humanism, Unitarian Universalism, and Liberal Quakers to name a few. There are also countless branches of Christianity that accept it, such as Liberal Christian Protestant. I should also mention that many people do not associate themselves with a specific religion, but they do believe in a higher power and do hold marriage in high esteem. Do not make the mistake of thinking that most gays or bisexuals are atheists. Most are not (though I don't see anything wrong with atheism).You mentioned here that same-sex marriage may have benefits which outweigh its "abnormal" nature. I must point out that even if we consider it abnormal, there is no reason to suggest that abnormal is somehow bad. In a free and equal society, abnormal deserves all the rights and privleges thet normal receives. Any benefits that exist in allowing same-sex marriage aren't being weighed down by abnormality.[QUOTE]The concept of equality is a lot easier to conceptualize than to put into practice. We, as a society, preach equality in principle, but practice inequality in all aspects of our lives. As I mentioned above, the tax code is a great example of institutionalized inequality. Businesses practice institutionalized inequality daily. For example, I am considered, by my employer, to be an HCI (highly compensated individual). As a result, I pay a much higher rate for the same healthcare coverage that my fellow employees get. Is that fair? I guess as I get older, I worry less about abstract concepts that sound good in theory but don't exist in practice.[QUOTE]Well, I won't argue that we will never be truly equal, and I won't argue that equality is the answer to everything, but I will argue that equality is worth striving for and that equality does exist in practice, it is just so ingrained into our mindset that we forget it is there. Compare US law to the laws of Europe before the revolution. In Europe there existed classes of nobles with extra rights under the law as well as kings and royalty with even more rights. As you went higher up in class, you'd get more and more political power. In America, we all have one vote. We all have an equal ability to participate in government. It is true that we use that vote to choose someone to make decisions for us in the government, but our ability to participate in government set a new precedent in equality. Consider even slaves or women's rights. These are cases where equality won out not just in theory but in practice. I will admit that we cannot simply just make everyone equal in every way, but we do our best to give them equal rights and equal represenation. In the case of same-sex marriage, I can think of no reason why we should not extend the same rights that opposite-sex couples have to same-sex couples (and plenty of reasons why we should).Well, I do understand that you call it a benefit for compliance, but my argument was that a benefit for compliance is the same thing as a fine for non-compliance and that in reality, the government is simply promoting one lifestyle over another. That is equivalent to destroying freedom. I do understand that the government rewards people for taking certain actions. IRA's are an example, yes, promoting investment in an IRA does destroy freedom in a sense. But there is at least a debatable reason behind the government using taxpayer money to reward IRA investers. The government wants people to have money in their old age so that they will be happier in the long run. But when the government is promoting heterosexual marriage, it isn't because promoting heterosexual marriage over homosexual marriage is a good thing, and it isn't because heterosexual couples deserve more money or more benefits than same-sex couples. It is because the majority is willing to use religious beliefs as a reason to give themselves more benefits under the law, as a reason to hurt others while benefiting themselves, as a reason to promote their own religoius beliefs over someone else's.Well, many argue that pro gay rights is a conservative. They say that conservatives favor government staying out of people's lives and not dictating the way that people should live. They argue that conservative people are using religion, not conservative principle to stand against gay rights. I don't know if that is true; I do know that whether conservative, liberal, both, or neither, I cannot find a way to call myself a good person if I do not support gay rights.

I'm not "married" (pun imtended) to the term class. I could just as easily said "new group" or new "category". The key point was "new".I didn't go into enough detail with respect to unmarried hetero couples. Right now, most states have "common law" marriage statutes in which a partner of the opposite sex can lay claim to a portion of their unmarried partner's property if they've lived together for a defined period of time. Allowing gay marriage without also rewriting common law statutes discriminates against unmarried heteros living together. Without legal gay marriage, gay partners don't have to worry about common law statutes being used against them by their partner. Does that explain it better?Sorry for my lack of clarity in prior posts WRT society's willingness to foot the bill.The CBO estimate was ~$1Billion/ year in additional costs for legalizing 600,000 gay marriages.An interesting scenario. Let me reply with an example of my own. The top 5% of wage earners pay over 30% of all Federal Income Taxes in the US because the majority of US citizens supported higher taxation on the wealthy. Is that not similar to your scenario, except that in your scenario the blacks footed the bill and in mine the wealthy footed the bill? But I digress.To get back to your point, there are "inalienable rights" and there are social standards. Gay marriage doesn't fall in the category of inalienable rights, IMO, it falls in the area of social standards. Social standards are subject to evolution, adaptation and refinement as determined by society as a whole. These types of laws aren't carved in stone, so to speak, but are semi-fluid and change as social mores change.Right now, the majority of Americans DO believe that gay marriage IS wrong. This has been demonstrated in 19 states that overwhelmingly voted against gay marriage. You have your work cut out for you in trying to convince the majority of Americans that there is a benefit to society in allowing gay marriages.If the cost of initiating gay marriage is >$50Million, then it is an unfunded mandate by definition and as the CBO calculated, the costs will far exceed $50Million.It is one of several reasons enumerated, not the only one. Your arguing apples and oranges. There are laws already on the books, prior to the unfunded mandate statute, that prohibit discrimination in employment.Gays partners have no legal status today, so the granting of legal status to them will result in increased expenditures by business.Not true.

Back during GW1's presidency, they changed the definition of disabled and incurred increased costs through the ADA to pay drunks and drug addicts benefits. http://www.usccr.gov/pubs/ada/ch4.htmThe redefining of "disabled" did, indeed, cost a sizeable amount of money.It's not a loophole if the gay partner has no legal standing. As far as the employer is concerned, the partner is a non-issue.

Exactly my point, just as a cat can never be considered a dog just because someone wants it to be.To me, and I'm guessing millions of others, the term gay marriage is an oxymoron. That's not to say that we shouldn't consider the possibility of allowing gay unions with, possibly, equivalent rights to hetero couples if we, as a society, see the benefit in doing so. For example, prior to FDR, the concept of state welfare was considered ludicrous and unconstitutional, but he was able to get enough support (and enough political muscle) to change society's mind on the role of the Federal gov't once he demonstrated the "good" that doing so had on America in its most dire time of need. People were willing to sacrifice a little freedom for security just as Ben Franklin had warned against. Now, I'll be the first to tell you that I think FDR was the biggest threat to American freedom that ever existed, but one can't argue his ability to change public opinion on the role of the Federal gov't.

This is circular reasoning however. It's stating that marriage simply is heterosexual, and so completely ends debate.

It can be an oxymoron because it already exists in Canada, Mass, and parts of Europe. It is already there.Just because up till now Gay marriage wasn't in the scope of your possiblities doesn't mean it won't be later. Up until now no one thought gays would ever matter. So the country is in the stages of acceptance. Denial, bargaining, anger, depression and soon acceptance. I will show you.1. Denial. Mass declared it would have gay marriage. The country said no it will never happen. The legislature will stop it, the courts will stop it. Denails sets in.2. Then the Bargining, "what about civil unions. We will give you Civil Unions and that will save marriage from the gays. 3. Anger.....Ammedments everywhere......4. Depression....we can't stop this.....it is just happening.......5. Acceptance. OH! You guys are married ....cool.

Honey, your analogy is all wrong. If cats are cats but dogs aren't allowed to be dogs...would be more to the point. If the law allowed cats to mate with cats and dogs were FORCED to mate with cats is how it is similar to what we have now. What we are trying to do is make it so dogs can mate with dogs without being discriminated against. Damn, what is so frelling hard about this?"To mate" is not just a sexual issue. Even with ducks, who "mate" for life, it goes way beyond sexual activity. It's an emotional bonding.
attacks
They're not legally recognized because they don't meet the legal criteria for marriage, ie one man, one woman. A cat doesn't meet the legal definition of a dog. Do we change the definition of dog to appease the cat? That's the real question to be answered by society.Actually, I pulled the number out of the air for illustrative purposes only, but after reading the CBO report, I see that I wasn't far off. They predicted 600,000 gay couples would want to get married it allowed.

It concerns reason, as Jaxian said earlier. What are the logical reasons for marriage discrimination against gays and lesbians?

Here are some other reports on fiscal effects of gay marriage and the CBO report........These findings parallel the conclusions of recent studies that were conducted by IGLSS and the Williams Project about the impact of granting marriage and domestic partnership rights at the state level. The most recent study showed that California would have a net savings of $22-25 million per year if same-sex couples could marry. A 2003 study of New Jersey’s Domestic Partnership Act, which goes into effect in July, predicts that the state is likely to see a net savings of $61 million per year by giving same-sex couples rights. http://www.iglss.org/pubs/highlights/latest_news.html

A few more thoughts on unfunded mandates... Though looking at wsm's post it does seem that same-sex marriage would not cost taxpayers money, I have more evidence which suggests that even if it did cost taxpayers money, it would not fall under the category of "unfunded mandate."Looking at the Unfunded Mandate Act: http://www.doi.gov/nrl/RegWeb/Umra1.htmIt appears that under the exclusions act is the point that this shall not apply to any regulation which "enforces constitutional rights of individuals". Since the courts would most certainly be saying that same-sex marriage is a constitutional right because of the fourteenth ammendment (which reads in part, "No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."), unfunded mandates cannot apply to a court ruling in this case.

Only because they've forced the name marriage onto a different sort of 'union.' Might as well have renamed "cats" to "dogs" in order to make a cat as much like a dog as possible.

It's actually totally opposite. Currently gays can have sex together, just not marry. Marriage is about a lot more than sex.

You really are so homophobic and yet you claim not to be, so really a hypocrite would define you better. You have no idea what it means to be loved or you would understand that gays have love not sex.only in your bigotry is this true. for those of us in loving commited realtionships....I think it is a step towards recognizing love comes in all forms and you are only jealous because you must lack it to say something like this.and you should be for them now, but you are not, that really does make you the bigot that you are. I understand those like JP who are not against gay rights but want clarifycation on them. You just don't want gays to be happy. Guess what. Like it or not I am happy without your consent.no perversion, just my love for another man. If that bothers you turn you head and look the other way. I pay the same taxes as you , I expect the same rights.Maybe that is what happiness is to you. The world is a mirror. What you hate in other is what you hate about yourself.Happiness to me is curling up each night with my partner. I don't have to have sex. I do want to curl up knowing he is there with me, knowing he loves me and I love him. I like the idea that we will grow old together and laugh together. Tonight for fun we went out to a bar we use to go to. We realy don't go to bars anymore. We had such a blast laughing abut the songs they played and what those songs reminded us of and we laughed and smiled at each other. That is what happiness is to me. It is also knowing that he wakes up everyday and puts on a pot of coffee, even though he doesn't drink it. He doesn it for me......it is knowing that he does all these little things for me that he knows will make me smile and I try my best to retrun the favor. Sorry if that bothers your xtian butt, but I love my partner and love the idea we will grow old together. I would like us to have some protections like other couple who are straight, but if we don't it changes nothing about how I feel for him.....you are just a bigot. You think gays only think about sex...we don't.you think that we have some agenda...we don't.we are living our lives, regardless of people like you and enjoying ourselves. I wake up every morning to a smile and a kiss. As I leave to go to work I get told to drive careful and call at lunch. I like it.......I am in love...sorry if you think that is a sin...and if you do...go ******* yourself.

But you forget that The 1996 Defense of Marriage Act specifically says that marriage is a union between man and woman and that any state may refuse to recognize any other state's gay marriage statute. In effect, it nullifies the full faith and credit clause in the 14th.

Though looking at wsm's post it does seem that same-sex marriage would not cost taxpayers money, I have more evidence which suggests that even if it did cost taxpayers money, it would not fall under the category of "unfunded mandate."Looking at the Unfunded Mandate Act: http://www.doi.gov/nrl/RegWeb/Umra1.htmIt appears that under the exclusions act is the point that this shall not apply to any regulation which "enforces constitutional rights of individuals". Since the courts would most certainly be saying that same-sex marriage is a constitutional right because of the fourteenth ammendment (which reads in part, "No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."), unfunded mandates cannot apply to a court ruling in this case.

I believe something about you is a "bane" and a "perversion". Is this an argument which justifies discrimination and inequality against you? No. No, it's not. He wants the right to marry. Perhaps you are the one hung up on gay sex.

Homosexuality is a bane. It is more akin to moving back into the times of slavery than moving out of it. You need to stop sugarcoating it and portraying it as something so benign. Allowing homosexual marriage is a step backwards for this country, not a step forwards like civil rights in the 60s. I was FOR civil rights in the 60s. I was always against things like segregation, but this issue is just you expecting America to give a stamp of approval on perversion in the form of marriage, by broadening what constitutes a marriage.Sorry, but if happiness to you is nothing but who you have sex with, then that only underscores why so many people are against your movement.

All that IS one possible scenario. Another is:1.Denial - NFW2. Bargaining - civil unions?3. Reaction - 2004 election4. Action - 37 state ratifications of anti-gay marriage amendment5. Bulletproof Federal Amendment banning same-sex marriage that is SCOTUS proof because, although it contradicts the 5th and 14th Amendment, it is new law that that was Constitutionally initiated.If you don't want the scenario above, you need to tread lightly on John Q. Public and not get "up in his grill".

It can be an oxymoron because it already exists in Canada, Mass, and parts of Europe. It is already there.Just because up till now Gay marriage wasn't in the scope of your possiblities doesn't mean it won't be later. Up until now no one thought gays would ever matter. So the country is in the stages of acceptance. Denial, bargaining, anger, depression and soon acceptance. I will show you.1. Denial. Mass declared it would have gay marriage. The country said no it will never happen. The legislature will stop it, the courts will stop it. Denails sets in.2. Then the Bargining, "what about civil unions. We will give you Civil Unions and that will save marriage from the gays. 3. Anger.....Ammedments everywhere......4. Depression....we can't stop this.....it is just happening.......5. Acceptance. OH! You guys are married ....cool.

Nice try...won't work....thanks for playin...please try again......

But you forget that The 1996 Defense of Marriage Act specifically says that marriage is a union between man and woman and that any state may refuse to recognize any other state's gay marriage statute. In effect, it nullifies the full faith and credit clause in the 14th.

This is not true. A bill passed by the legislature cannot overrule the Constitution of the United States. The job of the courts as listed in the Constitution is specifically to overrule any bill passed by the legislature that violates the rights of the people presented in the Constitution. Should the courts rule that the defense of marriage act is invalid, they would be doing precisely that which they were designed to do.If there is something I am missing, let me know, but the job of the courts is to judge the laws passed by the legislature to assure that they are not in violation of the Constitution. I see no possibility that the Defense of Marriage Act could overrule the 14th Ammendment. That is not to say that a new ammendment could not be passed which overrules the 14th Ammendment, however I feel that it would need to specifically state that the 14th Ammendment does not apply in the situation of marriage or else there would be a contradiction in the Constitution which the courts would have to sort out.Regardless of the legal status of same-sex marriage, I hope that the logic I've used in my latest long post has helped you to understand why I think same-sex marriage is morally correct and opposing it is not.

Joe, what would make you say something like that? I feel like one of the most loved people in the world!

You really are so homophobic and yet you claim not to be, so really a hypocrite would define you better. You have no idea what it means to be loved or you would understand that gays have love not sex.only in your bigotry is this true. for those of us in loving commited realtionships....I think it is a step towards recognizing love comes in all forms and you are only jealous because you must lack it to say something like this.and you should be for them now, but you are not, that really does make you the bigot that you are. I understand those like JP who are not against gay rights but want clarifycation on them. You just don't want gays to be happy. Guess what. Like it or not I am happy without your consent.no perversion, just my love for another man. If that bothers you turn you head and look the other way. I pay the same taxes as you , I expect the same rights.Maybe that is what happiness is to you. The world is a mirror. What you hate in other is what you hate about yourself.Happiness to me is curling up each night with my partner. I don't have to have sex. I do want to curl up knowing he is there with me, knowing he loves me and I love him. I like the idea that we will grow old together and laugh together. Tonight for fun we went out to a bar we use to go to. We realy don't go to bars anymore. We had such a blast laughing abut the songs they played and what those songs reminded us of and we laughed and smiled at each other. That is what happiness is to me. It is also knowing that he wakes up everyday and puts on a pot of coffee, even though he doesn't drink it. He doesn it for me......it is knowing that he does all these little things for me that he knows will make me smile and I try my best to retrun the favor. Sorry if that bothers your xtian butt, but I love my partner and love the idea we will grow old together. I would like us to have some protections like other couple who are straight, but if we don't it changes nothing about how I feel for him.....you are just a bigot. You think gays only think about sex...we don't.you think that we have some agenda...we don't.we are living our lives, regardless of people like you and enjoying ourselves. I wake up every morning to a smile and a kiss. As I leave to go to work I get told to drive careful and call at lunch. I like it.......I am in love...sorry if you think that is a sin...and if you do...go ******* yourself.

I hope to see you move out of your life of perversion, as a Christian. Don't take that personally. I am not a bigot.By the way, what are these concerns a person has if that person is not involved in someone else's personal life? Regardless of whether that life is gay or straight.Right. Everyone has equality rights, except gays. Try again.

Well, the definition of homophobia is under question here. Can the term be applied to people who think that homosexuality is somehow immoral and wrong? If so, then you are homophobic because you believe those things. I do believe most gay rights supporters use it in that fashion because they believe that thinking homosexuality is immoral or wrong results from an unfounded fear that homosexuality is wrong. Your definition of homophobia probably means something different, which is the result of the confusion.Well, homosexuality is without a doubt a civil right. I'd say marriage also qualifies as a civil right. Now, we don't want to give every civil right to everyone; I mean, murder is also a right, isn't it? But murder takes away the rights of those it hurts. We restrict the right to murder to protect the rights of those who are hurt by murder. I mean, no one supports all civil rights.When you say that homosexuality is not a civil right, I think you may have misspoken. Homosexuality is both a civil right and it is a legal one. Same-sex marriage is a civil right too, and though you may not realize it, it is legal to have a same-sex marriage, they are just not recognized by the government. The difference same-sex marriages are religious (that is, the same-sex couple's religion recognizes that marriage); the government does not recognize the marriage.So to be technical, it is not the right to marriage we are talking about, it is a fight over the recognition of marriage. The civil rights part comes about because the benefits provided by marriage and the idea of government-recognized marriage can both be considered civil rights.In a sense, you are for discrimination. By restricting the rights of same-sex couples, you are discriminating against them. By restricting the rights of murderers, you are discriminating against them. It isn't always wrong to discriminate, but you have to do it with a reason. If you have good reason to discriminate against same-sex couples, you aren't a bigot. If you don't, then you are a bigot. So (no offense intended here) technically this whole debate is over whether or not you're a bigot! Strange way of looking at things, isn't it? In truth, both sides are implying that the other is morally wrong, not in general but on this one issue. Though I think you're right in saying that just calling you a bigot isn't accomplishing anything.

A cat is a specific species of animal, as is a dog. Calling a cat a dog or vice versa, doesn't make it so. That was my point.Huh? In the strictest sense of the word, dogs CAN'T mate with cats. They are two differing species that don't share the same gene sets. If you want to prolong the analogy, I could argue that what you are proposing is mating cats to dogs, because there is no chance of procreating either species as a result as in gay "mating". Do ducks mate for life as single sex couples? No, so it's a bad analogy on your part because it just reinforces natural heterosexual mating practices. emoticonXRolleyes

Honey, your analogy is all wrong. If cats are cats but dogs aren't allowed to be dogs...would be more to the point. If the law allowed cats to mate with cats and dogs were FORCED to mate with cats is how it is similar to what we have now. What we are trying to do is make it so dogs can mate with dogs without being discriminated against. Damn, what is so frelling hard about this?"To mate" is not just a sexual issue. Even with ducks, who "mate" for life, it goes way beyond sexual activity. It's an emotional bonding.

Actually yes, Ducks too have had life long same sex coupling. Same sex coupling has been noted in most animals including......humans.

"Moral" concerns:Morality is a tricky issue. I think each person's individual morals are as unique as the individual themselves and are based on their personal beliefs. Many of these personal beliefs are based on the religious values of the individual (but religion has it's own forum here). What one person may consider immoral, an other individual may not. Examples might include sale / consumption of alcohol and gambling as a simplistic starting point. At various times within the history of the USA, both have been tolerated. At other times they have been made illegal. There was even a constitutional ammendment regarding alcohol which was later repealed. Many states which once outlawed gambling now reap profits from state run lotteries and taxes on casino gambling.Some people may feel the sale / consumption of alcohol is immoral because it does harm to the individual and others (ie.: drunk driving accidents and deaths). However, please note that even though both the sale / consumption of alcohol and gambling are widely legal and accepted today, no one is forced to do either one. That is left up to the individual.I personally believe that each individual is entitled to practice their moral values as long as in doing so, they cause no harm to another.I think that most people who oppose same-sex marriage do so on the basis of their personal belief in what is or is not moral. I have no objection to anyone believing that homossexuality and / or same-sex marriage is immoral. What I object to is their imposition of their moral standards upon me when no one forces them to do either and it in no way harms them. Yet their imposition of their moral standards upon me DOES do ME harm! I am denied the same legal rights and benefits with the one I love and am personally committed to, that they enjoy.I would ask: which is more "moral"; to accept that others may have moral standards and values different than mine, respect their right to believe as they choose, and act according to their morality as long as they harm no one; or to deny others the right to their moral standards and values even though they do me nor any other individual harm?"Health" concerns:I assume here you are refering to sexually transmitted diseases (STD's). While AIDS is transmitted by means other than sexual contact also, I am willing to include it in this discussion.May we agree that STD's are spread by individuals having multiple sex partners; becoming infected by one sex partner and passing that infection on to another sex partner? In other words; "promiscuity"?That promiscuity exist in both the gay and straight societies is a fact. I will even admit that promiscuity is more prevelant among gays than in the straight society as a whole. But is that really comparing apples to apples? What if one compared promiscuity among single gay individuals and single heterosexual individuals? I think they might both be higher than in comparson to committed couples of either sexual orientation. I have searched the Internet several times for a comparitive study of promiscuity among single gay to single straights and have been unable to find any. The only study I have been able to find is one conducted in Scandanavia by a doctor of a small (<30) sample of homosexual AIDS patients in committed relationships. Her conclusion was that homosexuals in committed relationships are more likely to be promiscuios than straight people in committed relationships. Having accumulated over 15 hours of college credit in statistics to gain my Bachelors degree, I find her conclusion somewhat flawed. If one assumes that AIDS is spread by promiscuity, then her sample was biased in that it only looked at homosexuals with AIDS in committed relationships, and notat all at any all homosexuals in committed relationships that did not have AIDS. Yet she mistakenly included all gays in committed relationships in her conclusion. She also failed to determine if the AIDS infection occured before or after the individual entered into a committed relationship (It is known that AIDS can remain dormant in a person for years). (As an aside; I was in a committed relationship with a person who was infected with AIDS before we met. He died in 1992. I was tested regularly every six months for 8 years, and remain AIDS free.)Be that as it may, can we agreed that a decrease in promiscuity would lead to a decrease in STD's? Can we agree that promiscuity is less prevelant in committed couples (gay or straight) than in single individuals? If so, then from the issue of better health, would it not behove us to promote committed relationships (ie: marriage; gay or straight)? You have gained a measure of my respect. I would be interested in your response.

Thank you for laying out the basis for the next part of the debate. Unlike the economics of gay marriage, the moral repercussions aren't as easily quantified.Here are some of the "moral concerns" that I've heard expressed. I don't necessarily subscribe to them, but I'm laying them on the table for discussion.1. Legalizing gay marriage will promote homosexuality, which is an unnatural condition2. Legalizing gay marriage will corrupt straight children3. It will increase the number of pedophiles4. It is anti-Christian and America is predominantly a Christian society5. It will weaken the institution of marriageWe can start with these and add or subtract as we see fit.Again, thank you for setting the framework for further debate. Here are some of the health concerns expressed.1. AIDS is spread predominantly through homosexuals and legalizing gay marriage would lead to an increase in homosexuals and therefore AIDS2. STDs. There is a greater incidence of STDs from gay transmission3. Lifespan. Gays die at an earlier age than straights, so we should be discouraging homosexuality as we do smoking I'll have to leave it here for now, but will finish later this evening.Thanks you.

Having accumulated over 15 hours of college credit in statistics to gain my Bachelors degree, I find her conclusion somewhat flawed. If one assumes that AIDS is spread by promiscuity, then her sample was biased in that it only looked at homosexuals with AIDS in committed relationships, and notat all at any all homosexuals in committed relationships that did not have AIDS. Yet she mistakenly included all gays in committed relationships in her conclusion. She also failed to determine if the AIDS infection occured before or after the individual entered into a committed relationship (It is known that AIDS can remain dormant in a person for years). (As an aside; I was in a committed relationship with a person who was infected with AIDS before we met. He died in 1992. I was tested regularly every six months for 8 years, and remain AIDS free.)Be that as it may, can we agreed that a decrease in promiscuity would lead to a decrease in STD's? Can we agree that promiscuity is less prevelant in committed couples (gay or straight) than in single individuals? If so, then from the issue of better health, would it not behove us to promote committed relationships (ie: marriage; gay or straight)? You have gained a measure of my respect. I would be interested in your response.

I still don't see what you mean... Certainly the federal legislature could overrule DoMA as easily as they could overrule any bill. Or did you mean that the states shouldn't be allowed to overrule it? Well, that's technically true, but states are also technically free to do as they choose, and if their law conflicts with the federal law, the decision must be sent to the courts. Not that this stuff even matters in the debate, but it's still fun to talk about!I would love to move on to non-economic issues. I do not wish to assume you have health or moral concerns with homosexuality that you do not have, and I don't want to miss any that you do have. So would you rather start by listing those concerns out? If not, I could issue some blanket statement about why I think homosexuality and same-sex marriage are not health nor moral problems.EDIT: It would appear that while I was posting this, you responded to wsm with some health and moral concerns. I will respond to those.

Perhaps I was unclear in my response. The DoMA is the law of the land until it is ruled unconstitutional by SCOTUS. I'm guessing that the law's writers anticipated, or were acting in response to, an attempt to apply the "full faith and credit clause" of the 14th to gay marriage as a legal maneuver around the will of the states not wanting gay marriage forced down their throats.It may, ultimately, be found unconstitutional. As I stated above, DoMA is the law of the land until it is ruled unconstitutional. SCOTUS has several options if the case is brought to them, not all of which I'm familiar with, but, they can rule that the 14th doesn't apply, that they don't have jurisdiction, that the issue is too volitile for them to rule on (which they've done in the past), that DoMA is unconstitutional, etc.,I do understand your point better now, but I'm not convinced that it's the morally correct thing to do. Up until now, I've argued the economic impact of gay marriage and not the moral one. I'm reasonably satisfied that the economic costs that I anticipated as a result of legalizing gay marriage probably aren't an issue, but we haven't discussed the moral and health concerns that I have.Having conceded that the economical impact would be minimal, maybe we can move on to the non-economic issues next.

Homosexuality doesn't cause HIV or other sexually transmitted diseases. Sex or contact with blood is the cause.The numbers of any particular group with a disease in a particular jurisdiction doesn't matter. We would have to decide what that magic number is where a group of people lose their human rights, and what specific groups will lose their human rights, and which specific diseases would cause that particular group with that particular magic number of a specific disease, to lose their human rights.In other words, the reason is not disease, the reason is you are gay.

Joe, what would make you say something like that? I feel like one of the most loved people in the world! I think that is part of the reason that I DO hope to see gay people moving out of a life of perverison. Why is it that you cannot accept that people have concerns about this issue of homosexuality? That doesn't make them a bigot.Sure I am. That's why I am for civil rights for everyone and always have been--but homosexuality and gay marriage isn't a civil right. This is a non-related issue.Hey Joe, you are a bigot. (There, I too can say it where it doesn't apply.) If I were a bigot, don't you think I'd be FOR discrimination? I'm not.

These are the sorts of things that form the conservative fantasy life.This last one is almost guaranteed. And before anyone starts attacking, please note that the Bush administration and most GOP leaders have come to that exact same conclusion, hence the FMA.The pathetic thing (about them, that is) is that at the basis of the argument that the FMA is necessary is a concession that bans on same-sex marriage are unconstitutional. Yet all these elected officials, SWORN to uphold the Constitution, are blithely ignoring their duty and trying to change the rules of the game before the referee issues an official ruling while hiding behind answers like "I don't know".

Each of these issues has been debated on this forum time after time after time. I will therefore try to be brief.I can see no basis for this assumption. It may prompt more homosexuals to "come out of the closet", but would have no affect whatsoever on the actual number of homosexuals.

While it has yet to be definitively proven one way or the other, the preponderance of scientific evidence suggests that it IS natural.I fail to see how recognition of a loving commitment between two consenting adults would corrupt any child. Where is the connection?Again, I fail to see a connection between a loving commitment between two consenting adults and pedophilia. If this logic were true, would not heterosexual marriage also lead to an increased number of pedophiles?If this were true, then by logical extension, we should not allow any non-Christian marriages; Jewish, Muslim, Buddhists, Hindu…………… Also keep in mind that, even if the USA is a predominately Christian society, the government of the USA is supposed to be non-religious. What about the existing Christian denominations that already recognize same-sex marriage? But again, this is not a religious forum.I fail to see how recognizing loving commitments between two consenting adults would weaken the institution of marriage. If anything, I believe it would strengthen it. I do, however, understand that some heterosexuals would feel that they would no longer enjoy what they perceive as a special, elite status in society.Homosexual contact is no longer the predominate means of AIDS infections. As I discussed in my pervious posting above, recognition of gay marriage should lead to less promiscuity and less AIDS.This may or may not be true. However, as discussed in my previous post, promoting committed relationships should reduce promiscuity and therefore all forms of STD’s.I honestly have never heard of that one before. I would be interested in knowing the cause, if it is, in fact, true. But I fail to see how an individuals lifespan should be a criteria for marriage. I would also point out that, while smoking may be detrimental to ones health, it is not illegal, and the government spends millions of dollars per year subsidizing tobacco farmers.

Thank you for laying out the basis for the next part of the debate. Unlike the economics of gay marriage, the moral repercussions aren't as easily quantified.Here are some of the "moral concerns" that I've heard expressed. I don't necessarily subscribe to them, but I'm laying them on the table for discussion.1. Legalizing gay marriage will promote homosexuality, which is an unnatural condition2. Legalizing gay marriage will corrupt straight children3. It will increase the number of pedophiles4. It is anti-Christian and America is predominantly a Christian society5. It will weaken the institution of marriageWe can start with these and add or subtract as we see fit.Again, thank you for setting the framework for further debate. Here are some of the health concerns expressed.1. AIDS is spread predominantly through homosexuals and legalizing gay marriage would lead to an increase in homosexuals and therefore AIDS2. STDs. There is a greater incidence of STDs from gay transmission3. Lifespan. Gays die at an earlier age than straights, so we should be discouraging homosexuality as we do smoking I'll have to leave it here for now, but will finish later this evening.Thanks you.

There's been very little reference made to children in this entire thread, and it's probably the heart of the matter in forming the anti-gay-marriage opinions of the majority.If gay marriage is legalized, the adoption process will have to be made perfectly identical for gays and straights. Gay people will seek to adopt as many kids as possible, and will raise them in a way to steer them towards being gay. They will encourage them to act gay in school, and scream discrimination when straight parents and straight children take exception to it. It will be debatable if the straights have grounds to take exception to it, but there is no question that they will. It will create plenty of conflict, and further gays desire for special rights. (separate schools for gays) Do you have any doubt that there would be more conflict in schools with the legalization of gay adoptions?

If you'll look back, quite a few pro-gay posters mention kids frequently. One of the greatest injustices in banning same-sex marriage is that it leaves gay families very vulnerable if one parent gets sick or dies. If that parent is the birth or legal adoptive parent, the survivor often has no legal rights and responsibilities to the children. THAT is anti-family.Yeah, gay people already have all that experience in how one's parents can determine one's sexual orientation... Geez, what a nitwit idea.Do you live in Florida? That's the only state where adoption by gay people is illegal. Not incoincidentally, it also has thousands of kids waiting for homes. THAT is anti-children.

Yes, it has, but it usually degrades into a "micturating contest" and I don't want to see this thread degrade into watersports. So. you don't subscribe to the "recruitment theory"? http://www.learntoquestion.com/class...es/000501.html I'm not convinced that homosexuality is genetic. While I think that there may be a slight predisposition,I think it's predominantly environmental, which does affect my opinion about gay marriage as you can probably already guess. I would like to hear more about why you think it's not a learned behavior.I'm going to have to plead complete ignorance on this one. Do gay men teach their male kids to be sensitive pantywaistes, NASCAR fans or somewhere in between? I do believe that a stable masculine father figure is important for both young boys and girls. Without parental role models to emulate, I think that kids grow up conflicted about gender roles. For example, in hetero relationships, the father is usually the partner that teaches about risk-taking, independence, work ethics and the need to be tough in certain situations. The mother is usually the one who teaches nurturing, empathy, respect for others and the more "'refined" people skills. Do gay partners teach the same balance of skills or do their children all turn out to be interior decorators? (OK, bad joke)I believe that it's a common belief that many homosexuals are pedophiles. I don't happen to subscribe to that belief, but I thought I'd add it to the list for comment.More tomorrow......

I'll keep in mind that you aren't sure about these, and it's good that you brought them up because they deserve to be discussed. I see what I can do:1. Regarding how natural homosexuality is, I do not think it important. I will say something on it anyhow, as I like to write on this topic. the most common beliefs of the causes of homosexuality are genetics and upbringing. I don't see any reason to think these things unnatural. Only if you believe homomsexuality is caused by a person willingly choosing to go against his nature could it be called unnatural. Beyond that, there appear to be adequate sexual means for members of the same-sex to engage in, and it seems to be possible to develop the emotional tie of love between members of the same sex. This seems natural enough to me.Regardless, there isn't really any reason to prohibit unnatural behavior. I'd definitely say that living in buildings, resisting the urge to cause violence, eating canned food, living monogomously, wearing clothing, mass production, telling the truth, posting on these forums, and billions of other things we do every day are unnatural. I wouldn't agree with restricting things that aren't natural, that's certain.Oh, one more thing: legalizing same-sex marriage doesn't really promote homosexuality. Let me make a comparison: By legalizing the construction of Muslim churches, am I promoting the Muslim religion? Well, no I'm not. I'm simply giving the Muslim religion the same rights that the other religions have. This does not suggest that anyone should become Muslim, it just continues to allow everyone to choose what they please while still enjoying the same rights. The same is true of same-sex marriage.Banning the construction of Muslim churches, on the other hand, is a government signal that the Muslim religion is not acceptable. Even if the government does not take away the freedom of the people to believe in the Muslim religion, it has taken away some of the benefits provided to people over another religion. It has still limited freedom and it still stands against the Muslim religion. What I mean is, permitting same-sex marriage does not promote homosexuality, it is restricting same-sex marriage that attacks homosexuality, in a sense.2. Well, it would be very difficult, I think, to argue that one will become attracted to members of the same-sex simply because he or she is raised by someone who is attracted to the same-sex. But just to prove my point, let's assume that every child raised by a gay person will become gay. This fact in itself is not a harm at all. Only by assuming that homosexuality is somehow bad can we say that children being raised to become homosexual is bad. Now, I admit that many have religious values which claim that homosexuality is a sin, but those people retain the right to raise their children with that value. Those parents have the right to burn the idea that homosexuality is a sin into the minds of their child until that child could not possibly be homosexual. Those parents have the right to corrupt gay children. Or put in a different light, parents always have the right to raise their children as they please. Now, I would argue against that if those children were raised in such a manner that caused them to harm people, but again, we have to assume that homosexuality harms people for that to apply.Now, being familiar with the mindset and ideals of many homosexuals, I find it likely that the most a same-sex couple will do is keep their children open to the idea that it is okay to be homosexual. This is hardly corruption of a straight child and would change the sexuality of very few children.3. Now, I think, or hope, this is one of the points you don't necessarily agree with. Just in case it isn't, let me explain my side of it. There is a very big difference between someone who is attracted to and falls in love with someone of the same sex and someone who is attracted to children of the same sex. Furthermore, there is yet another difference between someone who is attracted to children of the same sex and someone who chooses to molest a child. Those same-sex couples who would be given the right to marry, they are not the same group of people who chooses to molest children any more than you fall into the group of people who choose to molest children of the opposite sex. To suggest that they are somehow related is just as insulting.If we want to be specific, perhaps we can break down adult sexual attraction into three categories under the law: heterosexuality, homosexuality, and pedophilia. Most people are heterosexual, far less people are homosexual, and the smallest group, pedophiles. In this breakdown, heterosexual and homosexuals describe adults who are attracted to other adults. I place the smallest group, pedophiles, in a single category because right now they are treated as such under the law; this group would include any adults who are attracted to minors. Of course any one person can fall into none, one, or more categories of sexual attraction here. Breaking down pedophila, we really have two groups, those who are attracted to children of the same sex, and those who are attracted to children of the opposite sex. Some, but probably very few, pedophiles are also child molesters.Looking at it this way, I hope it becomes more apparent that same-sex marriage brings no new rights and no new benefits to someone for being a pedophile. Same-sex marriage does not encourage people do move into the pedophile group; that group still has no sexual or marriage rights under the law. I will further argue that same-sex marriage discourages pedophilia. This is because it encourages people to move into the homosexuality category. That means that anyone who may have been torn between homosexuality and pedophilia will now have incentive to act on their homosexual instincts, not their pedophile instincts (and I do not mean to imply that there are very many of these people; I suspect that the vast majority of child molesters are not attracted to adults, which is why they feel forced to satisfy their sexual urges any way they can).4. Anti-Christian is the wrong word to use here. Anti-Christian implies that it attacks Christianity in some way, that it takes rights away from Christians, or that it discourages Christianity. These things are not true. Same-sex marriage attacks Christianity no more than allowing one to build a Muslim church does; in fact, it attacks Christianity far less so. Both are expressions of a different belief system, but a Muslim church opens the doors for the community to come worship a faith that opposes the idea of Christianity. Same-sex marriage, on the other hand, is a private institution between two people, and it welcomes Christianity. I would not be surpised if more than half of homosexuals are Christian, though this may be because I have visited many Christian churches accepting of homosexuals in areas with large populations of homosexual people.I do understand that allowing same-sex marriage is an activity that most Christians disagree with, but it seems rather arbitrary to take away the rights of same-sex couples for only this reason when we allow so much other religious freedom. For example, eight of the activities which the ten commandments prohibit are completely legal. Look at number 1! "Thou shalt have no other gods before me." Holy ****! It is no secret that the one unforgivable sin in Christianity is believing in another God. It is no secret that the only way to heaven is through Jesus.But we do not force people to obey the ten commandments, and we do not force people to be Christian. We do not punish people for believing in other religions, and we do not take away the benefits of those who believe something different than we do because our country prides itself on the freedom of religion. That freedom, along with many others was a freedom our forefathers founded this country on. Jefferson himself wanted it noted that he authored the Act for Religious Freedom on his tombstone, and the text of the document stand opposite the text of the Declaration of Independence in the Jefferson Memorial. So we do not take away the rights of those simply because they believe differently, except for one issue: same-sex marriage. I think religious freedom was worth fighting for in Jefferson's days, and it is worth fighting for today, though we may choose words over guns to do our fighting.5. As far as I can tell, the institution of marriage will remain completely unchanged for opposite-sex couples and all future opposite-sex couples to come. That institution stands firm and no one is asking to change it or weaken it in any way. But we are asking for a new institution; an add-on to this institution that will allow more people to engage in it. It will stop marriage from being some exclusive club that only the chosen few can get into and will allow marriage to benefit as many families as it can. There is no weakening going on here except by those who wish to restrict or limit marriage.Health concerns are an important topic, for both you and homosexual families, I'm sure. Let me address them as best I can:1. In many places in the world, such as the United Kingdom and Scotland, AIDS is now more commonly spread through heterosexual activity than homosexual activity. If I remember correctly, homosexual activity in the US accounted for 51% of new AIDS cases in the US in 2003; I've no idea how 2004 fared. There's also plenty of speculation that gays are more likely to be tested for and report cases of HIV infection than heterosexuals due to increased awareness programs targeted at gays in the United States.Anyhow, there are two primary ways AIDS spreads: unprotected sexual promiscuity and sharing needles during drug use. So to figure out whether the spread of AIDS will increase if same-sex marriage is legalized, we must consider whether promiscuity or drug use will increase. Because homosexual promiscuity is more likely to spread AIDS, I would even give credit to the idea that the spread of AIDS would increase if it could be shown that heterosexual promiscuity might change to homosexual promiscuity should same-sex marriage be legalized. But on the contrary, I intend to show that not only would same-sex marriage not cause more homosexual promiscuity, it would actually decrease the spread of AIDS. Allow me to explain:First of all, let us examine the possibility that legalizing same-sex marriage could increase the number of homosexuals. I grant you that it might, but what type of people might become homosexual? Do you think that the most sexually promicuous heterosexuals will see same-sex marriage legalized and suddenly say, "Woah, I'm gay now." Of course they will not. Those people who are most sexually promiscuous are likely very certain of their sexuality and legalizing same-sex marriage will not change that. So who might become homosexual? Not the average heterosexual, no doubt. It could only be those people who are uncertain of their sexuality right now; it could only be those people who might suspect themselves of being homosexual today, but deny it because of society's lack of acceptance. It could only be those to whom sex is not imporantant and to whom giving up sex is worthwhile to comply to the implies rules that our current laws suggest. It can only be the non-promiscuous, and legalizing same-sex marriage will not magically change the non-promiscuous into the promiscuous; it cannot make those who practice safe sex suddenly decide not to. The spread of AIDS will not increase.So how will the spread decrease? Well, the commitment of marriage is a very mental thing. It is one thing for a man to cheat on his girlfriend, but cheating on his wife is completely different. It is one thing for a man to have multiple sex partners while single, but it is completely different to have multiple sex partners after the commitment of marriage has been made. I do not mean to imply that no one has multiple sexual partners after getting married, but I do mean that getting married can have the effect of calming down one's sexual life, of turning a promiscous person into a monogamous person. This sort of commitment could easily turn some promiscuous homosexual men into non-promiscuous ones. Not only that, but the more non-promiscuous gay people there are, the more pressure is put onto promiscuous gay people to meet the standards of other homosexuals.All-in-all, marriage will not increase promiscuity; it will do just the opposite.2. I think the explanation above can apply to STD's in general as well.3. This isn't true at all. What IS true is that the average gay person dies at an earlier age than a straight person. When in completely normal mental and physical health, gay people live just as long as anyone else; sexual orientation or having sex with someone of the same sex does not cause one's lifespan to shorten. The reason the average gay person has a shorter lifespan than the average straight person can be attributed to a number of factors. First, violence against gays is more common than violence against heterosexuals. I don't think this is a huge contributer, but it is worth mentioning. Second, AIDS and other STD's are more common among homosexual men. Third, depression, anxiety, heart problems, and other stress-related diseases are more common among homosexuals.Each one of those issues will become less of a problem should same-sex marriage be legalized. I spoke on AIDS and STD's above. As for violence, the community may be less likely to breed hatred against homosexuals if they do not have inferior rights under the law. Regarding depression and such, well to be honest, it is a tough life being constantly compared to child molesters, being referred to as a sinner, being afraid of what someone might do to you if they knew who you loved, and having to battle for the same rights that your neighbor has. Depression and anxiety will happen, but granting same-sex couples the same rights that the next couple has is the first step toward alleviating that. Allowing same-sex marriage will lengthen lifespans, not shorten them.Hopefully I've answered your points well enough, but I sort of feel like I've forgotten to say some imporant things which were on my mind when I started this post, so maybe I have not. If not, let me know!

Thank you for laying out the basis for the next part of the debate. Unlike the economics of gay marriage, the moral repercussions aren't as easily quantified.Here are some of the "moral concerns" that I've heard expressed. I don't necessarily subscribe to them, but I'm laying them on the table for discussion.1. Legalizing gay marriage will promote homosexuality, which is an unnatural condition2. Legalizing gay marriage will corrupt straight children3. It will increase the number of pedophiles4. It is anti-Christian and America is predominantly a Christian society5. It will weaken the institution of marriageWe can start with these and add or subtract as we see fit.Again, thank you for setting the framework for further debate. Here are some of the health concerns expressed.1. AIDS is spread predominantly through homosexuals and legalizing gay marriage would lead to an increase in homosexuals and therefore AIDS2. STDs. There is a greater incidence of STDs from gay transmission3. Lifespan. Gays die at an earlier age than straights, so we should be discouraging homosexuality as we do smoking I'll have to leave it here for now, but will finish later this evening.Thanks you.

This post is so strange... I mean no offense Marc, but I hesitate from wondering whether you are being sarcastic in this post or you actually believe it. I think that you do actually believe it, and because of that, I will answer it to the best of my ability.First, I should say that there has been more reference to children than you have brought up here. My posts are long, but if you have time to read through them, perhaps they would help you understand the reasons that I believe same-sex marriage will help children. For now, let me address the concerns you have raised.First, you claim that if gay marriage is legalized, then gay people will seek to adopt as many kids as possible. This is a very unique comment indeed; others here have suggested that gays would refrain from adopting and simply leech off the benefits. It appears you are on the other end of the spectrum, but that does not make your concerns any less important. I will say that there is no indication that gays would adopt as many children as possible, nor is there any indication that they would want to. Adopting many children would be a very large burden on money, and I imagine that few people would want to spend that much money on children that are not of their own genetics. Still, I would be very happy if gay couples adopted a lot of children; such a fate would be far better than ending up in an adoption facility until they are eighteen. The importance of loving parents and a loving family should not be underestimated.Of course I do it is morally to steer that child toward being gay or tell that child to act gay, and I'm certain that if you were familar with the ideals of homosexuals or were friends with any, then you would understand that you are making untrue and unfounded assumptions about how they would raise children. I might just as easily condemn all Christians for raising their children to hate homosexuals and making them scream "evil" any time they see the face of a harmless and morally good person. Of course I would never claim such a thing, but if I did, it would be founded upon more evidence than your claims about how homosexuals would raise their children.In truth, most homosexuals believe that one cannot control his or her sexual orientation and they cannot control who they are. Even the shortest conversations with a homosexual about gay rights should reveal this. Considering this, it seems most likely that a same-sex couple would raise their child to believe that he or she is a good person no matter what his or her sexual orientation may be and no matter how he or she may choose to act. If that same-sex couple tried to force a child to lean one way or another or to act a certain way, those parents would be violating their own set of beliefs; it does not logically follow that they would do such a thing.The only explanation that makes sense is that you believe that same-sex couples would use children as tools to disrupt schools and cause havoc. You have provided no evidence for why anyone would commit such an evil act. I will give you the benefit of the doubt when I assume that you did not mean offense to the homosexuals and bisexuals who post here, but I can guarantee that your statement was interpreted as more insulting and horrible than you realize by many people in this forum.As for whether or not I have any doubt that there will be more conflict in schools, I do have total doubt, and your post has not indicated anything different. I think that you may be assuming that homosexuals are somehow bad people who have bad intentions for their children, and this assumption is causing your arguments to invalidate themselves. Please, understand that same-sex couples are not very different than opposite-sex couples, and you need only meet some to reveal this to yourself. I wish I could show you that, but until then you must not base your arguments on the idea that homosexuals have bad intentions; those you are trying to convince already do not believe themselves to be bad people, and assuming that they are will do nothing but insult them.I hope I have not insulted you, and if I have, I apologize. But I think that this needed to be said, because if people feel they are insulted, they have the tendency to insult back. That would destroy the civility of this thread.

There's been very little reference made to children in this entire thread, and it's probably the heart of the matter in forming the anti-gay-marriage opinions of the majority.If gay marriage is legalized, the adoption process will have to be made perfectly identical for gays and straights. Gay people will seek to adopt as many kids as possible, and will raise them in a way to steer them towards being gay. They will encourage them to act gay in school, and scream discrimination when straight parents and straight children take exception to it. It will be debatable if the straights have grounds to take exception to it, but there is no question that they will. It will create plenty of conflict, and further gays desire for special rights. (separate schools for gays) Do you have any doubt that there would be more conflict in schools with the legalization of gay adoptions?

That is humour, just in case someone didn't understand.Whether it is genetic or environmental or a combination why would that affect your opinion on gay marriage? How would that make gay marriage wrong? Do you know how environment may make someone gay or straight? Would it make someone who is really straight into gay, or someone who is really gay into straight? How would you propose to control this early environment so your kid could be either straight or gay? For most, probably somewhere in between.These roles aren't quite so defined today. I think you are a little out of date. The mother could easily teach about work ethics and independence and risk taking, etc. Men are mostly not insensitive and butch, and probably most today have better interior decorating skills, then they are skilled at repairing a car engine. Two female or two male parents can teach all of the skills you list. A single parent of either sex could as well. In addition there will be other adult influences of both sexes in the child's life(aunts uncles, etc.). Would it necessarily be a bad thing if the child with gay parents turned out to be an interior decorator? Would it be better if the male child was a mechanic or worked in a hardware store?

Yes, it has, but it usually degrades into a "micturating contest" and I don't want to see this thread degrade into watersports. So. you don't subscribe to the "recruitment theory"? http://www.learntoquestion.com/class...es/000501.html I'm not convinced that homosexuality is genetic. While I think that there may be a slight predisposition,I think it's predominantly environmental, which does affect my opinion about gay marriage as you can probably already guess. I would like to hear more about why you think it's not a learned behavior.I'm going to have to plead complete ignorance on this one. Do gay men teach their male kids to be sensitive pantywaistes, NASCAR fans or somewhere in between? I do believe that a stable masculine father figure is important for both young boys and girls. Without parental role models to emulate, I think that kids grow up conflicted about gender roles. For example, in hetero relationships, the father is usually the partner that teaches about risk-taking, independence, work ethics and the need to be tough in certain situations. The mother is usually the one who teaches nurturing, empathy, respect for others and the more "'refined" people skills. Do gay partners teach the same balance of skills or do their children all turn out to be interior decorators? (OK, bad joke)I believe that it's a common belief that many homosexuals are pedophiles. I don't happen to subscribe to that belief, but I thought I'd add it to the list for comment.More tomorrow......

The 14th amendment gurantees everyoen has the same rights. Which everyone does. I'm not going to debate that your right is the same even if your preference is different.The full faith and credit clause doesn't have to recognize records that aren't recognized in their own state. Plus state can put limitation of the records. liek gun permits don't transfer from state to state. So the court weill have to decide if the full faith credit clasue can force a state to recognize a non-existing form of record by another record. They did this before with polygamy.

This is not true. A bill passed by the legislature cannot overrule the Constitution of the United States. The job of the courts as listed in the Constitution is specifically to overrule any bill passed by the legislature that violates the rights of the people presented in the Constitution. Should the courts rule that the defense of marriage act is invalid, they would be doing precisely that which they were designed to do.If there is something I am missing, let me know, but the job of the courts is to judge the laws passed by the legislature to assure that they are not in violation of the Constitution. I see no possibility that the Defense of Marriage Act could overrule the 14th Ammendment. That is not to say that a new ammendment could not be passed which overrules the 14th Ammendment, however I feel that it would need to specifically state that the 14th Ammendment does not apply in the situation of marriage or else there would be a contradiction in the Constitution which the courts would have to sort out.Regardless of the legal status of same-sex marriage, I hope that the logic I've used in my latest long post has helped you to understand why I think same-sex marriage is morally correct and opposing it is not.

I hope that nobody who actually read the link thought it was serious. If they did, you really have a tough PR job. ;)I'll be real frank with you on this one. If one of my kids was indecisive about his/her sexuality, I would certainly attempt to steer them towards heterosexuality for a variety of reasons. First, while we reallly haven't gotten into it, there is a higher probability of a gay man dying young as a result of his lifestyle. Just as I would encourage my kids not to smoke because it could shorten their life, I'd do the same for them if they were not sure of their sexuality by attempting to steer them away from homosexuality.As for whether or not it's possible to switch one's sexual orientation, I believe that it happens all of the time. You may argue that a straight who turns gay later in life is just "coming out of the closet" or "losing the beard", but I think it's more complex than that.I find that somewhat reassuring. :) I hope that you understand that I was speaking rather hyperbolically, but you did get the gist of my question.I think that we're feeling the impact of single parenting in our inner cities. Once an inner city angry male reaches the physical size of his mother, she can no longer control him and the Lord of the Flies mentality takes over. IMO, two gay men are preferrable to that situation, for sure.Maybe not in my neighborhood, but in the one that I was raised in, Hell yes. The kid would be lucky if he didn't get his butt kicked daily. (I went to a tough NJ HS.)Truthfully, I don't care what profession my kids go into as long as it makes them happy.

This is pure homophobic speculation on your part. Gay adoption is already a reality in many states and unbiased, scientific studies done by professionals have shown no harm to the child involved.It seems that you subscribe to the homophobic fallacy that gay people are out to recruit children into homosexuality. Nothing could be further from the truth.

I see it opening the door to constant conflict.It's human nature to take pride in one's life, to take oportunities to share how one lives with others. The testimonials here and all over the net show that gays are no different. Many of them have the same intent, the same innocence, as when someone describes what they do for a living to someone. I don't believe ALL of them have bad intentions, but I see a desire to further a political agenda. What group with a political agenda does not seek to increase it's numbers? Increasing adoption would be a big way to do it. Many people, myself included, firmly believe that a good orphanage is a far better place for a child to be raised in than by same sex parents. I know you disagree and nothing we say can change each other's minds, but it's a fact that it will become a bigger issue if gay marriage is legalized, and there will be CONFLICT. Gay parents would tend to steer adopted children towards homosexuality because of the political agenda, the numbers increasing thing that I described above. Most Christian parents don't have the desire to encourage their children to "hate" homosexuals. Little kids don't naturally think about sex at all. Since straight parents have no sexual political agenda, they'd rather their kids not be exposed to it at all. They'd rather their kids thought about other things. That 2+2=4, that d-o-g spells dog, that c-a-t spells cat. Practical learning. I don't see homosexuals as having bad intentions as much as I see them having political intentions, and I don't see it stopping only with gay marriage. If I were to meet with some same sex couples I'm sure I would find them to be decent people as you describe. But it wouldn't take a very big percentage of those of them who ARE trouble makers, to cause a lot of trouble, and to recruit followers, and create enemies in the straight community. SCHOOLS would be the centers of conflict. I did notice your comments about children in your post #50, however there have been no responses to my post #47.

There is no gay lifestyle, there are many lifestyles. There are many healthy gay lifestyles, as well as unhealthy lifestyles that gays have. It hasn't been proven that gay men will die earlier. There are so many variables which will determine one's lifespan and whether or not one has a healthy lifestyle. If you are looking at HIV/AIDS as one variable, then if you have a daughter you would steer her to be a lesbian and not straight. In the community where I have lived my entire life, tranmission of this virus is overwhelmingly heterosexual. You still have not indicated how you would control your child's sexual orientation.There is no causal link between homosexuality and I'm guessing you mean AIDS, the way there is a causal link between smoking and lung cancer(and other cancers and diseases and shortened lifespan). That's why the medical community does not discourage homosexuality like they discourage smoking. If you are correct, that doesn't make being gay a bad thing.Better economic opportunities and more social justice could help. It used to be that a family could live well off one parent's income.I'm glad to hear that.

I would even go farther than that and note that gay adoptions have risen significantly since the gay pride movement came on the scene, so one can't help but wonder if to some degree many of these adoptions are an attempt at a form of social protest, not entirely for the sake of the child. If the phenomenon were truly in the spirit of benevolence in general, it would stand to reason that they gays would not have waited until it became associated with gay pride to do so. Can you imagine knowing you were adopted as a form of social protest???Sort of like the social protest fad gay marriages we saw as soon as Massachusetts made it legal. If they were for real, gay marriages wouldn't have dropped off to a trickle now given the supposed percentage of gay people in this country.Agreed.

There is definitely reason to believe that early on, the gay rights movement and the pedophile movement were not so unrelated as you portray. As the "man/boy" idea became so offensive to society and therefore a liability, the gay rights movement dropped the 'man/boy' stuff like a hot potato. There was a time (I remember it, mainly in the 80s) when gay rights groups were not hostile toward the now defunct group NAMBLA. It was just as disgusting then as it is now.

OH MY GOD!!! I am laughing so hard tear are streaming down my face!!!!!!!!!!  Did you note the source of that report? "The Onion" emoticonXIdea http://www.theonion.com/index.php?pre=1In case you have never heard of it, it is a satirical webzine that pokes fun at just about everything!!!!!!!!! Go read some of the other funny articles!!!!!!The original purpose of that article in :"The Onion" was to poke fun at the people who actually think gay people are out recuiting. There is no such thing as the National Gay and Lesbian Recruitment Task Force. It was all a joke!!!!! And evidently you fell for it as truth. emoticonXFrazzled It just shows that you need to be careful about the sources of your information.Sorry, but I am still laughing over this one. :) I have already refered you to the AMA and the two APA's and their positions on this subject. I guess it depends on who one wishes to believe; respected, professional medical and mental health associations or Fred Phelps. As I said before, there is not yet a definative answer, but the preponderance of unbiased, scientific evidence suggests it is inate. Again, if you will read the AMA and the two APA's positions on children raised by gay parents, you will find that the children are not recuited into homosexuality and do quite well socially.It is a common tool of homophobic, radical straights to promote prejudice and hate. It simply has no basis in fact.

Gay rights groups have never supported NAMBLA. They have been kicked out of a pride organization in the country.edited to add link: http://www.notfrisco2.com/webzine/Lynn/004488.html

There's been very little reference made to children in this entire thread, and it's probably the heart of the matter in forming the anti-gay-marriage opinions of the majority.If gay marriage is legalized, the adoption process will have to be made perfectly identical for gays and straights. Gay people will seek to adopt as many kids as possible, and will raise them in a way to steer them towards being gay. They will encourage them to act gay in school, and scream discrimination when straight parents and straight children take exception to it. It will be debatable if the straights have grounds to take exception to it, but there is no question that they will. It will create plenty of conflict, and further gays desire for special rights. (separate schools for gays) Do you have any doubt that there would be more conflict in schools with the legalization of gay adoptions?

You evidently didn't bother to follow my link to "The Onion" or you would know that it is in no way associated with any gay cause. But, knowing you, you probably just jump in blindly and make some snide comment. I think your movement needs to be more careful about the sources of their misinformation.I had a power outage here shortly after I had posted that and was off the computer for a while. At first I was still laughing about it, then I got to thinking how truly sad it is that anyone would jump on anything so ridiculous so easily and attempt to use it to bolster their preconceived prejudices without even considering the source of the supposed information. How many other of the preconceived prejudices of some straight individuals against homosexuality are fed in much the same way and how many of them use such misinformation to attempt to further the fallacies?

You need to read up on your own movement's history!"New York's Gay Activist Alliance (GAA) opposed age of consent laws and hosted a forum on the topic in 1976. The Canadian Lesbian and Gay Rights Coalition held a similar position. Yet most gay rights groups paid little attention to the pederasts in their ranks. To them, the idea of "boylove" was just another variation of gay love that was sharing in the struggle for liberation. Thus gay rights groups granted tacit acceptance of NAMBLA's platform at the time the group formed.

I understand your desire for more specifics, but at this point you are pretty much arguing with the article itself. Based on what I know regarding this from such articles and from what I've always heard, gay rights groups in general didn't see their movement as separate from the NAMBLA one early on. This article certainly supports that conclusion. In my opinion, it would be better if the gay movement simply admitted this rather than trying to sweep it under the rug or deny it at all costs. It hasn't even been that long ago in fact. It's a skeleton in the closet, but that doesn't mean it's that way now. I have no problem with the fact that gay rights groups try to distance themselves from pederasty nowadays, but let's at least be honest about the past.

We're starting to get into the area of massive missives. I'd like to reply to all of this post, but don't want it to be unreadable due to shear size, so I'll break my reply up into sections.I don't mean to offend you with the following analogy, but it illustrates a point. To a pedophile, it is "natural" to want to have sex with a young child, but it is unnatural for those of us who aren't pedophiles. So, for a homosexual to say that it's "natural" really doesn't carry much weight with a straight person who sees pedophiles and homosexuals both as sexual deviants and, depending on one's bent, may find one or both abominable acts.If I may, I'd like to restate your examples above in their more basic form. It is very natural to seek shelter from the elements. It is natural to fear the reprucussions of initiating violence on another. For example, a domestic housecat won't normally take on a raccoon of similar size for just that reason. It is very natural to eat.The only thing unnatural is the container that the food comes in. Wearing clothes to protect against the environment is also very natural. As for the rest, they can also be broken down in terms of basic natural acts, such as communication. But homosexual sex isn't a natural act. The only time that I've heard of homosexuality occurring in nature was under "unnatural" conditions, such as overcrowding.Funny that you should choose that example. I happen to live in the area with the largest population of Middle Easterners outside of the ME. Dearborn, MI has become the Muslim capital of the US primarily because Muslims are accepted, have mosques, ethnic restaurants, community centers, etc., and draw other Muslims into the community from outside of the area. They also "recruit" others to become Muslims by their presence, through interaction with others in the community that aren't MEers, and by encouraging those who have strayed away from Christianity. Remember, it is a Muslim's job to either convert "infidels" or dominate them. Agreed. Now, if the government saw the spread of Islamic Fundamentalism as a threat to our society, it would ban the construction of Fundamentalist Islamic mosques and let radical Muslims know that they weren't welcome. By preventing the building of mosques, not allowing the immigration of more radical Muslims into the US and making it tougher for Muslims to gain a foothold in the area, it could be argued that the government was attempting to prevent the spread of something that was found to be a threat to society as a whole, correct?OK, now given the above hypothetical situation regarding radical Islam and the government's hypothetical response to it, an argument can be made that preventing gay marriage is akin to stopping the spread of Fundamentalist Islamic radicals. By preventing gay marriage, it is attempting to stop the spread of something that it has determined is detrimental to society as a whole. The battle lies in convincing John Q. Public that gays aren't the moral equivalent of radical Muslims.I'll respond to #2 in another post and the rest in individual posts as well.(Please don't take all of my statements above as representative of my personal beliefs. I am playing devil's advocate and don't necessarily buy the arguments presented.)

I'll keep in mind that you aren't sure about these, and it's good that you brought them up because they deserve to be discussed. I see what I can do:1. Regarding how natural homosexuality is, I do not think it important. I will say something on it anyhow, as I like to write on this topic. the most common beliefs of the causes of homosexuality are genetics and upbringing. I don't see any reason to think these things unnatural. Only if you believe homomsexuality is caused by a person willingly choosing to go against his nature could it be called unnatural. Beyond that, there appear to be adequate sexual means for members of the same-sex to engage in, and it seems to be possible to develop the emotional tie of love between members of the same sex. This seems natural enough to me.Regardless, there isn't really any reason to prohibit unnatural behavior. I'd definitely say that living in buildings, resisting the urge to cause violence, eating canned food, living monogomously, wearing clothing, mass production, telling the truth, posting on these forums, and billions of other things we do every day are unnatural. I wouldn't agree with restricting things that aren't natural, that's certain.Oh, one more thing: legalizing same-sex marriage doesn't really promote homosexuality. Let me make a comparison: By legalizing the construction of Muslim churches, am I promoting the Muslim religion? Well, no I'm not. I'm simply giving the Muslim religion the same rights that the other religions have. This does not suggest that anyone should become Muslim, it just continues to allow everyone to choose what they please while still enjoying the same rights. The same is true of same-sex marriage.Banning the construction of Muslim churches, on the other hand, is a government signal that the Muslim religion is not acceptable. Even if the government does not take away the freedom of the people to believe in the Muslim religion, it has taken away some of the benefits provided to people over another religion. It has still limited freedom and it still stands against the Muslim religion. What I mean is, permitting same-sex marriage does not promote homosexuality, it is restricting same-sex marriage that attacks homosexuality, in a sense.2. Well, it would be very difficult, I think, to argue that one will become attracted to members of the same-sex simply because he or she is raised by someone who is attracted to the same-sex. But just to prove my point, let's assume that every child raised by a gay person will become gay. This fact in itself is not a harm at all. Only by assuming that homosexuality is somehow bad can we say that children being raised to become homosexual is bad. Now, I admit that many have religious values which claim that homosexuality is a sin, but those people retain the right to raise their children with that value. Those parents have the right to burn the idea that homosexuality is a sin into the minds of their child until that child could not possibly be homosexual. Those parents have the right to corrupt gay children. Or put in a different light, parents always have the right to raise their children as they please. Now, I would argue against that if those children were raised in such a manner that caused them to harm people, but again, we have to assume that homosexuality harms people for that to apply.Now, being familiar with the mindset and ideals of many homosexuals, I find it likely that the most a same-sex couple will do is keep their children open to the idea that it is okay to be homosexual. This is hardly corruption of a straight child and would change the sexuality of very few children.3. Now, I think, or hope, this is one of the points you don't necessarily agree with. Just in case it isn't, let me explain my side of it. There is a very big difference between someone who is attracted to and falls in love with someone of the same sex and someone who is attracted to children of the same sex. Furthermore, there is yet another difference between someone who is attracted to children of the same sex and someone who chooses to molest a child. Those same-sex couples who would be given the right to marry, they are not the same group of people who chooses to molest children any more than you fall into the group of people who choose to molest children of the opposite sex. To suggest that they are somehow related is just as insulting.If we want to be specific, perhaps we can break down adult sexual attraction into three categories under the law: heterosexuality, homosexuality, and pedophilia. Most people are heterosexual, far less people are homosexual, and the smallest group, pedophiles. In this breakdown, heterosexual and homosexuals describe adults who are attracted to other adults. I place the smallest group, pedophiles, in a single category because right now they are treated as such under the law; this group would include any adults who are attracted to minors. Of course any one person can fall into none, one, or more categories of sexual attraction here. Breaking down pedophila, we really have two groups, those who are attracted to children of the same sex, and those who are attracted to children of the opposite sex. Some, but probably very few, pedophiles are also child molesters.Looking at it this way, I hope it becomes more apparent that same-sex marriage brings no new rights and no new benefits to someone for being a pedophile. Same-sex marriage does not encourage people do move into the pedophile group; that group still has no sexual or marriage rights under the law. I will further argue that same-sex marriage discourages pedophilia. This is because it encourages people to move into the homosexuality category. That means that anyone who may have been torn between homosexuality and pedophilia will now have incentive to act on their homosexual instincts, not their pedophile instincts (and I do not mean to imply that there are very many of these people; I suspect that the vast majority of child molesters are not attracted to adults, which is why they feel forced to satisfy their sexual urges any way they can).4. Anti-Christian is the wrong word to use here. Anti-Christian implies that it attacks Christianity in some way, that it takes rights away from Christians, or that it discourages Christianity. These things are not true. Same-sex marriage attacks Christianity no more than allowing one to build a Muslim church does; in fact, it attacks Christianity far less so. Both are expressions of a different belief system, but a Muslim church opens the doors for the community to come worship a faith that opposes the idea of Christianity. Same-sex marriage, on the other hand, is a private institution between two people, and it welcomes Christianity. I would not be surpised if more than half of homosexuals are Christian, though this may be because I have visited many Christian churches accepting of homosexuals in areas with large populations of homosexual people.I do understand that allowing same-sex marriage is an activity that most Christians disagree with, but it seems rather arbitrary to take away the rights of same-sex couples for only this reason when we allow so much other religious freedom. For example, eight of the activities which the ten commandments prohibit are completely legal. Look at number 1! "Thou shalt have no other gods before me." Holy ****! It is no secret that the one unforgivable sin in Christianity is believing in another God. It is no secret that the only way to heaven is through Jesus.But we do not force people to obey the ten commandments, and we do not force people to be Christian. We do not punish people for believing in other religions, and we do not take away the benefits of those who believe something different than we do because our country prides itself on the freedom of religion. That freedom, along with many others was a freedom our forefathers founded this country on. Jefferson himself wanted it noted that he authored the Act for Religious Freedom on his tombstone, and the text of the document stand opposite the text of the Declaration of Independence in the Jefferson Memorial. So we do not take away the rights of those simply because they believe differently, except for one issue: same-sex marriage. I think religious freedom was worth fighting for in Jefferson's days, and it is worth fighting for today, though we may choose words over guns to do our fighting.5. As far as I can tell, the institution of marriage will remain completely unchanged for opposite-sex couples and all future opposite-sex couples to come. That institution stands firm and no one is asking to change it or weaken it in any way. But we are asking for a new institution; an add-on to this institution that will allow more people to engage in it. It will stop marriage from being some exclusive club that only the chosen few can get into and will allow marriage to benefit as many families as it can. There is no weakening going on here except by those who wish to restrict or limit marriage.Health concerns are an important topic, for both you and homosexual families, I'm sure. Let me address them as best I can:1. In many places in the world, such as the United Kingdom and Scotland, AIDS is now more commonly spread through heterosexual activity than homosexual activity. If I remember correctly, homosexual activity in the US accounted for 51% of new AIDS cases in the US in 2003; I've no idea how 2004 fared. There's also plenty of speculation that gays are more likely to be tested for and report cases of HIV infection than heterosexuals due to increased awareness programs targeted at gays in the United States.Anyhow, there are two primary ways AIDS spreads: unprotected sexual promiscuity and sharing needles during drug use. So to figure out whether the spread of AIDS will increase if same-sex marriage is legalized, we must consider whether promiscuity or drug use will increase. Because homosexual promiscuity is more likely to spread AIDS, I would even give credit to the idea that the spread of AIDS would increase if it could be shown that heterosexual promiscuity might change to homosexual promiscuity should same-sex marriage be legalized. But on the contrary, I intend to show that not only would same-sex marriage not cause more homosexual promiscuity, it would actually decrease the spread of AIDS. Allow me to explain:First of all, let us examine the possibility that legalizing same-sex marriage could increase the number of homosexuals. I grant you that it might, but what type of people might become homosexual? Do you think that the most sexually promicuous heterosexuals will see same-sex marriage legalized and suddenly say, "Woah, I'm gay now." Of course they will not. Those people who are most sexually promiscuous are likely very certain of their sexuality and legalizing same-sex marriage will not change that. So who might become homosexual? Not the average heterosexual, no doubt. It could only be those people who are uncertain of their sexuality right now; it could only be those people who might suspect themselves of being homosexual today, but deny it because of society's lack of acceptance. It could only be those to whom sex is not imporantant and to whom giving up sex is worthwhile to comply to the implies rules that our current laws suggest. It can only be the non-promiscuous, and legalizing same-sex marriage will not magically change the non-promiscuous into the promiscuous; it cannot make those who practice safe sex suddenly decide not to. The spread of AIDS will not increase.So how will the spread decrease? Well, the commitment of marriage is a very mental thing. It is one thing for a man to cheat on his girlfriend, but cheating on his wife is completely different. It is one thing for a man to have multiple sex partners while single, but it is completely different to have multiple sex partners after the commitment of marriage has been made. I do not mean to imply that no one has multiple sexual partners after getting married, but I do mean that getting married can have the effect of calming down one's sexual life, of turning a promiscous person into a monogamous person. This sort of commitment could easily turn some promiscuous homosexual men into non-promiscuous ones. Not only that, but the more non-promiscuous gay people there are, the more pressure is put onto promiscuous gay people to meet the standards of other homosexuals.All-in-all, marriage will not increase promiscuity; it will do just the opposite.2. I think the explanation above can apply to STD's in general as well.3. This isn't true at all. What IS true is that the average gay person dies at an earlier age than a straight person. When in completely normal mental and physical health, gay people live just as long as anyone else; sexual orientation or having sex with someone of the same sex does not cause one's lifespan to shorten. The reason the average gay person has a shorter lifespan than the average straight person can be attributed to a number of factors. First, violence against gays is more common than violence against heterosexuals. I don't think this is a huge contributer, but it is worth mentioning. Second, AIDS and other STD's are more common among homosexual men. Third, depression, anxiety, heart problems, and other stress-related diseases are more common among homosexuals.Each one of those issues will become less of a problem should same-sex marriage be legalized. I spoke on AIDS and STD's above. As for violence, the community may be less likely to breed hatred against homosexuals if they do not have inferior rights under the law. Regarding depression and such, well to be honest, it is a tough life being constantly compared to child molesters, being referred to as a sinner, being afraid of what someone might do to you if they knew who you loved, and having to battle for the same rights that your neighbor has. Depression and anxiety will happen, but granting same-sex couples the same rights that the next couple has is the first step toward alleviating that. Allowing same-sex marriage will lengthen lifespans, not shorten them.Hopefully I've answered your points well enough, but I sort of feel like I've forgotten to say some imporant things which were on my mind when I started this post, so maybe I have not. If not, let me know!

1) your link doesn't work, so we can't read the article2) It could also be that early on, people didn't really know what NAMBLA was all about. I didn't know what they were till a few years ago and was shocked they existed at all. 3) You treat this like all gays and lesbains subscribe to the same movement. As a group we all cannot admit to anything. We don't have a "gay leader". There are many different groups fighting for our civil rights. Not all of these groups agree with one another on how things should be done. (much like republicans and democrats, not everyone agrees with the same tatics used to fight the battle)4) You cannot use "what I have heard" as a source or point of reference for a good debate. Mostly because you have little credibility on the knowing about the gay rights movement. You are very misinformed on many of the issues surrounding the gay rights and what those rights mean. You haven't even got past the sex thing to understand our relationship are no different from straight relationships. We are attracted to people based on who they are not what they do in bed.5) I would suggest you learn more about gays and lesbains as people before trying to understand the gay rights movement.

Are you aware that there are plenty of gay parents who are that way BIOLOGICALLY? Do you also suggest removing their parental right simply because you don't approve of who they screw?Are you actually advocating the REMOVAL of rights based on sexual orientation. What next? Job discrimination? Camps? You are the worst kind of scary. Don't be speaking for THIS Christian. SEX is perfectly normal - and most kids learn early on that it feels good to touch their privates. They understand the whys just yet - but we are sexual beings. I have never understood this need to protect kids from the knowledge of sex. It perpetuates the idea that it is dirty and wrong. IT'S NOT. Kids SHOULD know about sex, know what it is, what it's for, what are the consequences of it as soon as they ask the questions (and they will and do). Keep it age approriate - but nothing bad will happen just because they know about sex.You don't see them as anything but a stereotype.And what about those trouble making straight folks? How can I keep my kid clear of you and your brood and the hate you might instill in my son's school? I am sure if you have children they would be the God-fearing Christian sort who dissaprove of fags enough to do God's work by shoving trash into the mouth of my son for defending a gay person he loves.

Not at all, you are by far the best pro-gay debator here. (and I don't mean that as an insult to anyone else)Those who advocate gay marriage seem to imply that once it is legalized, the entire subject will go away, that our society will be better because of it. I see it opening the door to constant conflict.It's human nature to take pride in one's life, to take oportunities to share how one lives with others. The testimonials here and all over the net show that gays are no different. Many of them have the same intent, the same innocence, as when someone describes what they do for a living to someone. I don't believe ALL of them have bad intentions, but I see a desire to further a political agenda. What group with a political agenda does not seek to increase it's numbers? Increasing adoption would be a big way to do it. Many people, myself included, firmly believe that a good orphanage is a far better place for a child to be raised in than by same sex parents. I know you disagree and nothing we say can change each other's minds, but it's a fact that it will become a bigger issue if gay marriage is legalized, and there will be CONFLICT. Gay parents would tend to steer adopted children towards homosexuality because of the political agenda, the numbers increasing thing that I described above. Most Christian parents don't have the desire to encourage their children to "hate" homosexuals. Little kids don't naturally think about sex at all. Since straight parents have no sexual political agenda, they'd rather their kids not be exposed to it at all. They'd rather their kids thought about other things. That 2+2=4, that d-o-g spells dog, that c-a-t spells cat. Practical learning. I don't see homosexuals as having bad intentions as much as I see them having political intentions, and I don't see it stopping only with gay marriage. If I were to meet with some same sex couples I'm sure I would find them to be decent people as you describe. But it wouldn't take a very big percentage of those of them who ARE trouble makers, to cause a lot of trouble, and to recruit followers, and create enemies in the straight community. SCHOOLS would be the centers of conflict. I did notice your comments about children in your post #50, however there have been no responses to my post #47.

Thank you. There are many excellent debaters on both sides of the issue here, and being considered on the same level as some of those people is encouraging.I think few people would disagree that our society is already in just about as much of a conflict as it could be about this issue. If same-sex marriage is legalized, there will still be conflict, but at least those people who are denied rights currently will have those rights during the conflict. Besides, there will always be conflict in a society where the people have the power to change the laws, but that conflict isn't usually a bad thing.But beyond the scope of conflict, my argument is actually that this conflict should end, and that it should end in favor of same-sex marriage. I can say with certainty that it will never end while same-sex couples still exist and while they do not have the same rights that everyone else does under the law.You did raise the question, "What group with a political agenda does not seek to increase it's numbers?" I must ask that same question of you. If same-sex parents seek to expand their political agenda through children, then there is no reason to believe that opposite-sex couples would not do the same. I ask then, who has more political agendas than the stereotypical Christian? Christians tend to oppose same-sex marriage, oppose abortion, push for religion in schools and politics, support counselling before marriage, and any of a good many other political stances. These are each a political agenda. If it is reasonable to suggest that same-sex parents would impose their single agenda upon their children, it is reasonable to suppose that Christian parents would do the same, only far worse, having more agendas and all. By the same logic, those parents would teach their children about their political agendas instead of practical things, like 2+2=4, and how to spell "dog". By the same logic, those parents are creating conflict and should thus not be allowed to adopt.But Christian parents don't do that, do they? Despite having so many political agendas, they teach their parents practical things after all. They may teach their children that homosexuality is wrong, that abortion is wrong, or one of many other political stances, but that isn't what they think parenting is, and it isn't nearly the most important influence they intend to have on their children.I will argue that you look at gay rights debate forums and listen to gays speak about gay rights on the news, and you make the assumption that gays are only about one thing. But I could just as easily watch Christians speak about gay rights and listen to them speak on gay rights forums and assume the same about them. The truth is that boths sides are just people with countless aspects to their lives, and both sides want the best for their children.Furthermore, I wonder precisely what the agenda of same-sex parents would be after same-sex marriage is legalized. Certainly there are a few smaller gay rights issues, and they would have to fight for some time to keep it legal, but with equality, the need for a political agenda fades. There would certainly be far less conflict overall if homosexuals just gave in and accepted defeat immediately, but the same would be true of those who oppose it. In reality neither will ever happen. Remember, the argument I give suggests that homosexuality is morally correct; and it is worth fighting for that which is morally right.I think then that if it can be shown that any children of opposite-sex parents cause a conflict, then opposite-sex parents should lose their rights to raise children as well. Would you truely punish the whole for the actions of a few? It does not matter whether you would; if you claim that same-sex couples should not be allowed to raise their children to believe that homosexuality is morally right, then you must apply the same logic to those who raise their children to think that homosexuality is morally wrong. You would also have to apply that same logic to anyone on any side of a political issue, and soon, no one would have children. There are already incredible amounts of conflict over all sorts of political issues in school, same-sex marriage least of all, and this makes school a breeding ground for developing one's own opinion on the issue.Should you be worried that gay rights will not stop with same-sex marriage and that gay people will push to give themselves some kind of unequal advantage over straight people, then rest assured that I will stand with you against such inequality when it shows its face. But that is not a good reason to stand against equality now, and I do not see reason to believe that gay rights will go anywhere beyond equal.As for your comments in post #47, I have seen no civil rights or political issue classes appear in high schools. I have certainly seen those classes all over colleges, but adding classes about homosexuality and gay rights would surely be offered only as an optional replacement for current civil rights classes, not as a replacement for courses on workplace-related skills. Even if they did, considering the discussions we've had so far, I would think a good gay rights class might encourage students to learn and think in ways that they had never considered before. Finally, I've got to wonder what makes you think stopping same-sex marriage will stop these classes. Interestingly, I don't think it will.I hope you enjoyed my response! Hmm, it appears I must respond to JPSarte too.

Not at all, you are by far the best pro-gay debator here. (and I don't mean that as an insult to anyone else)Those who advocate gay marriage seem to imply that once it is legalized, the entire subject will go away, that our society will be better because of it. I see it opening the door to constant conflict.It's human nature to take pride in one's life, to take oportunities to share how one lives with others. The testimonials here and all over the net show that gays are no different. Many of them have the same intent, the same innocence, as when someone describes what they do for a living to someone. I don't believe ALL of them have bad intentions, but I see a desire to further a political agenda. What group with a political agenda does not seek to increase it's numbers? Increasing adoption would be a big way to do it. Many people, myself included, firmly believe that a good orphanage is a far better place for a child to be raised in than by same sex parents. I know you disagree and nothing we say can change each other's minds, but it's a fact that it will become a bigger issue if gay marriage is legalized, and there will be CONFLICT.

I suppose you might have a point if the child victims of pedophiles found it "natural" to be abused.They don't. You have illustrated nothing other than a willingness to smear.
attacks
We're starting to get into the area of massive missives. I'd like to reply to all of this post, but don't want it to be unreadable due to shear size, so I'll break my reply up into sections.I don't mean to offend you with the following analogy, but it illustrates a point. To a pedophile, it is "natural" to want to have sex with a young child, but it is unnatural for those of us who aren't pedophiles. So, for a homosexual to say that it's "natural" really doesn't carry much weight with a straight person who sees pedophiles and homosexuals both as sexual deviants and, depending on one's bent, may find one or both abominable acts.If I may, I'd like to restate your examples above in their more basic form. It is very natural to seek shelter from the elements. It is natural to fear the reprucussions of initiating violence on another. For example, a domestic housecat won't normally take on a raccoon of similar size for just that reason. It is very natural to eat.The only thing unnatural is the container that the food comes in. Wearing clothes to protect against the environment is also very natural. As for the rest, they can also be broken down in terms of basic natural acts, such as communication. But homosexual sex isn't a natural act. The only time that I've heard of homosexuality occurring in nature was under "unnatural" conditions, such as overcrowding.Funny that you should choose that example. I happen to live in the area with the largest population of Middle Easterners outside of the ME. Dearborn, MI has become the Muslim capital of the US primarily because Muslims are accepted, have mosques, ethnic restaurants, community centers, etc., and draw other Muslims into the community from outside of the area. They also "recruit" others to become Muslims by their presence, through interaction with others in the community that aren't MEers, and by encouraging those who have strayed away from Christianity. Remember, it is a Muslim's job to either convert "infidels" or dominate them. Agreed. Now, if the government saw the spread of Islamic Fundamentalism as a threat to our society, it would ban the construction of Fundamentalist Islamic mosques and let radical Muslims know that they weren't welcome. By preventing the building of mosques, not allowing the immigration of more radical Muslims into the US and making it tougher for Muslims to gain a foothold in the area, it could be argued that the government was attempting to prevent the spread of something that was found to be a threat to society as a whole, correct?OK, now given the above hypothetical situation regarding radical Islam and the government's hypothetical response to it, an argument can be made that preventing gay marriage is akin to stopping the spread of Fundamentalist Islamic radicals. By preventing gay marriage, it is attempting to stop the spread of something that it has determined is detrimental to society as a whole. The battle lies in convincing John Q. Public that gays aren't the moral equivalent of radical Muslims.I'll respond to #2 in another post and the rest in individual posts as well.(Please don't take all of my statements above as representative of my personal beliefs. I am playing devil's advocate and don't necessarily buy the arguments presented.)

My intent wasn't to inflame, but rather to inform. I'm trying to portray a realistic picture of the viewpoint held by many of those that strongly oppose gay marriage and let you know what would be necessary to overcome some of those beliefs.I'd be annoyed, just like you, but if you think that I'm presenting an unrealistic impression of the battle that you have, you are grossly underestimating your opposition. My beliefs are typically logically driven, but I hear opinions voiced from other straights that'd curl your hair. As I mentioned before, you have a helluva PR battle to fight and I'm just scratching the surface on opposition viewpoints. For example, the belief that pedophiles are homosexuals and NOT that they can be heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual predators of kids, is widespread amongst straights, for example.The economic arguments are easy to refute if you have the facts to do so and the person you're debating accepts that information as fact. You need to change peoples' perceptions as well and that's not an easy task. This is EXACTLY the fear that many straights have; they fear that you'll recruit their kids. I linked the satirical version of the argument because I thought it would be less offensive than the real argument.To be honest with you, I haven't given the concept of recruitment much thought, personally, but have heard others voice that fear. I've read quite a few studies and summaries of studies from authors on both sides of the issue. The one theme that keeps reappearing is that there appear to be both biological and environmental factors that affect one's sexual orientation. Here's a good summary of some of those summaries:http://allpsych.com/journal/homosexuality.htmlI'm trying to state opinions and beliefs that I've either heard or hold, personally. The intent isn't to inflame, outrage or take shots at gays. The purpose is to debate which positions are factual and which aren't. If you're offended by some of my statements, then maybe you shouldn't respond to those that upset you. Let someone who is capable of responding in a dispassionate manner handle that rebuttal. Don't feel obligated to respond to everything that you read as I have selected only those responses that have maintained a modicum of civility to reply to.I'm sure that you are aware that there are many stereotypes out there regarding gays, behaviors, goals, etc., that range from accurate to the absurd, but if we don't get them out in the open for comment, how will anyone know which are which? emoticonXConfused

You requested a civil debate. I and others have tried to be civil with you.However, whether your above statement is your personal belief or not, it is EXTREMELY offensive. If by "playing the devil's advocate", you wish to offend, you have accomplished it. Such statements are blatently inflamitory.Some posters, such as "jyoshu", will cry that I am being "oversensative". To them I ask; How would YOU react to being equated to a pedofile?You came here arguing the substantial cost of legalizing gay marriage. You were shown to be incorrect, and somewhat graciously condeded the issue.Then you posted an obviously satirical article about gay people recruiting heterosexuals. Whether you knew it was misinformation or not, I don't know.Now, whether they are your personal beliefs or not, you insult and offend.Did you come here to gain understanding or to inflame? Have you actually read what the AMA and the two APA's say about homosexuality? I seriously doubt it. Instead, you come here posting unfounded opinions that have been shown to be false, satarical articles that you seem to accept as truth, and insulting, inflamitory, prejudicial statements that flame the homophobic fire of hate.I have tried to engage in a civil debate with you and am willing to continue to try to. But I will not be a party to the spreading of insults and misinformation.

"try to"? "nowadays"? Sounds like chain-yanking time again.Yes, let's try to do that. There is a long history of what we now see as inappropriate sexual contact between adults and children. In many societies, including our own until recently, child brides were common. Today, this practice is largely frowned upon though it is still legal in far too many states (mostly red ones, I believe).As for illegal, truly pedophillic organizations, NAMBLA gets a lot of press, but there are far larger man/girl sex organizations (or generally man/child since pedophiles don't make much distinction between boys and girls). They are rarely mentioned. The larger heterosexual community takes no responsibility for "hetero" molesters. We'll take no responsibility for "homo" ones.I will take just as much responsibility for NAMBLA and sex between men and boys as you will take for the existence of heterosexual pedophilic organizations and sex between men and girls. Deal?I'm just going to ignore the "not separate" jab. You ought to be above that sort of thing... but you're not.What groups "in general" are you talking about? What umbrella gay organizations existed in the 70s and 80s and what were their positions on NAMBLA? Surely you must "remember".The article and all others like it that I have seen rely on one or two appearences of NAMBLA representatives or members at discussion meetings open to the public. MOST of these articles are actually about one particular meeting in NYC. They also rely on the very rare appearances of NAMBLA members at or in a pride parade. To take such instances as evidence of association or alliance would mean that the GOP must take responsibility for white supremacists. They don't. We won't.What you, and those on the right, conveniently ignore is that the gay rights movement was not and, to a large degree, still is not hierarchical. Especially in the early days, there was no one to "permit" or "forbid" a particular group from participating. Even in cases where there was strong opposition to someone being in a parade, for example, who was going to stop them? (I seem to recall on case where some in the crowd on the sidelines took their signs and smashed them and ran them out of the parade.)You folks also forget just how negatively society viewed gay people (largely thanks to your own groups' efforts). To many people, there was NO DIFFERENCE between gay people and other "perverts", so it wasn't so outlandish for gay groups to listen to a wide variety of society's outcasts or hidden groups: S&M practitioners, COYOTE, lesbian separatists, etc. Because of our own history, we were willing to consider ideas that the mainstream rejected. We knew there was nothing wrong with us. Forgive us for thinking that some other folks fell into the same class and were just misunderstood.And before you leap with an "aha!", remember that many of those groups are no longer considered "perverts" and some others have even been mainstreamed.As for NAMBLA in particular, are you so naive as to believe that they approached gay groups with the agenda of making sex with toddlers acceptable? No, their arguments to the gay community centered on issues like age of consent laws. At the time, and to this day, many states have biased age of consent laws, with one standard for heterosexual relationships and another for homosexual ones. THAT IS NOT FAIR. Making age of consent laws orientation-neutral IS a gay rights issue. I see repeated accusations on anti-gay sites and in anti-gay articles that "gays want to lower the age of consent for man/boy sex to 12!!!!" with all the (well founded) outrage one might associate with that idea. What they leave out is that in that case the heterosexual age of consent was already 12 and had been for a long, long time. Gay people supported making the laws EQUAL and RAISING both to a more suitable age.[Personally, I don't think any adults should have sexual relationships with any underage teens*, but if heterosexual men can date 16 year-old girls, then gay men should be able to date 16 year-old boys. (I shudder just to type it). If opposite-sex kids can play doctor with no legal consequences, then same-sex kids should face no legal penalties, either.* I'd prefer a firm distinction between adult and non-adult with sliding-scale age restrictions for non-adult cases]
attacks
I understand your desire for more specifics, but at this point you are pretty much arguing with the article itself. Based on what I know regarding this from such articles and from what I've always heard, gay rights groups in general didn't see their movement as separate from the NAMBLA one early on. This article certainly supports that conclusion. In my opinion, it would be better if the gay movement simply admitted this rather than trying to sweep it under the rug or deny it at all costs. It hasn't even been that long ago in fact. It's a skeleton in the closet, but that doesn't mean it's that way now. I have no problem with the fact that gay rights groups try to distance themselves from pederasty nowadays, but let's at least be honest about the past.

Extraordinary chain yanking. Does it occur to you that before "gay pride", it was illegal in most places for two men to live together "that way"? How in the world would they have even been able to adopt a child for "selfless" reasons?You really are a phenomenal twit.
attacks
I would even go farther than that and note that gay adoptions have risen significantly since the gay pride movement came on the scene, so one can't help but wonder if to some degree many of these adoptions are an attempt at a form of social protest, not entirely for the sake of the child. If the phenomenon were truly in the spirit of benevolence in general, it would stand to reason that they gays would not have waited until it became associated with gay pride to do so. Can you imagine knowing you were adopted as a form of social protest???Sort of like the social protest fad gay marriages we saw as soon as Massachusetts made it legal. If they were for real, gay marriages wouldn't have dropped off to a trickle now given the supposed percentage of gay people in this country.Agreed.

Sorry for the "out of order" responses.

There is no such thing as the National Gay and Lesbian Recruitment Task Force. It was all a joke!!!!! And evidently you fell for it as truth. emoticonXFrazzled It just shows that you need to be careful about the sources of your information.Sorry, but I am still laughing over this one. :) I have already refered you to the AMA and the two APA's and their positions on this subject. I guess it depends on who one wishes to believe; respected, professional medical and mental health associations or Fred Phelps. As I said before, there is not yet a definative answer, but the preponderance of unbiased, scientific evidence suggests it is inate. Again, if you will read the AMA and the two APA's positions on children raised by gay parents, you will find that the children are not recuited into homosexuality and do quite well socially.It is a common tool of homophobic, radical straights to promote prejudice and hate. It simply has no basis in fact.

You're right, and I fear it is partially due to my long-windedness. I will try to write shorter responses to accomodate forum-reading and responding.As a matter of fact, I too would make the claim that it is natural to be a pedophile. To be perfectly fair, I believe how natural it is to be a child molester is up for debate, but I specifically made the point later on that natural is not the same as good. I following this, I tried to make the point that natural is not the same as good, nor is there even any correlation between the two. Suggesting that pedophilia is natural furthers my point. I guess what I mean is: I have shown that homosexuality satisfies the definition of the word "natural". If that does not satisfy you, then perhaps there is another word you wish to use in place of natural.If we are allowed to break things down into their basic components, then everything can be considered natural. I could just as soon break down homosexuality into its basic components of the desire to love and be loved, as well as factors of lust and call it natural. As for food, you do admit the packaging to be unnaturally wrapped. If we are assuming that which is unnatural is morally wrong, then packaging food certainly must be morally wrong. As for the food inside a can, perhaps it is not simply beans but wheat processed in a factory to become noodles shaped like various letters of the alphabet, then covered in tomato paste and injected with preservatives. And wearing clothes! The only time that I've heard of wearing clothes occurring in nature was under "unnatural" conditions, such as humans putting the clothes on a pet.When you said that homosexuality does only occurs in nature under "unnatural" conditions, I assume you meant only across animals, as there is no doubt that humans engage in it under conditions equivalent to that of heterosexuality. And since this reference to animals was implied, I think we should determine what else is unnatural using that same criteria. So is restraint natural? Do you often see animals get angry at each other but just shrug it off, or do they tend to tear each other apart? How about generosity? Do animals give generously to the other animals, or do they horde for themselves and eat the eggs of another animal if given the chance? How about government? Do we often see animals following a set of laws that their elected official has handed down to them? Do we see animals calling the actions of other animals abomination? Do we see animals worshiping God? Yes, it is true; using the same criteria that you have presented to call homosexuality unnatural, I will suggest that worshipping God is also unnatural. Even in "unnatural" conditions, I have never seen worshipping a higher power occur in nature. Where is the difference? What makes one morally right and one morally wrong? I issue the proposal that whether or not we classify something as natural has nothing to do with whether that thing is morally right or morally wrong.Well, most importantly, you have suggested that it is not the equal protection under the law that converts people to the Muslim faith, it is the presence of Muslims. Regardless, my only argument in what I wrote was that allowing same-sex marriage does not promote the homosexual lifestyle. To promote implies that it would push that lifestyle above others on the acceptance scale. In reality, it would make that lifestyle equal to all others on the acceptance scale (well, not in the minds of the people but in the law of the government).I should also mention that I attend school at the University of Michigan - Dearborn. I graduated last year with a degree in Computer Science, and I am taking some post-graduate classes before I return for even more school (Yay!). During my time there, I have befriended, grouped with for school projects, and tutored many Muslims from both the University of Michigan - Dearborn and Henry Ford Community College (which is right next door, for those of you who have never been to Dearborn). None have tried to recruit me to the Muslim faith. Now, perhaps my experience is not representative of Muslims as a whole, perhaps it is; I don't claim to know. I only meant present my experience with Muslims.It could certainly be argued that the goverment intended to stop the spread of something that was found to be a threat to society as a whole, but that wouldn't make it right for the government to do so. The government or the society will claim that whatever it wants to ban is a threat to society, but that doesn't mean it actually is a threat to society. What if we weren't talking about Fundamentalist Muslims, we were talking about a religion preaching kindness and generosity. The government would be completely unjustified in taking away their rights under the law. This religion actually would not be a threat to society. This is imperative to understand when considering same-sex marriage. People can deny rights to same-sex couples, claiming that same-sex marriage is a threat to society all they want, but if they don't have any evidence to back that up, then they are still morally evil.Your statement does not list the ways that same-sex marriage is a threat to society, it simply claims that society is justified in banning that which they see as a threat. I'm claiming that they are absolutely not justified. To turn the tables, what if society saw Christianity as a threat? Would not the society be evil for taking away the rights of kind and generous Christians, then refusing to give back those rights unless the Christians went through generations of debate to prove themselves? Is the society any less evil if they call those Christians sinners and claim to love the Christian but not his actions? Is it the society any less evil if they try to keep Christians out of schools, deny Christians the right to marry, issue religious statements denouncing Christianity, cheer and celebrate when Christian rights are stripped in the nation's Constitution, and tell Christians that if they really wanted to change, they could.That society is evil, and I will not back down in saying it, just as I will not back down in saying that any society is evil which stands against a harmless belief or a harmless love. It is not up to the minority who is persecuted to prove their own worth. The society is given the power in our government, and it is the moral responsibility of that society to be certain that it does not use its power to strip away the rights and happiness of those minorities who are good and just.That may be. But if we as a people could truly call ourselves good, it would not be.Understandable. Playing Devil's Advocate helps us better understand an argument. Even if these were your beliefs, I would not hold them against you.So much for shortening my posts.

I didn't say anything about "removal", that was a conclusion you jumped to. I was talking about "adoption", not biological. Another conclusion you jumped to. No it perpetuates the idea that it's a PRIVATE thing. Private within a family, subject to the conditions determined by that family. Not something to be flaunted in public. We wear clothes in public - there are plenty of things for elementary children to think of besides sex.If there's no gay marriage, me and my brood wouldn't have reason to instill any hate in your son's school, if he wouldn't get in anyone's face about his sexual beliefs. Then me and my brood and your son could all learn that 2+2 equals 4 in peace and harmony. If there IS gay marriage, then many teachers will think that preparing kids for ALLLL the sexual options they will soon have will be more important than spending so much time learning that 2+2=4. If my brood takes exception to it, you'll call it hate, and if there IS gay marriage, you just may have legal rights to insist that all taxpayers provide your son with a separate school. And we can't afford it."Shoving trash", and "defending". Reversible terms, depending on ones point of view.

Job discrimination? Camps? You are the worst kind of scary. Don't be speaking for THIS Christian. SEX is perfectly normal - and most kids learn early on that it feels good to touch their privates. They understand the whys just yet - but we are sexual beings. I have never understood this need to protect kids from the knowledge of sex. It perpetuates the idea that it is dirty and wrong. IT'S NOT. Kids SHOULD know about sex, know what it is, what it's for, what are the consequences of it as soon as they ask the questions (and they will and do). Keep it age approriate - but nothing bad will happen just because they know about sex.You don't see them as anything but a stereotype.And what about those trouble making straight folks? How can I keep my kid clear of you and your brood and the hate you might instill in my son's school? I am sure if you have children they would be the God-fearing Christian sort who dissaprove of fags enough to do God's work by shoving trash into the mouth of my son for defending a gay person he loves.

I know this was not in response to something I wrote, but am curious to know why you believe this to be more than a fictional story. I could just as easily say that your son would attack mine for his beliefs and cause a disruption. You could also make the claim that this story would hold true for the child of any gay rights activist, or even the child on any other political issue. But you don't. You believe that this will only happen for children of same-sex couples and only on the issue of gay rights. I am curious to know why same-sex couples and gay rights specifically. Oh, and why would gay rights replace other education? I can't remember any similar events causing this historically.

I didn't say anything about "removal", that was a conclusion you jumped to. I was talking about "adoption", not biological. Another conclusion you jumped to. No it perpetuates the idea that it's a PRIVATE thing. Private within a family, subject to the conditions determined by that family. Not something to be flaunted in public. We wear clothes in public - there are plenty of things for elementary children to think of besides sex.If there's no gay marriage, me and my brood wouldn't have reason to instill any hate in your son's school, if he wouldn't get in anyone's face about his sexual beliefs. Then me and my brood and your son could all learn that 2+2 equals 4 in peace and harmony. If there IS gay marriage, then many teachers will think that preparing kids for ALLLL the sexual options they will soon have will be more important than spending so much time learning that 2+2=4. If my brood takes exception to it, you'll call it hate, and if there IS gay marriage, you just may have legal rights to insist that all taxpayers provide your son with a separate school. And we can't afford it."Shoving trash", and "defending". Reversible terms, depending on ones point of view.

Well at least you are actually weighing in on something here.Unfortunately your post so far misses the point. This isn't a contest to see whether straights or gays bear more responsibility on pederasty. The issue you responded to was about the obvious link early on between gay rights (at the time) and pederasty. As the article pointed out, Stonewall was partly carried out by the youths involved in these relationships. Ironcially, as you can see from the article, NAMBLA rose in part from Stonewall as well. So in a sense, the gay rights movement and pederasty are inexplicably linked when it comes to the origins of their organizations. There is simply no way to separate the gay rights movement from the reality that it's origins lie in this. It's a black eye on the movement, but at least in recent years your movement has sought to separate itslf from it in any way possible.Ok, that's fair enough.I would say that in many respects, society still views you all in that way. But aren't you putting the cart before the horse here? Don't you think the reason society viewed gays that way is because of what the article talked about?But why didn't you draw the line somewhere? Surely in retrospect you can see that pederasty isn't exactly a benevolent movement to accept.So you are telling me that your movement pushed to have the age of consent laws raised?

"try to"? "nowadays"? Sounds like chain-yanking time again.Yes, let's try to do that. There is a long history of what we now see as inappropriate sexual contact between adults and children. In many societies, including our own until recently, child brides were common. Today, this practice is largely frowned upon though it is still legal in far too many states (mostly red ones, I believe).As for illegal, truly pedophillic organizations, NAMBLA gets a lot of press, but there are far larger man/girl sex organizations (or generally man/child since pedophiles don't make much distinction between boys and girls). They are rarely mentioned. The larger heterosexual community takes no responsibility for "hetero" molesters. We'll take no responsibility for "homo" ones.I will take just as much responsibility for NAMBLA and sex between men and boys as you will take for the existence of heterosexual pedophilic organizations and sex between men and girls. Deal?I'm just going to ignore the "not separate" jab. You ought to be above that sort of thing... but you're not.What groups "in general" are you talking about? What umbrella gay organizations existed in the 70s and 80s and what were their positions on NAMBLA? Surely you must "remember".The article and all others like it that I have seen rely on one or two appearences of NAMBLA representatives or members at discussion meetings open to the public. MOST of these articles are actually about one particular meeting in NYC. They also rely on the very rare appearances of NAMBLA members at or in a pride parade. To take such instances as evidence of association or alliance would mean that the GOP must take responsibility for white supremacists. They don't. We won't.What you, and those on the right, conveniently ignore is that the gay rights movement was not and, to a large degree, still is not hierarchical. Especially in the early days, there was no one to "permit" or "forbid" a particular group from participating. Even in cases where there was strong opposition to someone being in a parade, for example, who was going to stop them? (I seem to recall on case where some in the crowd on the sidelines took their signs and smashed them and ran them out of the parade.)You folks also forget just how negatively society viewed gay people (largely thanks to your own groups' efforts). To many people, there was NO DIFFERENCE between gay people and other "perverts", so it wasn't so outlandish for gay groups to listen to a wide variety of society's outcasts or hidden groups: S&M practitioners, COYOTE, lesbian separatists, etc. Because of our own history, we were willing to consider ideas that the mainstream rejected. We knew there was nothing wrong with us. Forgive us for thinking that some other folks fell into the same class and were just misunderstood.And before you leap with an "aha!", remember that many of those groups are no longer considered "perverts" and some others have even been mainstreamed.As for NAMBLA in particular, are you so naive as to believe that they approached gay groups with the agenda of making sex with toddlers acceptable? No, their arguments to the gay community centered on issues like age of consent laws. At the time, and to this day, many states have biased age of consent laws, with one standard for heterosexual relationships and another for homosexual ones. THAT IS NOT FAIR. Making age of consent laws orientation-neutral IS a gay rights issue. I see repeated accusations on anti-gay sites and in anti-gay articles that "gays want to lower the age of consent for man/boy sex to 12!!!!" with all the (well founded) outrage one might associate with that idea. What they leave out is that in that case the heterosexual age of consent was already 12 and had been for a long, long time. Gay people supported making the laws EQUAL and RAISING both to a more suitable age.[Personally, I don't think any adults should have sexual relationships with any underage teens*, but if heterosexual men can date 16 year-old girls, then gay men should be able to date 16 year-old boys. (I shudder just to type it). If opposite-sex kids can play doctor with no legal consequences, then same-sex kids should face no legal penalties, either.* I'd prefer a firm distinction between adult and non-adult with sliding-scale age restrictions for non-adult cases]

When I say conflict, I'm mainly referring to brand new school curriculums that I believe would come about soon after gay marriage was legalized. The actions of school administrators don't always mirror the desires of the voting public.I believe one conflict would end, and a much more severe one would take it's place.No same sex marriage, no abortion, religion in schools and politics, - all commonplace and not controversial only a few decades ago. I don't believe majorities seek to increase their numbers, unless of course, they feel THREATENED.You and I may have different definitions of the word "agenda". If something has been proven to work, I don't see a desire to keep it, to protect it from those who would destry it, as the same aggressive "agenda" that gay marriage is.emoticonXConfused IMO many, if not most of the pro gay posters on this forum have chips on their shoulders. I see a vengefulness that I don't see on other forums at this site.With the vengefulness that I refered to above, I believe the continuing agenda would be legal claims of discrimination in schools and workplaces. Remedies would mainly consist of accommodations and separations that would cost STRAIGHT taxpayers plenty of money. Now I know that makes me a homophobe. Homophobe means having an "irrational fear". It's recently being morphed into an offensive term to be used against anyone who opposes special rights for gays. If we check U.S. history, or world history, we see that a fear of incrementalism in politics is not irrational, it's very real. When FDR was starting social security, he claimed that it would be a voluntary program. Today's anti smoking hysteria started a few decades ago with "no smoking on airline flights of 2 hours or less." A whole book could be filled with documentation of how incrementalism has caused governments and dictatorships to grow in the last 100 years.Parents who teach their children that homosexuality is wrong are less likely to encourage their children to make it a public issue, and therefore far less likely to cause a conflict.BY THEN IT WILL BE TOO LATE. Political mistakes are often impossible to reverse.I was referring almost completely to elementary schools - sorry I didn't make that more clear.I appreciate your civility!! :)

Thank you. There are many excellent debaters on both sides of the issue here, and being considered on the same level as some of those people is encouraging.I think few people would disagree that our society is already in just about as much of a conflict as it could be about this issue. If same-sex marriage is legalized, there will still be conflict, but at least those people who are denied rights currently will have those rights during the conflict. Besides, there will always be conflict in a society where the people have the power to change the laws, but that conflict isn't usually a bad thing.But beyond the scope of conflict, my argument is actually that this conflict should end, and that it should end in favor of same-sex marriage. I can say with certainty that it will never end while same-sex couples still exist and while they do not have the same rights that everyone else does under the law.You did raise the question, "What group with a political agenda does not seek to increase it's numbers?" I must ask that same question of you. If same-sex parents seek to expand their political agenda through children, then there is no reason to believe that opposite-sex couples would not do the same. I ask then, who has more political agendas than the stereotypical Christian? Christians tend to oppose same-sex marriage, oppose abortion, push for religion in schools and politics, support counselling before marriage, and any of a good many other political stances. These are each a political agenda. If it is reasonable to suggest that same-sex parents would impose their single agenda upon their children, it is reasonable to suppose that Christian parents would do the same, only far worse, having more agendas and all. By the same logic, those parents would teach their children about their political agendas instead of practical things, like 2+2=4, and how to spell "dog". By the same logic, those parents are creating conflict and should thus not be allowed to adopt.But Christian parents don't do that, do they? Despite having so many political agendas, they teach their parents practical things after all. They may teach their children that homosexuality is wrong, that abortion is wrong, or one of many other political stances, but that isn't what they think parenting is, and it isn't nearly the most important influence they intend to have on their children.I will argue that you look at gay rights debate forums and listen to gays speak about gay rights on the news, and you make the assumption that gays are only about one thing. But I could just as easily watch Christians speak about gay rights and listen to them speak on gay rights forums and assume the same about them. The truth is that boths sides are just people with countless aspects to their lives, and both sides want the best for their children.Furthermore, I wonder precisely what the agenda of same-sex parents would be after same-sex marriage is legalized. Certainly there are a few smaller gay rights issues, and they would have to fight for some time to keep it legal, but with equality, the need for a political agenda fades. There would certainly be far less conflict overall if homosexuals just gave in and accepted defeat immediately, but the same would be true of those who oppose it. In reality neither will ever happen. Remember, the argument I give suggests that homosexuality is morally correct; and it is worth fighting for that which is morally right.I think then that if it can be shown that any children of opposite-sex parents cause a conflict, then opposite-sex parents should lose their rights to raise children as well. Would you truely punish the whole for the actions of a few? It does not matter whether you would; if you claim that same-sex couples should not be allowed to raise their children to believe that homosexuality is morally right, then you must apply the same logic to those who raise their children to think that homosexuality is morally wrong. You would also have to apply that same logic to anyone on any side of a political issue, and soon, no one would have children. There are already incredible amounts of conflict over all sorts of political issues in school, same-sex marriage least of all, and this makes school a breeding ground for developing one's own opinion on the issue.Should you be worried that gay rights will not stop with same-sex marriage and that gay people will push to give themselves some kind of unequal advantage over straight people, then rest assured that I will stand with you against such inequality when it shows its face. But that is not a good reason to stand against equality now, and I do not see reason to believe that gay rights will go anywhere beyond equal.As for your comments in post #47, I have seen no civil rights or political issue classes appear in high schools. I have certainly seen those classes all over colleges, but adding classes about homosexuality and gay rights would surely be offered only as an optional replacement for current civil rights classes, not as a replacement for courses on workplace-related skills. Even if they did, considering the discussions we've had so far, I would think a good gay rights class might encourage students to learn and think in ways that they had never considered before. Finally, I've got to wonder what makes you think stopping same-sex marriage will stop these classes. Interestingly, I don't think it will.I hope you enjoyed my response! Hmm, it appears I must respond to JPSarte too.

Because of the vengefulness that I referred to above. I can't think of a past event similar to legalizing gay marriage. It may not replace it to a great extent ALL AT ONCE, but we don't know. It would be a big experiment - an irreversable one.

The "obviousness" of that link is in your mind. It's also waaay off chronologically. You need to read up on the gay rights movement. It's a lot older than you realize.Something you should take with a large grain of salt, since the article also seems to think that Stonewall took place in Boston. Or that Greenwich Village, a neighborhood in Manhattan, is "nearby" to Boston:>>If radicalism had a home in the 1970s, it was in Boston. The city was rife with a rebellious spirit. Just a decade earlier, the street youth of nearby Greenwich Village had ignited the modern-day gay rights movement by rioting at the Stonewall Inn bar. <<Oh, and for anyone who looks to Wikipedia as a "source", here's something from their disclaimer page:Wikipedia is an online open-content encyclopedia, that is, a voluntary association of individuals and groups who are developing a common resource of human knowledge. Its structure allows anyone with an Internet connection and World Wide Web browser to alter the content found here. Therefore, please be advised that nothing found here has necessarily been reviewed by professionals with the expertise necessary to provide you with complete, accurate or reliable information.For all we know, you may have entered all the stuff tying Stonewall to pederasty. Clearly, whoever did it is quite a ways off base.Sure there is. Rely on the true historical record.It strikes me that you have a black eye of your own to repair. Earlier you said that you've followed this issue for many years. If you had, the Wikipedia story would have struck you as odd.Your credibility is shot, as far as I'm concerned.The reason society viewed and views gays that way is because of religious indoctrination and lies intentionally spread by hypocrits and bigots.Why didn't WHO draw the line? There is no gay organization that controls us.In retrospect? When do you suppose I ever thought it was benevolent?Again, "my movement" pushed neither one way nor the other. Some people in some gay groups sought to have age of consent laws equalized. I suspect a very large majority of gay people believe that should happen. In the particular case that I mentioned, and that anti-gay folks like to flog so much, the gay people involved in the fight to equalize the age of consent law in question also supported the same position as those opposed to equalizing them: both sides wanted to raise the 12yo limit. So, yes, "my movement" pushed to have the age of consent law (singular, as it was just one case) raised.

If you will permit me, I'd like to take a shot at addressing Marc's concerns with a concrete example. You asked "Why would gay rights replace other education?"I've asked my kids school just that question prior to them engaging in "gay awareness month", an activity sponsored by the NEA. here's a sampling right from the 1996 NEA list of resolutions:Now, tell me, if the NEA pushes for training programs to teach these concepts, where does the time come from? You guessed it: reading writing and arithmetic. I don't believe that it's the schools job to teach ethics, morals, behavior modification, etc., to MY kids. That's MY responsibility. That is also why many straights see homosexuality as a threat to them. It's would-be PC do-gooders that try to usurp the parental responsibilities. emoticonXCensored And this applies to more than just teaching about gay awareness. We have the dumbest kids with the highest self-esteem in the world as a result of all of this touchy-feely BS social indoctrination. emoticonXMad

My recollection of public school from kindergarten to 6th and parochial school from then on is that there's plenty of time for reading, 'riting, and 'rithmetic. Along with Band and Art and Mechanical Drawing and Religion and Ethics and Latin and German and Spanish and Russian and American History and Theology and all sorts of other classes. Yes, I was a nerd. But other kids took those and more classes, as well. The problem isn't time, it's funding and parental support. The problem is putting tax cuts above investing in the next generation.That's not a "PC" problem.Of course it's the job of the schools to teach ethics and behavior. Insofar as "morals" don't coincide with ethics, I agree, they belong at home.Be honest here. A minority of straights see gay awareness in the schools as a threat to them. That minority coincides with a few religiously and socially "conservative" groups. Why should the public schools match only their requirements?

What I quoted was only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to non-academic subjects being taught in school. I can remember my kids having 1/2 day sessions every Friday for an entire marking period so that teachers could be trained in drug awareness, conflict resolution, anger management and a bunch of other BS programs. I don't want public school teachers playing junior psychologist on my kids. If I wanted all of those services, I'd send them to a shrink, NOT public school, where some hack gets to indoctrinate them on liberal propaganda without my permission OR knowledge. emoticonXCensored BS! I don't send my kids to school for indoctrination; I send them for an EDUCATION.To be honest, gay awareness is only a small fraction of the useless curricula that wastes huge amounts of time and usurps my responsibility. If I wanted my kids to learn ethics and morals at school, I'd send them to a Parochial School, not a public school. I don't want public schools doing anything but teaching the damn subject matter that they're paid to teach. Nobody asked me if I wanted to fund DARE, Quest, Anger Management, Conflict Resolution and a host of other non-academic courses. And nobody gave me the opportunity to opt them out of such garbage, either. Public school has become a leviathan, taking on many functions that dilute their real purpose for existence all in the name of the almighty dollar. School lunches, mental health, healthcare, etc., are all functions that public schools have taken on to increase revenues, but they all detract from their primary mission, to educate. emoticonXMad

Continuing to reply to Jaxian's missive: Given the fact that the homosexual lifestyle has much higher risks of acquiring STDs and HIV, I would argue that encouraging homosexuality is similar to encouraging your child to smoke. Both have REAL health consequences that can lead to diseases that otherwise would be less likely to be contracted and once contracted, shorten one's life. As a parent who is very protective of his kids, if I had a gay son, I would: a. attempt to steer them away from homosexuality, b. promote abstinance, c. teach safe sex or d. pray that the kid doesn't become promiscuous.....in that order. I believe that a parent's primary function is to keep their children safe. Now if this is the point in the debate that we get into health statistics, fine. I've seen all of the CDC reports and most of the other credible studies on health statistics and I can say with some confidence that their certainly is an increased health risk in engaging in homosexual relationships. If you don't agree with these studies, either with the conclusions, methodology used, subject numbers, etc., we can take that up as a separate portion of this thread. Do you have any data to back up your statement? the reason I ask is because I've never seen any studies done comparing the % of straight kids raised by homosexual couples and the % of homosexual kids raised by homosexuals. It would be an interesting study to see, especially since it is one of the major fears amongst straights. I think it goes back to the idea of "recruitment".

I'll keep in mind that you aren't sure about these, and it's good that you brought them up because they deserve to be discussed. I see what I can do:1. Regarding how natural homosexuality is, I do not think it important. I will say something on it anyhow, as I like to write on this topic. the most common beliefs of the causes of homosexuality are genetics and upbringing. I don't see any reason to think these things unnatural. Only if you believe homomsexuality is caused by a person willingly choosing to go against his nature could it be called unnatural. Beyond that, there appear to be adequate sexual means for members of the same-sex to engage in, and it seems to be possible to develop the emotional tie of love between members of the same sex. This seems natural enough to me.Regardless, there isn't really any reason to prohibit unnatural behavior. I'd definitely say that living in buildings, resisting the urge to cause violence, eating canned food, living monogomously, wearing clothing, mass production, telling the truth, posting on these forums, and billions of other things we do every day are unnatural. I wouldn't agree with restricting things that aren't natural, that's certain.Oh, one more thing: legalizing same-sex marriage doesn't really promote homosexuality. Let me make a comparison: By legalizing the construction of Muslim churches, am I promoting the Muslim religion? Well, no I'm not. I'm simply giving the Muslim religion the same rights that the other religions have. This does not suggest that anyone should become Muslim, it just continues to allow everyone to choose what they please while still enjoying the same rights. The same is true of same-sex marriage.Banning the construction of Muslim churches, on the other hand, is a government signal that the Muslim religion is not acceptable. Even if the government does not take away the freedom of the people to believe in the Muslim religion, it has taken away some of the benefits provided to people over another religion. It has still limited freedom and it still stands against the Muslim religion. What I mean is, permitting same-sex marriage does not promote homosexuality, it is restricting same-sex marriage that attacks homosexuality, in a sense.2. Well, it would be very difficult, I think, to argue that one will become attracted to members of the same-sex simply because he or she is raised by someone who is attracted to the same-sex. But just to prove my point, let's assume that every child raised by a gay person will become gay. This fact in itself is not a harm at all. Only by assuming that homosexuality is somehow bad can we say that children being raised to become homosexual is bad. Now, I admit that many have religious values which claim that homosexuality is a sin, but those people retain the right to raise their children with that value. Those parents have the right to burn the idea that homosexuality is a sin into the minds of their child until that child could not possibly be homosexual. Those parents have the right to corrupt gay children. Or put in a different light, parents always have the right to raise their children as they please. Now, I would argue against that if those children were raised in such a manner that caused them to harm people, but again, we have to assume that homosexuality harms people for that to apply.Now, being familiar with the mindset and ideals of many homosexuals, I find it likely that the most a same-sex couple will do is keep their children open to the idea that it is okay to be homosexual. This is hardly corruption of a straight child and would change the sexuality of very few children.3. Now, I think, or hope, this is one of the points you don't necessarily agree with. Just in case it isn't, let me explain my side of it. There is a very big difference between someone who is attracted to and falls in love with someone of the same sex and someone who is attracted to children of the same sex. Furthermore, there is yet another difference between someone who is attracted to children of the same sex and someone who chooses to molest a child. Those same-sex couples who would be given the right to marry, they are not the same group of people who chooses to molest children any more than you fall into the group of people who choose to molest children of the opposite sex. To suggest that they are somehow related is just as insulting.If we want to be specific, perhaps we can break down adult sexual attraction into three categories under the law: heterosexuality, homosexuality, and pedophilia. Most people are heterosexual, far less people are homosexual, and the smallest group, pedophiles. In this breakdown, heterosexual and homosexuals describe adults who are attracted to other adults. I place the smallest group, pedophiles, in a single category because right now they are treated as such under the law; this group would include any adults who are attracted to minors. Of course any one person can fall into none, one, or more categories of sexual attraction here. Breaking down pedophila, we really have two groups, those who are attracted to children of the same sex, and those who are attracted to children of the opposite sex. Some, but probably very few, pedophiles are also child molesters.Looking at it this way, I hope it becomes more apparent that same-sex marriage brings no new rights and no new benefits to someone for being a pedophile. Same-sex marriage does not encourage people do move into the pedophile group; that group still has no sexual or marriage rights under the law. I will further argue that same-sex marriage discourages pedophilia. This is because it encourages people to move into the homosexuality category. That means that anyone who may have been torn between homosexuality and pedophilia will now have incentive to act on their homosexual instincts, not their pedophile instincts (and I do not mean to imply that there are very many of these people; I suspect that the vast majority of child molesters are not attracted to adults, which is why they feel forced to satisfy their sexual urges any way they can).4. Anti-Christian is the wrong word to use here. Anti-Christian implies that it attacks Christianity in some way, that it takes rights away from Christians, or that it discourages Christianity. These things are not true. Same-sex marriage attacks Christianity no more than allowing one to build a Muslim church does; in fact, it attacks Christianity far less so. Both are expressions of a different belief system, but a Muslim church opens the doors for the community to come worship a faith that opposes the idea of Christianity. Same-sex marriage, on the other hand, is a private institution between two people, and it welcomes Christianity. I would not be surpised if more than half of homosexuals are Christian, though this may be because I have visited many Christian churches accepting of homosexuals in areas with large populations of homosexual people.I do understand that allowing same-sex marriage is an activity that most Christians disagree with, but it seems rather arbitrary to take away the rights of same-sex couples for only this reason when we allow so much other religious freedom. For example, eight of the activities which the ten commandments prohibit are completely legal. Look at number 1! "Thou shalt have no other gods before me." Holy ****! It is no secret that the one unforgivable sin in Christianity is believing in another God. It is no secret that the only way to heaven is through Jesus.But we do not force people to obey the ten commandments, and we do not force people to be Christian. We do not punish people for believing in other religions, and we do not take away the benefits of those who believe something different than we do because our country prides itself on the freedom of religion. That freedom, along with many others was a freedom our forefathers founded this country on. Jefferson himself wanted it noted that he authored the Act for Religious Freedom on his tombstone, and the text of the document stand opposite the text of the Declaration of Independence in the Jefferson Memorial. So we do not take away the rights of those simply because they believe differently, except for one issue: same-sex marriage. I think religious freedom was worth fighting for in Jefferson's days, and it is worth fighting for today, though we may choose words over guns to do our fighting.5. As far as I can tell, the institution of marriage will remain completely unchanged for opposite-sex couples and all future opposite-sex couples to come. That institution stands firm and no one is asking to change it or weaken it in any way. But we are asking for a new institution; an add-on to this institution that will allow more people to engage in it. It will stop marriage from being some exclusive club that only the chosen few can get into and will allow marriage to benefit as many families as it can. There is no weakening going on here except by those who wish to restrict or limit marriage.Health concerns are an important topic, for both you and homosexual families, I'm sure. Let me address them as best I can:1. In many places in the world, such as the United Kingdom and Scotland, AIDS is now more commonly spread through heterosexual activity than homosexual activity. If I remember correctly, homosexual activity in the US accounted for 51% of new AIDS cases in the US in 2003; I've no idea how 2004 fared. There's also plenty of speculation that gays are more likely to be tested for and report cases of HIV infection than heterosexuals due to increased awareness programs targeted at gays in the United States.Anyhow, there are two primary ways AIDS spreads: unprotected sexual promiscuity and sharing needles during drug use. So to figure out whether the spread of AIDS will increase if same-sex marriage is legalized, we must consider whether promiscuity or drug use will increase. Because homosexual promiscuity is more likely to spread AIDS, I would even give credit to the idea that the spread of AIDS would increase if it could be shown that heterosexual promiscuity might change to homosexual promiscuity should same-sex marriage be legalized. But on the contrary, I intend to show that not only would same-sex marriage not cause more homosexual promiscuity, it would actually decrease the spread of AIDS. Allow me to explain:First of all, let us examine the possibility that legalizing same-sex marriage could increase the number of homosexuals. I grant you that it might, but what type of people might become homosexual? Do you think that the most sexually promicuous heterosexuals will see same-sex marriage legalized and suddenly say, "Woah, I'm gay now." Of course they will not. Those people who are most sexually promiscuous are likely very certain of their sexuality and legalizing same-sex marriage will not change that. So who might become homosexual? Not the average heterosexual, no doubt. It could only be those people who are uncertain of their sexuality right now; it could only be those people who might suspect themselves of being homosexual today, but deny it because of society's lack of acceptance. It could only be those to whom sex is not imporantant and to whom giving up sex is worthwhile to comply to the implies rules that our current laws suggest. It can only be the non-promiscuous, and legalizing same-sex marriage will not magically change the non-promiscuous into the promiscuous; it cannot make those who practice safe sex suddenly decide not to. The spread of AIDS will not increase.So how will the spread decrease? Well, the commitment of marriage is a very mental thing. It is one thing for a man to cheat on his girlfriend, but cheating on his wife is completely different. It is one thing for a man to have multiple sex partners while single, but it is completely different to have multiple sex partners after the commitment of marriage has been made. I do not mean to imply that no one has multiple sexual partners after getting married, but I do mean that getting married can have the effect of calming down one's sexual life, of turning a promiscous person into a monogamous person. This sort of commitment could easily turn some promiscuous homosexual men into non-promiscuous ones. Not only that, but the more non-promiscuous gay people there are, the more pressure is put onto promiscuous gay people to meet the standards of other homosexuals.All-in-all, marriage will not increase promiscuity; it will do just the opposite.2. I think the explanation above can apply to STD's in general as well.3. This isn't true at all. What IS true is that the average gay person dies at an earlier age than a straight person. When in completely normal mental and physical health, gay people live just as long as anyone else; sexual orientation or having sex with someone of the same sex does not cause one's lifespan to shorten. The reason the average gay person has a shorter lifespan than the average straight person can be attributed to a number of factors. First, violence against gays is more common than violence against heterosexuals. I don't think this is a huge contributer, but it is worth mentioning. Second, AIDS and other STD's are more common among homosexual men. Third, depression, anxiety, heart problems, and other stress-related diseases are more common among homosexuals.Each one of those issues will become less of a problem should same-sex marriage be legalized. I spoke on AIDS and STD's above. As for violence, the community may be less likely to breed hatred against homosexuals if they do not have inferior rights under the law. Regarding depression and such, well to be honest, it is a tough life being constantly compared to child molesters, being referred to as a sinner, being afraid of what someone might do to you if they knew who you loved, and having to battle for the same rights that your neighbor has. Depression and anxiety will happen, but granting same-sex couples the same rights that the next couple has is the first step toward alleviating that. Allowing same-sex marriage will lengthen lifespans, not shorten them.Hopefully I've answered your points well enough, but I sort of feel like I've forgotten to say some imporant things which were on my mind when I started this post, so maybe I have not. If not, let me know!

In the sense of a national scale, the two are close. They are both in New England, anyway. It's not like we are talking about Boston and Kansas City here.Very well then, if you feel the Wikipedia article was so far off-base, tell me an accurate and independent (unbiased) source and I'll be glad to check it out.If I said that, it doens't mean I've followed it from the beginning; after all, didn't you say 'gay rights is much older than you think' or something like that? Do you really think that I particular care about my credibility with someone who has come in here and immediately taken on the role as possibly the most beligerent poster here now, as you have? I'm sure there are lots of people with whom I would care, but at this point you aren't one of them. So far you've mostly just come in here and complained and tried to stir people up, ignoring the requests of a poster who spcefically asked people such as yourself to please be civil in the discussion. As JPSarte pointed out earlier, if you intentionally hit a bee's nest hard enough, don't expect not to get stung. So it's ironic you would bring up 'credibility' with anyone given your posting history here so far.I think that gay people themselves bear some of that responsibility. They know the way society views their actions in many cases. In a sense they embody counter-culturalism. Since "gay-pride" is now very much an enterprise that is being carried out right in the face of mainstream American culture, it shouldn't surprise anyone that culture would resist it. If the bulk of gay rights people at the time had put their foot down early on regarding the pederasty issues among 'the faithful', this wouldn't be a skeleton in the closet today for your movement. You didn't need a controlling organization or leader. I think we need to consider the possibility that gay rights couldn't afford to do that early on, or it might alienate too many members.Ok, I'll concede that based on your word.

The "obviousness" of that link is in your mind. It's also waaay off chronologically. You need to read up on the gay rights movement. It's a lot older than you realize.Something you should take with a large grain of salt, since the article also seems to think that Stonewall took place in Boston. Or that Greenwich Village, a neighborhood in Manhattan, is "nearby" to Boston:>>If radicalism had a home in the 1970s, it was in Boston. The city was rife with a rebellious spirit. Just a decade earlier, the street youth of nearby Greenwich Village had ignited the modern-day gay rights movement by rioting at the Stonewall Inn bar. <<Oh, and for anyone who looks to Wikipedia as a "source", here's something from their disclaimer page:Wikipedia is an online open-content encyclopedia, that is, a voluntary association of individuals and groups who are developing a common resource of human knowledge. Its structure allows anyone with an Internet connection and World Wide Web browser to alter the content found here. Therefore, please be advised that nothing found here has necessarily been reviewed by professionals with the expertise necessary to provide you with complete, accurate or reliable information.For all we know, you may have entered all the stuff tying Stonewall to pederasty. Clearly, whoever did it is quite a ways off base.Sure there is. Rely on the true historical record.It strikes me that you have a black eye of your own to repair. Earlier you said that you've followed this issue for many years. If you had, the Wikipedia story would have struck you as odd.Your credibility is shot, as far as I'm concerned.The reason society viewed and views gays that way is because of religious indoctrination and lies intentionally spread by hypocrits and bigots.Why didn't WHO draw the line? There is no gay organization that controls us.In retrospect? When do you suppose I ever thought it was benevolent?Again, "my movement" pushed neither one way nor the other. Some people in some gay groups sought to have age of consent laws equalized. I suspect a very large majority of gay people believe that should happen. In the particular case that I mentioned, and that anti-gay folks like to flog so much, the gay people involved in the fight to equalize the age of consent law in question also supported the same position as those opposed to equalizing them: both sides wanted to raise the 12yo limit. So, yes, "my movement" pushed to have the age of consent law (singular, as it was just one case) raised.

That data you seek is in the AMA and APA's positions that you have been refered to several times before.From "joebrummer"s research:I will find the appropriate links to these professional associations and post them here for you also.

Continuing to reply to Jaxian's missive: Given the fact that the homosexual lifestyle has much higher risks of acquiring STDs and HIV, I would argue that encouraging homosexuality is similar to encouraging your child to smoke. Both have REAL health consequences that can lead to diseases that otherwise would be less likely to be contracted and once contracted, shorten one's life. As a parent who is very protective of his kids, if I had a gay son, I would: a. attempt to steer them away from homosexuality, b. promote abstinance, c. teach safe sex or d. pray that the kid doesn't become promiscuous.....in that order. I believe that a parent's primary function is to keep their children safe. Now if this is the point in the debate that we get into health statistics, fine. I've seen all of the CDC reports and most of the other credible studies on health statistics and I can say with some confidence that their certainly is an increased health risk in engaging in homosexual relationships. If you don't agree with these studies, either with the conclusions, methodology used, subject numbers, etc., we can take that up as a separate portion of this thread. Do you have any data to back up your statement? the reason I ask is because I've never seen any studies done comparing the % of straight kids raised by homosexual couples and the % of homosexual kids raised by homosexuals. It would be an interesting study to see, especially since it is one of the major fears amongst straights. I think it goes back to the idea of "recruitment".

I've already replied on pedophilia. I know that pedophiles are just as likely to be heterosexual as homosexual. I brought it up because many straights don't know that the two are unrelated and almost Pavlovian start to talk about pedophiles whenever homosexuality is mentioned. And organizations, such as NAMBLA, as has been previously mentioned, don't help dispell the myth that pedophiles are homosexuals, exclusively.
attacks
I'll keep in mind that you aren't sure about these, and it's good that you brought them up because they deserve to be discussed. I see what I can do:1. Regarding how natural homosexuality is, I do not think it important. I will say something on it anyhow, as I like to write on this topic. the most common beliefs of the causes of homosexuality are genetics and upbringing. I don't see any reason to think these things unnatural. Only if you believe homomsexuality is caused by a person willingly choosing to go against his nature could it be called unnatural. Beyond that, there appear to be adequate sexual means for members of the same-sex to engage in, and it seems to be possible to develop the emotional tie of love between members of the same sex. This seems natural enough to me.Regardless, there isn't really any reason to prohibit unnatural behavior. I'd definitely say that living in buildings, resisting the urge to cause violence, eating canned food, living monogomously, wearing clothing, mass production, telling the truth, posting on these forums, and billions of other things we do every day are unnatural. I wouldn't agree with restricting things that aren't natural, that's certain.Oh, one more thing: legalizing same-sex marriage doesn't really promote homosexuality. Let me make a comparison: By legalizing the construction of Muslim churches, am I promoting the Muslim religion? Well, no I'm not. I'm simply giving the Muslim religion the same rights that the other religions have. This does not suggest that anyone should become Muslim, it just continues to allow everyone to choose what they please while still enjoying the same rights. The same is true of same-sex marriage.Banning the construction of Muslim churches, on the other hand, is a government signal that the Muslim religion is not acceptable. Even if the government does not take away the freedom of the people to believe in the Muslim religion, it has taken away some of the benefits provided to people over another religion. It has still limited freedom and it still stands against the Muslim religion. What I mean is, permitting same-sex marriage does not promote homosexuality, it is restricting same-sex marriage that attacks homosexuality, in a sense.2. Well, it would be very difficult, I think, to argue that one will become attracted to members of the same-sex simply because he or she is raised by someone who is attracted to the same-sex. But just to prove my point, let's assume that every child raised by a gay person will become gay. This fact in itself is not a harm at all. Only by assuming that homosexuality is somehow bad can we say that children being raised to become homosexual is bad. Now, I admit that many have religious values which claim that homosexuality is a sin, but those people retain the right to raise their children with that value. Those parents have the right to burn the idea that homosexuality is a sin into the minds of their child until that child could not possibly be homosexual. Those parents have the right to corrupt gay children. Or put in a different light, parents always have the right to raise their children as they please. Now, I would argue against that if those children were raised in such a manner that caused them to harm people, but again, we have to assume that homosexuality harms people for that to apply.Now, being familiar with the mindset and ideals of many homosexuals, I find it likely that the most a same-sex couple will do is keep their children open to the idea that it is okay to be homosexual. This is hardly corruption of a straight child and would change the sexuality of very few children.3. Now, I think, or hope, this is one of the points you don't necessarily agree with. Just in case it isn't, let me explain my side of it. There is a very big difference between someone who is attracted to and falls in love with someone of the same sex and someone who is attracted to children of the same sex. Furthermore, there is yet another difference between someone who is attracted to children of the same sex and someone who chooses to molest a child. Those same-sex couples who would be given the right to marry, they are not the same group of people who chooses to molest children any more than you fall into the group of people who choose to molest children of the opposite sex. To suggest that they are somehow related is just as insulting.If we want to be specific, perhaps we can break down adult sexual attraction into three categories under the law: heterosexuality, homosexuality, and pedophilia. Most people are heterosexual, far less people are homosexual, and the smallest group, pedophiles. In this breakdown, heterosexual and homosexuals describe adults who are attracted to other adults. I place the smallest group, pedophiles, in a single category because right now they are treated as such under the law; this group would include any adults who are attracted to minors. Of course any one person can fall into none, one, or more categories of sexual attraction here. Breaking down pedophila, we really have two groups, those who are attracted to children of the same sex, and those who are attracted to children of the opposite sex. Some, but probably very few, pedophiles are also child molesters.Looking at it this way, I hope it becomes more apparent that same-sex marriage brings no new rights and no new benefits to someone for being a pedophile. Same-sex marriage does not encourage people do move into the pedophile group; that group still has no sexual or marriage rights under the law. I will further argue that same-sex marriage discourages pedophilia. This is because it encourages people to move into the homosexuality category. That means that anyone who may have been torn between homosexuality and pedophilia will now have incentive to act on their homosexual instincts, not their pedophile instincts (and I do not mean to imply that there are very many of these people; I suspect that the vast majority of child molesters are not attracted to adults, which is why they feel forced to satisfy their sexual urges any way they can).4. Anti-Christian is the wrong word to use here. Anti-Christian implies that it attacks Christianity in some way, that it takes rights away from Christians, or that it discourages Christianity. These things are not true. Same-sex marriage attacks Christianity no more than allowing one to build a Muslim church does; in fact, it attacks Christianity far less so. Both are expressions of a different belief system, but a Muslim church opens the doors for the community to come worship a faith that opposes the idea of Christianity. Same-sex marriage, on the other hand, is a private institution between two people, and it welcomes Christianity. I would not be surpised if more than half of homosexuals are Christian, though this may be because I have visited many Christian churches accepting of homosexuals in areas with large populations of homosexual people.I do understand that allowing same-sex marriage is an activity that most Christians disagree with, but it seems rather arbitrary to take away the rights of same-sex couples for only this reason when we allow so much other religious freedom.

I don't think there are very many people in the world that would say that pedophiles are exclusive to homosexuality. Furthermore, your previous posts didn't indicate that you think "pedophiles are just as likely to be heterosexual as homosexual." I agree that pedophilia can be heterosexual as well as homosexual. The issue I see is that the homosexual pride movement in part grew out of a "soup" (if you will) of lots of sexual misconduct--what most would call 'perverts' by most people's standards--including pederasty. This was a by-product of the sexual revolution which by the time the mid to late 70s rolled around, had let to everything from a thriving porn industry to the growth of gay pride and other phenomenons like transgender people.

This is inaccurate information. There is no causal relationship, as there is between smoking and diseases, like I explained before. Risky sex practices of any sexual orientation increases your risk of disease. This is just propaganda on your part. Who said anything about "encouraging" your child to have any sexual orientation, gay or straight?Sometimes one can be over-protective.How? By spewing your inaccurate information and propaganda against homosexuality? A healthy sexuality is not based on these appeals to fear. What else would you do to try to steer them away from being gay? Why would he or she trust anything you have to say on important issues such as safe sex? Why would he or she feel comfortable asking questions to get the right information, if he or she is ashamed of being gay? I disagree with your interpretation. So does most of the medical community. That's why they don't try to "steer" people away from being gay. They do try to steer everyone toward safe sex practices and lowering risk.

As a parent who is very protective of his kids, if I had a gay son, I would: a. attempt to steer them away from homosexuality, b. promote abstinance, c. teach safe sex or d. pray that the kid doesn't become promiscuous.....in that order. I believe that a parent's primary function is to keep their children safe. Now if this is the point in the debate that we get into health statistics, fine. I've seen all of the CDC reports and most of the other credible studies on health statistics and I can say with some confidence that their certainly is an increased health risk in engaging in homosexual relationships. If you don't agree with these studies, either with the conclusions, methodology used, subject numbers, etc., we can take that up as a separate portion of this thread. Do you have any data to back up your statement? the reason I ask is because I've never seen any studies done comparing the % of straight kids raised by homosexual couples and the % of homosexual kids raised by homosexuals. It would be an interesting study to see, especially since it is one of the major fears amongst straights. I think it goes back to the idea of "recruitment".

I disagree, but you knew that already. Since I'm behind a restrictive firewall at the moment, I'll reply from my home computer tonight with the references for my statement.Guilty as charged. First off, it is YOUR opinion that I would spew inaccurate information and propaganda. Just because I have data that doesn't match your opinion doesn't make it propaganda. IIRC, most of the info I read came from the CDC, hardly a Christian Right propaganda machine. I'll have plenty of time this evening to reply. Look for a detailed answer then.

This is inaccurate information. There is no causal relationship, as there is between smoking and diseases, like I explained before. Risky sex practices of any sexual orientation increases your risk of disease. This is just propaganda on your part. Who said anything about "encouraging" your child to have any sexual orientation, gay or straight?Sometimes one can be over-protective.How? By spewing your inaccurate information and propaganda against homosexuality? A healthy sexuality is not based on these appeals to fear. What else would you do to try to steer them away from being gay? Why would he or she trust anything you have to say on important issues such as safe sex? Why would he or she feel comfortable asking questions to get the right information, if he or she is ashamed of being gay? I disagree with your interpretation. So does most of the medical community. That's why they don't try to "steer" people away from being gay. They do try to steer everyone toward safe sex practices and lowering risk.

Well can gays be parents or not? Just exactly where is your line? Sure it's private. I don't think any gay parent supports open screwing in elementary school. What in the world are you blathering about? You think math is going to go away in leiu of gay porn or something? There are kids now with gay parents. My son had friend's in pre-school who had two dads. It was "they have two dads" and life went on from there. Nothing else changed. My son's school has not made one change to it's curriculem due to my son having a gay mentor/father. You are absolutely and ridiculously paranoid.To clarify - the scene went like this.My son overheard a kid use the word "gay" to insult another kid. My son responded with "hey, that's not nice my big brother (mentor) is gay". To which he was thrown to the ground and fed a mouth of literal trash. Are you telling me here that you believe it is defending God, loving or correct to defend these boys' attack on my son? Are you saying you condone violent action against gay people and the people who love them? Or did you think I was using "shoving trash" in a figurative way? I wasn't.

I didn't say anything about "removal", that was a conclusion you jumped to. I was talking about "adoption", not biological. Another conclusion you jumped to. No it perpetuates the idea that it's a PRIVATE thing. Private within a family, subject to the conditions determined by that family. Not something to be flaunted in public. We wear clothes in public - there are plenty of things for elementary children to think of besides sex.If there's no gay marriage, me and my brood wouldn't have reason to instill any hate in your son's school, if he wouldn't get in anyone's face about his sexual beliefs. Then me and my brood and your son could all learn that 2+2 equals 4 in peace and harmony. If there IS gay marriage, then many teachers will think that preparing kids for ALLLL the sexual options they will soon have will be more important than spending so much time learning that 2+2=4. If my brood takes exception to it, you'll call it hate, and if there IS gay marriage, you just may have legal rights to insist that all taxpayers provide your son with a separate school. And we can't afford it."Shoving trash", and "defending". Reversible terms, depending on ones point of view.

So you are arguing against marriage benefits.If we didn't have any financial benefits to marriage, think of all the moneythat will be saved.What's new about the category "married"?This is an argument against commonlaw "marriage" not aginst gay marriage.But if an employer were morally opposed to hiring gay people and the law says that he has to, this is an unfunded mandate!The Unitarian Universalist Church.http://www.uua.org/news/2004/freedomtomarry/And the others mentioned.You've got no problem with Jim Crow laws? Nice.It IS seperate. Black people are not white people.But you said you were FOR seperate but equal.In a lot of states, including mine, it's totally legal for gay married couples to adopt children. I don't think there is much difference in the law between gay/straight people adopting. This is one of those things that does not affect you.Its already going on and you don't even know about it.If gay marriage were always legal, you wouldn't be upset by the thoughtbecause it would never even affect your life one bit.

You do, generally, if you want your spouse's employer paying for it. And the cost of private health insurance isn't trivial. It can be several thousands/year for young people and $10 thousand/year for older couples.

I am aware of statistics for different groups, not the exact numbers. Those stats show high levels among men who have sex with men, among the poor, and among African Americans. This doesn't mean that being a person living in poverty, being African American, or a man who has sex with a man, will cause you to get HIV/AIDS. None of those numbers in those groups are high enough, and the facts don't show, a causal relationship. In those groups, and in all groups, any individual's level of risk will be a combination of different variables. It's not as simple as telling a man to never have sex with a man, or a poor person to never have sex. What if one is a member of one group considered "high risk", but also a member of another group which is not considered high risk? There are ways for any individual to reduce his or her risk by practicing safe sex, and/or monogamy with someone trustworthy.

Your smoking analogy is off base. I suppose if one must go analogy hunting, the most appropriate would be handedness. Not only do most gay people think it's a closer fit, but it also matches your concerns about health and safety. Left-handed people are at higher risk for accidents because so much of the world is made for right-handed folks. I suppose you could try to force your child to use the "wrong" hand with some success, but you should remember that extreme methods, including the demonization of left-handedness have been shown to cause permanent psychological damage.In any case, if you really would stick with your approach of "encouraging" sexuality, I assume you would encourage lesbianism in your female children, as that is a far healthier lifestyle than heterosexuality for women.In that order, all you would do is raise a needlessly pained child. In the end, you'd probably just lose your son completely.

There are dozens, if not hundreds, of books about the history of the homosexual movement. Just looking at a list of their titles on Amazon.com or the Library of Congress should quickly dispell the silly idea that it "shares origins" with NAMBLA. Hint: keep an eye out for: 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, along with 1800's, turn-of-the-century, etc.It works both ways, you know. Yank a bee's chain enough times, and it might get mad, too (to mix metaphors).As for my intemperate posts, their tone might cause people to reject them or ignore them, but no one has questioned the veracity of anything I've said.Yeah, there's nothing quite so wild and crazy, so "out there", as getting hitched!You continue with this fantasy that NAMBLA participation was more than a blip in the gay movement. How would a national, dispersed movement "put its foot down" against a group that reared its head, I don't know, a dozen times over the course of a couple decades?Don't concede based "on my word". Concede because the source you cited is obviously subject to distortion and because logic itself dictates that a movement that has been around for over one hundred years can't possibly "share origins" with something that happened in the 1970s.

In the sense of a national scale, the two are close. They are both in New England, anyway. It's not like we are talking about Boston and Kansas City here.Very well then, if you feel the Wikipedia article was so far off-base, tell me an accurate and independent (unbiased) source and I'll be glad to check it out.If I said that, it doens't mean I've followed it from the beginning; after all, didn't you say 'gay rights is much older than you think' or something like that? Do you really think that I particular care about my credibility with someone who has come in here and immediately taken on the role as possibly the most beligerent poster here now, as you have? I'm sure there are lots of people with whom I would care, but at this point you aren't one of them. So far you've mostly just come in here and complained and tried to stir people up, ignoring the requests of a poster who spcefically asked people such as yourself to please be civil in the discussion. As JPSarte pointed out earlier, if you intentionally hit a bee's nest hard enough, don't expect not to get stung. So it's ironic you would bring up 'credibility' with anyone given your posting history here so far.I think that gay people themselves bear some of that responsibility. They know the way society views their actions in many cases. In a sense they embody counter-culturalism. Since "gay-pride" is now very much an enterprise that is being carried out right in the face of mainstream American culture, it shouldn't surprise anyone that culture would resist it. If the bulk of gay rights people at the time had put their foot down early on regarding the pederasty issues among 'the faithful', this wouldn't be a skeleton in the closet today for your movement. You didn't need a controlling organization or leader. I think we need to consider the possibility that gay rights couldn't afford to do that early on, or it might alienate too many members.Ok, I'll concede that based on your word.

What I quoted was only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to non-academic subjects being taught in school. I can remember my kids having 1/2 day sessions every Friday for an entire marking period so that teachers could be trained in drug awareness, conflict resolution, anger management and a bunch of other BS programs. I don't want public school teachers playing junior psychologist on my kids. If I wanted all of those services, I'd send them to a shrink, NOT public school, where some hack gets to indoctrinate them on liberal propaganda without my permission OR knowledge. emoticonXCensored BS! I don't send my kids to school for indoctrination; I send them for an EDUCATION.To be honest, gay awareness is only a small fraction of the useless curricula that wastes huge amounts of time and usurps my responsibility. If I wanted my kids to learn ethics and morals at school, I'd send them to a Parochial School, not a public school. I don't want public schools doing anything but teaching the damn subject matter that they're paid to teach. Nobody asked me if I wanted to fund DARE, Quest, Anger Management, Conflict Resolution and a host of other non-academic courses. And nobody gave me the opportunity to opt them out of such garbage, either. Public school has become a leviathan, taking on many functions that dilute their real purpose for existence all in the name of the almighty dollar. School lunches, mental health, healthcare, etc., are all functions that public schools have taken on to increase revenues, but they all detract from their primary mission, to educate. emoticonXMad

Since you asked:If you do the math, you see that 59% of HIV infections in adolescent males are attributable to engaging in homosexual relationships. If you consider that the population of gay males is <5% of the total male population in a given age group, that means that the >95% of heterosexual males 13-19 account for ~41% of the HIV infections. That equates to a rate of acquiring HIV by MSM that is over 20 times higher than that of heterosexual adolescent males (including intravenous drug users, even). For comparison, The risk of a young homosexual contracting HIV is on par with the risk of acquiring lung cancer after a lifetime of smoking. Wouldn't you try to steer your son away from any behavior that increased his risk of acquiring a deadly disease by that much? Any responsible parent would, IMO.More food for thought.Since I believe that the CDC's statisics are credible, naturally you can understand my claim that homosexual behavior is a health risk, especially for young males.

JP,I am not sure if you have noticed but kids need to learn more about "getting along" they need to learn more than science and math. Back in the days when we just taught math and science and nothing else are the days that got us where we are. With metal dectors and police officers in the schools. It was bullying that brought us Columbine. Of course we are teaching more than math and history.

Good lord!What does gay marriage have to do with public schools?!?!?!?!It's so ridiculous.The problems with public schools are starting to get out of hand, it seems.This has nothing to do with gay marriage.One common perception is that parents are looking to schools to teach themvalues and morals, when they should be taught that at home anyway.This has nothing to do with gay marriage.For a few years there, it seemed like there was a school shooting every other week.This has nothing to do with gay marriage.Drug use by school aged kids seems to be going DOWN from the 1990s.http://usinfo.state.gov/gi/Archive/2.../23-42196.htmlThis has nothing to do with gay marriage.I mean, the only connection I can see is that the kids of gay parents that goto public schools will have parents whose marriage is legally recognized.(Yes, there are already kids who have married gay parents.)

So we should not give gays their rights, because they might become millitant?By your logic, we should not have given blacks their rights because there are millitant blacks right now.

No, I have a history book full of actual examples of incrementalism. Blacks gained some equal rights back in the 60's, (which I don't disagree with), but I disagree with how small percentages of progressing minorities NEVER STOP. Ever hear the term " repairations"?? A small, activist group of them seek compensation from TODAY'S society at large for something that happened 150 years ago!! I saw a high level represenative of that movement smugly declare on national television that they were going to succeed in getting them too. Thankfully, the majority of black people don't seem too militant in demanding them. But some of them are recruitable. It all takes time.If gay marriage is legalized nationally, I don't think it will take long for gays to make it clear that straight people have now admitted they were wrong. Gays will easily be able to document all the money they lost in the past RECENT DECADES by not having the same benefits (all carefully described earlier in this thread) It won't take 20 or 30 years for you to demand repairations, and you'd have a far better chance of getting them than blacks do for something that happened 150 years ago. I know you'll say you don't want them, and chances are no one posting here actually does right now. But I guarantee there will be militant activists among you who will, and they will recruit you. You'll find money being dangled in front of you as irresistable as blacks do. The "slippery slope fallacy" phrase doesn't hold up when we actually try to utilize one of the best teachers we have, HISTORY.

I disagree. "Back in the day" we were the manufacturing capital of the world because we had strong science and math skills to go along with a strong work ethic. What got us where we are today was post-WWII liberalism and the indoctrination by public schools that Uncle Sam owes us a living and that it's better for us to feel good about ourselves than to MAKE something of ourselves.No, that is what a generation of moral relativism and failure to enforce discipline on spoiled brats got us. My grandparents didn't worry about my mother and father's "individuality and expression". If they stepped out of line, they got put right back in it. The parents and the murderers at Columbine had much less in common with generations past than they did modern liberalism.Sorry if I disagree, but violence in school isn't caused by a strict upbringing, quite the contrary, it's the end result of societal decay that started when we began rewarding illegitamacy and making excuses for thug behavior.Speak for yourself. Statistics show that when parents teach their kids, they outperform those taught by "professionals". emoticonXRolleyes

JP,I am not sure if you have noticed but kids need to learn more about "getting along" they need to learn more than science and math. Back in the days when we just taught math and science and nothing else are the days that got us where we are. With metal dectors and police officers in the schools. It was bullying that brought us Columbine. Of course we are teaching more than math and history. We have no choice, if teacher s don't play psychiartists, the ids kill each other off in a rain of bullets.If the parents would teach them something great, most parents fall by the way side.

The statistics are looking at males who have sex with males, not gay-identified males. There is a reason why the CDC makes the distinction, as it is not the same thing. This puts the rest of your calculations off, and is the reason why the CDC does not make similar calculations. You are adding apples and oranges. We will also never know how many gay-identified men there are, as long as there is such stigma. You are looking at one small age group of men who have sex with men. None of this deals with women, for whom I'm guessing, having sex with a woman and not with a man, is recommended? Wrong, for some of the reasons I explained above. There are also other variables for practicing men who have sex with men, such as sex, but with prevention, which will decrease the risk. There is no such thing as safe smoking practices. The CDC talks specifically of "risk behaviours" and "prevention" among those men who have sex with men. It doesn't say the behaviour of a man having sex with a man itself, is putting him at risk, but is pointing to other behaviours such as doing so without prevention or protection. Yes, let's indeed look at specific risk behaviours and steer your son or daughter away from those. Do you believe a man who is gay-identified and having sex with men, has no options to lower his risk? Should we be teaching safe sex practices and lower risk behaviours to anyone at all then?

Since you asked:If you do the math, you see that 59% of HIV infections in adolescent males are attributable to engaging in homosexual relationships. If you consider that the population of gay males is <5% of the total male population in a given age group, that means that the >95% of heterosexual males 13-19 account for ~41% of the HIV infections. That equates to a rate of acquiring HIV by MSM that is over 20 times higher than that of heterosexual adolescent males (including intravenous drug users, even). For comparison, The risk of a young homosexual contracting HIV is on par with the risk of acquiring lung cancer after a lifetime of smoking. Wouldn't you try to steer your son away from any behavior that increased his risk of acquiring a deadly disease by that much? Any responsible parent would, IMO.More food for thought.Since I believe that the CDC's statisics are credible, naturally you can understand my claim that homosexual behavior is a health risk, especially for young males.

Gasp! Heavens to Betsy! They are actually making schools safe and supportive environments for all students, even for the gay ones!

You can compare any type of movement for social equality. As a black man of mix American ancestry, I believe that gays have a more difficult time than other social groups. Blacks and others had the support of their families and religious community. Homosexuals are perhaps the only social group who rarely have the support of family and the religious community. Therefore, the psychological abuse is worse for homosexuals than for others.

I think you've misunderstood my point that respectful and considerate treatment of other students and conveying societal values was certainly not a "liberal" POV in my Catholic schools, yet they managed to do it. I'm not very fond of touchy-feely, "esteem" classes, either. I think values are taught best when they are integrated into the whole school experience. In how teachers allow kids to behave and how they behave themselves all the way to examining issues related to those values. That means civics lessons and discussions of discrimination etc. when covering history, literature, and other similar subjects. Schools SHOULD teach values and ethics. They shouldn't teach them as though they were somehow separate from real life. They're not.I didn't express myself very well -- posting too fast, plus it's not really the topic for this forum. But what I mean is that today's educational experience in far too many urban schools pales in comparison to that of a couple decades ago. We may SPEND more actual money, but we offer so much less in terms of curriculum and extra-curricular activities like music and art and support costs like school nurses and free lunches, etc. Much of the reason for the large increase in actual dollars is the huge increase in payroll, most of it compensating for the fact that teachers were always woefully underpaid even when teaching was a noble profession. Nowadays we're competing for talent with corporations and have to pay much more than we once did for teachers. Administrative salaries have risen even more dramatically (with little return in my opinion).The real test of whether "we're spending enough" is not just to compare the four- or five-times average spent you mentioned, but to also compare what we're offering in many urban school districts versus what we're spending in many suburban districts. We may be paying more money, but we're offering a far stingier education. And it shows.Fair enough. I'll post more clearly and we'll see if still feel the need to refute me. My main "solution" to the educational crisis is far smaller schools and far fewer exclusively administrative positions, by the way. Is that a bad idea?Well, I can't know the details, of course, but "teacher accountability" is too often code for reducing teaching to rote memorization. Not quite "anti-Christ" material, but not a particularly good idea in my mind.

I want teachers teaching my kids what they're paid to do, not playing junior psychiatrist. If there is a discipline issue, then call the principle and throw the little SOB out of school.Having a strict policy isn't equivalent to spending weeks of class time teaching about the ills of bad behavior. emoticonXRolleyes That's a myth.You certainly aren't going to get a pass from me when you make such easily refutable claims WRT education. It's a topic that I'm VERY familiar with. Ten years ago, I was the anti-Christ because I ran for our school board on a platform of, heaven forbid "teacher accountability". You'd have thought that I had murdered a nun by the reaction I got from the local NEA. emoticonXRolleyes

Another day, another post. Let's see what's on the platter today:Nor should they, unless there is evidence that the voting public knows its head from its heels about education.First of all, I see absolutely and completely no evidence that allowing same-sex marriage will change school cirriculums. I don't mean to imply that none exists, but certainly you have provided none. It seems only logical to assume that same-sex marriage, being completely unrelated to our education system, would not affect the schedule of classes available. JPSartre did provide some evidence that the schedule may change, but he has not related any of his evidence to same-sex marriage. I'll deal with more with what he wrote when I finish responding to your post.Anyhow, second of all, I see no evidence that any such school class change would be very large, let alone cause a conflict. I do have evidence this claim, and that evidence is former classes revolving around civil rights. There have been plenty of classes added to colleges and perhaps even high schools which revolve around women's rights and African Americans. Although some angry parents might have done some shouting, conflict over these courses has been absolutely negligable. Even if all the shouting in the world had been done, a conflict of words is hardly justification for stripping people's freedom.Third of all, I see no evidence that these new classes would do anything significant to any student's schedule. I went to the University of Michigan - Dearborn: one of the more liberal colleges in this nation. As an Engineering student, I took absolutely zero courses on Anthropology, Sociology, Civil Rights, or anything along those lines. The only time I would be forced to take one of those classes is if I were a CASL major (College of Arts, Sciences, and Literature. It encompasses majors like Math, Science, English, Music, etc). If I were such a major, I would be required to take a single "diversity course". This course could be Anthropology, Sociology, Music History, Art History, certain Psychology or Behavioral Science Course, or yes, a course on Women's Rights, Sexual Orientation, etc. Beyond that those courses on civil rights are miniscule in number compared to Anthropology, Sociology, etc, and they are usually only offered one semester out of the year. Consider further that I wanted to take a civil rights class as a Computer Science major, but I did not because it would not count toward my major. Consider even further that I am going back to school for a Mathematics degree, but I still can't take a civil rights course because it is faster and cheaper for me to satisfy my diversity requirement by taking Anthropology, as it also counts toward a different requirement in my major. Based on both my past experiences and my reasoning, I must conclude that your argument about same-sex marriage causing an increase in civil rights classes is nonsense.Do these courses exist in colleges? Absolutely? Are we polluting the minds of our children with useless knowledge? Even if it could be argued that the knowledge is useless, the answer must still be: certainly not based on what I wrote above.I understand that you believe this, but there is no reason behind that belief. There is no reason to believe that a new conflict would begin, and there is no evidence has been shown to suggest that this conflict could somehow be severe enough to warrant taking away the rights of good people.But they do seek to increase their numbers. The problem is that majorities feel threatened any time a new minority seeking equal rights arises. Majorities are prone to rejecting anyone who is different than they are. Majorities feel threatened by people who ask only to be treated as equals. It happens in every society from Sumer to America. Majorities tend to abuse their power as much as anyone else, and in America, the majority has all of the power.Hitler had a pretty darn strong economy while he was burning the Jewish people in ovens. Kings and Queens created vast empires while tyrannizing their people and conquering through war. America was doing fantastic while it held slaves.Which of those people had reason to change their ways? In most of those cases, the majority of people were living just fine. Keep on killing the minority, what does the majority care? It's proven to work. Just because an immoral and evil action takes place in a successful society does not mean that immoral and evil action should continue, nor does it mean that it is part of that society's success.As for the definition of "agenda", I am using the English definition of the word agenda. I can use the English definition of the word "aggressive" to say that same-sex couples are aggressors to no other person; they seek only to grant themselves the same rights that others have. Are not the aggressors the ones who try to take things from others or stop others from doing what they have done themselves? Regardless, you may continue to use the word "agenda", but both sides have political goals. The distinction is that one side wishes to change the law to give themselves the same rights that others have. The other side wishes to stop them from changing that law.Hmm, I'm not sure where I lost you, but let me try to explain this paragraph again. You had written that same-sex couples have a political agenda, which they would teach to their children in order to make enemies in the straight community. I called this perposterous, then followed with the paragraph that confused you. In that paragraph, I said that Christians also have political agendas, but they don't raise their children to infiltrate the enemy community. There is no evidence to suggest that same-sex couples would do the same (of course, I talk as though same-sex couples and Christians are different, even though most same-sex couples are likely Christian).I would wager that they would say the same about you without blinking. The reason for this is that people who post against same-sex marriage are insulting in unparalleled manners, they just don't realize it. It is what I tried to point out to you with my first response to your post. Each sentence written by an opponent of same-sex marriage feels like a slap in the face, a punch in the gut, and being spit on, all at the same time if you are a gay person. To know that someone who has never even met you believes that you honestly believes you are a bad parent is awful. To know that someone who has never met you believes you to be at a high risk for a disease spread by promiscuity is horrible; that implicitly calls every gay person promiscuous. To know that someone who has never met you would force you to recognize his marriage and his love, then would refuse to recognize yours is a worse pain than I can describe. But opponents of same-sex marriage tend to take their insulting comments for granted. They tend to think nothing of saying "Allowing you to marry would cause debates in schools!" Who cares? It's the love between two people we're talking about here. Yes, it's health care and tax benefits and whatever other things come with marriage, but no man can oppose same-sex marriage without implicitly declaring that his love is better than a same-sex couple's love or somehow more worthly of recognition. It is the ultimate insult made worse by the fact that the opponent of same-sex marriage truthfully believes this. It is a horrible punishment for a crime not committed, or at least it is in the eyes of every supporter of gay rights.But opponents of same-sex marriage usually don't see things from that point of view. They don't see that they've just called every gay person a promiscuous sinner whose love doesn't deserved to be recognized like their own love. They don't understand why their opponents get angry and frustrated. But don't take this the wrong way! It is understandable not to realize what one is saying, just as I'm certain those who react as though they have chips on their shoulders don't realize what they are saying. And it's impossible to make your argument against same-sex marriage without saying what you believe. But when what you believe is as insulting at this, you have to expect your opponents to react poorly. But you still have to listen to their arguments and understand that if you knew this person as a friend, not as someone who is denying them rights, then that person would be just as kind and generous as anyone else you might know.Fear incrementalism as you see fit, but do not use that fear as an excuse to deny equal rights. Do not use your fear of evil tomorrow as an excuse to do evil today. As I have stated; if the day comes where gay rights move beyond equality, then you have my promise that I will stand by your side and fight for the equality of heterosexuals. But today I stand by the side of the group who is in the right, and I will not leave that group's side while they are morally right.Considering the homosexuals which I am friends with today, I do believe your fear of incrementalism is unjustified and false, but it is no excuse to do that which is wrong.Are you so certain about that? Do you not hear just as many people, if not more, claiming that homosexuality is wrong? Do you not hear just as many people, if not more, claiming that abortion is wrong? I think that you are judging parents who oppose homosexuality by considering those peolpe you know, but you are only judging homosexuals and gay rights supporters by those you have spoken to in a situation where gay rights is the topic of conversation. Recently, when gay Christian parents tried to enroll their straight child into a Christian school, it was not the gay parents nor their child who made a big deal about the sexual orientation of those parents; it was the parents who oppose homosexuality who did it.Considering my stance on same-sex marriage, I understand all too well the results of political mistakes. But you fear that which may never happen, and you fear that which is insignifcant. A few people claiming discrimination is nothing compared to the marriage rights to millions. I ask only that you support what is morally right, and work toward preventing that which is morally wrong if it shows itself.Elementary schools? As I've written above, I'm confused about why you could think this. Does this happen historically? Are our children in school today, engaging in civil rights conflicts? I don't see why you think this.You write later that same-sex marriage is a big experiment, an irreversable one. The opponents of instituting the Constitution that we use today said the same thing, and they were right. Large-scale popular government had never been done before, and they weren't just risking a little debate in schools, they were risking their freedom. But that Constitution is now the longest standing Constitution in the world, and we are the longest-standing popular goverment in the world. Our Constitution was based on the right principles, and it was worth the experiment. Same-sex marriage is based on the right principles too. I'll take that risk any day.I appreciate yours in turn. I'm sorry if the things I wrote about opponents of same-sex marriage being insulting seemed a lack of civility, I am only trying to show how deeply those words can scar people.As for JPSartre:In 1996, I was a Freshman in high school. In 2000, I was taking the standardized tests you spoke of which labeled our children as stupid compared to nations such as Japan and Sweden. Do I write as though I am among the dumbest people in the world? Do you suspect that I did not score well on those standardized tests? I do not pretend to know the age of anyone else who posts here, so perhaps some of you are able to answer this from experience: was the material on those standardized tests not taught in school?I can say from experience that our schools do teach all of the Math, English, Science, and History that anyone could possibly need to succeed on those standardized tests. The difference is not that the information wasn't taught, the difference is that 75% of the students in my classes didn't do their homework. Parents don't make sure their children are doing their schoolwork, and the work ethic does not exist among children in America as it does among children in other nations. School for some children is just passing notes in class and making fun of the kid with the glasses who sits up front taking notes. Some high school students get through by copying and convincing the teacher to make that test a take-home one. I've heard excuses such as "summer vacation is too long" or "our teachers move too slowly" or "the school board needs replacing." I must admit that blaming homosexuals or civil rights movements is a new one to me. But none of those excuses address the problem that children simply don't feel motivated to learn or study.More importantly, I think that what JPSartre has posted almost illustrates my point for me: schools have been pushing for anti-discrimination measures since 1996. What, precisely, do any of us think we can change by banning same-sex marriage? Banning same-sex marriage won't stop school boards from putting up whatever classes they want; it will only take away rights from good people.I don't have any specific post to quote about health effects of same-sex marriage, but I have not seen my points regarding that addressed by anyone. My points were that smoking is directly harmful. We can try to make it less harmful by discouraging it (not that I agree with doing that, but there is at least a reason for it). Same-sex marriage is not directly harmful, and neither is homosexuality. It is promiscuity and irresponsible sex that are the problem here. If you want to discourage those things, go right ahead. And unlike discouraging smoking, if we discourage same-sex marriage, we are only encouraging promiscuity and irresponsible sex. When we see the true problems behind the spread of AIDs and other diseases, we realize that we aren't discouraging them by banning same-sex marriage at all; we're encouraging them. We're doing completely the opposite of what we intended to do. Legalizing same-sex marriage is one of the best and most direct routes of discouraging promiscuity among homosexuals.I think I will close by reminding everyone that the vast majority of homosexuals live a long and STD-free life. We have the opportunity to make that number even higher.

When I say conflict, I'm mainly referring to brand new school curriculums that I believe would come about soon after gay marriage was legalized. The actions of school administrators don't always mirror the desires of the voting public.I believe one conflict would end, and a much more severe one would take it's place.No same sex marriage, no abortion, religion in schools and politics, - all commonplace and not controversial only a few decades ago. I don't believe majorities seek to increase their numbers, unless of course, they feel THREATENED.You and I may have different definitions of the word "agenda". If something has been proven to work, I don't see a desire to keep it, to protect it from those who would destry it, as the same aggressive "agenda" that gay marriage is.emoticonXConfused IMO many, if not most of the pro gay posters on this forum have chips on their shoulders. I see a vengefulness that I don't see on other forums at this site.With the vengefulness that I refered to above, I believe the continuing agenda would be legal claims of discrimination in schools and workplaces. Remedies would mainly consist of accommodations and separations that would cost STRAIGHT taxpayers plenty of money. Now I know that makes me a homophobe. Homophobe means having an "irrational fear". It's recently being morphed into an offensive term to be used against anyone who opposes special rights for gays. If we check U.S. history, or world history, we see that a fear of incrementalism in politics is not irrational, it's very real. When FDR was starting social security, he claimed that it would be a voluntary program. Today's anti smoking hysteria started a few decades ago with "no smoking on airline flights of 2 hours or less." A whole book could be filled with documentation of how incrementalism has caused governments and dictatorships to grow in the last 100 years.Parents who teach their children that homosexuality is wrong are less likely to encourage their children to make it a public issue, and therefore far less likely to cause a conflict.BY THEN IT WILL BE TOO LATE. Political mistakes are often impossible to reverse.I was referring almost completely to elementary schools - sorry I didn't make that more clear.I appreciate your civility!! :)

Are you really confused? There are enormous differences in risk between the subgroups of men who have sex with men (MSMs). In a simplistic summary, the ones at lowest risk are out, proud, responsible. The ones at highest risk are closeted, in denial, hiding and ashamed. Your son, as you would raise him, would lean towards the latter group.Small, but still a lot larger than if your daughter were a lesbian.... (especially if you were not white).Unfortunately (or not), lifelong abstention is a recipe for madness and depression for most folks. The next best thing is monogamous marriage, of course. But you're opposed to that, as I recall...

YOU I did not ask you anything about HIV.You are attempting to deflect from the issues I provided documentation for. None of them had ANYTHING to do with HIV or AIDS. They dealt with the myths you propogate about homosexuals raising their children to be homosexuals and recruiting other people to be homosexuals. They dealt with the myth you propogate about homosexuals being pedofiles. They dealt with the myth you propogate about homnosexuality being "unnatural". They dealt with the myth you propogate that ones sexuality being a choice. They dealt with the myth you propogate about "conversion therapy". They dealt with the myth you propogate about homosexual promiscuity. They dealt with the myth you propogate about all gay men being effinimate and all lesbians being "butch".Instead of responding to the documentation I DID give you, you take off on completely different issues. Are you afraid to respond to the documentation on the issues YOU raised? I most certainly did not raise them.For your edification, YES, I do believe the CDC's data on HIV and AIDS to be credible. What I don't believe is credible is your attempting to take the data and twist it into a condemnation of homosexuality. ANYONE who is promiscious, ANYONE who has unsafe sex, ANYONE  who shares hypodermic needles, ANYONE WHO COMES IN CONTACT WITH THE BODY FLUIDS OF ANOTHER PERSON IS AT RISK FOR CONTRACTING THE HIV VIRUS!!!!!!!!!!In regard to your and other's comments on schools, I will be brief. If you and all the other parents were doing the job you are SUPPOSED to be doing at HOME, then perhaps we wouldn't have to burden the schools and taxpayers to do your job for you!!!!!!! Too bad if you take that personally. You certainly don't seem to care how I take your outrageous opinions.

Since you asked:If you do the math, you see that 59% of HIV infections in adolescent males are attributable to engaging in homosexual relationships. If you consider that the population of gay males is <5% of the total male population in a given age group, that means that the >95% of heterosexual males 13-19 account for ~41% of the HIV infections. That equates to a rate of acquiring HIV by MSM that is over 20 times higher than that of heterosexual adolescent males (including intravenous drug users, even). For comparison, The risk of a young homosexual contracting HIV is on par with the risk of acquiring lung cancer after a lifetime of smoking. Wouldn't you try to steer your son away from any behavior that increased his risk of acquiring a deadly disease by that much? Any responsible parent would, IMO.More food for thought.Since I believe that the CDC's statisics are credible, naturally you can understand my claim that homosexual behavior is a health risk, especially for young males.

I've seen the facts on women. I believe that you are attempting to deflect the issue, however. If you dig a bit deeper, you find that women contracting HIV are doing so predominantly by having sex with bisexual men, having sex with heterosexual junkies with HIV and sharing needles with HIV infected people. It can't be argued that it's a mainstream "straight" disease by any stretch of the imagination. emoticonXRolleyes

It's still a young disease, give it some more time...WomenWomen make up nearly one-third of new HIV infections. 4In 1992, women accounted for 13.8% of people living with AIDS 5; by the end of 2001 that percentage had increased to 21%. 6Among women, sexual contact accounts for 75% of infections. 7http://www.cdcnpin.org/scripts/hiv/hiv.asp#womenPercentage with HIV who are women in North America increases from 20% in 2001 to 25% in 2003...http://www.unaids.org/bangkok2004/GA....htm#TopOfPage

Not to butt in, but this is a good point. It's not about whether the infectees are straight or not, but rather if they are monogamous or not. And since gay men have the highest rates of HIV in the nation by a landslide according to the CDC, one has to conclude they have real problems with monogamy.Logic alone indicates that a monogamous person is far less likely to get HIV.

No. For the most part gays can adopt now if they want. So can singles. Parenting has long since left the Cleaver family paradigm. I don't see why anything would change. And I see no reason to scrutinze gay adopting parents more than any other adaopting parent.Se Joe's response and what a load of gobbledy gook. Do actually know any gay parents or even any gay people? Any parent who who encouraging a small child to be sexual is a problem. Do you teach your kids to be openly sexual in school? Or are you even worried about platonic affection between males? Girls tend to be openly affectionate with each other - I think it would do men and the world a load of good if men could show affection to their brothers. Not every hug and kiss and touch is sex. yowzer!I have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. Why does one have to reach puberty before having good self-esteem? I want my kid to have it NOW. I know how sharp my tongue can be - that is why I clarified. Thank you.

I don't militantly draw lines. One of my phrases was "a far better place to raise a child." I like things the way they are right now pretty well. You have your biological children - that's fine. Some gays with adopted children, properly scrutinized by today's authorities under today's laws, is also fine with me. If we legalize gay marriage, I'd bet you and an army of lawyers will be ready to draw some brand new lines, won't you?How about two little boys kissing each other in full view of everyone else, at the suggestion of their two dads?Not gay porn, just some new touchy-feely 'future self esteem' instruction for kids who haven't even reached puberty yet.As I said, it's okay now. Gay marriage isn't legal yet.I thought you were using "shoving trash" in a figurative way. It goes along pretty well with your sarcasm and anger. I don't condone physical fights under any circumstances.

ALL men especially young men have some problems being monogamous.I would think that unprotected anal sex does carry the greatest risk of transmission of HIV since it seems bleeding must take place in order to transmit the virus. So when the responsibility for safety is left to young horny men it is not surprising that they often fail to play it smart. I don't see that as a homosexual issue exclusively.

No, I'm not.Yes I am. There are many studies in fact, which show a much larger percentage of men reporting having sex with other men, then is the percentage of those who identify as gay men. Those are two separate categories...Laumann et al (1994) found that 9% of men and 4% of women reported having engaged in at least one same-gender sexual activity since puberty. Given the identity category choices of heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, or something else, 2.8% of men and 1.4% of women surveyed reported "some level of homosexual identity." Binson et al (1995) showed 5.3% of men reporting sexual activity with a same-gender partner since age 18. and 6.5% of men reporting sex with men during the previous five years. The highest prevalence was found the 12 largest cities (14.4% since age 18) and among "highly educated" White males (10.8%).Sells et al (1995) reported 6.2% of males and 3.6% of females with "sexual contact with someone of the same sex only or with both sexes in the previous five years," and 20.8% of U.S. males and 17.8% of U.S. females with some homosexual behavior or some homosexual attraction since age 15. Gonsierek et al (1995) reviewed the literature and critiqued surveys of homosexual activity from Kinsey in 1948 to the 1994 study by Laumann, et al. Because of the possible risks involved in self-disclosure, it is posited that the recurrent 2-5% for same-gender sexual behavior in the studies reviewed represents a minimum figure. They suggest that the current prevalence of predominant same-sex orientation is 4-17%.http://www.geocities.com/plusg1/facts_05.htm

You should take off the blinders and learn to read more carefully. Your data only said they MAY contact it from a man who had sex with another man. Even if it were usually from men who first aquired it from other men, it is still being spread by men having sex with women. I am not omitting anything. You are looking for a scapegoat so relations between men and women won't be held responsible for the diseases they spread from that activity.It's similar to Mary getting a disease from a parnter John, and John and Mary blaming the person and the activity which gave him the disease, saying that he Mary and their activity isn't really to blame, just because they contracted the disease from John and Mary's activity. They had no need to use a condom, and it's not John or Mary's fault for not involving a condom in their activity.

I was requested to start a new thread in which pro-gay and anti-gay marriage positions could be debated without posters being called "homophobes", "gay bashers" and "bigots" simply because they don't favor gay marriage.While I"ve already stated why I'm against gay marriage in previous threads, I'll reiterate them here for newbies and for simplicity sake.1. Gay marriage creates a new dependent class of citizen2. It is an unfunded mandate and therefore, illegal3. It forces additional costs on an employer via healthcare benefits4. It adds costs to the court system via increased litigation over custody, property, inheritance, etc.,5. It allows more people to lay claim to finite SS and other entitlement benefits6. It establishes a loophole to transfer property without payment of inheritance taxes.7. It establishes a mechanism to bypass the payment of taxes on life insurance payouts.These should be enough fodder to get the ball rolling.

If you want to find the source of a leak, you don't look at the end of the pipe, do you? Wouldn't you trace the pipe back to its origin? The origin of women with HIV is typically from having sex with a man with HIV who acquired it by having sex with a man with HIV who got it by having sex with a man with HIV...etc., etc., Now, I agree that due to all of the bisexuals and MSMs out there who have spread the disease to women today, even having heterosexual relations isn't safe. But the widespread propagation of HIV took place in the gay community, not straight America. Straight America has acquired HIV tangentially to the main cause, either through transfers of blood from needles or via sex with a high risk partner, namely drug addict or MSM.

Well, I didn't specifically address that, but, yes, I'd say that. The strain in Africa is more easily spread through heterosexual sex and more easily spread from women to men. Bisexuality plays a very minor role in the spread of AIDS in Africa (many of these countries are very homophobic). The main human aspects of the problem are poverty-induced prostitution, a highly mobile and infected population of truck drivers, a general refusal on the part of men to use condoms, and the general lack of power among women to demand that they do. And let's not forget overly religious governments unwilling to take on the task of education and prevention and an overly "conservative" population unwilling to talk about sex.

I don't understand why people make negative statements with nothing to back them up, and then expect others to disprove them.I, likewise, have never seen any studies or information that would support either an increase or a decrease. Assuming it had no affect at all, I fail to see it as an argument AGAINST gay marriage.

We do not know where the original leak of HIV started.Yes, it's easy for you to scapegoat a certain group you don't like, when you don't know where that original leak was, as I said above. The CDC also cites women having sex with an already infected partner or men with unspecified risks, as risky for women. It's not just MSM.
attacks
If you want to find the source of a leak, you don't look at the end of the pipe, do you? Wouldn't you trace the pipe back to its origin? The origin of women with HIV is typically from having sex with a man with HIV who acquired it by having sex with a man with HIV who got it by having sex with a man with HIV...etc., etc., Now, I agree that due to all of the bisexuals and MSMs out there who have spread the disease to women today, even having heterosexual relations isn't safe. But the widespread propagation of HIV took place in the gay community, not straight America. Straight America has acquired HIV tangentially to the main cause, either through transfers of blood from needles or via sex with a high risk partner, namely drug addict or MSM.

Agreed. But the floodgates opened up in the gay community. When did I EVER use the term "always" or "exclusively"? I've used the word predominantly a few times, however. Do you dispute that? emoticonXConfused

A victim of a disease is a victim of a disease. That is very subjective to say "floodgates" opened with a certain group. If the "floodgates" had opened with heterosexuals as could be said of Africa, would that have made any difference? If one group instead of another has more cases of the disease, or had more at the beginning, does that make any difference? It's a virus that continues to spread among all groups of people. You are saying one particular group which gets the disease, has made a bad choice, simply because it chooses to express it's sexuality. I haven't seen anything which states the most predominant higher risk area(for women), exclusively, involves a woman partnering with an MSM.

I cannot help but feel that my posts on the subjects of STDs have not been addressed and this debate is being steered into a conversation over who has the best statistics. Statistics mean nothing when interpreted incorrectly.As I have said, homosexuality is not the cause of AIDS. Irresponsible promiscuity and drug use are the causes. This is very straightforward and apparent to everyone who posts here. Male-male sex has no chance of causing AIDS if neither one of the males involved has AIDS. So looking at the rate of AIDS in homosexuals does not indicate that homosexuality makes one more prone to AIDS, it indicates that more homosexuals have made the concious decision to act in a promiscuous manner.So targetting homosexuality is not targetting the real cause of AIDS here. If we are to battle AIDS, then we must fight against promiscuity and needle-sharing. If we simply make the claim that stopping people from becoming homosexual will reduce AIDS, then we are fighting the wrong problem because there is no indication that discouraging homosexuality will discourage promiscuity or drug use, and is in fact arbitrary. Furthermore, disallowing same-sex marriage, while discouraging homosexuality, only encourages promiscuity. Disallowing this marriage will have unquestionably and undeniably the opposite effect that any opponents of AIDS intend it to have especially when considering that only a miniscule portion of the population would determine whether they are attracted to the same sex based on whether or not they could marry someone of the same sex. But marriage has an enormous effect on encouraging monogamy, and disallowing it only puts homosexuals at risk.Consider that I could might make the claim that people who enjoy living in cities are at unimaginably more likely to contract AIDS than those who live in rural areas. Does this indicate that we must discourage people from living in urban areas? Does this justify us in taking the right to marry away from everyone who lives in cities? I believe not one person here could agree with that, and the truth is, living in cities keeps you almost completely protected from AIDS provided you are not promicuous or a needle-sharer. If you live responsibly in the city, you won't get AIDS; living in cities is simply not the cause of AIDS. Though a few people in cities might choose to be promiscuous, is it appropriate to take away the right of all people in that city to marry because of those few people? Do you think that would solve the problem or hurt it in the long run?What if I were to mention that people who listen to music are much more likely to go deaf from listening to loud music? Would this indicate that we should discourage listening to music? Or does logic dictate that it is not music which is the problem at all, it is listening to loud music that is the real problem. What if I were to declare that forest fires caused by campers who forget to put their fires out could be stopped completely if we just discouraged everyone from going camping? Am I justified in doing that, or does it logically only make sense to stop people from keeping their fires going after they go to sleep?I hope this has made my point clear: it makes no sense to attack a group of people that are more likely to get AIDS and claim that you are attacking the problem. That is not attacking the problem, that is simply an excuse to punish an entire group of people for the actions of a few. Understand now that it is not right to take away the rights of one man because of the actions of another.

That would be require talking about homosexuality, and we know who can't stand that, don't we?It wouldn't hurt for society to openly acknowledge and mourn the horrific loss, either.Hell will free over before that happens, of course...

I see your point, but it is not unprotected sex any more than it is promiscuity. In truth, it must be irresponsible unprotected sex, for unprotected sex across two people does not spread the disease. I used the term "irresponsible promiscuity" once, and I should have continued to do so if not for the fact that I did not think it essential to my argument, and making such a distinction was tiresome.I agree. But my argument does not make sense except in light of the truth that the activities of gay men, when done irresponsibly, put them at a higher risk. Each of my examples, from city-dwellers to campers, represents a group at a higher risk of some bad thing happening. My point was that though the risk factors may be higher for those groups of people, it is not membership in that group which is the cause of the harm, and it is perfectly simple to be a member of those groups without putting yourself at risk.I agree with this. But I also agree with what I wrote. Just as you understand that Hell will freeze over before society does this, I believe that the argument I used is more likely to convince opponents of same-sex marriage that they are wrong. I do not deny ignoring the most fundamental arguments in favor of those I believe most convincing.

Now THIS is one of the best examples I have of why you are mistaking the reasons why gay marriage is opposed. It's the voting public's children that are being educated, and the voting publics money that is footing the bill. To suggest that elites know better than the general public about education reeks of liberalism. Liberalism and gay marriage go hand in hand. THAT is the main reason gay marriage is opposed, far more than all "slaps in the face" - "punches in the gut" - "being spit on", ways that you falsely take it. Check out www.glaad.org sometime. A while back they were hatefully pointing fingers at Mel Gibson for something in one of his movies. Currently they are encouraging everyone to bombard Creators Syndicate to get Thomas Sowell's columns removed from as many sources as possible. Sowell writes about 75 or so columns every year. I'd guess maybe 3 or 4 of them have to do with his (very mainstream) views of gay marriage. Glad wants EVERYTHING of his removed. Is it because of his gay marriage views, or because of his comservative views??It does happen historically. I was an elementary student in the 60's, and had a job as an adult that gave me a close-up of elementary education in the 80's, in the same district. I saw more liberalism, and less basic education. Gay rights is a tool of liberalism.You and others here use pretty strong wording in describing "rights" and lack thereof. You called the lack of gay marriage an "evil and immoral action". There are at least a few million American adults who are straight as can be, yet aren't married and have no relationship with another person. (I'm one of them) Can you name me a right that I have that gay people don't?? I don't think it's a case of gay people not having rights, it's that married heterosexuals have a few special rights. Since the traditional family has long been considered a integral part of our society, I have no problem with them having a few special rights.Does glaad? Is their agenda positive, or negative?
attacks
Another day, another post. Let's see what's on the platter today:Nor should they, unless there is evidence that the voting public knows its head from its heels about education.First of all, I see absolutely and completely no evidence that allowing same-sex marriage will change school cirriculums. I don't mean to imply that none exists, but certainly you have provided none. It seems only logical to assume that same-sex marriage, being completely unrelated to our education system, would not affect the schedule of classes available. JPSartre did provide some evidence that the schedule may change, but he has not related any of his evidence to same-sex marriage. I'll deal with more with what he wrote when I finish responding to your post.Anyhow, second of all, I see no evidence that any such school class change would be very large, let alone cause a conflict. I do have evidence this claim, and that evidence is former classes revolving around civil rights. There have been plenty of classes added to colleges and perhaps even high schools which revolve around women's rights and African Americans. Although some angry parents might have done some shouting, conflict over these courses has been absolutely negligable. Even if all the shouting in the world had been done, a conflict of words is hardly justification for stripping people's freedom.Third of all, I see no evidence that these new classes would do anything significant to any student's schedule. I went to the University of Michigan - Dearborn: one of the more liberal colleges in this nation. As an Engineering student, I took absolutely zero courses on Anthropology, Sociology, Civil Rights, or anything along those lines. The only time I would be forced to take one of those classes is if I were a CASL major (College of Arts, Sciences, and Literature. It encompasses majors like Math, Science, English, Music, etc). If I were such a major, I would be required to take a single "diversity course". This course could be Anthropology, Sociology, Music History, Art History, certain Psychology or Behavioral Science Course, or yes, a course on Women's Rights, Sexual Orientation, etc. Beyond that those courses on civil rights are miniscule in number compared to Anthropology, Sociology, etc, and they are usually only offered one semester out of the year. Consider further that I wanted to take a civil rights class as a Computer Science major, but I did not because it would not count toward my major. Consider even further that I am going back to school for a Mathematics degree, but I still can't take a civil rights course because it is faster and cheaper for me to satisfy my diversity requirement by taking Anthropology, as it also counts toward a different requirement in my major. Based on both my past experiences and my reasoning, I must conclude that your argument about same-sex marriage causing an increase in civil rights classes is nonsense.Do these courses exist in colleges? Absolutely? Are we polluting the minds of our children with useless knowledge? Even if it could be argued that the knowledge is useless, the answer must still be: certainly not based on what I wrote above.I understand that you believe this, but there is no reason behind that belief. There is no reason to believe that a new conflict would begin, and there is no evidence has been shown to suggest that this conflict could somehow be severe enough to warrant taking away the rights of good people.But they do seek to increase their numbers. The problem is that majorities feel threatened any time a new minority seeking equal rights arises. Majorities are prone to rejecting anyone who is different than they are. Majorities feel threatened by people who ask only to be treated as equals. It happens in every society from Sumer to America. Majorities tend to abuse their power as much as anyone else, and in America, the majority has all of the power.Hitler had a pretty darn strong economy while he was burning the Jewish people in ovens. Kings and Queens created vast empires while tyrannizing their people and conquering through war. America was doing fantastic while it held slaves.Which of those people had reason to change their ways? In most of those cases, the majority of people were living just fine. Keep on killing the minority, what does the majority care? It's proven to work. Just because an immoral and evil action takes place in a successful society does not mean that immoral and evil action should continue, nor does it mean that it is part of that society's success.As for the definition of "agenda", I am using the English definition of the word agenda. I can use the English definition of the word "aggressive" to say that same-sex couples are aggressors to no other person; they seek only to grant themselves the same rights that others have. Are not the aggressors the ones who try to take things from others or stop others from doing what they have done themselves? Regardless, you may continue to use the word "agenda", but both sides have political goals. The distinction is that one side wishes to change the law to give themselves the same rights that others have. The other side wishes to stop them from changing that law.Hmm, I'm not sure where I lost you, but let me try to explain this paragraph again. You had written that same-sex couples have a political agenda, which they would teach to their children in order to make enemies in the straight community. I called this perposterous, then followed with the paragraph that confused you. In that paragraph, I said that Christians also have political agendas, but they don't raise their children to infiltrate the enemy community. There is no evidence to suggest that same-sex couples would do the same (of course, I talk as though same-sex couples and Christians are different, even though most same-sex couples are likely Christian).I would wager that they would say the same about you without blinking. The reason for this is that people who post against same-sex marriage are insulting in unparalleled manners, they just don't realize it. It is what I tried to point out to you with my first response to your post. Each sentence written by an opponent of same-sex marriage feels like a slap in the face, a punch in the gut, and being spit on, all at the same time if you are a gay person. To know that someone who has never even met you believes that you honestly believes you are a bad parent is awful. To know that someone who has never met you believes you to be at a high risk for a disease spread by promiscuity is horrible; that implicitly calls every gay person promiscuous. To know that someone who has never met you would force you to recognize his marriage and his love, then would refuse to recognize yours is a worse pain than I can describe. But opponents of same-sex marriage tend to take their insulting comments for granted. They tend to think nothing of saying "Allowing you to marry would cause debates in schools!" Who cares? It's the love between two people we're talking about here. Yes, it's health care and tax benefits and whatever other things come with marriage, but no man can oppose same-sex marriage without implicitly declaring that his love is better than a same-sex couple's love or somehow more worthly of recognition. It is the ultimate insult made worse by the fact that the opponent of same-sex marriage truthfully believes this. It is a horrible punishment for a crime not committed, or at least it is in the eyes of every supporter of gay rights.But opponents of same-sex marriage usually don't see things from that point of view. They don't see that they've just called every gay person a promiscuous sinner whose love doesn't deserved to be recognized like their own love. They don't understand why their opponents get angry and frustrated. But don't take this the wrong way! It is understandable not to realize what one is saying, just as I'm certain those who react as though they have chips on their shoulders don't realize what they are saying. And it's impossible to make your argument against same-sex marriage without saying what you believe. But when what you believe is as insulting at this, you have to expect your opponents to react poorly. But you still have to listen to their arguments and understand that if you knew this person as a friend, not as someone who is denying them rights, then that person would be just as kind and generous as anyone else you might know.Fear incrementalism as you see fit, but do not use that fear as an excuse to deny equal rights. Do not use your fear of evil tomorrow as an excuse to do evil today. As I have stated; if the day comes where gay rights move beyond equality, then you have my promise that I will stand by your side and fight for the equality of heterosexuals. But today I stand by the side of the group who is in the right, and I will not leave that group's side while they are morally right.Considering the homosexuals which I am friends with today, I do believe your fear of incrementalism is unjustified and false, but it is no excuse to do that which is wrong.Are you so certain about that? Do you not hear just as many people, if not more, claiming that homosexuality is wrong? Do you not hear just as many people, if not more, claiming that abortion is wrong? I think that you are judging parents who oppose homosexuality by considering those peolpe you know, but you are only judging homosexuals and gay rights supporters by those you have spoken to in a situation where gay rights is the topic of conversation. Recently, when gay Christian parents tried to enroll their straight child into a Christian school, it was not the gay parents nor their child who made a big deal about the sexual orientation of those parents; it was the parents who oppose homosexuality who did it.Considering my stance on same-sex marriage, I understand all too well the results of political mistakes. But you fear that which may never happen, and you fear that which is insignifcant. A few people claiming discrimination is nothing compared to the marriage rights to millions. I ask only that you support what is morally right, and work toward preventing that which is morally wrong if it shows itself.Elementary schools? As I've written above, I'm confused about why you could think this. Does this happen historically? Are our children in school today, engaging in civil rights conflicts? I don't see why you think this.You write later that same-sex marriage is a big experiment, an irreversable one. The opponents of instituting the Constitution that we use today said the same thing, and they were right. Large-scale popular government had never been done before, and they weren't just risking a little debate in schools, they were risking their freedom. But that Constitution is now the longest standing Constitution in the world, and we are the longest-standing popular goverment in the world. Our Constitution was based on the right principles, and it was worth the experiment. Same-sex marriage is based on the right principles too. I'll take that risk any day.I appreciate yours in turn. I'm sorry if the things I wrote about opponents of same-sex marriage being insulting seemed a lack of civility, I am only trying to show how deeply those words can scar people.As for JPSartre:In 1996, I was a Freshman in high school. In 2000, I was taking the standardized tests you spoke of which labeled our children as stupid compared to nations such as Japan and Sweden. Do I write as though I am among the dumbest people in the world? Do you suspect that I did not score well on those standardized tests? I do not pretend to know the age of anyone else who posts here, so perhaps some of you are able to answer this from experience: was the material on those standardized tests not taught in school?I can say from experience that our schools do teach all of the Math, English, Science, and History that anyone could possibly need to succeed on those standardized tests. The difference is not that the information wasn't taught, the difference is that 75% of the students in my classes didn't do their homework. Parents don't make sure their children are doing their schoolwork, and the work ethic does not exist among children in America as it does among children in other nations. School for some children is just passing notes in class and making fun of the kid with the glasses who sits up front taking notes. Some high school students get through by copying and convincing the teacher to make that test a take-home one. I've heard excuses such as "summer vacation is too long" or "our teachers move too slowly" or "the school board needs replacing." I must admit that blaming homosexuals or civil rights movements is a new one to me. But none of those excuses address the problem that children simply don't feel motivated to learn or study.More importantly, I think that what JPSartre has posted almost illustrates my point for me: schools have been pushing for anti-discrimination measures since 1996. What, precisely, do any of us think we can change by banning same-sex marriage? Banning same-sex marriage won't stop school boards from putting up whatever classes they want; it will only take away rights from good people.I don't have any specific post to quote about health effects of same-sex marriage, but I have not seen my points regarding that addressed by anyone. My points were that smoking is directly harmful. We can try to make it less harmful by discouraging it (not that I agree with doing that, but there is at least a reason for it). Same-sex marriage is not directly harmful, and neither is homosexuality. It is promiscuity and irresponsible sex that are the problem here. If you want to discourage those things, go right ahead. And unlike discouraging smoking, if we discourage same-sex marriage, we are only encouraging promiscuity and irresponsible sex. When we see the true problems behind the spread of AIDs and other diseases, we realize that we aren't discouraging them by banning same-sex marriage at all; we're encouraging them. We're doing completely the opposite of what we intended to do. Legalizing same-sex marriage is one of the best and most direct routes of discouraging promiscuity among homosexuals.I think I will close by reminding everyone that the vast majority of homosexuals live a long and STD-free life. We have the opportunity to make that number even higher.

Hmm . . . I think you are really having to stretch there. I don't think it is unreasonable to say that being promiscuous can make one much more apt to get an STD. That 'being promiscuous' is exactly what we are talking about.To blame it solely on unprotected sex instead of promiscuity (to use an analogy) is sort of like having a bathtub that is overflowing, and in order to protect the house from flooding, sawing out and digging a trench through the floor around the tub rather than simply turning down the water.The fact is, if two people are monogamous to each other, knowing they are each free of HIV, there's no chance of them getting the disease from sex with one another. Protection is not even needed in such a case. Give it a try sometime!

Though I suspect you're not really trying to avoid the points, there are two important things to keep in mind:Unprotected sex, rather than actual promiscuity, is what most causes the spread of AIDS.To some extent, gay men ARE at higher risk, not because of promiscuity per se, but because of the prevelence of anal sex, the most effective way for the virus to leap to another person.Again, it's unsafe sex, not promiscuity per se.What would make even more sense would be to target that group not with slander but with an open educational campaign and societal support. That would be require talking about homosexuality, and we know who can't stand that, don't we?It wouldn't hurt for society to openly acknowledge and mourn the horrific loss, either.Hell will free over before that happens, of course...

How is exploring the possibility that a group's promiscuity has led to increased HIV infections in that group a case of "attacking" them? In my opinion it IS one way of attacking the problem, but we cannot be expected to just ignore the one place where the problem has been most prevalent by far. And I also don't think this is a case of 'trying to take your rights away.'

I cannot help but feel that my posts on the subjects of STDs have not been addressed and this debate is being steered into a conversation over who has the best statistics. Statistics mean nothing when interpreted incorrectly.As I have said, homosexuality is not the cause of AIDS. Irresponsible promiscuity and drug use are the causes. This is very straightforward and apparent to everyone who posts here. Male-male sex has no chance of causing AIDS if neither one of the males involved has AIDS. So looking at the rate of AIDS in homosexuals does not indicate that homosexuality makes one more prone to AIDS, it indicates that more homosexuals have made the concious decision to act in a promiscuous manner.So targetting homosexuality is not targetting the real cause of AIDS here. If we are to battle AIDS, then we must fight against promiscuity and needle-sharing. If we simply make the claim that stopping people from becoming homosexual will reduce AIDS, then we are fighting the wrong problem because there is no indication that discouraging homosexuality will discourage promiscuity or drug use, and is in fact arbitrary. Furthermore, disallowing same-sex marriage, while discouraging homosexuality, only encourages promiscuity. Disallowing this marriage will have unquestionably and undeniably the opposite effect that any opponents of AIDS intend it to have especially when considering that only a miniscule portion of the population would determine whether they are attracted to the same sex based on whether or not they could marry someone of the same sex. But marriage has an enormous effect on encouraging monogamy, and disallowing it only puts homosexuals at risk.Consider that I could might make the claim that people who enjoy living in cities are at unimaginably more likely to contract AIDS than those who live in rural areas. Does this indicate that we must discourage people from living in urban areas? Does this justify us in taking the right to marry away from everyone who lives in cities? I believe not one person here could agree with that, and the truth is, living in cities keeps you almost completely protected from AIDS provided you are not promicuous or a needle-sharer. If you live responsibly in the city, you won't get AIDS; living in cities is simply not the cause of AIDS. Though a few people in cities might choose to be promiscuous, is it appropriate to take away the right of all people in that city to marry because of those few people? Do you think that would solve the problem or hurt it in the long run?What if I were to mention that people who listen to music are much more likely to go deaf from listening to loud music? Would this indicate that we should discourage listening to music? Or does logic dictate that it is not music which is the problem at all, it is listening to loud music that is the real problem. What if I were to declare that forest fires caused by campers who forget to put their fires out could be stopped completely if we just discouraged everyone from going camping? Am I justified in doing that, or does it logically only make sense to stop people from keeping their fires going after they go to sleep?I hope this has made my point clear: it makes no sense to attack a group of people that are more likely to get AIDS and claim that you are attacking the problem. That is not attacking the problem, that is simply an excuse to punish an entire group of people for the actions of a few. Understand now that it is not right to take away the rights of one man because of the actions of another.

But you (and others) are singling out only one group to attack. Why not attack ALL promiscuity?How would you attack promiscuity within this group you have singled out?Safe Sex?I support this for ALL groups.Abstinance?Simply will not work for any group.Monogomy?Now THERE's an idea!!!!!!!!!! Yet you vehemently oppose it.
attacks
How is exploring the possibility that a group's promiscuity has led to increased HIV infections in that group a case of "attacking" them? In my opinion it IS one way of attacking the problem, but we cannot be expected to just ignore the one place where the problem has been most prevalent by far. And I also don't think this is a case of 'trying to take your rights away.'

This seems like a small gray area. People gay or straight can be sleeping around, but if it is with protection, there is a better than average chance they are safe from STD's. If someone isn't sleeping around, but only messes around with a few people who they date,and we will say for the argument that is few, but with no protection. They are at a higher risk.In simple terms. If one has sex with 100 people with protection, they are at a lower risk than someone who sleeps with one person and no protection.

Hmm . . . I think you are really having to stretch there. I don't think it is unreasonable to say that being promiscuous can make one much more apt to get an STD. That 'being promiscuous' is exactly what we are talking about.To blame it solely on unprotected sex instead of promiscuity (to use an analogy) is sort of like having a bathtub that is overflowing, and in order to protect the house from flooding, sawing out and digging a trench through the floor around the tub rather than simply turning down the water.The fact is, if two people are monogamous to each other, knowing they are each free of HIV, there's no chance of them getting the disease from sex with one another. Protection is not even needed in such a case. Give it a try sometime!

Show me where I said it had nothing to do with it.First of all, since you had just quoted me as saying "most", I can't imagine why you think I meant "solely". As for your analogy, what is more dangerous, taking five baths a day or bathing with your plugged-in boom-box perched precariously on the tub edge during your monthly bath?I believe someone else already covered the "safety in monogamy" aspect. I didn't think it necessary to point out the obvious yet again. Silly chain-yanker, my partner and I have been together more than 24 years.

I think you missed the point here. I see that Jix didn't articulate his point well either. I think what he was trying to say was moreover that UNPROTECTED promiscuity is more so to blame than promiscuity in general. I have a friend who is fairly promiscuous, yet my friend has NEVER once contracted any kind of STD. Why? Because my friend NEVER engages in UNPROTECTED sex. You have to have both factors working together here.

You make some valid points. Let me address the essence of them and not the particulars so that my reply isn't too windy.You claim that allowing gay marriage would decrease gay promiscuity and encourage monogomy. I ask, where is the proof? Heterosexual marriage is legal yet over 70% of children born in Detroit, for example, are illegitimate. If marriage isn't very effective in encouraging monogomy amongst heteros, why would we expect it to change gay behavior? And, amongst heteros couples who don't believe in marriage, they don't need "a piece of paper" to keep them monogomous. It seems to me that gays promoting gay marriage as a means of increasing relationship stability and thereby reducing promiscuity and HIV are engaging in nothing more than wishful thinking. If it doesn't work for straights, why would it work for gays? Convince me otherwise, please.

Though I suspect you're not really trying to avoid the points, there are two important things to keep in mind:Unprotected sex, rather than actual promiscuity, is what most causes the spread of AIDS.To some extent, gay men ARE at higher risk, not because of promiscuity per se, but because of the prevelence of anal sex, the most effective way for the virus to leap to another person.Again, it's unsafe sex, not promiscuity per se.What would make even more sense would be to target that group not with slander but with an open educational campaign and societal support. That would be require talking about homosexuality, and we know who can't stand that, don't we?It wouldn't hurt for society to openly acknowledge and mourn the horrific loss, either.Hell will free over before that happens, of course...

No one has had same-sex marriage "for a long time". Whether in places where it's still quite new or in those few places where it's been around for a while, like the Netherlands, same-sex divorce rates are far below heterosexual divorce rates. Faaaar below.But don't despair. It's not really a fair comparison, as gay couples are much less likely to marry, and many of those who have were already stable couples, together for many, many years.Meaningful statistics won't be available for decades, though, even when they are, I'm not sure I see how they would be pertinent. Afterall, it's been well established that Southern Baptists in red states have one of the worst divorce rates, but we still let them marry...

Thanks for responding to my posts. Let's see here...It seems to me that you are using my explanation on how offensive anti-same-sex marriage arguments to mean something they did not, so I am afraid I was not clear on what I meant. I did not say any of those things in an attempt to justify same-sex marriage or to show that opposing it is wrong. I also did not mean to imply that opponents of same-sex marriage are intentionally hostile. I said those things only in an attempt to justify the hostility you described in members of the forum who support same-sex marriage. From what you wrote above, it sounds to me that you believed I thought you wanted to offend opponents of same-sex couples. That is certainly not what I think.Next, you mentioned my comment that school administrators not always listening to the general public being a good thing. I should point out that the comment was barely related to same-sex marriage and that I wrote paragraphs of other comments explaining why same-sex marriage would not affect our schools. Addressing this one comment does not address the heart of my argument.Still, since you chose this sentence to pull out, allow me to explain why it is a bad idea for the public administrator to listen to everything the public demands. The public, first of all, is very uninformed about how to educate children, and they are very influenced by the media. They tend to hear some vague piece of information, and instead of researching it themselves, demand that something be unreasonably changed. The truth is, no one can be informed about everything, and the mass of the public isn't informed at all except on that which sends them into an outrage. Furthermore, parents tend to be interested more in what benefits their own children more than in what benefits the most children overall. Considering all of this, it is best to leave these decisions in the hands of someone who is an expert on the subject matter and who has a vested interest in making sure his school is successful, not in certain children succeeding over others or certain children getting good grades.As for things being liberal, well I'm not certain this is a liberal viewpoint, though it may be. I get my reasoning from the Federalist Papers, which I think provide much insight into these sorts of situations. So I do think it a Federalist viewpoint. Though you say "liberal" as though that is all you need say in order to show that something is bad. "Liberal" and "conservative" are just different viewpoints, each one requiring reasoning and evidence to prove themselves correct. Do not make the mistake of immitating radio show hosts in this respect; if you believe something is bad, you must have a reason for that belief, not just term "liberal" or "conservative".Beyond this, same-sex marriage is a conservative value by nature, as conservatives tend to value keeping the government out of people's lifestyle and their decisions. Conservatives tend to hate it when the government interferes with people living their lives. On the other hand, it is also a liberal issue. Liberals tend to believe that the overall happiness of the people can be sometimes be increased through government interference. Republicans and those who identify themselves as conservatives today tend to disagree with same-sex marriage not based on conservative principle but on moral or religious principle. In my arguments, I intend to prove that banning same-sex marriage is harmful and morally wrong, and that although you are entitled to your religous beliefs on the subject, you are not entitled to take away the rights of those who hold different beliefs.I'm guessing that truly GLAAD was angry at something he wrote about same-sex marriage but that they probably would not have targetted someone very liberal. But what is the point here? Do you disagree with same-sex marriage because most gay rights groups support liberals?As for hatefully pointing fingers, certainly it could just as easily be said that most opponents of same-sex marriage hatefully point fingers at gay people. It's not an evil thing to do, it is the way people try to win civil rights battles.A tool? Surely you cannot call the rights of millions of people a tool, and surely you do not suspect that liberalism has some great intent to take over the world. Society itself has become more liberal over time, and that in itself is the only liberalism that has entered our elementary schools. Perhaps Gay rights is not a tool by which liberalism attempts to force itself upon others, and preventing it is a tool by which conservatism attempts to prevent society from becoming more liberal. People who have grown up knowing only one certain set of values watch society move away from that set of values and do what they can to stop that movement, even if it means stopping equality. I haven't decided that what I've just said is accurate for certain, but the more I speak with people, the more true that seems to become.In some off-sense, I could say that you have the right to marry the person you love while a gay person does not. Though to explain it more thouroughly, you do not have a right that any gay person does not have. By legalizing same-sex marriage, I am indeed suggesting that we give everyone the right to marry someone of the same sex, not just gay people. However it is also true that this situation is not equal or free. The lack of freedom is present in that people do not have the right to marry the person of their choosing. The lack of equality is clear not because you have some right that a gay person does not, but because the right to marry is designed so that only heterosexuals will use it. When I say that gays do not have equal rights, I do not mean they do not have as many rights but that our civil rights do not provide equality to everyone, though they certainly could be extended to do so. When I say that it is wrong to take away the rights of gays, I take it for granted that everyone understands that we are taking away this right from everyone, but that this right we are taking away would only be used by gays and they are therefore only the ones losing anything.Slavery was long part of our society until it was abolished. What is long part of our society is not necessarily good or just, and we should not give special privleges to things just because they have been in our legal books the longest. We should strive to continaully evaluate ourselves as people, and where we can increase equality, freedom, and happines, we should strive to do so. Everyone deserves special rights.Well, GLAAD's agenda is equality for gay people, and I consider that a very positive agenda. But whether their campaign uses positive or negative tactics, I do not know. I get lots of mail from GLAAD asking me to donate money, and that mail is generally positive. "Make a difference!" You know what I mean; you'd have to expect that sort of stuff. I haven't paid much attention to their political tactics. Does it really matter?Oh, well I think none of us have any doubt that promiscuity among gay men has led to the spread of AIDS. That isn't attacking them. It is stripping them of the right to marry that attacks them. What I mean is that I think people are looking at the problem that more gay people have AIDS than straight people, and they say, "Well, we should deny the rights of gay people to discourage being gay. That way less people will get AIDS." My argument is that this is discouraging the wrong thing, and because people are targetting the wrong thing, they are actually increasing the cases of AIDS by denying gay rights instead of decreasing them.Well, hopefully that clears things up!

Now THIS is one of the best examples I have of why you are mistaking the reasons why gay marriage is opposed. It's the voting public's children that are being educated, and the voting publics money that is footing the bill. To suggest that elites know better than the general public about education reeks of liberalism. Liberalism and gay marriage go hand in hand. THAT is the main reason gay marriage is opposed, far more than all "slaps in the face" - "punches in the gut" - "being spit on", ways that you falsely take it. Check out www.glaad.org sometime. A while back they were hatefully pointing fingers at Mel Gibson for something in one of his movies. Currently they are encouraging everyone to bombard Creators Syndicate to get Thomas Sowell's columns removed from as many sources as possible. Sowell writes about 75 or so columns every year. I'd guess maybe 3 or 4 of them have to do with his (very mainstream) views of gay marriage. Glad wants EVERYTHING of his removed. Is it because of his gay marriage views, or because of his comservative views??It does happen historically. I was an elementary student in the 60's, and had a job as an adult that gave me a close-up of elementary education in the 80's, in the same district. I saw more liberalism, and less basic education. Gay rights is a tool of liberalism.You and others here use pretty strong wording in describing "rights" and lack thereof. You called the lack of gay marriage an "evil and immoral action". There are at least a few million American adults who are straight as can be, yet aren't married and have no relationship with another person. (I'm one of them) Can you name me a right that I have that gay people don't?? I don't think it's a case of gay people not having rights, it's that married heterosexuals have a few special rights. Since the traditional family has long been considered a integral part of our society, I have no problem with them having a few special rights.Does glaad? Is their agenda positive, or negative?

Hmmmmm. Very interesting. You start the thread claiming to want civility; with a list inane fiscal arguments for which you provided no facts and have been shown to be false.

Well, I have to admit that I have no statistics which show that marriage increases monogamy, just as there are not really any statistics which show that it decreases monogamy. There are simply no statistics which describe the same society with and without marriage. I could show statistics which prove that married couples are less promiscuous than unmarried people. That statistic could mean that marriage lowers promiscuity, but it could also very well mean that it is only the non-promiscuous people who get married. But there is a lot of good theory about why marriage might lower promiscuity, and in the end, same-sex marriage is an well-reasoned attack on promiscuity which may or may not work.Allow me to explain. Marriage itself is a commitment to love, cherish, and dedicate yourself to one person for the rest of your life. It means this just as much to gay people as it does to straight people; we all live in the same society. When you get married, something changes, not something physical but something moral. Suddenly it is not okay to do things that you might do otherwise. Cheating on your boyfriend is a bad thing, heck a lot of boyfriends and girlfriends have open relationships. But cheating on your husband? That is absolutely taboo. Marriage places a new level of moral restriction placed upon you, and although not everyone obeys it, marriage means monogamy in the minds of everyone. It isn't easy to break one's moral convictions. Furthermore, couples are less likely to break up over a dispute if they are married. Being married again sort of signals that this relationship is something more permanent, and that just because you're upset with your boyfriend doesn't mean you can run off and sleep with someone else.I will admit this is a completely mental thing and I will admit that many same-sex couples do get religiously married or become "life partners". But many don't. Without marriage, many same-sex couples are intend on calling themselves boyfriends or girlfriends for their entire lives. By instituting marriage, we are giving couples a sort of natural progression of a relationship that they are supposed to go through. Once they're ready to never be with anyone else, they register that marriage with the government.You're right, this places no physical restrictions on anyone, but that is one of the great parts about this. We can place this sort of mental restriction on every gay who wants to get married without actually restricting freedom, equality or happiness. We're actually giving them what they want. Even if the most promiscuous gays did not get married, it only takes one night of a non-promiscuous gay getting frustrated and cheating for AIDS to spread. If we can prevent that, we've done something.So this allowing same-sex marriage is an attack on promiscuity, by offering legal recognition and benefits to couples who vow to be monogamous. It may not work, but there is good reason behind it that suggests that it will.But let us not forget the more fundamental point that same-sex marriage does not encourage promiscuity; it does just the opposite. Irresponsible promiscuity is one of the real causes of AIDS, and if our society wants to discourage promiscuity, it is only accomplishing the opposite by keeping same-sex marriage illegal. But we have the opportunity to discourage promiscuity without even taking away the freedom or equality of anyone (increasing freedom and equality in fact). That is a rare opportunity indeed, and I see no reason not to take it.

You make some valid points. Let me address the essence of them and not the particulars so that my reply isn't too windy.You claim that allowing gay marriage would decrease gay promiscuity and encourage monogomy. I ask, where is the proof? Heterosexual marriage is legal yet over 70% of children born in Detroit, for example, are illegitimate. If marriage isn't very effective in encouraging monogomy amongst heteros, why would we expect it to change gay behavior? And, amongst heteros couples who don't believe in marriage, they don't need "a piece of paper" to keep them monogomous. It seems to me that gays promoting gay marriage as a means of increasing relationship stability and thereby reducing promiscuity and HIV are engaging in nothing more than wishful thinking. If it doesn't work for straights, why would it work for gays? Convince me otherwise, please.

Hmmmmm. Very interesting. You start the thread claiming to want civility; with a list inane fiscal arguments for which you provided no facts and have been shown to be false. Failing at that, you post innoculous, insulting, stereotypical gay bashing myths with no facts to back them up, under the guise of not necessarily "subscribing" to them, which again have been shown to be false. You then proceed to pose outlandish "hypothetical" situations, again with no supporting facts.I don't know about the rest of the people here, but as far as I am concerned, you have "zero" credibility.

Well, thanks for the index.#47I never once learned ANYTHING about marriage in public schools.Not the laws surrounding it, nothing.No cirriculum that I ever had would have been changed.It's not "social engineering" to recognize 2 people's marriage legally.Maybe you could call it "legal engineering" or just "the law.'#110Gay people will seek to adopt as many kids as possible,What's wrong with that? If they can afford it, then thank god they can take some starving kids out of orphanages (in Russia or China) or state-run foster care. The reason there are so many kids to adopt is because someone didn't want them or couldn't care for them. Thank god someone will. This has nothing to do with public schools except that some dirt poor kid may get to actually attend one.raise them in a way to steer them towards being gayWhere in the hell do you get that?I can't speak for any gay people, but surely they know more than anyone that people have to "follow their heart" when it comes to who they love. I can't imagine a gay couple "steering" their kids to be gay. This has nothing to do with public schools.They will encourage them to act gay in schoolSorry dude, you have no idea what you are talking about.maybe if you at least met a few gay people with kids, you would clue in.(separate schools for gays) http://www.cnn.com/2003/EDUCATION/07/28/gay.school.ap/Too late! buhahaha!

No?Why do you think there would be even MORE conflict if gay folk got what these marriage rights?#138 I agree with so...

I don't think that wsm2506 gets it. From the start, I have tried to present arguments that straights have against gay marriage. Some were stereotypical beliefs, some were based on nothing more than a lack of knowledge and some were based on factual assertions. Maybe it would have been easier if I had listed which views I held personally, I don't know, but the purpose of the thread was to debate gay marriage. That included the myths, the stereotypes, the preconceptions as well as the misconceptions.While I believe that you were in tune to what I was attempting to do, I saw enough hostility amongst others to know that they either didn't or couldn't maintain civility over the long haul. It is this "in your face" attitude that causes straight people to harden their position, not soften it. Even if you could factually disprove all of someone's assertions, if he doesn't like you or your methods, you aren't going to get his buy in. That's just human nature. You, on the other hand, have maintained a very steady demeanor and refused to engage in invective hurling. I appreciate that and look forward to discussing other topics with you in the future.

Read this one carefully.There are videos sent to schools, but do the schools show them? Not stated.People suggest circulla all the time. A fraction are agreed upon.The testimonial section says that students giving testimonials about being bullied would lead to a change in lesson plans? I would think that the testimonial would be the lesson in itself. What's wrong about anti-harassment ciriculla?I don't think we ever had something like that when I was in school,but I'm sure there was a video or two in there about fights and what to do in that situation. Is this telling people to be sissies and get beat up? Why would including gay-harassment in the bullying ciricullum make anyone gay?This whole article says that it's wrong to teach people about tolerance.Matthew Shepard was killed for the $30 in his pocket so the other kids could buy Meth. No school could teach these kids not to do meth and kill people for their money. It really had nothing to do with his being gay. His friends and parents made it look like that to get press attention.They are trying to teach tolerance. Something their parents should do anyway. Maybe they feel like they have to since they sense that values are not being taught at home, what with all the bullying and such.· Educate Association members about the problems gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered persons face in our schools and our society.· Advocate for strong nondiscrimination provisions in state and federal law, bargained contracts, and school policies.How is defending people from intolerance "gayness infiltrating our schools."It's tolerance and peace that is trying to infiltrate, if anything.This is a little more informative.Yes, it seems that there are indeed ciriculla in public schools that teach kids about homosexuality, in effect beating parents to the punch. Before their parents can instill hatefull destructive values in them, the school heads them off and instills tolerant and peaceful values. I stand corrected.Teaching tolerance isn't a "gay agenda."Not getting beat up (or killed) may be the gay agenda if anything.Ok, I stand corrected on kids nowadays being taught values in school.BUT! These are public schools we are talking about.If you don't like what they teach, no one says that your kids have to go to public schools. Send them to some private baptist bible academy and be done with it.I think I spot a pattern here.I see why it's called homophobia.You and marc9000 are so scared that someone is going to "teach your kid to be gay." Well, just think about it. Could YOU be taught to be gay? If the answer is yes, then you might be gay. If the answer is no, then you are straight. I think what you are advocating is that children should only be exposed to a limited set of prescribed knowledge. They should never come across something that they might not understand. That way when they are older and they see something or someone they don't understand or agree with, they will bash them or kill them. Maybe we should get all our school ciriculla from Rev. Phelps because tolerance of gays cannot be tolerated.

Though I suspect you're not really trying to avoid the points, there are two important things to keep in mind:Unprotected sex, rather than actual promiscuity, is what most causes the spread of AIDS.To some extent, gay men ARE at higher risk, not because of promiscuity per se, but because of the prevelence of anal sex, the most effective way for the virus to leap to another person.Again, it's unsafe sex, not promiscuity per se.What would make even more sense would be to target that group not with slander but with an open educational campaign and societal support. That would be require talking about homosexuality, and we know who can't stand that, don't we?It wouldn't hurt for society to openly acknowledge and mourn the horrific loss, either.Hell will free over before that happens, of course...

If they are heterosexual women they have more risk, statistically then a lesbian, looking at the general groups.

It's at the point where it's just willful blindness on your part.So this young man's sexuality is to be based on an irrational frear that he can do nothing to take the risk away from any MSM activity, simply because he belongs to a certain group.

lol, so if we make gay relationships illegal we would have no problem? ;) When sodomy was illegal, did that solve the problem?Practical problems only. They are consenting adults whos love is the same as yours. Philosophically, all of the arguments for equal rights and social acceptance do apply.Not quite a slippery slope. What argument (besides practical problems which can always be gotten around) would you use to deny polygamous rights? Incestous relationships between consenting adults? At what point does good and acceptable become creepy and weird? Brother and sister? Father and son?The argument for straight marriage over gay marriage is based in religion usually, so there is no slippery slope there. Anything besides man and woman is simply not allowed. You cannot use that justification.

I most certainly do not subscribe to any of them, but I, as you have, ask you to disprove them:1. Masturbation causes blindness.2. Masturbation is anti-Christian, and we are a predominately Christian society.3. Scientific studies have shown that childhood sexual abuse is predominately perpetrated by male family members, therefore, male family members should not be allowed any contact with children.4. Heterosexual married couples produce more left handed offspring than homosexual couples.

lol, so if we make gay relationships illegal we would have no problem? ;) When sodomy was illegal, did that solve the problem?Practical problems only. They are consenting adults whos love is the same as yours. Philosophically, all of the arguments for equal rights and social acceptance do apply.Not quite a slippery slope. What argument (besides practical problems which can always be gotten around) would you use to deny polygamous rights? Incestous relationships between consenting adults? At what point does good and acceptable become creepy and weird? Brother and sister? Father and son?The argument for straight marriage over gay marriage is based in religion usually, so there is no slippery slope there. Anything besides man and woman is simply not allowed. You cannot use that justification.

Wrapped up in those three snippets is the heart of the argument. First of all, same-sex marriage is new in the modern era. It has been legal in earlier times in this culture (insofar as we are the continuation of Western civilization) and in other cultures. To some extent the reason it comes and goes is because the position of women vis-a-vis women changes over history. When men and women are seen more as equals before the law, same-sex marriage rises as a reasonable alternative for those who are attracted to members of their same sex. When culture sees women as subordinate to men, same-sex marriage seems really weird and appears to be a really bad fit for the relationship between two men or two women. Similarly, the idea of one man "owning" many women doesn't seem so strange if men are superior to women, but if they're equal, it's quite a shocking idea.Now, our society has only recently shifted from a mild version of female subjugation (many women might rightly quibble with my use of the term "mild") to one of, at least theoretical, equality. Of course, we've also thrown in the concept of "romance" to really make things confusing.With government now viewing a couple as two equal citizens, rather than a dominant man and a subservient woman, the legal logic behind the ban on same-sex marriage no longer exists. That leaves the state with only the arguments based on reasonable and rational societal goals. Those are now seen as rather flimsy.The reason society can allow same-sex marriage and disallow polygamy is that ALL citizens would be treated equally. ALL citizens could marry one other citizen. NONE could marry more than one. That's one test. The other is whether the restriction on ALL is rational and reasonable. The reason polygamy was banned before Utah could enter the Union was based on the unreasonable and undesireable effects of polygamy on society: the subjugation and exploitation of women and the dangers inherent in a having a large number of unmarried men (left over because some men would take many wives). [Personally, I think society really needs to grapple with the idea of polygamy. I don't want to encourage the kind of polygamy that exists largely due to the subjugation of women, but respect for self-determination for those few who choose polyamory (whether hetero, homo, or bi) and respect for the religious traditions of many folk around the world both beg for some sort of solution in a modern, global context, though probably a highly regulated one.]Bans on incestuous marriages also have rational and reasonable bases (plural of basis, nothing to do with baseball). In many states, cousins can marry. In some, they can't. In some, only sterile cousins can marry.The saddest thing about this whole issue is that the folks pushing the amendment are fully and totally aware that what they are doing is exactly the same as what the prohibitionists did. They are seeking power and dominance not by reason but by inflaming ignorance and hysteria. Crappy way to lead a nation, if you ask me.
attacks
Why only two consenting adults? Why not three? or four? or eight? It seems to me that you don't want to discriminate against gays, but do want to discriminate against polygamists. Don't the parties involved in polygamy also have the same right to self-determination?You're certainly free to hold that opinion.Actually, legalized gay marriage is a relatively new phenomenon (as my gay buddies have told me in this thread), so the jury's still out.That was the purpose of this thread, to separate the wheat from the chaff.Under the current definition of marriage, it is neither unjust nor inequitable. Anybody who is above the age of consent is free to marry a member of the opposite sex. What you're really argunig for is the redefining of what "marriage" is. That's a legitimate function for society to undertake, should it choose to do so. Social mores change with time, maybe it's time to rethink the definition of marriage to include same sex marriage. But, I can guarantee you that if gay marriage is forced on society without its approval, an amendment banning it is almost a guarantee. And a new Constitutional amendment banning same sex marriages would be bulletproof. The SOCUS would be unable to rule it unconstitutional because it would represent the newest Constitutional law, so whether or not it violated the previous 5th or 14th would become moot. An analogy would be Prohibition and the subsequent repeal of it.

So what if they ARE based on an "irrational prejudice" (which is YOUR take on them, BTW)? It seems to me that JP just wants to argue the merits of the gay marriage issue, period. Why should his personal feelings really matter? It's a national issue to debate regardless.There is a big difference between many the social arguements JP presented and the ones you presented regarding other matters: the jury is still out on a lot of what JP brought up. Many people still believe them, and many of those issues have not been disproven by your side. And as I have pointed out before, your own pride movement contributed to some of the arguments people made against gay people by such things as being more involved with seedier counter-cultural elements from the sexual revolution early on.

Here's a couple . . .- Broadening the marriage standard to include other arrangements would cost nothing to society financially has certainly not been proven--the just is still out.- the idea that gay sex (therefore gay people) are no more likely to get HIV than anyone else is unproven and the jury is still out.I'm sure there are more, but I don't want to go back and review all of JP's posts right now.

It has not been proven that it would either. I have presented a report from the CBO saying it would present an overall fiscal benefit to the federal government to the tune of +~$1 Billion per year over the next ten years. I would be interested in your opposing documentation.I simply fail to see a link whatsoever between this issue and gay marriage. "Hypothetical" "what if" arguments don't cut it. All I see is circular arguments.At least I honsetly stated that I do not subscribe to any of the absurd statements I itterated.

I wasn't attacking her at all. I was asking her to apply her same logic to another situation that would require the redefining of marriage. Her argument was that "No one has the right to tell two consenting adults whether or not they can engagein a contractual union. Period. I don't give two shits whether or not someone finds it offensive, immoral, wrong, unnatural, or whatever. It's a peron's right to self-determination. He may choose as he see's fit whom he can marry if that individual is of concentual age."If she truly believes that no one has the right to interfere in the contractual rights of consenting adults, why do you have to stop at two consenting adults. See, that's one of the flaws that I see in redefining marriage. It opens the floodgates for marriage to be redefined by any group with enough political clout to do so. If same sex "marriage" and not civil unions are allowed, then precedence will have been set for redefining marriage.I merely made note of it.I wasn't goading her, I was reitterating a fact that you folks told me.I believe that if you come out of the corner swinging, you should expect an early KO, but I had no way of knowing her level of knowledge a priori. Noobies shouldn't start out posting comments that they can't back up in fact. It kills their credibility before they even get any. ;)

Now now JP, don't attack the poor gal. Keep to the subject. The subject is Gay Marriage and yeah, that really is about "TWO" individuals, not three or four. You're only trying to confuse the issue and you know it. Polygamy is a different subject. If you want to discuss it, take it to the Civil Rights forum. ...And she has stated it. Let it be. This is true, however you're still attempting to goad Tigerlilly. This user is brand spankin' new to the forums. Back off for a bit before going directly to the jugular. Honey, I'm fairly certain you went directly over Tigerlilly's head here. Granted, many of us are a bit more experienced and have at least some idea of what you are saying, but give Tigerlilly a chance to catch up. Sure, maybe Tigerlilly didn't read every thread or post in this forum yet. Give him/her a chance. Tigerlilly hasn't even completed a full profile yet.

Very tactfully done. Why don't you reply to me that way, honey ? ;)
attacks
Tigerlilly, although your intentions are good, and don't get me wrong here I support your view, but I would really suggest reading more in this forum before you state some things that have already either been stated and upheld or stated and proven incorrect. For starters, your assumption that Gay Marriage exists "around the world" isn't completely true. It only exists in three other countries. As I said, I support you views, heck I'm gay and I want to attain a legal marriage with my partner of eight years. But I'm not about to state things which simply aren't true to do so.

You could go that route.....if you really wanted it to fail. Marriage is one of those things that falls into the category of social mores. Social mores are best changed through evolution, not revolution. For example, I don't see marriage laws as excluding same-sex partners. I see it as specifying opposite sex partners are required for a union to be a marriage. There IS a difference. I can guarantee that if gay marriage is forced on the public, a constitutional amendment defining marriage as one man, one woman will quickly follow and there aren't enough blue states to stop it from becoming so. Forcing it through the courts, instead of the legislature, would be a nuclear option with bad consequences for gay marriage advocates.
attacks
How would you suggest advocates of gay marriage recieve approval from society? Wouldn't advocates of gay marraige have to challenge the current definition of marriage which excludes same-sex marriage?

Agreed. But setting a precedence to redefine marriage from its traditional meaning will open the door for other attempts to redefine marriage as well.
attacks
Yes. Regardless of what happens with polygamy, it doesn't prove that same-sex marriage is right or wrong.

I'm afraid that precedence has already been set. Interracial marriage was once illegal, but now it is legal. In the Middle Ages, marriage was arranged by the parents. Now, it is the choice of the individuals involved.
supports
Agreed. But setting a precedence to redefine marriage from its traditional meaning will open the door for other attempts to redefine marriage as well.

As I attempted to state, rather ambiguously I now see, if I had a child that wasn't sure of his sexual identity, I would attempt to steer him towards heterosexuality if for no other reason than to give him a better chance of remaining healthy and living a long life. There are definitely extra health risks associated with homosexuality, so I would try to persuade him to avoid those risks as I persuade him to never smoke for like reasons.No, I wouldn't steer my daughters into lesbianism. While it's true that lesbians are less likely to contract HIV, there are other reasons to "steer" them towards heterosexuality. Grandkids are one reason that immediately comes to mind. Actually, I have three "real" kids, all very heterosexual so there's no actual steering needed. And of the three, my son's beliefs are even more strongly religious-based than my own.
attacks
Well, now that you're refreshed your memory as to your hypothetical childrens' orientations -- gay boy / gay girl -- how would you "steer" them?And even though it wasn't part of the original scenario, I'd really like to know why you wouldn't "steer" a hypothetical straight daughter into lesbianism, since the lesbian lifestyle is so much "safer" than the female hetero lifestyle. (hint: it's OK to just fall back on personal prejudice. Afterall, these fantasy kids are yours)

Scientific studies have shown that childhood sexual abuse is predominately perpetrated by male family members, therefore, male family members should not be allowed any contact with children. Unless you're a relative of Michael jackson's, I'd say the probability is extremely low. I'm willing to live with those odds. 4. Heterosexual married couples produce more left handed offspring than homosexual couples. These left handed individual will rise up and demand accommodations in public areas and the workplace, creating an undue fiscal strain on taxpayers and businesses.Since the union of homosexuals produces zero offspring, we'd have a hard time maintaining SS bennies if there wasn't new blood to pay into the system5. The incidence of sickle cell anemia is highest among the black race, therefore, black people should not be allowed to have children.We know enough about sickel cell anemia's spread to guard against a widespread increase. But, if it was highly contagious, you can bet we'd quarantine carriers. 6. The majority of drunken driving accidents and the resulting deaths, injuries, and property damages are caused by male drivers, therefore males should not be allowed to drive. Again, the statistics say that the risk is low, much lower than the chances of young SMS's acquiring HIV, I might add. 7. The incidence of violence against women is more predominate among heterosexual couples, therefore heterosexual couples should be banned. Again, low, acceptable risk.8. Being a Roman Catholic increases the risk of a child being sexually abused, therefore, the practice of the Roman Catholic religion should be banned.again, low acceptable risk level9. Insurance industry studies have shown that males have a shorter life span than females, therefore all males should be barred for obtaining life insurance.They aren't barred, but they do pay a penalty for being male.10. Southern people are rednecks. Only those who spend too much time in the sun, unprotected.11. White, Christian males are bigots. Only those who spend too much time in the sun, unprotected.The difference between my statements and yours is that the majority of Americans aren't being asked to change who can drive, wank, or anything other than redefine marriage.You could have chosen to ignore what I wrote, just as I chose to give some silly responses to you. I didn't jump in your face, call you names, etc., I maintained my civility in spite of your attempt to goad me.Not necessarily. I expected you to comment dispassionately on their veracity or lack thereof, though. Anyone who has been following the thread from its inception should have known that the intent was to debate the pros and cons of gay marriage. I started Post #1 with MY fiscal concerns. They were addressed and my fiscal concerns were found to be unfounded.We, next, moved on to health and moral concerns (see post #97)In post 99, I wrote:Now, where exacting, in the above post, am I making "in your face" statements? There was no hostility in my posts then or now. I was simply putting down arguments that straights have expressed for not wanting gay marriage in an attempt to generate a dialogue. I even reitterated my desire to not have the debate degrade into hostility by stating that I woul;dn't reply to uncivil responses.I understand the problem beter than you, evidently. I KNOW that you have to address straights' misconceptions, paranoia and fears while maintaining a non-threatening demeanor. So far, I've seen very little chance of that occurring if we can't even do so amongst reasonable open-minded, logical people. This isn't meant to be taken as confrontational, but if I was debating you in person on whether or not gays should be allowed to marry, you wouldn't be able to convince me that they should. Jaxian, on the other hand might. The reason isn't that his arguments are any more fctual than yours, it's because of his demeanor. It's honest, non-confrontational and conciliatory, when necessary. He allows room for people to admit that they were wrong without fear of being beaten over the head with the fact, he acknowledges when negative facts are presented and doesn't attempt to cloud the argument or deflect it and he does so in a credible, non-threatening way. Many times, the winner of an informal debate isn't the one with the best facts; it's the one with the most convincing argument and a convincing argument is more than just facts. The debater has to appear credible, likable and reasonable. First, I'd like to thank you for sharing that story. I'm sure it was a very uncomfortble incident for all involved. And I think that your customer demonstrated what many claim doesn't exist, ethics in business. Second, I'd like to say that the junior engineer was no Christian. Just because many Christians don't think that homosexuality is moral, it isn't an excuse for them to act un-Christian towards anyone. Jesus taught us to love everyone as we love ourselves.Third, you asked me what I believed and said that maybe if you knew my personal beliefs, it would help. OK, here goes.1. I believe that the push for gay marriage is "all about the Benjamins" but, not in the way that I first thought. My initial concern was the creation of more dependents that would be added to Federal outlays. The CBO analysis convinced me otherwise.2. Someone told me that a $30 marriage license would have saved them $thousands in legal fees to give his partner equivalent legal standing to a married partner. That's a significant financial burden, IMO.3. Marriage is a sacred union between a man and a woman.4. I am in favor of civil unions for gays, not marriage because of my religious belief above.5. I don't believe that gays are any more likely to be pedophiles than heterosexuals.6. I still believe that there are increased health risks for males associated with practicing homosexuality over males practicing heterosexuality.7. I'm not fully convinced that homosexuality isn't at least partially nurture and not 100% nature and therefore, I'm not 100% convinced that some recruitment or convincing doesn't take place.8. I think that allowing gay civil unions may help reduce the spread of HIV by providing a legal stabilizing institution.9. I'm not sure how to reconcile increased employer costs as a result of new legislation that would mandate them to pay for healthcare of same sex spouses. Perhaps the effect wouldn't be significant and my concern is unfounded.10. I'm not a homophobe, gay basher or bigot, but I am a little ignorant about committed gay relationships. This thread has given me much food for thought in that respect.

The junior engineer (straight, male "supposedly" Christian) and the sales engineer (straight, male, Christian, who I did not know very well at all at that time) took the customers to lunch.

I'm afraid that precedence has already been set. Interracial marriage was once illegal, but now it is legal. In the Middle Ages, marriage was arranged by the parents. Now, it is the choice of the individuals involved.

The definition has nothing to do with the sexes, it is all about what the right wing told you was the defintion. Up until gays there was no defintion. It is nothing more than a legal contract giving "special rights" to couples. But only hetero couples. We would like those rights extended not redefined. If you redefine what a marriage is gays might not want it anymore. We want it just as it is defined, but extended to us.

I didn't say that at all. I just said there were different issues involved, beause polygamous activity is indeed illegal.But different issues.The argument of consenting adults who love can be applied to any relationship between adults which does not involve rape. Please explain your second sentence further. How do these arguments apply specifically to gays and polygamists?Ah, yes, here we go again. I'm very surprised you didn't mention sex with a human and a sheep. I am not arguing for or against polygamous rights nor for or against any of the other rights you mention. Can we please stay on the topic of gay rights? Do you have a logical argument against THAT?It depends on which religion. Gay marriages often take place in a religious institution too. How do you know there is no slippery slope with straight religious marriages, but "not quite" a slippery slope involving gay marriage? What is "not quite" a slippery slope?

lol, so if we make gay relationships illegal we would have no problem? ;) When sodomy was illegal, did that solve the problem?Practical problems only. They are consenting adults whos love is the same as yours. Philosophically, all of the arguments for equal rights and social acceptance do apply.Not quite a slippery slope. What argument (besides practical problems which can always be gotten around) would you use to deny polygamous rights? Incestous relationships between consenting adults? At what point does good and acceptable become creepy and weird? Brother and sister? Father and son?The argument for straight marriage over gay marriage is based in religion usually, so there is no slippery slope there. Anything besides man and woman is simply not allowed. You cannot use that justification.

Of course, I did allow myself to be drawn into this attempt to take us off the topic of gay rights, by discussing polygamy.

I do agree that it is difficult to convince someone that they are wrong if they feel that you are very hostile, though I understand why people are very hostile here. As I've said, this topic strikes very close to home for a lot of people here.I would love to discuss other issues, though I am not nearly as strong an arguer in those cases. It is my opinion that gay rights is the only issue under debate right now in which there is one side that is clearly correct. All other issues have valid points on both sides of the argument and it is a matter of determining which side has the best points. Still, I am very opinionated, and I love to debate.Woah now, wait just a second. Polygamous activity is certainly not illegal. Banning polygamous activity would be a harsh limitation on freedom, this is certain.I actually agree with this; most arguments used to support same-sex marriage can be used to support polygamy as well. The difference is that there are argument which can be used against polygamy which do not apply to same-sex marriage. The primary argument against polygamy is that it is unequal and unrealistic. Applying marriage across ten people would in theory allow one person to spread his benefits of marriage across nine others instead of just one. For example, nine other people in a family could get that one man's health insurance instead of just one in a current-day marriage. Not only would this give polygamy benefits over other marriages, but it would be rather unrealistic to give that many people health benefits just because only one person has them. So it is unequal and impractical. Now we could in theory implement a form of polygamy where each member is allowed to give his or her benefits to only one other person, but how is that different from what we have today? Currently polygamous people can marry one other person and give that person benefits; technically their marriage is already recognized under the law.So creating polygamous marriage is a bad idea; we don't need it and it would create inequality. You may not like my reasoning on the subject, but if you do not, you had better have some reasoning of your own to back up your dislike of polygamy. If one does not have a reason to disallow polygamy, then he is not justified in disallowing it. So tell us that reason. If it also applies to same-sex marriage, then we can discuss its validity. But simply saying "if we can allow same-sex marriage, we can allow polygamy" is not enough because you have not given any reason that polygamy should not be allowed. When you give that reason, we can discuss whether it actually applies to same-sex marriage or not. I gave a reason to disallow polygamy which does not apply to same-sex marriage.Well, I discussed polygamy above. But how about incest? Well in my opinion incest too often results in children who are mentally disabled and is an abuse of the natural bonds of love created by the closeness between families. Again, this reason to disallow incestuous marriage does not apply to same-sex marriage. If you do not like my reasoning, again you simply must have a reason to dislike incest. The only reason you specified is that it is "creepy and weird". I think we can both agree that creepy and weird is a matter of opinion and is not any reason to take away the rights of others. So why do you dislike incest? Think about it, and think about whether those reasons apply to same-sex marriage. If they do, posts them here, and again, we will discuss their validity.Sure I can. The argument in favor of same-sex marriage is based on religion often as well; whole bunches of people hold religious beliefs which state that marriage is between any two people who are not related by family.Furthermore, there is a very dangerous slippery slope to be run down by disallowing same-sex marriage. If the battle against same-sex marriage wins, we are setting a precedent that the government is allowed to disallow the rights of minorities any time it wants. With the denial of same-sex marriage, what other rights are soon to follow? Will we lose the right to cheat on our spouses? Maybe that one isn't so bad. Maybe you'd vote in favor of removing that right. If so, then you should see my point. What about divorcing our spouses; might we soon lose that right? What about having children out of wedlock? What about practicing a religion that the government has not approved? What about speaking out against the government? What about eating unhealthy food? At what point does restricting freedom end? Such a slippery slope is a far more dangerous one to walk down than the "what if people allow polygamy!" one. Everyone is in the minority on some issue, and everyone is in danger of losing their rights if same-sex marriage is not legalized.

I disagree. The public consists of a very large number of people. They may be somewhat uninformed as individuals, but collectively a large group knows more about PUBLIC decision making than a FEW "experts". The same way that the public should be allowed to make the decision of whether or not we should allow gay marriage. Gays should, and are, allowed to make decisions about who they'll live with, spend time with, work with, etc. etc. That's an INDIVIDUAL decision - not up to the public, OR an expert. I try not to be a name caller. Distinguishing between liberals and conservatives isn't name calling IMO. It's one of many reasons talk radio is popular. One of the strategies of today's liberals is play "moderate". You'll see those who claim to be a social liberal, but a fiscal conservative. That's not really possible - to be a social liberal requires money, and they'll try to cover it up in a debate. It's important to distinguish between the two labels. Though we may not like it, having political opinions requires taking sides. Picking and choosing, favoring one sides befefits without that same sides subsequent costs is common today.See above about the difference between a ~public~ decision, and a ~private~ decision.Mainly, yes.I hope you are seeing from several of us here, (those of us against gay marriage) have reasons for being against it that have nothing to do with a personal dislike of gay people.Right. Society has indeed become more liberal over time. Legalizing gay marriage will be an additional liberal victory.As things are now, gays AND single, companionless people share the burden equally in providing the tax benefits etc. that married couples enjoy. If gay people are newly included in these benefits, then single companionless people will be burdened far more than they are now.If everyone has something, it's not very special. :) Their website looks pretty negative and liberal to me. In the spread of liberalism, I think it matters a LOT.Stripping them of the right to marry? They never had the right. There is a difference between taking something away, and not allowing it in the first place.

Thanks for responding to my posts. Let's see here...It seems to me that you are using my explanation on how offensive anti-same-sex marriage arguments to mean something they did not, so I am afraid I was not clear on what I meant. I did not say any of those things in an attempt to justify same-sex marriage or to show that opposing it is wrong. I also did not mean to imply that opponents of same-sex marriage are intentionally hostile. I said those things only in an attempt to justify the hostility you described in members of the forum who support same-sex marriage. From what you wrote above, it sounds to me that you believed I thought you wanted to offend opponents of same-sex couples. That is certainly not what I think.Next, you mentioned my comment that school administrators not always listening to the general public being a good thing. I should point out that the comment was barely related to same-sex marriage and that I wrote paragraphs of other comments explaining why same-sex marriage would not affect our schools. Addressing this one comment does not address the heart of my argument.Still, since you chose this sentence to pull out, allow me to explain why it is a bad idea for the public administrator to listen to everything the public demands. The public, first of all, is very uninformed about how to educate children, and they are very influenced by the media. They tend to hear some vague piece of information, and instead of researching it themselves, demand that something be unreasonably changed. The truth is, no one can be informed about everything, and the mass of the public isn't informed at all except on that which sends them into an outrage. Furthermore, parents tend to be interested more in what benefits their own children more than in what benefits the most children overall. Considering all of this, it is best to leave these decisions in the hands of someone who is an expert on the subject matter and who has a vested interest in making sure his school is successful, not in certain children succeeding over others or certain children getting good grades.As for things being liberal, well I'm not certain this is a liberal viewpoint, though it may be. I get my reasoning from the Federalist Papers, which I think provide much insight into these sorts of situations. So I do think it a Federalist viewpoint. Though you say "liberal" as though that is all you need say in order to show that something is bad. "Liberal" and "conservative" are just different viewpoints, each one requiring reasoning and evidence to prove themselves correct. Do not make the mistake of immitating radio show hosts in this respect; if you believe something is bad, you must have a reason for that belief, not just term "liberal" or "conservative".Beyond this, same-sex marriage is a conservative value by nature, as conservatives tend to value keeping the government out of people's lifestyle and their decisions. Conservatives tend to hate it when the government interferes with people living their lives. On the other hand, it is also a liberal issue. Liberals tend to believe that the overall happiness of the people can be sometimes be increased through government interference. Republicans and those who identify themselves as conservatives today tend to disagree with same-sex marriage not based on conservative principle but on moral or religious principle. In my arguments, I intend to prove that banning same-sex marriage is harmful and morally wrong, and that although you are entitled to your religous beliefs on the subject, you are not entitled to take away the rights of those who hold different beliefs.I'm guessing that truly GLAAD was angry at something he wrote about same-sex marriage but that they probably would not have targetted someone very liberal. But what is the point here? Do you disagree with same-sex marriage because most gay rights groups support liberals?As for hatefully pointing fingers, certainly it could just as easily be said that most opponents of same-sex marriage hatefully point fingers at gay people. It's not an evil thing to do, it is the way people try to win civil rights battles.A tool? Surely you cannot call the rights of millions of people a tool, and surely you do not suspect that liberalism has some great intent to take over the world. Society itself has become more liberal over time, and that in itself is the only liberalism that has entered our elementary schools. Perhaps Gay rights is not a tool by which liberalism attempts to force itself upon others, and preventing it is a tool by which conservatism attempts to prevent society from becoming more liberal. People who have grown up knowing only one certain set of values watch society move away from that set of values and do what they can to stop that movement, even if it means stopping equality. I haven't decided that what I've just said is accurate for certain, but the more I speak with people, the more true that seems to become.In some off-sense, I could say that you have the right to marry the person you love while a gay person does not. Though to explain it more thouroughly, you do not have a right that any gay person does not have. By legalizing same-sex marriage, I am indeed suggesting that we give everyone the right to marry someone of the same sex, not just gay people. However it is also true that this situation is not equal or free. The lack of freedom is present in that people do not have the right to marry the person of their choosing. The lack of equality is clear not because you have some right that a gay person does not, but because the right to marry is designed so that only heterosexuals will use it. When I say that gays do not have equal rights, I do not mean they do not have as many rights but that our civil rights do not provide equality to everyone, though they certainly could be extended to do so. When I say that it is wrong to take away the rights of gays, I take it for granted that everyone understands that we are taking away this right from everyone, but that this right we are taking away would only be used by gays and they are therefore only the ones losing anything.Slavery was long part of our society until it was abolished. What is long part of our society is not necessarily good or just, and we should not give special privleges to things just because they have been in our legal books the longest. We should strive to continaully evaluate ourselves as people, and where we can increase equality, freedom, and happines, we should strive to do so. Everyone deserves special rights.Well, GLAAD's agenda is equality for gay people, and I consider that a very positive agenda. But whether their campaign uses positive or negative tactics, I do not know. I get lots of mail from GLAAD asking me to donate money, and that mail is generally positive. "Make a difference!" You know what I mean; you'd have to expect that sort of stuff. I haven't paid much attention to their political tactics. Does it really matter?Oh, well I think none of us have any doubt that promiscuity among gay men has led to the spread of AIDS. That isn't attacking them. It is stripping them of the right to marry that attacks them. What I mean is that I think people are looking at the problem that more gay people have AIDS than straight people, and they say, "Well, we should deny the rights of gay people to discourage being gay. That way less people will get AIDS." My argument is that this is discouraging the wrong thing, and because people are targetting the wrong thing, they are actually increasing the cases of AIDS by denying gay rights instead of decreasing them.Well, hopefully that clears things up!

Gay marriage is a NEW thing that's being sought, not an existing thing that someone's seeking to remove.

EXACTLY! It is my INDIVIDUAL decision to marry someone of the same sex. What business is it of yours? If single heterosexuals decides to remain single, that is their INDIVIDUAL decision, not mine, not yours. If homosexuals decision to remain single, that is their INDIVIDUAL decision. INDIVIDUAL heterosexual people have the right to marry someone of the opposite sex. What YOU promote is denying INDIVIDUAL homosexuals the right to marry someone of the same sex. I fail to see any logic in that.I thought we had already put the fallacy of gay marriage costing society $$ to bed. Do we need to reitterate the aprox. +$1 Billion per year over the next ten years to the federal government's bottom line?And I believe in Peter Pan, the tooth fairy, the Easter Bunny, and Santa Claus too.And probably will continue to be, when people start understanding the illogic of their prejudices. You need to catch up with the times.See reference above to aprox, +$1 Billion to the fed bottom line per year.I think that is really the point of your entire argument. You feel "special" and don't want to give that up.

I'm misunderstanding. The issues are different because polygamous activity is illegal? Do you mean to say that if homosexual activity was illegal you would not argue for it?It is different, no denying that. Why do the arguments for homosexual love not justify polygamous love?Agreed, including polygamous and incestuous relationships.You made my point already. Any argument for an alternative union apply to other sorts of alternative unions.I would include that but a sheep cannot give consent. I would argue that it doesn't matter since animals should not have rights as humans do, but that requires more arguments than I'm willing to put forth at the moment.No, nor would I attempt to. I have no problem with gay rights or gay marriage, I have a problem with the inherent hypocrisy I see when gay activists argue that "the love is the same" and "we're people and we just want to love each other" and then blast other alternative marriage. What others do in the bedroom is none of your or my business, and who I marry is none of your business either. It doesn't affect you :)Because religion (for the sake of argument, say Catholics) bans any marriage besides between a man and a woman. There can be no slippery slope because there is no argument, only dogmatic laws. An argument can apply to different situations whether or not they are the authors intent, dogmatic law only applies to what the priests apply it to. The "not quite" was a bit of sarcasm.This is not a "slippery slope", this is a logical step. If you wish to argue for gay rights, realize that other things you may not agree with become a lot more possible.

Please explain your second sentence further. How do these arguments apply specifically to gays and polygamists?Ah, yes, here we go again. I'm very surprised you didn't mention sex with a human and a sheep. I am not arguing for or against polygamous rights nor for or against any of the other rights you mention.

How do you know there is no slippery slope with straight religious marriages, but "not quite" a slippery slope involving gay marriage? What is "not quite" a slippery slope?

Agreed. If your going to allow one sort of alternative marriage, I cannot see how you can justify banning other sorts (besides practical issues, and practical issues should not, philosophically if not practically, interfere with civil rights).Agreed, there are practical problems associated with polygamy. However, that does not negate that their relationship should be recognized in some manner. Perhaps the answer is the change marriage entirely, I don't know.Do we "need" homosexual marriage? There are those who wish to have polygamous marriage.I don't dislike polygamy.I am arguing that polygamy should be allowed, under the same reasoning that gay marriage is allowed.Practical problems are not a good justification to ban civil liberties, especially when the argument for gay marriage is not that it's "easy" but that it's "right". Whether or not polygamy is "easy" makes little difference in terms of if it's "right".Abuse is something that is fought against anyway.Children are not a pre-requisite of marriage. Homosexuals cannot have children at all, so the state of the children should not bar incestuous relationships. Also, we do not ban marriage between couples who may (even if it's a good chance) have disabled or mentally challenged children, incestuous or no. "Abuse of the natural bonds of love created by the closeness between families"? That sounds suspiciously like a moral argument against a certain relationship. What if I were to argue that homosexual relationships were an abuse of the natural bonds of love between opposite sexes?I don't dislike incest. I don't participate myself, but I see no reason why incestuous relationships should be demonized by those who are supposedly open-minded about relationships. They love each other, who are you to keep them apart? Regardless of whether or not they have children, or if those children are retarded, they have the right to love each other.Exactly! So, why is incest and polygamy wrong? Only because of the practical problems with implementing polygamy and what might happen with the children in incest? Are those valid reasons for not giving them civil liberties?I have no problem with incestuous relationships or polygamous relationships. It appears that you do.However, much of the opposition to homosexual marriage is based in religion is it not?Agreed. I don't believe the gov't should be in our personal lives any more than absolutely necessary.You misunderstand my stance. You believe I am arguing for polygamy and incest as a rhetorical device against homosexual marriage. I am not. I am sincerely arguing for polygamy and incestuous relationships based on the same arguments that you are using.I realize that I am a lot more liberal in personal matters than many liberals, but I do not think the gov't should be involved in our personal lives.Unfortunately, there are situations where you do not have the right to divorce. There was a case recently where a woman was not allowed to divorce because she was pregnant.I don't believe that particular slippery slope. Certainly it would restrict freedom, and be a step toward fascism. But "everyone will lose all their rights if this isn't legal!" is a textbook slippery slope fallacy.

So why do you dislike incest? Think about it, and think about whether those reasons apply to same-sex marriage. If they do, posts them here, and again, we will discuss their validity.Sure I can. The argument in favor of same-sex marriage is based on religion often as well; whole bunches of people hold religious beliefs which state that marriage is between any two people who are not related by family.Furthermore, there is a very dangerous slippery slope to be run down by disallowing same-sex marriage. If the battle against same-sex marriage wins, we are setting a precedent that the government is allowed to disallow the rights of minorities any time it wants. With the denial of same-sex marriage, what other rights are soon to follow? Will we lose the right to cheat on our spouses? Maybe that one isn't so bad. Maybe you'd vote in favor of removing that right. If so, then you should see my point. What about divorcing our spouses; might we soon lose that right? What about having children out of wedlock? What about practicing a religion that the government has not approved? What about speaking out against the government? What about eating unhealthy food? At what point does restricting freedom end? Such a slippery slope is a far more dangerous one to walk down than the "what if people allow polygamy!" one. Everyone is in the minority on some issue, and everyone is in danger of losing their rights if same-sex marriage is not legalized.

And up until the number of gays increased, there was no need to. Nobody thought marriage was anything BUT one man and one woman. You can't have it both ways. The 1996 Defense of Marriage Act defines it as one man, one woman. You would have to redefine marriage in that case.

The definition has nothing to do with the sexes, it is all about what the right wing told you was the defintion. Up until gays there was no defintion. It is nothing more than a legal contract giving "special rights" to couples. But only hetero couples. We would like those rights extended not redefined. If you redefine what a marriage is gays might not want it anymore. We want it just as it is defined, but extended to us.

I'm misunderstanding. The issues are different because polygamous activity is illegal? Do you mean to say that if homosexual activity was illegal you would not argue for it?It is different, no denying that. Why do the arguments for homosexual love not justify polygamous love?Agreed, including polygamous and incestuous relationships.You made my point already. Any argument for an alternative union apply to other sorts of alternative unions.I would include that but a sheep cannot give consent. I would argue that it doesn't matter since animals should not have rights as humans do, but that requires more arguments than I'm willing to put forth at the moment.No, nor would I attempt to. I have no problem with gay rights or gay marriage, I have a problem with the inherent hypocrisy I see when gay activists argue that "the love is the same" and "we're people and we just want to love each other" and then blast other alternative marriage. What others do in the bedroom is none of your or my business, and who I marry is none of your business either. It doesn't affect you :)Because religion (for the sake of argument, say Catholics) bans any marriage besides between a man and a woman. There can be no slippery slope because there is no argument, only dogmatic laws. An argument can apply to different situations whether or not they are the authors intent, dogmatic law only applies to what the priests apply it to. The "not quite" was a bit of sarcasm.This is not a "slippery slope", this is a logical step. If you wish to argue for gay rights, realize that other things you may not agree with become a lot more possible.

The question of DOMA constitutionality is what Bush, post-election, bases his withdrawal of pushing for federal legislation to ban same-sex marriage on.

The arguments for homosexual marriage are not contingent on how many are participating. Is your only justification that the number of participants are the same?No, the arguments in favor of homosexual marriage are that it is no one elses business who you marry, nor does it affect others in a way that justifies denying them rights. The same argument applies to polygamous and incestuous marriage.Why does the number of particpants matter, if they love each other and are in a commited relationship? I do agree that this is a bit outside the scope of the debate, but I believe it is a valid criticism of the gay-rights movement.If a member of the relationship is not able to give consent, obviously I cannot use the same argument.I never was part of any other subject in this thread ;)Homosexuality is not my style either, and you can find homosexuality on the internet as well. That does not allow or disallow the relationship. What people do in the bedroom is not your business :)Where is the hypocrisy? I have not said anything negative about homosexual relationships. You, however, are for one sort of alternative relationship but seem to blast any other sort. That is hypocrisy.So what? If they do that is their business. My only point was that there is no slippery slope with a religion defining marriage between a man and a woman because a religious argument does not need to be rational or logical as your argument does. A rational and logical argument can apply to things you don't necessarily agree to, while dogmatic laws do not. God says exactly what he means, if he meant something different he would have said so.

I do agree that it is difficult to convince someone that they are wrong if they feel that you are very hostile, though I understand why people are very hostile here. As I've said, this topic strikes very close to home for a lot of people here.I would love to discuss other issues, though I am not nearly as strong an arguer in those cases. It is my opinion that gay rights is the only issue under debate right now in which there is one side that is clearly correct. All other issues have valid points on both sides of the argument and it is a matter of determining which side has the best points. Still, I am very opinionated, and I love to debate.Woah now, wait just a second. Polygamous activity is certainly not illegal. Banning polygamous activity would be a harsh limitation on freedom, this is certain.I actually agree with this; most arguments used to support same-sex marriage can be used to support polygamy as well. The difference is that there are argument which can be used against polygamy which do not apply to same-sex marriage. The primary argument against polygamy is that it is unequal and unrealistic. Applying marriage across ten people would in theory allow one person to spread his benefits of marriage across nine others instead of just one. For example, nine other people in a family could get that one man's health insurance instead of just one in a current-day marriage. Not only would this give polygamy benefits over other marriages, but it would be rather unrealistic to give that many people health benefits just because only one person has them. So it is unequal and impractical. Now we could in theory implement a form of polygamy where each member is allowed to give his or her benefits to only one other person, but how is that different from what we have today? Currently polygamous people can marry one other person and give that person benefits; technically their marriage is already recognized under the law.So creating polygamous marriage is a bad idea; we don't need it and it would create inequality. You may not like my reasoning on the subject, but if you do not, you had better have some reasoning of your own to back up your dislike of polygamy. If one does not have a reason to disallow polygamy, then he is not justified in disallowing it. So tell us that reason. If it also applies to same-sex marriage, then we can discuss its validity. But simply saying "if we can allow same-sex marriage, we can allow polygamy" is not enough because you have not given any reason that polygamy should not be allowed. When you give that reason, we can discuss whether it actually applies to same-sex marriage or not. I gave a reason to disallow polygamy which does not apply to same-sex marriage.Well, I discussed polygamy above. But how about incest? Well in my opinion incest too often results in children who are mentally disabled and is an abuse of the natural bonds of love created by the closeness between families. Again, this reason to disallow incestuous marriage does not apply to same-sex marriage. If you do not like my reasoning, again you simply must have a reason to dislike incest. The only reason you specified is that it is "creepy and weird". I think we can both agree that creepy and weird is a matter of opinion and is not any reason to take away the rights of others.

Of course, I did allow myself to be drawn into this attempt to take us off the topic of gay rights, by discussing polygamy.

That's a really bad argument, imo. Restricting what people can eat does not discriminate on that basis, either. And yet you favor restricting rights in other ways? Across the board gun control does not discriminate.

Marriage is a legal contract (get it???) between 2 (not some # >2, get it???) consenting (get it???) adults (get it????).Minors (get it???)cannot enter into legal contracts, and I agree with that stipulation.Animals (get it???) cannot enter into legal contracts, and I most DEFINATELY agree with that.

I'd like to see some references for same-sex marriage being generally practiced and not just "tolerated". Everything I find seems to indicate that male/female unions are the natural state from antiquity to the present.and I disagree. The legal system still has many laws that favor a woman over a man, especially in child custody law, but extending into other areas, such as real estate. For example, in Michigan, a married man cannot buy a house without his wife's consent, but it is legal for the wife to buy a house without the husband's consent. I found out that one the hard way when my wife and I were relocating from PA 20 years ago. I had to fly her out here, last minute, to sign papers before I could close on a house.Here's where your logic is flawed. You assert that it is legal to define marriage arbitrarily as "two parties", but illegal to define it as 3 or more. This is no different that our current situation. The law currently defines marriage as one man, one woman. It is argued by you and others, that this is discriminatory against same sex partners. Polygamists would argue that the number 2 is just as arbitrary as saying that only one man and one woman constitutes marriage and use your same argument. All citizens would be treated equally. All citizens could marry X other citizens. [quote]The other is whether the restriction on ALL is rational and reasonable. The reason polygamy was banned before Utah could enter the Union was based on the unreasonable and undesireable effects of polygamy on society: the subjugation and exploitation of women and the dangers inherent in a having a large number of unmarried men (left over because some men would take many wives). [Personally, I think society really needs to grapple with the idea of polygamy. I don't want to encourage the kind of polygamy that exists largely due to the subjugation of women, but respect for self-determination for those few who choose polyamory (whether hetero, homo, or bi) and respect for the religious traditions of many folk around the world both beg for some sort of solution in a modern, global context, though probably a highly regulated one.]Rational and reasonable as in religious or morally? You do know that the fear of getetic abnormalities from mating within one's family has been largely disproven, don't you?That's the danger of ticking off the majority in a "democratic" society.

Wrapped up in those three snippets is the heart of the argument. First of all, same-sex marriage is new in the modern era. It has been legal in earlier times in this culture (insofar as we are the continuation of Western civilization) and in other cultures. To some extent the reason it comes and goes is because the position of women vis-a-vis women changes over history. When men and women are seen more as equals before the law, same-sex marriage rises as a reasonable alternative for those who are attracted to members of their same sex. When culture sees women as subordinate to men, same-sex marriage seems really weird and appears to be a really bad fit for the relationship between two men or two women. Similarly, the idea of one man "owning" many women doesn't seem so strange if men are superior to women, but if they're equal, it's quite a shocking idea.Now, our society has only recently shifted from a mild version of female subjugation (many women might rightly quibble with my use of the term "mild") to one of, at least theoretical, equality. Of course, we've also thrown in the concept of "romance" to really make things confusing.With government now viewing a couple as two equal citizens, rather than a dominant man and a subservient woman, the legal logic behind the ban on same-sex marriage no longer exists. That leaves the state with only the arguments based on reasonable and rational societal goals. Those are now seen as rather flimsy.The reason society can allow same-sex marriage and disallow polygamy is that ALL citizens would be treated equally. ALL citizens could marry one other citizen. NONE could marry more than one. That's one test. The other is whether the restriction on ALL is rational and reasonable. The reason polygamy was banned before Utah could enter the Union was based on the unreasonable and undesireable effects of polygamy on society: the subjugation and exploitation of women and the dangers inherent in a having a large number of unmarried men (left over because some men would take many wives). [Personally, I think society really needs to grapple with the idea of polygamy. I don't want to encourage the kind of polygamy that exists largely due to the subjugation of women, but respect for self-determination for those few who choose polyamory (whether hetero, homo, or bi) and respect for the religious traditions of many folk around the world both beg for some sort of solution in a modern, global context, though probably a highly regulated one.]Bans on incestuous marriages also have rational and reasonable bases (plural of basis, nothing to do with baseball). In many states, cousins can marry. In some, they can't. In some, only sterile cousins can marry.The saddest thing about this whole issue is that the folks pushing the amendment are fully and totally aware that what they are doing is exactly the same as what the prohibitionists did. They are seeking power and dominance not by reason but by inflaming ignorance and hysteria. Crappy way to lead a nation, if you ask me.

I am not attempting to undo fundamental Christian beliefs, I am attempting to give people equality under the law regardless of their beliefs. As I have argued in my previous posts, I do believe that if anyone is trying to undo their opponents beliefs, it is the opponents of same-sex marriage attempting to undo the beliefs of the supporters by illegalizing the practice of a certain belief. If you imply that I am offending people by stating that it is immoral to oppose same-sex marriage, well that may be, and I do not doubt it to be the case. However, it is necessary for my argument to say such things, just as it is necessary for your argument to offend gay people. In what I said there, I was not saying that offending gay people is a reason we should allow same-sex marriage, I was saying that it is understandable why people seem hostile to you.I did not mean to imply that the issue is cut and dry for you, only that it is cut and dry for me. Whether some of our laws are based on religion, our Constitution is not, and most who founded our country believed in a freedom of religion unseen in past countries. Regardless, the religious beliefs of the majority are not and will never be an excuse to put something morally evil into our laws. From our debates in previous posts, I have not seen any benefit of banning same-sex marriage at all, yet I have seen countless benefits. Banning something that would help people and harm no one is evil, as far as I am concerned.Hmm, well perhaps I didn't explain myself very well. The argument I intended to present could only be used to support same-sex marriage, not argue against it. Let me re-explain myself: If we legalize same-sex marriage, everyone will have an equal right to bestow their marriage benefits on one other person that they fall in love with. If we legalize polygamy, those in polygamous relationships will be able to bestow their marriage benefits on an unlimited number of people while those in monogamous relationships will only be allowed to bestow those benefits on a single person. That is the inequality I spoke of. Carrying that logic to the same-sex marriage debate, it could easily be said that those in opposite-sex relationships are able to bestow marriage benefits on one person they fall in love with, while those in same-sex relationships are able to bestow marriage benefits upon no one. My logic is intended to reveal an inequality that can only be rectified by allowing same-sex marriage and disallowing polygamous marriage.As I have stated above, polygamous relationships are already recognized and are already equal under the law to those of monogamous couples. Their marriage is recognized, and they can bestow their marriage benefits upon one other person. Equality is not discrimination.So do I. As with same-sex marriage, I believe that many of the arguments used to support gay rights can be used to support incestual marriage. However, as I stated regarding polygamy, there are reasons for banning incestual marriage that do not exist for same-sex marriage. I explain those.I can do so because freedom of religion is a value worth holding. As a nation, we do not take away the rights from one religion because of the beliefs of another. We do not strip the right of one religion to build churches because it is not the majority just as we do not strip the right of one religion to marry because they are not the majority. We especially do not do so when allowing equality in religion would not hurt our nation; it would help it.You wouldn't agree that people are being discriminated against based on sexual orientation? As I have said in the past: I am not arguing for a new right that only affects homosexuals, I am arguing to give everyone the right to marry people of the same-sex. I call this "rights of the minority" because as we all know, it is only those whose sexual orientation is in the minority who would take advantage of this new right.It will work; that should be all the more evidence of the slippery slope we're headed toward. States are ready to take away the rights of people; the federal government is ready to take away those rights. They've already done so. If they can take away the right to adultry, then they will. If the government can take away any right, it will. All we need to do is give them a reason, give them a sign that the people aren't going to rise up if the government takes away their freedom, and suddenly our freedom will be gone. Or at least that slippery slope is a far more likely and more dangerous one than the polygamy and incest one.You're right, it wasn't. But each step we take toward restricting freedom makes the next step toward it seem less far fetched. Is it really the government's business why you got divorced any more than it is the government's business why you believe in your religion, why you chose the job you did, why you eat the food you do, or why you do anything else? Your life is your own, not the government's to control. Each step we take away from that is a step away from freedom.You're absolutely right. Hrm, my point isn't getting across. I specifically used examples that don't seem far-fetched so that you would understand how the government might use their momentum to actually restrict more freedoms. Then I implied that if they are going to restrict those freedoms, how far might they go? Restricting freedom is a bad place to be.How about the Ammendment that guarantees equal protection under the law? But regardless of that, does it really matter whether there is an Ammendment? Does that make it any less wrong? Does that make it any less likely that the government will try to overrule the Ammendment? Think about religious freedom and gun control. Also, think of all the freedoms that aren't protected by the Constitution that you might lose.If you're a gun-rights advocate, then maybe you know where I'm coming from. The government will restrict your right to guns just as readily as it will restrict your right to anything if you give it the chance. The majority will vote against gun-owners in Michigan, if you give them the chance. That doesn't make it right.Despite all I've said, I don't really think we'll end up heading down a slippery slope no matter which side wins out. But I do think that if a slippery slope does begin, it will begin by restricting same-sex marriage and it will continue by restricting more of our freedoms. I don't think we're in a slippery slope yet. What slope are you referring to?

But if gays are allowed to make the decision of who they spend time with, work with, live with, etc; why can they not make the decision about who they marry? Why is it up to the public at large to determine that? Why can they not raise their children as they see fit? Why does the public at large get involved? Why can they not take and give a good home to a child from adoption? Why must the public interject its opinion? The entire issue we are discussing involves the public interjecting its opinion of marriage upon every individual couple. It is tyranny of the majority in every sense.Regardless, I do not believe there is any indication that the public knows anything about educating a child. The public could not put together a list of good courses for children to take; they simply aren't informed enough about school classes. Most probably couldn't even name more classes than those their child is immediately taking. Yet we're going to leave all of the decisions about how the school is run up to the 51% of public opinion that was aroused by some story in the news? In that case, might we not get rid of the school board alltogether?But as we have seen, supporting same-sex marriage saves money. Allowing abortion wouldn't require money, banning guns wouldn't require money (though it would hurt businesses), allowing stem-cell research wouldn't cost money, keeping religion out of schools and public buildings would save money... The only really socially liberal thing I can think of that might cost money is enforcing environmental regulations.Anyhow, I guess all I meant when I spoke about same-sex marriage and liberalism is that same-sex marriage is based in both liberal and conservative principles; though even if it were not, simply claiming something is "liberal" isn't enough explanation for why you disagree with it.Yes, but there is no reason to suggest that marriage is any of the public's business. For example, if the public didn't want any brunettes marrying blondes, should the public be allowed to take away that right? What business is it of the public to take away that right? This is a private decision in every way I can think of, which aligns it perfectly with conservatism.Well that's not a good reason! Taking away rights from an entire group of people because a lot of them are liberal is not justice; it is tyranny. It is an admission that you are taking away rights with someone simply because they have a different political viewpoint. It what dictators do to the people who disagree with them.Well, it was you who claimed that gay people were hatefully pointing fingers; I was only saying that it would be no more valid for me to claim that opponents of same-sex marriage are hatefully pointing fingers.Well, I would argue that it would be a victory for everyone, but as I've said, even if it could be shown that this is not a conservative value, simply being a victory for liberals does not indicate that it is a bad thing. In previous posts, I've shown harm coming to many people through banning same-sex marriage, while benefit coming to many through allowing it. Liberal or not, it is right.Not at all; those people are perfectly entitled to get married to anyone they wish, should they choose to do so. The important part is that they are free to marry any person of their choosing, not a set of government-mandated people. As for tax burdens, well I don't recall mentioning that. The point of marriage is to reduce the tax burden on married couples, if I'm not mistaken. It is acceptable to argue that married couples should not recieve this additional tax relief because that puts the burden on unmarried people, but that is a different topic. All I'm arguing is that whatever rights we give to opposite-sex couples, we should give to same-sex couples as well.Well, if we restrict some people from having what we have, then what we have may be special, but we're still bad people.Well, take a look at the website of a real gay rights group, then: http://www.hrc.org/Regardless, I fail to see how a gay rights group delivering a negative message against that which they see as wrong is a bad thing. You're doing it right now, I'm doing it right now... That's the way debating works.Is there a big difference? I don't really see it. In a sense, we are still stripping people of the right to marry, we've just always been doing it. We are still just as wrong; well, more wrong since we've been doing it for a longer period of time.

I disagree. The public consists of a very large number of people. They may be somewhat uninformed as individuals, but collectively a large group knows more about PUBLIC decision making than a FEW "experts". The same way that the public should be allowed to make the decision of whether or not we should allow gay marriage. Gays should, and are, allowed to make decisions about who they'll live with, spend time with, work with, etc. etc. That's an INDIVIDUAL decision - not up to the public, OR an expert. I try not to be a name caller. Distinguishing between liberals and conservatives isn't name calling IMO. It's one of many reasons talk radio is popular. One of the strategies of today's liberals is play "moderate". You'll see those who claim to be a social liberal, but a fiscal conservative. That's not really possible - to be a social liberal requires money, and they'll try to cover it up in a debate. It's important to distinguish between the two labels. Though we may not like it, having political opinions requires taking sides. Picking and choosing, favoring one sides befefits without that same sides subsequent costs is common today.See above about the difference between a ~public~ decision, and a ~private~ decision.Mainly, yes.I hope you are seeing from several of us here, (those of us against gay marriage) have reasons for being against it that have nothing to do with a personal dislike of gay people.Right. Society has indeed become more liberal over time. Legalizing gay marriage will be an additional liberal victory.As things are now, gays AND single, companionless people share the burden equally in providing the tax benefits etc. that married couples enjoy. If gay people are newly included in these benefits, then single companionless people will be burdened far more than they are now.If everyone has something, it's not very special. :) Their website looks pretty negative and liberal to me. In the spread of liberalism, I think it matters a LOT.Stripping them of the right to marry? They never had the right. There is a difference between taking something away, and not allowing it in the first place.

Well, I feel that polygamy is recognized well enough... I think it is very clear that polygamous marriage is not practical.If by "need" you mean need to live, then of course not. If you mean, do we need it to call ourselves morally just and good, then yes we do.I see; then perhaps I misread your post.Of course I would not fight to ban the right to engage in a polygamous relationship, and I feel that those relationships currently have the rights they need. They get the same marriage, the same benefits, etc. Though they may not have some blanket legal term that gives them no benefits and covers their situation, I again think that is impractical, unnecessary paperwork for the government.Well, I didn't mean physical abuse, as you read later. The abuse of natural bonds of love created by closeness in families is absolutely a moral argument. Just like my argument supporting same-sex marriage. I don't recall saying that moral arguments are wrong, though I did distinguish between religious beliefs and that which actually causes harm. Anyhow, this abuse of natural bonds thing is an argument designed toward the beliefs of those who oppose same-sex marriage. I meant that situation to be a more pleasant way to state that a father might raise his daughter to believe that she should marry him, and such a situation would be a manipulation of love and would certainly be morally wrong, but that argument isn't the strongest and might not only apply to incest. A stronger reason, and I think the reason most people oppose incest, is the tendency of incestual relationships to produce retarded children and children more prone to certain diseases. This is a situation that can actually be considered harmful, and it brings up a whole new debate over whether it is morally just to conceive a child who is at a greater risk of disease and mental retardation.I don't mean to demonize those relationships, though I do mean to say that they are part of something which could be considered harmful, while same-sex couples are not. I meant only to distinguish the two debates, not demonize people who are causing harm to no one.I discussed those reasons, and those reasons were not "it's creepy and weird". I also did not say that those things are morally wrong, I said that it may be a bad idea to give those people civil rights, but I intended to distinguish them from same-sex marriage. It seems to me that you are implying that allowing same-sex marriage absolutely must mean that polygamy and incest must be allowed. That isn't true. There are unanswered issues with both of those. I'm not talking about taking away their civil liberties, I'm talking about giving them as many civil liberties as is practical and which prevents harm.Polygamy is a personal choice; it is not mine. Incest may cause harm, and I oppose it only insomuch as it can be shown to cause harm. I am not an expert on the debates over polygamy and incest, but I believe I have listed sufficient evidence to suggest that it is absolutely not acceptable to claim that these things must be legalized simply because same-sex marriage is legalized. There is plenty of debate and discussion to be done on these issues.Yes, but what does this have to do with anything? I was simply stating that I can use religion as justification for allowing same-sex marriage more than he can use it as justification for disallowing it.Well... Good!You're right! I did not mean to make a case that a slippery slope will occur, I meant to make a case that it is more likely that a slippery slope will occur if same-sex marriage is kept illegal than if it is made legal. Furthermore, the slippery slope that occurs if it is kept illegal is far more dangerous. In truth, I doubt a slippery slope will happen in either case.Anyhow! If you wish to continue the debate that we should legalize incestual and polygamous marriage, let's put that in a seperate thread; this one is intended to be about same-sex marriage, though incest and polygamy are certainly interesting topics as well.Umm, also! You quoted wsm2506 a bunch of times but used my name instead of his, which makes it seem like I said a bunch of things that I did not actually say. I was hoping you could modify your post to account for this. I have bolded this just to make sure it isn't missed, not because it is a main point or because I'm angry or something.

Agreed. If your going to allow one sort of alternative marriage, I cannot see how you can justify banning other sorts (besides practical issues, and practical issues should not, philosophically if not practically, interfere with civil rights).Agreed, there are practical problems associated with polygamy. However, that does not negate that their relationship should be recognized in some manner. Perhaps the answer is the change marriage entirely, I don't know.Do we "need" homosexual marriage? There are those who wish to have polygamous marriage.I don't dislike polygamy.I am arguing that polygamy should be allowed, under the same reasoning that gay marriage is allowed.Practical problems are not a good justification to ban civil liberties, especially when the argument for gay marriage is not that it's "easy" but that it's "right". Whether or not polygamy is "easy" makes little difference in terms of if it's "right".Abuse is something that is fought against anyway.Children are not a pre-requisite of marriage. Homosexuals cannot have children at all, so the state of the children should not bar incestuous relationships. Also, we do not ban marriage between couples who may (even if it's a good chance) have disabled or mentally challenged children, incestuous or no. "Abuse of the natural bonds of love created by the closeness between families"? That sounds suspiciously like a moral argument against a certain relationship. What if I were to argue that homosexual relationships were an abuse of the natural bonds of love between opposite sexes?I don't dislike incest. I don't participate myself, but I see no reason why incestuous relationships should be demonized by those who are supposedly open-minded about relationships. They love each other, who are you to keep them apart? Regardless of whether or not they have children, or if those children are retarded, they have the right to love each other.Exactly! So, why is incest and polygamy wrong? Only because of the practical problems with implementing polygamy and what might happen with the children in incest? Are those valid reasons for not giving them civil liberties?I have no problem with incestuous relationships or polygamous relationships. It appears that you do.However, much of the opposition to homosexual marriage is based in religion is it not?Agreed. I don't believe the gov't should be in our personal lives any more than absolutely necessary.You misunderstand my stance. You believe I am arguing for polygamy and incest as a rhetorical device against homosexual marriage. I am not. I am sincerely arguing for polygamy and incestuous relationships based on the same arguments that you are using.I realize that I am a lot more liberal in personal matters than many liberals, but I do not think the gov't should be involved in our personal lives.Unfortunately, there are situations where you do not have the right to divorce. There was a case recently where a woman was not allowed to divorce because she was pregnant.I don't believe that particular slippery slope. Certainly it would restrict freedom, and be a step toward fascism. But "everyone will lose all their rights if this isn't legal!" is a textbook slippery slope fallacy.

It would be more difficult to argue for gay marriage, without first taking care of the issue of legality of gay relationships.Why do arguments for heterosexual love not justify polygamous love?And heterosexual relationships? If not, why not? How do you define "alternative union"? Could the same arguments not apply to heterosexual unions? Are you not using the fallacy of being too broad?There are religions which have it as their dogmatic law to marry gay and straight couples, but not brothers and sisters, or polygamous relationships. Do all non-religious marriages make other things more possible? It doesn't follow that other things become more possible if we allow gay marriage, or that other things become less possible if we don't allow gay marriage.

I'm misunderstanding. The issues are different because polygamous activity is illegal? Do you mean to say that if homosexual activity was illegal you would not argue for it?It is different, no denying that. Why do the arguments for homosexual love not justify polygamous love?Agreed, including polygamous and incestuous relationships.You made my point already. Any argument for an alternative union apply to other sorts of alternative unions.I would include that but a sheep cannot give consent. I would argue that it doesn't matter since animals should not have rights as humans do, but that requires more arguments than I'm willing to put forth at the moment.No, nor would I attempt to. I have no problem with gay rights or gay marriage, I have a problem with the inherent hypocrisy I see when gay activists argue that "the love is the same" and "we're people and we just want to love each other" and then blast other alternative marriage. What others do in the bedroom is none of your or my business, and who I marry is none of your business either. It doesn't affect you :)Because religion (for the sake of argument, say Catholics) bans any marriage besides between a man and a woman. There can be no slippery slope because there is no argument, only dogmatic laws. An argument can apply to different situations whether or not they are the authors intent, dogmatic law only applies to what the priests apply it to. The "not quite" was a bit of sarcasm.This is not a "slippery slope", this is a logical step. If you wish to argue for gay rights, realize that other things you may not agree with become a lot more possible.

My personal reasons are:1. My faith and belief in Jesus Christ and the Holy Bible which clearly states in both the Old and New Testament that it is wrong and God detests it.2. It's no very practical especially trying to justifying it by saying it's natural due to the fact that we wouldn't be here if everyone was homosexual.3. Although many men claim to condone or enjoy lesbian due to their perverse nature....I honestly don't find it appealing when you really come down to it. There's just something deep inside me that screams wrong, you may say it's due to my religious upbringing, but whatever it maybe I just don't agree with it.4. I've never seen a homosexual relationship work out with children involved, the ones I do know commited suicided, or other drastic actions or behavioral problems as a result from homosexual parents. I know there are heterosexual parents who don't do the best as well, but I'm saying in general.These are my reasons, call me a bigot, or call me whatever, but I will never change my point of view as this subject.

It has not been proven that it would either. I have presented a report from the CBO saying it would present an overall fiscal benefit to the federal government to the tune of +~$1 Billion per year over the next ten years.

All I see is circular arguments.At least I honsetly stated that I do not subscribe to any of the absurd statements I itterated.

No, only the slippery slope of the leftist position on gay marriage - expanding government involvement in marriage. The libertarian position (i.e. the privatization of marriage) has no such slippery slopes.

I was using the collective "you", certainly not "you" personally.All of our Constitution is based religious-based morality and principles. It came with the times and authors. As for putting something "morally evil" into our laws, many would argue that allowing gay marriage would do just that. i guess it just depends on which side of the issue you're on.But if those in monogomous relationships also have the opportunity to "bestow their marriage benefits" to more than one partner, where is the inequity? It is no different than arguing in favor of same sex OR opposite sex marriage. As long as we offer the option to all, where's the inequity? It doesn't mean that everyone has to take advantage of that benefit for it to be equitable. Where in the US is polygamy legal? I'm not aware of any state. Even Utah banned polygamy.What non-morality-based argument is there for banning incest? I'm not aware of any. But what if a practice goes against the beliefs of most religions? Do they have to conform to a new "immoral" law? What means to redress their grievances exists?No, I wouldn't agree that they were being discriminated against based on their sexual orientation. They are being excluded from marriage based on their sex, not their sexual orientation. Gays can marry members of the opposite sex, so they aren't being discriminated against based on their orientation.There's no taking away of anybody's rights. You never had the right to marry someone of the same sex in the first place.As many gays point out, marriage is a contractual agreement between partners. If I enter into a lifelong business contract with you, I have to have a reason to void that contract, don't I? So why is it unreasonable to expect that a marriage contract is at least as legally binding as a business agreement?....More tomorrow....

I am not attempting to undo fundamental Christian beliefs, I am attempting to give people equality under the law regardless of their beliefs. As I have argued in my previous posts, I do believe that if anyone is trying to undo their opponents beliefs, it is the opponents of same-sex marriage attempting to undo the beliefs of the supporters by illegalizing the practice of a certain belief. If you imply that I am offending people by stating that it is immoral to oppose same-sex marriage, well that may be, and I do not doubt it to be the case. However, it is necessary for my argument to say such things, just as it is necessary for your argument to offend gay people. In what I said there, I was not saying that offending gay people is a reason we should allow same-sex marriage, I was saying that it is understandable why people seem hostile to you.I did not mean to imply that the issue is cut and dry for you, only that it is cut and dry for me. Whether some of our laws are based on religion, our Constitution is not, and most who founded our country believed in a freedom of religion unseen in past countries. Regardless, the religious beliefs of the majority are not and will never be an excuse to put something morally evil into our laws. From our debates in previous posts, I have not seen any benefit of banning same-sex marriage at all, yet I have seen countless benefits. Banning something that would help people and harm no one is evil, as far as I am concerned.Hmm, well perhaps I didn't explain myself very well. The argument I intended to present could only be used to support same-sex marriage, not argue against it. Let me re-explain myself: If we legalize same-sex marriage, everyone will have an equal right to bestow their marriage benefits on one other person that they fall in love with. If we legalize polygamy, those in polygamous relationships will be able to bestow their marriage benefits on an unlimited number of people while those in monogamous relationships will only be allowed to bestow those benefits on a single person. That is the inequality I spoke of. Carrying that logic to the same-sex marriage debate, it could easily be said that those in opposite-sex relationships are able to bestow marriage benefits on one person they fall in love with, while those in same-sex relationships are able to bestow marriage benefits upon no one. My logic is intended to reveal an inequality that can only be rectified by allowing same-sex marriage and disallowing polygamous marriage.As I have stated above, polygamous relationships are already recognized and are already equal under the law to those of monogamous couples. Their marriage is recognized, and they can bestow their marriage benefits upon one other person. Equality is not discrimination.So do I. As with same-sex marriage, I believe that many of the arguments used to support gay rights can be used to support incestual marriage. However, as I stated regarding polygamy, there are reasons for banning incestual marriage that do not exist for same-sex marriage. I explain those.I can do so because freedom of religion is a value worth holding. As a nation, we do not take away the rights from one religion because of the beliefs of another. We do not strip the right of one religion to build churches because it is not the majority just as we do not strip the right of one religion to marry because they are not the majority. We especially do not do so when allowing equality in religion would not hurt our nation; it would help it.You wouldn't agree that people are being discriminated against based on sexual orientation? As I have said in the past: I am not arguing for a new right that only affects homosexuals, I am arguing to give everyone the right to marry people of the same-sex. I call this "rights of the minority" because as we all know, it is only those whose sexual orientation is in the minority who would take advantage of this new right.It will work; that should be all the more evidence of the slippery slope we're headed toward. States are ready to take away the rights of people; the federal government is ready to take away those rights. They've already done so. If they can take away the right to adultry, then they will. If the government can take away any right, it will. All we need to do is give them a reason, give them a sign that the people aren't going to rise up if the government takes away their freedom, and suddenly our freedom will be gone. Or at least that slippery slope is a far more likely and more dangerous one than the polygamy and incest one.You're right, it wasn't. But each step we take toward restricting freedom makes the next step toward it seem less far fetched. Is it really the government's business why you got divorced any more than it is the government's business why you believe in your religion, why you chose the job you did, why you eat the food you do, or why you do anything else? Your life is your own, not the government's to control. Each step we take away from that is a step away from freedom.You're absolutely right. Hrm, my point isn't getting across. I specifically used examples that don't seem far-fetched so that you would understand how the government might use their momentum to actually restrict more freedoms. Then I implied that if they are going to restrict those freedoms, how far might they go? Restricting freedom is a bad place to be.How about the Ammendment that guarantees equal protection under the law? But regardless of that, does it really matter whether there is an Ammendment? Does that make it any less wrong? Does that make it any less likely that the government will try to overrule the Ammendment? Think about religious freedom and gun control. Also, think of all the freedoms that aren't protected by the Constitution that you might lose.If you're a gun-rights advocate, then maybe you know where I'm coming from. The government will restrict your right to guns just as readily as it will restrict your right to anything if you give it the chance. The majority will vote against gun-owners in Michigan, if you give them the chance. That doesn't make it right.Despite all I've said, I don't really think we'll end up heading down a slippery slope no matter which side wins out. But I do think that if a slippery slope does begin, it will begin by restricting same-sex marriage and it will continue by restricting more of our freedoms. I don't think we're in a slippery slope yet. What slope are you referring to?

Male/female is the "natural" state for heterosexuals. Why do you hide behind "natural" when all you mean is most common?It's a childish argument. Pointing to anachronisms in the law does not invalidate the general principle that U.S. law views men and women as equals.No, I said that limiting it to two individuals would treat all citizens fairly. Limiting it to 3 would also treat all citizens equally, but that's not likely to come about.The differences are two: one, the SCOTUS has already acknowledged that the marriage available must be meaningful to the particpants. Also, under current law, CitizenA can marry CitizenB but not CitizenC. CitizenB can marry CitizenC. That is discrimination between supposedly equal citizens.I'm not really sure why we even have this argument. In every case except one, when this issue has been brought before a state Supreme Court, the discriminatory situation has been ruled to be unconstitutional. The current occupant of the WH and the Congressional leadership all agree that under an unamended Constitution, same-sex marriage will be declard constitutional at some point. YOU may not see the argument as valid, but those whose opinion counts have all but conceded the point.They might use some quite convincing arguments, but they wouldn't be making the point I am.A perfectly reasonable proposal, but not the same as the discussion of same-sex marriage.Neither, I prefer my laws to be reality-based.Disproven? Diminished in likelihood, but not "disproven". Actually, it's the danger of ticking off a largely misinformed majority seriously misled and manipulated by an XXX of a president. Face it, anyone who voted for him based on this issue was used.

I'd like to see some references for same-sex marriage being generally practiced and not just "tolerated". Everything I find seems to indicate that male/female unions are the natural state from antiquity to the present.and I disagree. The legal system still has many laws that favor a woman over a man, especially in child custody law, but extending into other areas, such as real estate. For example, in Michigan, a married man cannot buy a house without his wife's consent, but it is legal for the wife to buy a house without the husband's consent. I found out that one the hard way when my wife and I were relocating from PA 20 years ago. I had to fly her out here, last minute, to sign papers before I could close on a house.Here's where your logic is flawed. You assert that it is legal to define marriage arbitrarily as "two parties", but illegal to define it as 3 or more. This is no different that our current situation. The law currently defines marriage as one man, one woman. It is argued by you and others, that this is discriminatory against same sex partners. Polygamists would argue that the number 2 is just as arbitrary as saying that only one man and one woman constitutes marriage and use your same argument. All citizens would be treated equally. All citizens could marry X other citizens. [quote]The other is whether the restriction on ALL is rational and reasonable.

See, but this isn't really true. If you looked at the morals presented in the Bible, you'd see a set of morals based on duty to one's family, superiors, and nation. You'd see a spelled-out list of rules that you must follow. The Constitution is not based on duty and reliance upon others, it is based on individualism, making as much money as you can, and living freely. The Bible says nothing about free speech, the right to bear arms, freedom of religion, trials of your peers, etc. I don't know that even one moral held in esteem by the Bible made it into the Constitution or even the Bill of Rights.The inequity is visible only when you consider that the goal of marriage is to give these benefits across families. This sort of relationship would give one family the ability to choose from the best of many health care programs, for example, while another family would only be able to choose from the best of two. That sort of inequality wouldn't even be a huge deal, if not for the impracticality of the whole situation. The fact that it is impractical to offer the benefits of marriage across many people is really far more important than the inequality, since the inequality would only be helping some families while hurting no others.Furthermore, why are you arguing this? Are you actually in support of allowing polygamous marriage? If not, why are you not?Well, polygamous marriage is not recognized anywhere, however I don't believe you can be thrown in jail for having a polygamous relationship or polygamous family anywhere. If I'm wrong about that, you just let me know.I must be too tired... I don't really understand what you're asking here. Aren't all of these arguments moral?No means to redress their grievenances exists. If most religions believe that we must cause harm to those who are different, those religions simply have to give in and accept laws that do not cause harm. It is unacceptable for anyone of those religions to say, "Well, most of us don't want this minority group to have the same rights we do. If you're going to give them the same rights I have, you'd better give us something in return."Anyhow, remember that I'm trying to convince you that the majority SHOULD accept same-sex marriage, even though they might not do so right now.Oh, I don't know about that... I'd say that the laws we are banning specifically target people of a certain sexual orientation, not people of a certain sex. Is it not true that homosexual and bisexual people are the ones who are unable to participate in marriage because same-sex marriage is disallowed? I'd say this has everything to do with sexual orientation, even though it is technically the sex of the two individuals involved that determines whether or not they can get married.Argh; arguments like this are frustrating, I must admit. Would it have been more acceptable if I said "keeping from" instead of taking away? Nitpicking my choice of words does not invalidate my argument in this case, and you are already the second person to have pointed this out.The debate is simply over whether this contractual agreement includes a divorce clause or not. If the contractual agreement says, "I pledge my life, unless we decide to get divorced," then it is exactly as legally binding as a business contract. Our government could decide that if you don't enter into a legal agreement that includes no divorce, then you don't get marriage benefits. That's not something I think should happen.Excellent. I feel like I'm just typing away randomly today because there have been a lot of posts I wanted to respond to. Hopefully tomorrow will be slower.

I think you are right about this, and I think gay pride people want very much to portray their movement as natural, because they know that the stigma of it being 'unnatural' is not helpful to their movement. - Gay relationships are downright rare, compared to straight ones. Probably 3%, although gay pride people always go with the higher percentages up to about 7% tops. I've heard some percentages at 1-2%. - Gay unions cannot, by natural biology, concieve children as a couple. Trying to get away from this reality by calling it 'irrelevant' or bringing up red herrings such as hetero couples who can't conceive due to problems doesn't change reality. Even if straight couples can't bear children because of problems, gay couples' bodies are physically unable to do so with each other as a couple at all to begin with.I think a much better tactic than denying the reality that gay unions are not society's natural way would be to simply go with the fact that it's not natural and still argue these so-called 'rights' regardless. It looks pretty silly to call a duck an elephant over and over, when it waddles and quacks.

I'd like to see some references for same-sex marriage being generally practiced and not just "tolerated". Everything I find seems to indicate that male/female unions are the natural state from antiquity to the present.and I disagree. The legal system still has many laws that favor a woman over a man, especially in child custody law, but extending into other areas, such as real estate. For example, in Michigan, a married man cannot buy a house without his wife's consent, but it is legal for the wife to buy a house without the husband's consent. I found out that one the hard way when my wife and I were relocating from PA 20 years ago. I had to fly her out here, last minute, to sign papers before I could close on a house.Here's where your logic is flawed. You assert that it is legal to define marriage arbitrarily as "two parties", but illegal to define it as 3 or more. This is no different that our current situation. The law currently defines marriage as one man, one woman. It is argued by you and others, that this is discriminatory against same sex partners. Polygamists would argue that the number 2 is just as arbitrary as saying that only one man and one woman constitutes marriage and use your same argument. All citizens would be treated equally. All citizens could marry X other citizens. [quote]The other is whether the restriction on ALL is rational and reasonable.

I'm not infavor of incest, but let me argue on it's behalf the same way you would argue for homosexuality to make a point here . . .'Incest harms no one if you use protection. The harm comes from not using protection--it's not the relationship itself.' 'There is nothing in the Constitution than prevents it.''The 14th Amendment should apply.''Who are you to descriminate against someone if the want to marry their sister?'You can use the exact same arguements to argue for one as the the other. And the harm of birth defects is just as preventable with incestuous relationships as HIV is preventable in gay ones.Again, I don't argue these to promote incest (I don't approve of it) but it makes a good analogy to gay marriage.

The report you cite (without and Internet link to it) dated in 2003 addressescost only, of domestic partner benefits, not same-sex marriage. It also says:The report I cited (with an Internet link) by the CBO dated in 2004 addresses both the cost and and revenues involved in the legalization of same-sex marriage (as opposed to the issue of domestic partner benefits you cite) and estimates a net benefit to the federal government of aprox. + $1 billion for each year over the next 10 years.

Marriage is a legal contract (get it???) between 2 (not some # >2, get it???) consenting (get it???) adults (get it????).Minors (get it???)cannot enter into legal contracts, and I agree with that stipulation.Animals (get it???) cannot enter into legal contracts, and I most DEFINATELY agree with that.

The only place the "one man, one woman" stipulation exists (under law) is in the DOMA, and even the current administration concedes the DOMA is probably unconstitutional. They have even gone so far as to introduce H.R. 3313 which would bar any federal court from ruling on the constitutionality of the DOMA.

If you want to argue the sanctity of the number "2", then you also have to argue the sanctity of the "1 male/1 female" requirement as well. My point is that what you are asking us to do is change the definition of marriage because the opposite sex requirement is arbitrary and discriminatory, IYO. Fine. The next step is to change the definition of marriage because the number 2 is arbitrary and discriminatory, as well. The same logic applies.

THAT IS WRONG!! Read on...Most adults who sexually molest children are considered to have pedophilia, a mental disorder described in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). An adult who engages in sexual activity with a child is performing a criminal and immoral act that never can be considered normal or socially acceptable behavior.Pedophilia is categorized in the DSM-IV as one of several paraphiliac mental disorders. The essential features of a paraphilia (sexual deviation) are recurrent, intense, sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges or behaviors that generally involve nonhuman subjects, the suffering or humiliation of oneself or one's partner, or children or other nonconsenting persons.http://www.medem.com/MedLB/article_d...LC&sub_cat=355

Come on, don't tell me you don't know about the incidents I'm talking about. Congress got involved, for goodness' sakes. The APA's credibility has never been the same since.There is no reason you should not know about this; it was a big deal at the time. If you really don't know about this, start by reading the report itself from the APA Bulletin:A Meta-Analytic Examination of Assumed Properties of Child Sexual Abuse Using College Samples (Abstract: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/q...&dopt=Abstract)There was a big uproar about all this.Also, in 1994, the APA manual "1994 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV" removed pedophilia as a sexula perversion (sound familiar?) unlile previous editions.

Because much of the public attends CHURCH, a place where a lot of marrying takes place. After gay marriage is legalized, churches will be in the spotlight.

"Now that you admit that you've been WRONG about us all these years, what are you going to do to appease us?"Moveon.org is just a strong as ever, probably growing, and they were formed because of Bill Clinton's sex controversy - a thing of the past.

Republicans generally oppose it - Democrat's generally favor it.In addition to the church thing I described above, there is also the issue of what people want their very young children exposed too, whenever they go out in public. I know my saying that really sets some gay people off, but it's not really me saying it. I don't much care since I don't have children. But I know that's the way a lot of people who have children feel.There you go with that "taking away" phrase again. You can't take away something that never existed.It wouldn't be too hard for anyone to go through this thread alone and count up the clear personal insults, and determine which side insults more. I'm not going to bother to take the time, but I think I know which side would win the personal insults, by about 5 to 1. You're the exception though - if you weren't here I wouldn't be involved in this thread. It's a bad thing to me when they attack not only those who oppose gay marriage, but the entire Republican party. The Democratic party hasn't won enough major elections lately to be very comfortable. They're working on some complicated strategies behind closed doors these days. Gay marriage is very political.There is a difference. If we seek to take something away, we have experience in how that something affected society in the past, and should have to clearly show why society would be better off without it. Redefining marriage would be a blind experiment. VERY difficult to clearly show how society would react to it - be better off WITH it. And more difficult to reverse if it turns out to be a bad decision.With today's war on terror, and the global economy what it is, I think it's a bad time for social experiments.

But if gays are allowed to make the decision of who they spend time with, work with, live with, etc; why can they not make the decision about who they marry? Why is it up to the public at large to determine that? Why can they not raise their children as they see fit? Why does the public at large get involved? Why can they not take and give a good home to a child from adoption? Why must the public interject its opinion? The entire issue we are discussing involves the public interjecting its opinion of marriage upon every individual couple. It is tyranny of the majority in every sense.Regardless, I do not believe there is any indication that the public knows anything about educating a child. The public could not put together a list of good courses for children to take; they simply aren't informed enough about school classes. Most probably couldn't even name more classes than those their child is immediately taking. Yet we're going to leave all of the decisions about how the school is run up to the 51% of public opinion that was aroused by some story in the news? In that case, might we not get rid of the school board alltogether?But as we have seen, supporting same-sex marriage saves money. Allowing abortion wouldn't require money, banning guns wouldn't require money (though it would hurt businesses), allowing stem-cell research wouldn't cost money, keeping religion out of schools and public buildings would save money... The only really socially liberal thing I can think of that might cost money is enforcing environmental regulations.Anyhow, I guess all I meant when I spoke about same-sex marriage and liberalism is that same-sex marriage is based in both liberal and conservative principles; though even if it were not, simply claiming something is "liberal" isn't enough explanation for why you disagree with it.Yes, but there is no reason to suggest that marriage is any of the public's business. For example, if the public didn't want any brunettes marrying blondes, should the public be allowed to take away that right? What business is it of the public to take away that right? This is a private decision in every way I can think of, which aligns it perfectly with conservatism.Well that's not a good reason! Taking away rights from an entire group of people because a lot of them are liberal is not justice; it is tyranny. It is an admission that you are taking away rights with someone simply because they have a different political viewpoint. It what dictators do to the people who disagree with them.Well, it was you who claimed that gay people were hatefully pointing fingers; I was only saying that it would be no more valid for me to claim that opponents of same-sex marriage are hatefully pointing fingers.Well, I would argue that it would be a victory for everyone, but as I've said, even if it could be shown that this is not a conservative value, simply being a victory for liberals does not indicate that it is a bad thing. In previous posts, I've shown harm coming to many people through banning same-sex marriage, while benefit coming to many through allowing it. Liberal or not, it is right.Not at all; those people are perfectly entitled to get married to anyone they wish, should they choose to do so. The important part is that they are free to marry any person of their choosing, not a set of government-mandated people. As for tax burdens, well I don't recall mentioning that. The point of marriage is to reduce the tax burden on married couples, if I'm not mistaken. It is acceptable to argue that married couples should not recieve this additional tax relief because that puts the burden on unmarried people, but that is a different topic. All I'm arguing is that whatever rights we give to opposite-sex couples, we should give to same-sex couples as well.Well, if we restrict some people from having what we have, then what we have may be special, but we're still bad people.Well, take a look at the website of a real gay rights group, then: http://www.hrc.org/Regardless, I fail to see how a gay rights group delivering a negative message against that which they see as wrong is a bad thing. You're doing it right now, I'm doing it right now... That's the way debating works.Is there a big difference? I don't really see it. In a sense, we are still stripping people of the right to marry, we've just always been doing it. We are still just as wrong; well, more wrong since we've been doing it for a longer period of time.

If a law is based on two primary attributes and you declare one arbitrary, what stops others from declaring the second one is arbitrary as well? What is fundamental about the number 2, that isn't fundamental about 1 man/1 woman?The logic is there whether you care to admit it or not.If you redefine marriage as "a union" without specifying gender, then who's to stop us from defining "union" as 2 or more consenting parties?

Only if your "logic" is a false dilemma fallacy.

Maybe it's a question of symantics. To most Christians, marriage is not only a legal contract, but a spiritual one. The spiritual marriage is the union of a husband and wife as taught by most churches. In the church, there is no "right" to marry someone of the same sex.

EXACTLY! It is my INDIVIDUAL decision to marry someone of the same sex. What business is it of yours? If single heterosexuals decides to remain single, that is their INDIVIDUAL decision, not mine, not yours. If homosexuals decision to remain single, that is their INDIVIDUAL decision. INDIVIDUAL heterosexual people have the right to marry someone of the opposite sex. What YOU promote is denying INDIVIDUAL homosexuals the right to marry someone of the same sex. I fail to see any logic in that.I thought we had already put the fallacy of gay marriage costing society $$ to bed. Do we need to reitterate the aprox. +$1 Billion per year over the next ten years to the federal government's bottom line?And I believe in Peter Pan, the tooth fairy, the Easter Bunny, and Santa Claus too.And probably will continue to be, when people start understanding the illogic of their prejudices. You need to catch up with the times.See reference above to aprox, +$1 Billion to the fed bottom line per year.I think that is really the point of your entire argument. You feel "special" and don't want to give that up.

How can you deny a right that never existed? emoticonXConfused

I think it is more asking them to not deny other people rights based on their presonal moral or religious views.

To some Christians, marriage is a sacrament available to opposite-sex couples and same-sex couples. To some Christians, marriage can be polygamous. Do you want the government to decide which Christians are "legitimate"?First of all, there is no longer a single "the church". (not that there ever was)That holds true for the churches that accept same-sex marriage. Guess you have to put up with them as much as I have to put up with those which don't.Sucks, doesn't it?

And that's probably part of the reason they do it--they know if they are rude enough they won't have to deal with you. I think in reality gay lobbyists here and elsewhere really don't want there to be a debate. They'd just as soon these forums not have to exist, and when they do as in this case, they sometimes don't seem to understand that it IS a debate forum and there will be other views, because they take it so personally. I understand they might take it personally, but if they go into a debate forum they should know that's the way it is. I think some are honestly in denial that a national debate is taking place and that many people don't see things their way.Right now the Republican party is more "big tent" than the Democratic one. They allow people such as Schwarzenegger and Giulianni who are staunchly pro-choice, pro-stem cell research, etc. But do you know anyone who is welcome among Democrats who is staunchly pro-life? Or against gay rights? I think that is one reason the Republican party is becoming so much more successful in recent years--they've become the center. I don't agree with people like Schwarzenegger, but I'm glad to be in a party that can co-exist with other views. I can debate and disagree, but I still respect diversity.

Being of the right race or the right religion were also once considered primary attributes, as well as the number 2. The fact that it was a union for life, without legal divorce was also an attribute, along with the number 2. The number 2 applies to other types of couples as well, not just to gay couples. There is no logic here. You are suggesting we only have two choices, either accept the sex based definition, or else accept polygamy. In reality there are more than those two choices. It's like saying either accept the race based definition, or else accept polygamy.You may argue that sex is a more important than race. That's your opinion. It doesn't make this false dilemma logical. It doesn't make the slippery slope logical.

I fail to see where the "Christian" ideology trumps civil rights. As has been stated many times before by myself and others, legalization of same-sex marriage in no way infringes on your right to believe in and practice you chosen religion. It in no way would force any religion to either perform or accept same-sex marriage within their religion. You simple have no grievance there. And so would same-sex marriages.Which "the church"? Yours? Mine? I thought there was more than one church. Did the Reformation never really happen? Why did it happen? What does "the church" have to say about the ordination of women? If there is no "right" to same-sex marriage within "the church" how do you explaing the many "Christian" denominations that already perform such "rites"?Maybe it is just me, but I prefer a study done by the CBO on the fiscal effects (costs and revenues both) of "same-sex marriage" over either a study of the effects of the cost only, of granting "domestic partnership benefits" to federal employees or someone's personal opinion who repeatedly shows extreme prejudice against same-sex marriage. emoticonXRolleyes And really, isn't that what it is all about?

Will the same not happen if the opposite side wins? The decision to recognize same-sex marriage is that of the church. The decision on who an individual should be allowed to marry must be that of the individual. Simply because some people might ask churches to change their ways does not change an individual decision into one that anyone in society can shove themselves into.But do you think the same couldn't be said about those groups that oppose same-sex marriage? It certainly could. Remember that banning same-sex marriage won't make those groups go away either. It is best to give equal rights to people and oppose them when they go to far. It is wrong to oppose equality assuming that people will go too far if they are given it.I don't doubt that many individuals are intelligent and informed on education, in fact that is exactly what I was arguing. I do doubt that the majority of society is intelligent. Try educating a child doing only what the majority of society thinks is best. It'll go in completely opposite directions, its opinions will change with the wind, and its conclusions will be meaningless. I do believe that a well-informed individual is often much more capable of making good decisions; home-education is a fine example of this.Well, government studies which suggested that same-sex marriage would save one billion dollars in taxpayer money each year. I don't know what more evidence you need than that. Furthermore, I don't see how gay rights groups continuing with their agenda will cause any more financial burden than anti-gay rights groups continuing with their own agenda.I'd disagree. I doubt many liberals support publically-funded abortion. You may meet some extreme person who does, but you are just as likely to meet an extreme conservative who supports an equal number of absurd things. Generalizing such a position across liberalism is misrepresentative.Agreed about it being another debate, however I think what you are referring to social programs is not what people mean when they call themselves "socially liberal". You'll see what I mean below.True, but Republicans are a party while "conservative" is a political belief system. Lots of people consider themselves conservative but not Republican.Well, if you get angry about gay people forcing their views upon churches, then that's great. But that isn't happening here. You are advocating society forcing its views upon the individual. If the church situation happens, feel free to oppose it. But that isn't what is happening, and that isn't what the debate is. You are in support of society forcing its views of who one should marry upon the individual. Don't do exactly what it is that you hate so much; don't allow people to force their views upon others.As for what their children are exposed to, I can understand that, except that allowing same-sex marriage doesn't really expose children to anything. Of course I could use the same argument against opposite-sex marriage, except that opposite-sex marriage really doesn't expose children to anything. Without marriage, there will still be public kissing and holding hands by gay people, just as the same will be true of straight people. We are speaking only about legal recognition and the benefits that come with it.I don't know, I think you can. I think if someone reaches for something that he does not yet have, and you keep him from getting it, you are bascially taking that thing away from him. But if it pleases you, replace "taking away" with "keeping away" or whatever other phrase you believe is more correct. I don't really care; my argument is exactly the same. Nitpicking my word choice does not affect that in this situation.I'm not so sure about that, because as I've said before, every argument against same-sex marriage is taken as a person insult by a gay person, and reasonably so. It all depends on your point of view. Beyond that, I'm not certain how representative these forums are in the first place. I am an extremely strong advocate of same-sex marriage, for example. Have I delivered any insults? I hope not, and I will readily apologize for any that I have.I wouldn't worry much about the comfort level of the Democratic party, but I would worry about throwing stones in glass houses. Do not conservative radio show hosts who attack the entire Democratic party each time they come across a single issue they disagree with? How many other conservatives do this, do you think? Even you have made some general statements about what "liberals" want and what they believe in. You said that liberals want the government to pay for abortion, which is not very representative, for example. I'm sure I've done the same thing at times. We are all guilty of this; we just don't tend to notice it when someone we agree with is saying it.I do believe that if we are to remove something, we must show how society would be better off without it, and I believe the same holds true today. I believe that long ago we removed something without offering that evidence, and I believe that it's time to come clean and admit that we removed something inappropriately.You're right, same-sex marriage has not had a true test anywhere yet, but if we are never going to give it that test, then we are doomed to refuse equality and happiness to people any time we've never tried it in the past. It is our responsibility as a society to try to achieve equality, freedom, and happiness for everyone, and we must not pass up the opportunity to do so simply because it has not been tried before.Also, we aren't exactly going in blindly here. I've offered many benefits to both gays and society that same-sex marriage will bring with it, and any drawbacks to it seem improbable and avoidable. We are going into this never having tried it before but having strong theory backing up our decision.It may be best to try these things in a great economy, but I'd rather implement them as soon as possible so that as few people are not denied these rights as possible. But besides that, I would not argue with pushing off the date of legalizing same-sex marriage provided that it is agreed that it is morally correct to do so as soon as we reenter prosperous times.

But I know that's the way a lot of people who have children feel.There you go with that "taking away" phrase again. You can't take away something that never existed.It wouldn't be too hard for anyone to go through this thread alone and count up the clear personal insults, and determine which side insults more. I'm not going to bother to take the time, but I think I know which side would win the personal insults, by about 5 to 1. You're the exception though - if you weren't here I wouldn't be involved in this thread. It's a bad thing to me when they attack not only those who oppose gay marriage, but the entire Republican party. The Democratic party hasn't won enough major elections lately to be very comfortable. They're working on some complicated strategies behind closed doors these days. Gay marriage is very political.There is a difference. If we seek to take something away, we have experience in how that something affected society in the past, and should have to clearly show why society would be better off without it. Redefining marriage would be a blind experiment. VERY difficult to clearly show how society would react to it - be better off WITH it. And more difficult to reverse if it turns out to be a bad decision.With today's war on terror, and the global economy what it is, I think it's a bad time for social experiments.

No, not "reasonably" so. At least not in a forum designed and set up for the very purpose of debating the issue. That is what this forum is here for. If a person comes to debate, but can't debate a certain topic without getting offended as a rule by "every" argument, it's probably not to anyone's benefit for them to be here. Don't you think?Good point, and in fact you have been the most civil person here that I've seen, perhaps on both sides of the issue. On this I agree with JP, and I thank you for that.

Will the same not happen if the opposite side wins? The decision to recognize same-sex marriage is that of the church. The decision on who an individual should be allowed to marry must be that of the individual. Simply because some people might ask churches to change their ways does not change an individual decision into one that anyone in society can shove themselves into.But do you think the same couldn't be said about those groups that oppose same-sex marriage? It certainly could. Remember that banning same-sex marriage won't make those groups go away either. It is best to give equal rights to people and oppose them when they go to far. It is wrong to oppose equality assuming that people will go too far if they are given it.I don't doubt that many individuals are intelligent and informed on education, in fact that is exactly what I was arguing. I do doubt that the majority of society is intelligent. Try educating a child doing only what the majority of society thinks is best. It'll go in completely opposite directions, its opinions will change with the wind, and its conclusions will be meaningless. I do believe that a well-informed individual is often much more capable of making good decisions; home-education is a fine example of this.Well, government studies which suggested that same-sex marriage would save one billion dollars in taxpayer money each year. I don't know what more evidence you need than that. Furthermore, I don't see how gay rights groups continuing with their agenda will cause any more financial burden than anti-gay rights groups continuing with their own agenda.I'd disagree. I doubt many liberals support publically-funded abortion. You may meet some extreme person who does, but you are just as likely to meet an extreme conservative who supports an equal number of absurd things. Generalizing such a position across liberalism is misrepresentative.Agreed about it being another debate, however I think what you are referring to social programs is not what people mean when they call themselves "socially liberal". You'll see what I mean below.True, but Republicans are a party while "conservative" is a political belief system. Lots of people consider themselves conservative but not Republican.Well, if you get angry about gay people forcing their views upon churches, then that's great. But that isn't happening here. You are advocating society forcing its views upon the individual. If the church situation happens, feel free to oppose it. But that isn't what is happening, and that isn't what the debate is. You are in support of society forcing its views of who one should marry upon the individual. Don't do exactly what it is that you hate so much; don't allow people to force their views upon others.As for what their children are exposed to, I can understand that, except that allowing same-sex marriage doesn't really expose children to anything. Of course I could use the same argument against opposite-sex marriage, except that opposite-sex marriage really doesn't expose children to anything. Without marriage, there will still be public kissing and holding hands by gay people, just as the same will be true of straight people. We are speaking only about legal recognition and the benefits that come with it.I don't know, I think you can. I think if someone reaches for something that he does not yet have, and you keep him from getting it, you are bascially taking that thing away from him. But if it pleases you, replace "taking away" with "keeping away" or whatever other phrase you believe is more correct. I don't really care; my argument is exactly the same. Nitpicking my word choice does not affect that in this situation.I'm not so sure about that, because as I've said before, every argument against same-sex marriage is taken as a person insult by a gay person, and reasonably so. It all depends on your point of view. Beyond that, I'm not certain how representative these forums are in the first place. I am an extremely strong advocate of same-sex marriage, for example. Have I delivered any insults? I hope not, and I will readily apologize for any that I have.I wouldn't worry much about the comfort level of the Democratic party, but I would worry about throwing stones in glass houses. Do not conservative radio show hosts who attack the entire Democratic party each time they come across a single issue they disagree with? How many other conservatives do this, do you think? Even you have made some general statements about what "liberals" want and what they believe in. You said that liberals want the government to pay for abortion, which is not very representative, for example. I'm sure I've done the same thing at times. We are all guilty of this; we just don't tend to notice it when someone we agree with is saying it.I do believe that if we are to remove something, we must show how society would be better off without it, and I believe the same holds true today. I believe that long ago we removed something without offering that evidence, and I believe that it's time to come clean and admit that we removed something inappropriately.You're right, same-sex marriage has not had a true test anywhere yet, but if we are never going to give it that test, then we are doomed to refuse equality and happiness to people any time we've never tried it in the past. It is our responsibility as a society to try to achieve equality, freedom, and happiness for everyone, and we must not pass up the opportunity to do so simply because it has not been tried before.Also, we aren't exactly going in blindly here. I've offered many benefits to both gays and society that same-sex marriage will bring with it, and any drawbacks to it seem improbable and avoidable. We are going into this never having tried it before but having strong theory backing up our decision.It may be best to try these things in a great economy, but I'd rather implement them as soon as possible so that as few people are not denied these rights as possible. But besides that, I would not argue with pushing off the date of legalizing same-sex marriage provided that it is agreed that it is morally correct to do so as soon as we reenter prosperous times.

Well, now that you put it like that, I do agree that it isn't reasonable. Knowing what the arguments against same-sex marriage are, it is only reasonable to expect those coming in. However, I think I can still see where they are coming from. When one is finds him or herself in a position of inequality, when one is homosexual or bisexual, it is difficult to avoid these sorts of arguments, and it is difficult to not feel insulted by them. Coming to these forums is seeking out these arguments, in a sense. But I don't think they a lot of gay and bisexual people come to these forums with the intention of speaking with civility until the debate is resolved, they come out of the feeling that they have to defend themselves. They see these forums and realize what people are saying there. They realize that some person is talking about taking away their rights, and they join out of a sort of self defense. Then they see people saying the same things that they've found so insulting all of their lives, and they act out of a hope that showing such disgust toward an idea through personal insults will help people understand just how outrageous they find it.I realize this doesn't make it okay to act without civility, and I realize that it probably isn't convincing anyone, but I think it is something that most people would do, if put in the same situation. Even in general, perhaps the more important something is to someone, the more frustrated he or she gets when people disagree.Thanks, but there are many civil people here. I avoid words that I think might sound harsh, which could make me seem more civil than the next person, but maybe I'm not really any more civil than someone who simply does not deliver personal insults.

I am not offended by "every" argument or even by anyone's personal opinion. What offends me is those who pose arguments with nothing to back up their reasoning behind their argument, and in some cases, expect another to disprove that argument. It offends me to have someone express a personal opinion as fact. It offends me for someone to intentionally spread malicious misinformation, be it in jest or otherwise. You see, it is MY rights that are being denied, not theirs. Perhaps if their rights (not necessarily over marriage) were being denied, they might get offended too.

I regret having to bring up the subject again, but I ran across something in the news that may shed some light on who is "responsible" for NAMBLA and just how much.Some would argue that the presence of a man articulating his views at a meeting or two in 1978 taints the entire gay-rights movement. Others might argue that allowing that man to act on those views repeatedly over the course of a couple decades would be a more substantial affiliation.Well, here's that man:http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn...2005Jan17.htmlEx-Priest's Trial Begins On Child Rape, AssaultAnd here's a search on his connection to NAMBLAhttp://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q...=Google+Search

There is definitely reason to believe that early on, the gay rights movement and the pedophile movement were not so unrelated as you portray. As the "man/boy" idea became so offensive to society and therefore a liability, the gay rights movement dropped the 'man/boy' stuff like a hot potato. There was a time (I remember it, mainly in the 80s) when gay rights groups were not hostile toward the now defunct group NAMBLA. It was just as disgusting then as it is now.

The only place the "one man, one woman" stipulation exists (under law) is in the DOMA, and even the current administration concedes the DOMA is probably unconstitutional. They have even gone so far as to introduce H.R. 3313 which would bar any federal court from ruling on the constitutionality of the DOMA. This itself seems to be unconstitutional; the legislative branch barring the judical branch from doing it's constitutional job?

To some Christians, marriage is a sacrament available to opposite-sex couples and same-sex couples. To some Christians, marriage can be polygamous. Do you want the government to decide which Christians are "legitimate"?First of all, there is no longer a single "the church". (not that there ever was)That holds true for the churches that accept same-sex marriage. Guess you have to put up with them as much as I have to put up with those which don't.Sucks, doesn't it?

The opposite side isn't seeking a "win". They are merely trying to keep things as they are.I don't see groups who oppose same sex marriage as having an agenda to take away any freedoms that gay people currently have. If there are, they would be a small minority, and I'd oppose them. Some decisions concerning freedoms are made by the public, and some are made by the individual - they are not up for a public vote. Determining which is which is always debatable. The constitution is interpreted in different ways by different people, concerning individual liberty.I can see gay rights groups seeking reparations, IF our society admits that we have "wronged" them for several past decades. They would have a far better case than blacks who seek reparations for slavery. I'm not saying "gay reparations" would make more sense than "slavery reparations", I'm saying that a new LAW, concerning recent years rather than a whole 150+ years ago, would have better legal standing.What financial burden could anti-gay groups impose on us if we LEAVE THINGS ALONE??They don't say it too loudly since they've tested the waters and see that it doesn't have enough support YET, but todays liberals (today's Democrat party) really does support government health care. Combine that with their solid "pro-choice" stance, and there's no question that publically funded abortion is in their dreams.It may not be what they mean, but it's what they support - whether they realize it or not.They sure do "consider" themselves conservatives, but they're wrong. :) We have to agree to disagree if a new gay marriage law is a personal right, or if it is a public decision. I think it's a public decision because the public has a right to use their knowledge of history and human nature to determine if it may negatively affect our society.As I said to the other poster, you make yourself sound more oppressed by making it seem like you are having something taken away, rather than not being granted something new, which is what the gay marriage controversy is.I don't think it's reasonalbe for them to take it personally. Did an earlier generation or two take it so personally? They seemed to accept it. What's different about today's generation?You have nothing to apologize to me for. I'm worried about what the Democratic party is up too - they're desperate. I'm afraid their strategies concern something besides moving closer to conservative principles. Liberal talk radio just entered my area in a big way. Private enterprise, or DNC funded? Just a little attacking going on there too. But I'm listening - I'm impressed - they've done their homework.It's about time for us to agree to disagree, but I've enjoyed it. You're a good debater - hope you'll stay around!

I fail to see where the "Christian" ideology trumps civil rights. As has been stated many times before by myself and others, legalization of same-sex marriage in no way infringes on your right to believe in and practice you chosen religion. It in no way would force any religion to either perform or accept same-sex marriage within their religion. You simple have no grievance there. And so would same-sex marriages.Which "the church"? Yours? Mine? I thought there was more than one church. Did the Reformation never really happen? Why did it happen? What does "the church" have to say about the ordination of women? If there is no "right" to same-sex marriage within "the church" how do you explaing the many "Christian" denominations that already perform such "rites"?Maybe it is just me, but I prefer a study done by the CBO on the fiscal effects (costs and revenues both) of "same-sex marriage" over either a study of the effects of the cost only, of granting "domestic partnership benefits" to federal employees or someone's personal opinion who repeatedly shows extreme prejudice against same-sex marriage. emoticonXRolleyes And really, isn't that what it is all about?

Several people here have argued (some without disclosing their reasoning behind their argument) that same-sex marriage is not a right, that such a right has never existed, and and therefore is not being taken away or denied.I would argue that it IS a right guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution (including the ammendments there-to) and has ALWAYS been there. It is a "basic civil right" that is being excluded to a class of citizens.I refer you to the thread "Constitutional Debate on Gay Marriage"; Posts #24, #25, and #26 for the reasoning behind my argument.As a summary, any right not specifically barred or limited by the Constitution is granted to the people. The Constitution, as it stands now, does not mention marriage at all. SCOTUS has ruled in Loving vs. Virginia, that marriage is a "basic civil right". The fact that there is not now a any definition at all within the Constitution that "marriage" is limited to "one man / one woman", means same-sex marriage is NOT barred or limited in any way. This same reasoning seems to be the impetus behind the so-called "Moral Majority" (of whom only 20% attend church at least once a week) for a constitutional ammendment to specifically define marriage as between "one man / one woman".I hope there are enough people in our counrty that find it absolutely outrageous and abhorant to misuse use the Constitution as a tool, based on a self-centered, prejudical sense of morality, to to deny a right that harms no one and in no way infringes upon any other individuals rights. I think (my personal opinion, not fact) the United States would be considered the hypocritical laughing-stock of the world if such an ammendment were passed.

The issue here is that the govt. gives certain benefits to people it considers part of a married couple. Marriage itself, as far as the institution, can't be regulated. You can get married in the sense that you can make a ceremonial commitment to another person anytime you want. Of COURSE that's your right. But it's a whole other matter to argue that it's your right to get the benefits given to straight married couples simply by laxing the definition and standard of what constitutes a marriage.Because inevitably others are going to step in and want these benefits as well, perhaps groups further down the road even if we DO give them to gay couples, Dzeron's view of completely privatizing marriage may not be a bad idea. Otherwise we are probably eventually going to have no way to really oversee the matter of assigning benefits because the standards for them will be so lax and open-ended.You are trying to use it as tool right now, out of your own prejudices, and your form of morality.

Is the gonernment not supposed to be based on the Constitution?Then what do you consider the regulations in most (if not all) states requiring a marriage license, a blood test, and who may and may not perform a legally recognized marriage? Are these not regulations covering marriage? Wheter they are constitutionally correct regulations or not is a different issue.How can one "lax" a definition that doesn't exist?As I pointed out above, there IS NO DEFINITION or standard in the Constitution, as now written, that defines "marriage" in ANY way, shape, or form. If I am incorrect, please point me to the place in the Constitution where it does so.What is being presented here is an argument supporting the right of two individual, consenting adults, regardless of sexual orientation, to marry and enjoy the benefits thereof. I feel sure (personal opinion, not fact), that any challenge brought before the Supreme Court, based on the Constitution as now written, would likewise be limited in scope in such a manner. I seriously doubt (personal opinion, not fact) the Supreme Court would even consider a broader challenge including other "what if", hypotheticals such as pologomy, close relatives, incest, pedophilia, beastiality, inanimate objects, ect. as you and many others here have suggested.Supposition on your part. If the lesialative branch is smart enough to come up with the tax code as it is today, I am sure (personal opinion, not fact) they can figure it out.Excuse me, but I did neither write nor ratify the Constitution as it stands today, nor am I arguing a change to it. If asking that the Constitution be applied and enforced as written is prejudicial, then I must be. It is YOUR imposition of YOUR perception of morality that is at issue.

Is the gonernment not supposed to be based on the Constitution?Then what do you consider the regulations in most (if not all) states requiring a marriage license, a blood test, and who may and may not perform a legally recognized marriage? Are these not regulations covering marriage? Wheter they are constitutionally correct regulations or not is a different issue.How can one "lax" a definition that doesn't exist?As I pointed out above, there IS NO DEFINITION or standard in the Constitution, as now written, that defines "marriage" in ANY way, shape, or form. If I am incorrect, please point me to the place in the Constitution where it does so.What is being presented here is an argument supporting the right of two individual, consenting adults, regardless of sexual orientation, to marry and enjoy the benefits thereof. I feel sure (personal opinion, not fact), that any challenge brought before the Supreme Court, based on the Constitution as now written, would likewise be limited in scope in such a manner. I seriously doubt (personal opinion, not fact) the Supreme Court would even consider a broader challenge including other "what if", hypotheticals such as pologomy, close relatives, incest, pedophilia, beastiality, inanimate objects, ect. as you and many others here have suggested.Supposition on your part. If the lesialative branch is smart enough to come up with the tax code as it is today, I am sure (personal opinion, not fact) they can figure it out.Excuse me, but I did neither write nor ratify the Constitution as it stands today, nor am I arguing a change to it. If asking that the Constitution be applied and enforced as written is prejudicial, then I must be. It is YOUR imposition of YOUR perception of morality that is at issue.

On what basis do you hold the position that there are merely for "the sake of applying marriage [i[benefits.[/i]"? For example, how would "who" performed the ceremony relate to the application of marriage benefits?If you have an argument you wish to present showing another interpretation of the Constitution, AS WRITTEN, to support your position, then by all means, please do so.

The opposite side isn't seeking a "win". They are merely trying to keep things as they are.I don't see groups who oppose same sex marriage as having an agenda to take away any freedoms that gay people currently have. If there are, they would be a small minority, and I'd oppose them. Some decisions concerning freedoms are made by the public, and some are made by the individual - they are not up for a public vote. Determining which is which is always debatable. The constitution is interpreted in different ways by different people, concerning individual liberty.I can see gay rights groups seeking reparations, IF our society admits that we have "wronged" them for several past decades. They would have a far better case than blacks who seek reparations for slavery. I'm not saying "gay reparations" would make more sense than "slavery reparations", I'm saying that a new LAW, concerning recent years rather than a whole 150+ years ago, would have better legal standing.What financial burden could anti-gay groups impose on us if we LEAVE THINGS ALONE??They don't say it too loudly since they've tested the waters and see that it doesn't have enough support YET, but todays liberals (today's Democrat party) really does support government health care. Combine that with their solid "pro-choice" stance, and there's no question that publically funded abortion is in their dreams.It may not be what they mean, but it's what they support - whether they realize it or not.They sure do "consider" themselves conservatives, but they're wrong. :) We have to agree to disagree if a new gay marriage law is a personal right, or if it is a public decision. I think it's a public decision because the public has a right to use their knowledge of history and human nature to determine if it may negatively affect our society.As I said to the other poster, you make yourself sound more oppressed by making it seem like you are having something taken away, rather than not being granted something new, which is what the gay marriage controversy is.I don't think it's reasonalbe for them to take it personally. Did an earlier generation or two take it so personally? They seemed to accept it. What's different about today's generation?You have nothing to apologize to me for. I'm worried about what the Democratic party is up too - they're desperate. I'm afraid their strategies concern something besides moving closer to conservative principles. Liberal talk radio just entered my area in a big way. Private enterprise, or DNC funded? Just a little attacking going on there too.

My point is that you aren't banned from getting married. Have your gay marriage ceremony and commit to someone anytime you want. You are just not allowed the benefits for marriage unless it's a male/female marriage.It's your burden of proof to do so, as it is you seeking to enact change.

Well, I would argue that they are seeking a win. One side is arguing to change the laws, the other is arguing to keep them the same. As long laws are not changed, the side seeking to stop change wins. If a clause preventing this change is added to the Constitution, in effect, the side preventing change has moved a big way toward victory. But it is a fight, a debate. Each side seeks to win.Well, I don't see gay rights groups as having the agenda that you describe; I haven't seen much indication that they intend to move past equality. I have certainly seen many groups which oppose same-sex marriage speak out against other freedoms, though; sex between same-sex couples was banned by the legislature in Texas, for example, but the Supreme Court struck down a ban on sodomy. I wouldn't be surprised to see groups opposed to same-sex marriage come down on as many gay rights as they can. Beyond that, they often speak out on against freedoms on issues unrelated to gay rights.I'm not so sure about that; I'd say that decisions concerning freedoms that could be harmful to society should be decided by officials elected by the public, not by a majority vote. Those people are able to more clearly evaluate harms caused to the minority as compared to overall harm. However in order for it to even come to that, it must be shown that there is some harm caused by the action in question. If an individual's actions and decisions cause no one harm, then the decision over whether or not to do them should be left up to the individual, not up to society. That is why I call this a restriction on freedom, and I do not believe that there has been much evidence illustrating any harm caused by same-sex marriage.Well whether our society admits that or not, it does not make sense to respond to inequality with inequality. There should be no reparations, and I think our society will see to it that there are none. If you have a problem with reparations, I urge you to speak out against reparations. But don't speak out against marriage if you have a problem with reparations. Don't use fear of what may never happen as a reason to deny others the same rights that you have.Well, that depends on how you define "us". If you are referring to the population as a whole, then the financial burdens are put on the same-sex couples who are trying to start a family, though those burdens are not present for opposite-sex couples. Beyond that, if allowing same-sex marriage to pass saves taxpayers 1 billion dollars each year, then opposing same-sex marriage is effectively costing taxpayers 1 billion dollars each year.I believe that you are taking the stance held by a few people and making the claim that it isn't just a few people who believe these things, it is all Democrats. You are generalizing the extremes across the entire politcal ideal. Furthermore, I think it would have to be only the most rare and most extreme percentage of Democrats who support government-funded health care that also believe abortion should be covered. I do not know where you get these ideas from, but I hope you will tell me. Are you certain you are not mistakening generalizing the views held by a few extreme people across an entire political party? Wouldn't the party platform give you a better idea of their political stance?Sorry; you wrote this in response to that socially liberal thing. I wrote that I would explain below, but I don't think I ever actually did! So here goes: People who claim to be socially liberal generally are pro-choice, supportive of gay rights, in support of environmental protections, in opposition to war, and supportive of stem-cell research. They are not generally referring to "social programs" such as welfare, government health care, etc. Those are more fiscal issues.Heh, well I think they consider themselves "Reagan-conservatives" in that they support limited government spending and limited government interference in people's lives. Republicans today are "neo-conservatives" aren't they? Anyhow, it doesn't even matter; I think I was just trying to point out that the lines between liberalism and conservatism may not be as clear as Democrat vs. Republican, and though many people may hold conservative values enough to vote for a Republican, they might not hold all the same views.Well, as I said, I believe that the government should not interfere with people's lives unless it is doing so because it is preventing some harm. I don't think we've seen any reason to believe that same-sex marriage would cause harm, so I don't think that the government has any place giving marriage benefits to opposite-couples but not to same-sex couples. That's rewarding people for living a government-approved lifestyle; that is not the government's place.That may be, but it was not my intent. I used the words "taking away" because I subscribe to the Lockian-ideology that the people have the right to do anything they want when there is not government, but they institute government to take away some rights in the interest of protecting many other rights. Dzeron touched that subject briefly. I did not mean to make people seem more oppressed than they are, and changing my wording on the issue does not change my arguments.Also, you used the term "yourself". Though this isn't too relevant, I have deliberately kept my sexual orientation out of these debates, because I feel that if I say I am straight, anyone could easily claim that I do not know the true intentions of gays. If I say that I am gay, anyone could easily claim that I am supporting gay rights only out of self-interest. So I have made neither statement.Though their voices may not have carried; I'm willing to bet that an earlier generation did take it very personally. Today's generation has more support and people who will listen. I should also mention that I think there is just as high a percentage of civil gay rights supporters as there are civil gay rights opposers, but forums and debate groups tend to draw those who feel the need to defend themselves more than those who do not wish to insult.I am glad to hear that; you have also done extremely well in keeping this discussion civil, and I thank you for that.Well, I'm just curious on this (I cannot use it to claim your arguments invalid): I've mentioned conservative talk radio a few times; are you a listener to Rush or Sean Hannity? I can't really see any evidence that the Democratic party is desperate about anything, but I know I've heard those two radio hosts bringing up some obscure examples of single Democrats saying something absurd, then using that as evidence to call the Democratic party "desperate". I see no evidence that the party is doing anything different than it has always done, nor anything really different from the Republican party when we had a Democrat president. So, well, maybe I should have asked: is this idea that the Democrats are desperate rooted in radio show listening, or elsewhere? Why would you say they are desperate?As for liberal talk radio, I've only listened to it a few times, but what I've heard hasn't been much better than conservative talk radio. Their arguments were often weak compared to the stronger arguments around, they made unjust attacks on conservatives, and they generalized views of a single conservative across the entire party. But they pull you in by talking to opponents who don't know the argument very well or by presenting some absurd fact as the belief of the opposite party. Of course, I believe conservative talk radio has the same problems.Well, maybe I shouldn't be generalizing the subject; this has only been my experience with it.Anyhow, I'd have to guess liberal radio is funded by advertisements, because it isn't using the same arguments that the party would use; it's using extreme arguments designed to perpetuate listeners. I suppose it would make sense for the DNC to want to respond to conservative, but I don't really think either side responds to the real arguments delivered by their opponents.Well, I cannot say that I will agree to disagree. Please understand where I'm coming from; it is my opinion that your viewpoint is harming a lot of people, and in my opinion, this debate is one of the most important debates our society will be faced with in my lifetime. So should I see the opportunity to present my side of the argument to you, I will probably take it; it would be unfair of me to agree to disagree if I plan on responding to arguments you might deliver in the future.Still, it can be tedious to have to type out these long responses, and I understand that no one wants to keep going back and forth forever. So I've got no problem if we close up our little back and forth discussion that we're having right now.As for me being a good debater, well thanks! You're pretty good yourself. I'll probably stick around; I've still got plenty of people to debate here if you decide to finish this one up.

?????????? Then why have I cited the Constitution as my basis? DUH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The Constitution does not give the power to give benefits to anyone. It merely infers that it must be done equatibly. Exclusion of same-sex partners from marriage and the benefits there-from is not equatible.But the point is, is there a Constitutional basis for NOT allowing them?OH? Then what IS it based on? I am willing to take that risk. Are you willing to take the risk that they will rule against you? Or do you feel it is necessary to pass a Constitutional ammendment just to make sure they don't rule against you.Not until you codify those assumptions into law which violate the Constitution as written.I am not discussing "everytime". I am discussing one specific case, the rights of same-sex marriage. "Gravy train"? I thought we had already established estimated net benefit to the federal government of aprox. +$1 billion per year over each of the next ten years.Like what?And what I have presented is a Constitutional basis for saying it IS mine too; not EXCLUSIVELY yours. You have failed to privide ANY evidence to such exclusitivity you claim within the Constitution.Excuse me. The subject of this forum is "Gay Rights", not "Polygamy Rights" or "Incest Rights". The subject of this forum is about the specificof issue same-sex marriage of two consenting adults, not polygamist marriage or incestious marriage. Whether such a precedent may or may not apply is not a part of this issue. Why? Because that is what I defined this line of discussion to be within this topic within this thread within this forum to be about when I started this line of discussion.

I believe they meant mostly, if not always, granted to the people COLLECTIVELY. Either by a vote, or by general voting habits of the people and their represenatives. It's clear that public opinion today does not support gay marriage.

Several people here have argued (some without disclosing their reasoning behind their argument) that same-sex marriage is not a right, that such a right has never existed, and and therefore is not being taken away or denied.I would argue that it IS a right guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution (including the ammendments there-to) and has ALWAYS been there. It is a "basic civil right" that is being excluded to a class of citizens.I refer you to the thread "Constitutional Debate on Gay Marriage"; Posts #24, #25, and #26 for the reasoning behind my argument.As a summary, any right not specifically barred or limited by the Constitution is granted to the people. The Constitution, as it stands now, does not mention marriage at all. SCOTUS has ruled in Loving vs. Virginia, that marriage is a "basic civil right". The fact that there is not now a any definition at all within the Constitution that "marriage" is limited to "one man / one woman", means same-sex marriage is NOT barred or limited in any way. This same reasoning seems to be the impetus behind the so-called "Moral Majority" (of whom only 20% attend church at least once a week) for a constitutional ammendment to specifically define marriage as between "one man / one woman".I hope there are enough people in our counrty that find it absolutely outrageous and abhorant to misuse use the Constitution as a tool, based on a self-centered, prejudical sense of morality, to to deny a right that harms no one and in no way infringes upon any other individuals rights. I think (my personal opinion, not fact) the United States would be considered the hypocritical laughing-stock of the world if such an ammendment were passed.

Do you think the social experiment of gay marriage is a good idea in these economic times?

Our self-righteousness seems to seek out those circumstances. Our standing president used a threat of unconstitutional federal legislation banning same-sex marriage as a reelection tool.

Just about anything can be determined by anybody to be harmful to society, whether it's something children can see, or environmental harm done on private property, or so many other things in between. It's all politics, and constitutional interpretation.I'm speaking out against reparations, by not supporting SETTING THE TABLE for someone to seek them. Our legal system currently (wrongly) allows a lot of time and money to be wasted seeking them.I was referring to the population as a whole. I don't believe the 1 billion dollar figure was arrived at by a non biased study.I get these ideas from Democrat LEADERSHIP. Terry McCaulliff (spelling?) Hillary Clinton (she called for the elimination of the Electorial College) John Kerry ("health care is a RIGHT") Countless "Democrat strategists" debating on television. They are authorized by Democrat leadership. I do know of a couple Democrats past & present who aren't so extreme left. John F. Kennedy would be one from the past - Zell Miller would be one from the present.They often want it both ways. They want to support a benefit of one side, yet not support the cost. Or they support the cost if they feel it doesn't cost THEMSELVES. I wasn't attempting to label you, I was just used the word "yourself" in making the argument. I'm not concerned which you are, and I know that you're not necessarily gay. I support smokers rights, but I don't smoke.I don't think earlier generations had gay marriage on their minds at all. If they took anything personally, it was that others didn't approve and accept them. I'd bet it's the same with gay marriage seekers today. You can't tell people how to feel. Getting gay marriage legalized isn't going to change how those who oppose it feel about it. In some ways, gays will become more oppressed if gay marriage is made legal. They don't have control of the House, Senate, or Presidency, and they've been losing governorships. They are about to replace their DNC leader. They have not been successful lately, and they seek success. They aren't going to do it by admitting they've been wrong, or too extreme. Yes, I listen to Limbaugh and Hannity, off and on. I listen while working, and miss a lot of it. The reason I said it may be time to agree to disagree is because we're getting to the point where we're saying the same things over and over. I think your viewpoint is harmful, mainly because it has too many unforseen consequences. I'll be here - good Lord willing and the computer don't break! emoticonXClown

Well, I would argue that they are seeking a win. One side is arguing to change the laws, the other is arguing to keep them the same. As long laws are not changed, the side seeking to stop change wins. If a clause preventing this change is added to the Constitution, in effect, the side preventing change has moved a big way toward victory. But it is a fight, a debate. Each side seeks to win.Well, I don't see gay rights groups as having the agenda that you describe; I haven't seen much indication that they intend to move past equality. I have certainly seen many groups which oppose same-sex marriage speak out against other freedoms, though; sex between same-sex couples was banned by the legislature in Texas, for example, but the Supreme Court struck down a ban on sodomy. I wouldn't be surprised to see groups opposed to same-sex marriage come down on as many gay rights as they can. Beyond that, they often speak out on against freedoms on issues unrelated to gay rights.I'm not so sure about that; I'd say that decisions concerning freedoms that could be harmful to society should be decided by officials elected by the public, not by a majority vote. Those people are able to more clearly evaluate harms caused to the minority as compared to overall harm. However in order for it to even come to that, it must be shown that there is some harm caused by the action in question. If an individual's actions and decisions cause no one harm, then the decision over whether or not to do them should be left up to the individual, not up to society. That is why I call this a restriction on freedom, and I do not believe that there has been much evidence illustrating any harm caused by same-sex marriage.Well whether our society admits that or not, it does not make sense to respond to inequality with inequality. There should be no reparations, and I think our society will see to it that there are none. If you have a problem with reparations, I urge you to speak out against reparations. But don't speak out against marriage if you have a problem with reparations. Don't use fear of what may never happen as a reason to deny others the same rights that you have.Well, that depends on how you define "us". If you are referring to the population as a whole, then the financial burdens are put on the same-sex couples who are trying to start a family, though those burdens are not present for opposite-sex couples. Beyond that, if allowing same-sex marriage to pass saves taxpayers 1 billion dollars each year, then opposing same-sex marriage is effectively costing taxpayers 1 billion dollars each year.I believe that you are taking the stance held by a few people and making the claim that it isn't just a few people who believe these things, it is all Democrats. You are generalizing the extremes across the entire politcal ideal. Furthermore, I think it would have to be only the most rare and most extreme percentage of Democrats who support government-funded health care that also believe abortion should be covered. I do not know where you get these ideas from, but I hope you will tell me. Are you certain you are not mistakening generalizing the views held by a few extreme people across an entire political party? Wouldn't the party platform give you a better idea of their political stance?Sorry; you wrote this in response to that socially liberal thing. I wrote that I would explain below, but I don't think I ever actually did! So here goes: People who claim to be socially liberal generally are pro-choice, supportive of gay rights, in support of environmental protections, in opposition to war, and supportive of stem-cell research. They are not generally referring to "social programs" such as welfare, government health care, etc. Those are more fiscal issues.Heh, well I think they consider themselves "Reagan-conservatives" in that they support limited government spending and limited government interference in people's lives. Republicans today are "neo-conservatives" aren't they? Anyhow, it doesn't even matter; I think I was just trying to point out that the lines between liberalism and conservatism may not be as clear as Democrat vs. Republican, and though many people may hold conservative values enough to vote for a Republican, they might not hold all the same views.Well, as I said, I believe that the government should not interfere with people's lives unless it is doing so because it is preventing some harm. I don't think we've seen any reason to believe that same-sex marriage would cause harm, so I don't think that the government has any place giving marriage benefits to opposite-couples but not to same-sex couples. That's rewarding people for living a government-approved lifestyle; that is not the government's place.That may be, but it was not my intent. I used the words "taking away" because I subscribe to the Lockian-ideology that the people have the right to do anything they want when there is not government, but they institute government to take away some rights in the interest of protecting many other rights. Dzeron touched that subject briefly. I did not mean to make people seem more oppressed than they are, and changing my wording on the issue does not change my arguments.Also, you used the term "yourself". Though this isn't too relevant, I have deliberately kept my sexual orientation out of these debates, because I feel that if I say I am straight, anyone could easily claim that I do not know the true intentions of gays. If I say that I am gay, anyone could easily claim that I am supporting gay rights only out of self-interest. So I have made neither statement.Though their voices may not have carried; I'm willing to bet that an earlier generation did take it very personally. Today's generation has more support and people who will listen. I should also mention that I think there is just as high a percentage of civil gay rights supporters as there are civil gay rights opposers, but forums and debate groups tend to draw those who feel the need to defend themselves more than those who do not wish to insult.I am glad to hear that; you have also done extremely well in keeping this discussion civil, and I thank you for that.Well, I'm just curious on this (I cannot use it to claim your arguments invalid): I've mentioned conservative talk radio a few times; are you a listener to Rush or Sean Hannity? I can't really see any evidence that the Democratic party is desperate about anything, but I know I've heard those two radio hosts bringing up some obscure examples of single Democrats saying something absurd, then using that as evidence to call the Democratic party "desperate". I see no evidence that the party is doing anything different than it has always done, nor anything really different from the Republican party when we had a Democrat president. So, well, maybe I should have asked: is this idea that the Democrats are desperate rooted in radio show listening, or elsewhere? Why would you say they are desperate?As for liberal talk radio, I've only listened to it a few times, but what I've heard hasn't been much better than conservative talk radio. Their arguments were often weak compared to the stronger arguments around, they made unjust attacks on conservatives, and they generalized views of a single conservative across the entire party. But they pull you in by talking to opponents who don't know the argument very well or by presenting some absurd fact as the belief of the opposite party. Of course, I believe conservative talk radio has the same problems.Well, maybe I shouldn't be generalizing the subject; this has only been my experience with it.Anyhow, I'd have to guess liberal radio is funded by advertisements, because it isn't using the same arguments that the party would use; it's using extreme arguments designed to perpetuate listeners. I suppose it would make sense for the DNC to want to respond to conservative, but I don't really think either side responds to the real arguments delivered by their opponents.Well, I cannot say that I will agree to disagree. Please understand where I'm coming from; it is my opinion that your viewpoint is harming a lot of people, and in my opinion, this debate is one of the most important debates our society will be faced with in my lifetime. So should I see the opportunity to present my side of the argument to you, I will probably take it; it would be unfair of me to agree to disagree if I plan on responding to arguments you might deliver in the future.Still, it can be tedious to have to type out these long responses, and I understand that no one wants to keep going back and forth forever. So I've got no problem if we close up our little back and forth discussion that we're having right now.As for me being a good debater, well thanks! You're pretty good yourself. I'll probably stick around; I've still got plenty of people to debate here if you decide to finish this one up.

You maybe correct. As I said, I am in no way an expert on constitutional law. I think that particular issue is something for SCOTUS to sort out (if they already haven't on some other issue not relating to same-sex marriage).

Well, as usual, I still have more to say. I will try to keep my responses shorter, however.That may be, but reasoning can show that some things are clearly more harmful than others.I understand, but the same logic could have been used to justify continuing slavery. The answer to reparations is not to never grant equality, it is to oppose inequality in the form of reparations when they arise. Our legal system grants people a chance to fight for their rights when they believe they have been treated unfairly. That is not a bad thing, even though this means that sometimes people can fight for rights they do not deserve.Still, I urge you to take a look at the reasoning of the study and see how it arrives that its conclusion. The government agency that conducted it seems to be nonbiased.Heh, well from what I know of Zell Miller, he seeks to strip freedom and equality while increasing government spending; I could be wrong about him, but from what I know, he is not my idea of a good politician.Interesting; I have not seen this in people who claim that, though I don't doubt that plenty, most even, do just as you describe. It is natural for people to act in their own interest, and many people of all political beliefs do that.I think if they thought that same-sex marriage could be made legal, they would have fought just as hard for it. As for being more oppressed, well isn't a group of people oppressed when their rights are taken away? Granting more equality shouldn't make them more oppressed.Well, they don't believe they've been wrong or too extreme, and neither do I. Getting 49% of the vote against an incumbent president is very impressive. Many of the congressional seats they lost were caused by redistricting. Beyond that, moving away from the opinion held by the majority of the public does not make one wrong, and it is not a reason to change good beliefs into bad ones. I've heard people claim that gay rights played a factor in the loss of the presidential election, and though I don't know whether or not that is true, I can say that I would sooner not be elected president than take a stance that gays do not deserve the same rights that others have. I'd imagine most democrats feel the same way on the issues that are important to them.Though I see what you mean about unforseen consequences, I don't think those consequences will be very significant, and it is difficult to argue against the possibility of things that we don't yet know of happening. But remember that unforseen consequences are just as likely to be good as bad, even more so when good theory supports granting more families the benefits of marriage, and I think that it does.Well, maybe I just opened the door for another post from you, but if you feel that what you say will only be repetative, that is fine too.Are there any other topics you post on in these forums, by the way?

(Follow-up to previous post)I have been doing some Internet research for Supreme Court rulings regarding their interpretation of the phrase "of the people".

I know many people argue that it means the individual state's right to maintain a militia (ie: National Guard). Others argue that it pertains to an individual's right to own firearms.

It doesn't matter even if it conflicts with the Bill of Rights. If a new Amendment gets passed today, it is bulletproof. The Supreme Court will have no means by which to judge it unconstitutional because it would represent the latest Constitutionally-instituted law. The only way to make it null and void would be to pass an ever newer amendment that says the opposite, as in Prohibition and its repeal.

Hi, mind if I weigh in on this?I agree. Republicans now represent the political 'middle' in politics. They are the mainstream. It doesn't matter whether it was moral values or the war on terrorism that helped Bush win; Democrats have simply stopped appealing to voters. They represent the far left, and Republicans represent the middle and the right (and sometimes a little of the left as well, as in Schwarzenegger). And I think over time, people have started to realize that all the over-the-top accusations against Republicans are just simply not true. (Such as "they hate old people," or "they are only for the rich.") Democrats however, will try and chalk it up to anything else they can, rather than look inward and realize and actually consider that maybe their perception of reality and the world just isn't so accurate after all.The DNC picked up a liability when they got in bed with radical gay activism. But their biggest failure is that they have no sense of purpose and direction regarding terrorism.

Well, JP, not all these claims are ficticious. In some states such as Virginia, they have stripped gays the right of having union contracts. At one point we could sort of protect our relationships with "living contracts". The new admendment in Va. prevents those from being recognized. Rights are being taken away. Maybe not as you see it, many of these laws are not so specific, so lawyers are misusing them against gays and even some straight couples. Unless you are a married couple, rights are being limited.

If it were, then the government could never be "restricting rights" because if the government does not grant you a particular right, then it does not exist to restrict.Rights are the actions that people are able to take; the government freely and willingly restricts the right to murder, for example, and it does so in order to protect other rights.So when people say that the government is restricting the rights of same-sex couples, they do not need to offer "evidence that these rights exist"; of course they exist. The debate is over whether or not it is morally right or wrong to ban same-sex marriage.Regarding the Bill of Rights, it is my understanding that the 9th and 10th Ammendment are in contrast and are the result of the dispute between the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists. The Federalists wanted most governmental power to rest in the hands of the Federal government, and they wanted to keep that government very limited. The Anti-Federalists believed good government has to be local, and they wanted the states to have a lot of power. The Constitution did not really say what powers the states have, and the Bill of Rights delegates "all other powers to the states" (9th Ammendment) but also claims that the Bill of Rights isn't a list of the ONLY rights that government cannot take away, and it should not be confused to mean that the government can take away any rights of the peolpe that it wants. At the time, this sort of brought up the question of what rights state governments are actually allowed to take away (the Federal government technically has no power to take away rights any rights unlisted in the Constitution, though it does so freely because the people support it, and it is the people who hold the power in our nation, not the Constitution).I don't believe the 10th Ammendment could really apply to protecting same-sex marriage.Now the 14th Ammendment says many things, but the most important is that no person shall be denied equal treatment under the law. Perhaps this view is not held by everyone, but it seems very clear to me that allowing marriage between opposite-sex couples, but disallowing it for same-sex couples who are in the same financial situation with the same family responsibilites is exactly the definition of unequal treatment under the law.Joebrummer is also correct that many states have taken away the rights of same-sex couples to enter into legal agreements that resemble marriage, even though they may have had those rights in the past. How strictly this will be enforced is up for debate; I don't know those legal cases well enough to know which rights have been restricted. I do know that in Michigan, some government employers are no longer providing health insurance to same-sex couples because of a recent state constitutional ammendment. I think they have stated that they would return to granting those benefits if a court rules that they can legally do so, but they will not do unless it does. The most prominant example of this is Jennifer Granholm's staff, as it consists of many gay employees. It is also likely that the court will rule that no employers, government or not, are allowed to continue providing health care insurance to the partners of gay and lesbian employees.

I keep hearing these ficticuious revisionist claims that the government has restricted gays' rights. You had no right to marry a member of the same sex, you DID have the same right as anyone else to marry a member of the opposite sex. Maybe we should explore the legal question a little deeper; there's far too much misconception about what the law does and doesn't say on the topic.Would someone like to start with the basics, such as:1. 10th Amendment argument- pro/con2. 14th Amendment argument - pro/con3. Loving V VA4. Others?

It has already been started. I refer you to my post (#408 on this thread) and also to the thread "Constitutional debate on Gay Marriage".In reference to Amendment #10's use of the phrase: "to the people", "marc9000" (post #422 on this thread) argues it applies to the people collectively. You (post #429 on this thread) argue that the same phrase in Amendment #4, applies to the individual person.I am still researching the issue of the meaning of "to the people" within the Constitution.

I agree it does speak for itself, but the response is predictable. That a marriage is between a man and a women. "And gays have that right." That is how the "right" is going to view this.We already know I don't agree with that but I see it coming.

In the cases to which I was referring, courts HAD determined that same-sex couples DO have (at least some of) the rights associated with marriage.

I keep going back to this (and no one seems to pick it up, emoticonXCry emoticonXCry ), but the writing is on the wall. Four or five state supreme courts have already upheld the idea that same-sex marriage is a constitutional right (based on their state constitutions which largely mimic the federal one). The SCOTUS has already hinted/threatened that it might be compelled by logic and precedence to take the same position (thank you, Justice Scalia!). The President buys the argument. The GOP buys the argument. Why won't you?Fascinating as this mental masturbation might be, it really doesn't matter if we run through those arguments yet again (though I concede it might be instructive to lurkers).

The idea that marriage could mean anything BUT the union of one man and one woman wasn't considered until relatively recently, so it's not surprising that it wasn't specifically spelled out in the Constitution.

Yes, the legislative branch has done that. The judicail branch has yet to rule on the DOMA's constitutionality. If it hasn't been challenged already, it will be. Why do you think there is a move underway for a constitutional ammendment on that issue if the DOMA wasn't realized to be unconstitutional, even by it's own supporters?

Gay pride people? Anyhow, I think it would be difficult to make the claim that "equal protection under the law" does not or should not apply to same-sex couples, which indicates that this is not a loophole but a usage of the Ammendment for its intended purpose.Regardless, I think that this entire conversation has taken a turn in the wrong direction; it seems to easy to bait ourselves into Constitutional discussions as though such a discussion actually resolves anything. Let me ask this: does the Constitution determine whether something is morally right or wrong? Do the Supreme Courts? They certainly do not. The Supreme Courts could declare that murder is legal, and the Constitution could protect murder, but that would never make murder morally right. I would gladly support a law which bans murder, even if that law violates the Constitution, and I would gladly support using loopholes, trickery, bribery, lies, foolery, blasphemy or any other method necessary to get that ban on murder passed.The wording of the Constitution and the rulings of Supreme courts will never be a real reason to support or oppose same-sex marriage, and if this thread is to answer the question of why we support or oppose same-sex marriage, discussing the Constitution and court rulings are not sufficient.

Please, Mr. Justice Scalia has requested that no one use the word or the root "lay" when discussing him or his thoughts -- it's just too dirty.The problem with Scalia's take on the "compelling" nature of all controversial issues regarding minorities is that he's only concerned with whether the majority feels "compelled", unless the minority is orthodox Catholics, then he can see their point.

Do you suppose the forefathers that authored the Constitution foresaw the end of slavery? Do you suppose they foresaw women's right to vote (something reserved strictly for men in the original Constitution)? Do you suppose they foresaw black civil rights? Do you suppose they foresaw inter-racial marriage? Do you suppose they foresaw Roe vs. Wade?

They knew they could not foresee all possible issues that might arise and specifically worded the Constitution and Bill of Rights to grant to the people, any right not specifically barred or specifically granted to the states.

All of these issues are separate ones that had (and still do have) to be argued on their own merits.- Women's right to vote wan't a morality issue, like homosexual marriage. IN fact, they couldn't vote. But you have always been able to participate in a gay marriage. You just didn't get benefits for it. - Black civil rights wasn't either in the sense that no one thought the activity of blacks was particularly immoral--same as above- Interracial marriage was considered a morality issue, so this could be an analogy--nevertheless it didn't seek to change the fundamental aspect of marriage: that it is between a man and woman- Roe v. Wade: This is still so controversial that a lot of people believe the court was wrong on this one and that it's not consititutional at all, given that it legalizes a form of harm through the act of abortion. The specifics of this issue are so different from that of gay marriage, the analogy really doesn't hold water.The problem with your tactic here is that it is an example of assuming that just because the courts ruled on favor on these other issues, they should automatically rule in favor of the one you are seeking. But the courts could just as easily (and probably have at times) stike down arguements with the same basis as yours: a polygamist could just as easily take the same approach. Each case has to be argued on it's own merits, not because other cases happened to end up the same way. Now I do understand that you were making the point that the founding fathers never may not have envisioned such things as gay marriage. But you, nor anyone else here, really have any idea what they throught about issues such as these. The phrase "they are rolling over in their graves" may apply, for all we know. One thing is certain: you don't automatically get to have gay marriage put in the same catagory as women's and blacks' right to vote, interracial marriage, etc. It's not automaticaly a "civil right" just because you say it is. In my opinion, it's a much different issue than all these.And everyone wants what they do to automatically be a 'right,' no? The jury is still out on whether or not changing the standard of marriage and making it open-ended is a right of yours.

They knew they could not foresee all possible issues that might arise and specifically worded the Constitution and Bill of Rights to grant to the people, any right not specifically barred or specifically granted to the states. These men stood for freedom, not tyrany and intolerance.Read my signature. That is an example of how these men thought.

Ah... Wait just a second now. My entire post was about how I believe the Constitution SHOULD be used to support something it never intended if that something is the right thing. I said that I would support any method of getting that which is morally good put into law. I don't support the Constitution because it lists the founders' intentions; I support it because I think it provides a great government and a strong set of protections for people. To the extent that it does not do these things, our law should be adjusted. What I mean is, I will use any excuse to do what is morally right, and if abusing the Constitution helps millions of people while hurting none, I will gladly abuse the Constitution.But beyond that, I think that I can be certain our founders did in fact intend the Constitution to be used to protect same-sex marriage. If you read their writings, it is very clear that they believe governments to be evil by nature in that they take away rights. Their goal was to create a government that protected rights, taking away as few as possible. Their arguments were primarily about which type of government best accomplished this. They knew they could not list out every right, and because of this, they did not give government the power to do something like grant marriage benefits, and they added an ammendment to the Bill of Rights stating that the protected rights of the people should not be considered "only what is listed in the Bill of Rights". They tried to form a Constitution that would protect equality for even those of future generations, not just for themselves; they wanted their Constitution to protect freedom and equality in the cvil rights battles faced by future generations.

I agree that the Constitution shouldn't be used as a tool to manipulate laws in ways that they were never intended. Our forefathers never intended the Constitution to be used to support gay marriage. The concept was foreign to them and foreign to us up until this generation. That being said, I see no reason to redefine marriage as anything but one man, one woman. I would consider entertaining the concept of same sex civil unions with equal rights and protections, but calling it marriage would still be a show-stopper to me.

I'm not sure you can easily show that the founding fathers considered marraige recognition by the govt. to be a "right" in the first place. I wonder what benefits existed very early on from the early American govt. in the 1780s for married couples. If they really felt that way, they would have set up a system that considered black people free and women able to vote immediately. I think sometimes people put the founding fathers on way too high of a pedastal.

I agree; They are very much serarate issues and stand on their own merits.Wrong. My "tactic" here was to point out that the framers of the Constitution could not possibly have forseen all eventualities. You presume something that is not there.How ironic. Have you finally seen the light? It is you and other anti-gay marriage people who have tried repeatedly to compare allowing gay marriage to polygomy, beastility marriages, incest marriage, marrying minors, etc., etc., etc.OH, so NOW you finally understand what my point was? That would be a first.Doesn't the quote beneath my name below give you an idea of how Thomas Jefferson thought?Why not? It is a right that is being denied just as those were. (Don't try to read into that something that is not there.)And likewise, it is not automatically NOT a "civil right" just because you say it isn't. And I have already agreed that each is a separate issue.Opps!!!!! Have you already forgotten the "separate issue" ?I have yet to see one person here who supports gay marriage argue for anything more than "two consenting adults". I don't see that as "open ended". It is you and the other anti-gay marriage people who bring up all the other permutations noted above.

All of these issues are separate ones that had (and still do have) to be argued on their own merits.- Women's right to vote wan't a morality issue, like homosexual marriage. IN fact, they couldn't vote. But you have always been able to participate in a gay marriage. You just didn't get benefits for it. - Black civil rights wasn't either in the sense that no one thought the activity of blacks was particularly immoral--same as above- Interracial marriage was considered a morality issue, so this could be an analogy--nevertheless it didn't seek to change the fundamental aspect of marriage: that it is between a man and woman- Roe v. Wade: This is still so controversial that a lot of people believe the court was wrong on this one and that it's not consititutional at all, given that it legalizes a form of harm through the act of abortion. The specifics of this issue are so different from that of gay marriage, the analogy really doesn't hold water.The problem with your tactic here is that it is an example of assuming that just because the courts ruled on favor on these other issues, they should automatically rule in favor of the one you are seeking. But the courts could just as easily (and probably have at times) stike down arguements with the same basis as yours: a polygamist could just as easily take the same approach. Each case has to be argued on it's own merits, not because other cases happened to end up the same way. Now I do understand that you were making the point that the founding fathers never may not have envisioned such things as gay marriage. But you, nor anyone else here, really have any idea what they throught about issues such as these. The phrase "they are rolling over in their graves" may apply, for all we know. One thing is certain: you don't automatically get to have gay marriage put in the same catagory as women's and blacks' right to vote, interracial marriage, etc. It's not automaticaly a "civil right" just because you say it is. In my opinion, it's a much different issue than all these.And everyone wants what they do to automatically be a 'right,' no? The jury is still out on whether or not changing the standard of marriage and making it open-ended is a right of yours.

There were none. As I said, the founders did not give the government the right to grant marriage benefits. However, this does not mean that they did not set up a Constitution which would attempt to protect freedom and equality when those things find themselves at risk.Well, I sort of agree with this... The truth is that there is not one single view held by the founders; some agreed with slavery. But those who are most famous: Jefferson, Madison, Franklin, Washington, Hamilton, and others; these people are the ones who really won out in the Constitutional battle, and these are the people who are usually referred to when we say "Founders". All of these people opposed slavery, even Jefferson, who held slaves. The only one of these people that I know of who suggested that women should have the right to vote is Franklin. Now, I don't mean to claim that these people knew all of the answers to bring us toward equality and freedom, but I do mean to say that they intended to prevent the government from taking away these things wherever it did not absolutely need to do so, and they designed the Constitution so that when these battles did spring up, the Constitution would support freedom and equality.In Jefferson's writings, he explained that he lived in a society full of slavery where slavery is taught to be moral and acceptable. He stated that only a prodigy, a person capable of learning outside of society's teachings, could be understand that slavery is immoral after being raised in the society he lived in. Even he did not completely admit that blacks were equals, despite agreeing with the immorality of slavery. What I mean is that our founders realized that they were not capable of understanding equality and freedom in every situation, but they did know that if they designed a Constitution that would protect those things, then at least freedom and equality would be better realized some day.Of course our Constitution has changed (sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse), and not all of the founders supported the same things (though pretty much all of them preached the values of freedom and equality). So as I meant to say in the first paragraph of my last post, the Constitution should not be obeyed if it lists something immoral.EDIT: Oh, I forgot to mention: it may be worthwhile to understand the intentions of our founders because it appears that they have done a very good job in creating a Constitution. The United States has the longest-standing Constitution ever, and it is the longest-standing democracy ever. They did this not having statistics or factual evidence to support them. They did it based completely on theory. By understanding that theory, by understanding why our founders made the Constitution the way the did and on the principles on which they founded it, we can better understand why our Constitution has done so well, and we can better understand whether a proposed change to our Constitution will strengthen or weaken it. If it is not clear by now, I believe that an ammendment granting equality based on sexual orientation would greatly strengthen our Constitution while an Ammendment opposing that equality would do the opposite.

Have you ever really taken a good hard look at the English language? If so, you would have noticed that we have SEVERAL words which have multiple meanings/definitions (if you will). A word having more than one definition does not belittle any other definitions of that same word, does it? NO! This rule would then hold true for the word: MARRIAGE. Actually, that word ALREADY has SEVERAL definitions. We are NOT changing any one definition by including another.So, the ENTIRE argument that by allowing same-sex couples to marry would in anyway "Change" the definition is disinformation at work once again. If we allow same-sex couples to legally marry, does it in anyway water down any other marriage between opposite-sex couples? NO.Unless we're talking about adultery, in that a member of an opposite gender couple leaves his/her legal spouce to enter into one with someone of the same gender, but that's a completely different subject all together. My marrying my same gender partner of eight years has absolutely ZERO effect on the marriage between my brother and his wife, or my parents. NONE, ZIP, ZERO, NADA! Since I am not marrying my sister-in-law nor my mother, my marrying my partner CAN NOT have any affect on their relationships whatsoever, unless for some unforseen reason they allow it to do so, by way of creating stressors between them. Which again, is NOT my fault or that of any other same-gender couple. Hell, I pay into the tax base, medicare, social security, local property taxes which go to my son's school district as well as police, fire and other municipal agencies. I pay into benefits of which I any currently barred from simply because I'm not legally wed to my partner. Not out of conscience choise either...no, insted it's out of LEGAL DESCRIMINATION TOWARDS COUPLES OF THE SAME GENDER WHO OPENLY WISH TO PARTICIPATE IN ENTERING INTO THE LEGAL CONTRACT OF MARRIAGE!

One thing that is blindingly clear from the writings of the Founders, the predominant ones of whom (Jefferson, Madison, Franklin) were heavily influenced by Locke and the Enlightenment in France, is that they revered science and logic above religious superstition, about which they were acidly contemptuous.If colonial scientists had had access to the sophisticated information our scientists have uncovered about sexual orientation, you can bet the Founders would have put considerably more stock in what they had to say on the subject than in demoguogic illogic and citations from the Biblical writings of Paul (whom Jefferson referred to as "the first great corrupter of the teachings of Jesus").

I agree that they set the constitution up in this way, but it stands to reason that the idea for the govt. to give out benefits to married couples came later, perhaps much later. I admit, I don't know when that first happened. But it seems to me that they are more "benefits" rather than "rights." Remember we are talking about the governement's role in this, not the act of marriage in the sense of making a commitment to someone.Take social security for instance. One criteria for that is that a person has to be 62 or older to get social security benefits. In the same vein, marriage benefits require a marriage between a man and a woman. Wouldn't you say that for a man and a man together as a couple wanting to get marriage benefits is sort of like a 50 year old person wanting to get social security? In the sense that there is criteria, both marriage AND social security could be described as discriminatory Both were initiated as avenues of benefits at one time. Why is marriage any more discriminatory than any other criteria-based application of benefits given by the government?

I do not know how the founders would have reacted if faced with the question of same-sex marriage; allowing it coincides with their system of beliefs in equality and freedom, but the society they were raised in would have had a strong influence on their beliefs, just as Jefferson said. But what they would have done is not any indication of what we should do now; what they believed in is.

Most scientific papers use words such as "appears" and "suggest," whether discussing biology or atomic theory. There is hardly ever, if ever, a paper that says "This definitely proves..." or "Beyond a doubt..." That's the way science is, the way the scientific method works. You can only hypothesize to a point. But when many scientific studies "suggest" the same thing, a concensus of scientific opinion concludes that, barring a better explanation, a certain thing is very probably the case, despite the fact that the specifics are not yet known and further tests are required.The number of studies "suggesting" a biological component to homosexuality has become overwhelming enough that the current consensus of scientific opinion is that there is one, if not several. There are no studies that even "suggest" that its cause is dysfunctional parenting, much less voluntary "choice." Which is why the current scientific concensus of opinion is that such theories are BS.

Both can be called discriminatory and both ARE discriminatory; there is no doubt about that. The difference is that one is discriminatory for a good reason while the other is discriminatory for no good reason, or at least I believe there is no good reason to discriminate against same-sex couples. Whether that reason exists is the heart of the debate.As for the reasoning that makes it okay to discriminate against younger people, the idea is that everyone will be old some day, and old people are often unable to continue working and being productive. In order to better the lives of people who are too old to be working, social security was implemented to ensure that we would all have a steady flow of cash to keep us afloat in our old age. Since younger people do not need this help and we need people to work in order to have a productive society, this benefit only makes sense in the hands of the elderly.In the case of same-sex marriage, I have to assume that we are not giving benefits to people based on their religious beliefs regarding what constitutes a marriage. The reasons for granting marriage benefits, as I see them, are to encourage the family structure, which provides emotional support to its members. Furthermore, the benefits granted by marriage help one member of a family care for others who become ill or fall on hard times. Beyond that, the benefits ease the financial burden of parenting and raising children. Since all of these things can apply to same-sex couples, it logically does not make sense to not grant these rights to same-sex couples. Allowing same-sex marriage encourages more people to adopt, giving loving homes to children in need, grants benefits to good people, encourages the emotional support provided by a family for same-sex couples, and gives same-sex couples a set of benefits that will let them care for each other if one should fall ill or on hard times. The same reasons which we implement opposite-sex marriage apply for same-sex marriage. Since I see no harm caused by same-sex marriage and no reason to deny it, save promoting one man's preferred lifestyle over another's, I will make the claim that banning same-sex marriage is a bane to freedom and equality in every sense.

Well, I don't mean for this to become a social security discussion, but I think your arguments for saying the the one case of discrimination is any better than the other is weak. There are plenty of people out there who don't make it to 62 (and some may even know they won't), so the argument that 'we're all going to get SS sooner or later' doesn't really hold up. And the argument that younger people don't need help is not compelling either--many certainly probably do need financial help--just like many gay couples can claim to need to the benefits of marriage.The point here is that the govt. has numerous programs in which they discriminate, and anyone could argue that they such discrimination for any of those programs is bad. Social security, pell grants, disability payments, marriage benefits, etc. are all forms of benefits the govt. gives out and none of them were around when the constitution was drafted. To say that gay marriage is an example of inequality or denial of rights is to claim that about any of these examples, because they are all examples of benefits given based on criteria. Your claim that you should get marriage benefits is no different than a healthy person claiming it's unfair for his neighbor to get disability payments or no different than a younger person saying social security is unfair. Both could be cases where there is indeed a need there despite not meeting the criteria.I think the real issue here is that you are trying to cash in on a form of govt. benefits for which you don't meet the criteria. The standard for what constitutes a marriage has been there SINCE the constitution. It seems to be you who are trying to make that standard more open-ened.

It has never been incumbent on the US to recognize every other country's laws. That's what makes us a sovereign nation.Like I said, marriage has special meaning in our society. If you'd rather take an all or nothing approach, then who am I to argue; I'd vote "no". I said that I wouldn't have a problem with equal rights, but the term "marriage" would be a non-negotiable item in my case. It doesn't have to be rational; that's the beauty of a free society. Everyone is free to be irrational when so moved.

Anything short of the word marriage would not be equal. On an international level even, If one country has marriage (Canda) and another has civil unions (USA) What will the first country recognized. They may say..you are not married and not honor that union.It would be a tough sell to gays and lesbians to give us a new institution and tell us it is equal when it is clearly not. It like giving some people hald and hald and the others coffee mate. Tatse the same, looks the same, has the same effect...but not the same. Why have a substitute when as a citizen you are entitled to the real thing.Why should gay unions be second class to straight unions.

The fact that it doesn't recognize standards doesn't make it's own standards right, does it? The fact that you are a sovereign nation has no bearing on the correctness or wrongness of a law/practice.Anthropologically speaking, there's no rational reason to assume that the social definition recently slapped onto marriage is correct or ought to be honoured.

Every country has the right to determine what is and what isn't socially acceptable. Many European countries allow public nudity and sexually-explicit TV broadcasting. The US has decided that it doesn't want to follow that trend.

Not all of the US. Euthanasia is legal in Oregon. There's no constitutional conflict and it was approved by a majority of Christian, we have a small Catholic presence here, voters. Just as same sex marriage should remain a states right, not be a political football to gain partisan support at a federal level by using mythology as a moral determination. That clearly mixes religion and government.

1. You are confusing ethical convention with justification. Conventional Ethical Relativism isn't justification for anything. It fails logically to explain/justify anything. Just because the majority wants it or says it does not mean it's warrented.

There are many "illegal" sexual acts that hurt no one and are victumliess crimes (masturbation in your own home), for example, is a finable offense in some countries. Do you think that this is justified soley because the government says so? If you do, you are very shallow morally.You are committing the is/ought fallacy.

It's the ethically objective reasoning which goes behind the law.

Use the Razor, which easily shaves away the entire justification for Religious Ethis. Once you do this, you kill the source, and the rest of it dies. Since God is a superfluous entity, any and all beliefs which come from GOd no longer are required to actually come from GOd, therefore they aren't the absolute divine system people think they are.This is largely a valid opinion. Why do you ask? Because metaphysics is worthless and academically unjustified. Morality and Ethics can be based on objective logical reasoning in lieu of metaphysical mysticism.Again, you are assuming that because many people belief something to be true, it implies it is true, when you mentioned that morality and spirituality go hand-in-hand. This isn't the case. Appeal to popularity and numbers have no bearing on the validity of the system under question.That's the crux of the issue. YOu cannot justify faith. Faith is useless. If you have faith in something you are recognizing and admitting that your belief is subjective and has no objective, empirical, or rational basis. Faith is the antithesis to objective justification. This is the distinct difference between Objective Ethics and Religious and Relativistic Ethics. Objective Ethics uses reason and empirical evidence and observation, whilst faith uses an unfalsifiable "innate" origin or metaphysical realm from which the values are gathered. These systems are easily culled.This is a problem. People appeal to "faith," as did St. Thomas Aquinace, when they have nothing else. It's like man A commenting: Mountains are really the spawn of Satan. HOw do you this? Metaphysical Faith, being the answer. It's unnecessary and impossible to gauge, since someone can always come up with some unfalsifiable ideology to explain the phenomenon.1. The majority of americans opinions or their lack of care really has no bearing on whether or not the belief is warrented. This is a fact.Social policy in the United States is based on duality; Protection of Minority from Majority and the protection of Majority from Minority outline in the Federalist Papers #10. Yes, the United STates does have some democratic qualities, but the Argument from Democracy has no bearing still on the correctness or wrongness of an Maxim.You are correct in that you have to "consider" popularity when making social policy, but only insomuch that the belief is justified. It's wrong to implement policies based on irrational, unethical opinions. It's merely sophistry: placating the masses of undereducated people who really don't have the expertise needed to run government policy through clever political rhetoric and oration.Your argument stems from the Anthropological Argument of Ethics, but that's not really a valid ethical argument. Differences among cultures and the variations argument don't = right or wrong. Why is gay marriage wrong in the United States? Because people say so? That's a conventional answer, not an objective answer. An objective answer would be, if provable: 1. Marriage harms children (which there's on evidence"2. Marriage is a religious institution universally (which it isn't, according to 99.9% of anthropological studies.3. Gay marriage leads to the destruction of society (which it hasn't and never does, and is a simplistic-simple minded reason) No society collapses because of personal sexual relationships between conscenting adults..3. Marriage has the purpose of only producing children (which it doesn't).Good. Others have an annoying way of not providing information for their opinions. They expect others to prove their cases for them and they tend to ignore the rules of logic.

I would just like to know why the term "marriage" needs to be used? Marriage has been something sacred between a man and a woman for over a thousand years (not including the few who practiced polygamy). Why don't you come with some other term? It's like your trying to change the dog into a cat.
supports
They're not legally recognized because they don't meet the legal criteria for marriage, ie one man, one woman. A cat doesn't meet the legal definition of a dog. Do we change the definition of dog to appease the cat? That's the real question to be answered by society.Actually, I pulled the number out of the air for illustrative purposes only, but after reading the CBO report, I see that I wasn't far off. They predicted 600,000 gay couples would want to get married it allowed.

Remember, gay rights people only accept personal experience and observation if it fits their views. Try telling one you know of someone who claims to be an ex-gay and see if they'll accept it because he says so. Yet they usually expect you to accept what THEY say about being gay because it's their experience and because they say so.

If too many people were against it, segregation would not have even been opposed enough to be overturned (and for centuries it wasn't).

You see, this is the problem. You aren't considering the justification. In a situation of whether or not something is right or wrong, it matters not whether or not the majority agree/disagree, but upon what objective ethical basis you can make a claim.They can make any law they want, but it,in no way, makes it right, and if you want a just society, you would try to objectively justify your laws. If enough people support public stonning because you masturbate in your own home and the law finds out will you allow that based on the will of the masses? Or is it wrong based on objective rationality? You cannot honestly hold that much faith in Convention.Great, now you can admit that slavery was not only legal, but perfectly justified, since you only care about what the majority says. The majority of the nation was gung-ho about slavery, even the masses who didn't own slaves. Like that conclusion? You do know a minority of people said it was wrong, and that THIS minority actually used  justification  for why it was wrong, other than  i say so Do you even know to what you are admitting? You are saying it's ok to have a system of laws with NO justification behind it other than the will of the mases. That's inane. That's what your argument logically leads to. It's bad. If we made a law that the "majority" supported that told you that you couldn't have kids "just because," what would you say to that? Oh well! I guess it's the will of the masses? Next topic?Stating that their need not be justification, only mass support is nonsensical sophistry and a vain attempt to avoid any responsibility for your actions: plain and simple.Yes. The will of the masses, sadly, is what makes the world go around, not rational justification, untill it happens to you. However, there's no argument to support making a law and it being right just because someone says so. Laws with no justfication are, well, unjustified. Lets look at what unjustified means:adj : lacking justification or authorization; "unreasonable searches and seizures"; "desire for undue private profit"; "unwarranted limitations of personal freedom"I guess you also find no problem with the masses supporting a law that allowed the government to illegally search the home of a group of people they didn't like: say jews, for instance, and confiscate any material they found to be "impure christian values." Of course, that's where your "will of the masses," justification = irrelevant, leads.A law, whether or not the people want it, must be justified through logic and objective reasoning or it has  no basis . It's as good as saying: murder is legal becauses the masses say so (hypothetically). So you are basically saying you like living in a nation that feels free to legislate unjustified laws. You find it fantastic to have discrimination because the majority says so? You would find it nice to live in a country that tries to ban you from getting married? Please. That's worse than a dictatorship. It's a dictatorship of the uneducated masses.Information on conversions isn't credible, and this is comming from the APA and the AAA. No one expects you to believe anything based on what he/she says. In fact, it's based on professional inquiry; anthropology and science.Ex gay claims are largely bs. They are disreputible nonsense organizations who get small "success rates" by using unethical practices to force their victums into psychological remission. It's not a cure, it's brainwashing and unethical.How bout lets try to run tests on you and try to repress your sexual orientation through medications and treatment? Wanna volunteer?And the founding fathers were right, as well as the ancients: Democracy is the worst type of government if left unchecked by reason and justification.

Try telling one you know of someone who claims to be an ex-gay and see if they'll accept it because he says so. Yet they usually expect you to accept what THEY say about being gay because it's their experience and because they say so.

Sounds like your "good friend" hung out in some questionable places.Today's definition of marriage as the voluntary, often romantically driven, union between a man and a woman, legally equal in status, for as long as they both see fit, IS a recent phenomenon. Ask any anthropologist.AND it has been homosexual in some cultures and at certain times.AND now it is again. Get used to it.

You completely missed the point. What I'm saying is that while it may be desirable (by me to in some ways) for laws to have to be justified, ultimately society decides it's laws. There's no way around that. It may seem fine and dandy for a few to be able to run something through the courts against the will of the general public, but the reality is that it's rarely ever happened that way. Why? Because our govt. is set up to be a govt. by the people and for the people. We elect our lawmakers based on what we want them to do for us. I'm saying that in reality, it just doesn't happen the way you say.I think you are failing to give "the masses" the credit they deserve by implying it is bad to let us govern ourselves. Without the enough of the masses changing their views, segregation would still be in place today. It would still be illegal for women to vote. And to require a justification for laws outside of the will of masses is to pull the rug out from under democracy. Who decides what that "justification" is? A monarch? Or are you advocating a "legistocracy," where the courts basically take the place of determining what our laws are rather than the people? So yes, I certainly do think it's ok to have a system of laws set in place by the will of the masses. That's what democracy is all about.

You see, this is the problem. You aren't considering the justification. In a situation of whether or not something is right or wrong, it matters not whether or not the majority agree/disagree, but upon what objective ethical basis you can make a claim.They can make any law they want, but it,in no way, makes it right, and if you want a just society, you would try to objectively justify your laws. If enough people support public stonning because you masturbate in your own home and the law finds out will you allow that based on the will of the masses? Or is it wrong based on objective rationality? You cannot honestly hold that much faith in Convention.Great, now you can admit that slavery was not only legal, but perfectly justified, since you only care about what the majority says. The majority of the nation was gung-ho about slavery, even the masses who didn't own slaves. Like that conclusion? You do know a minority of people said it was wrong, and that THIS minority actually used  justification  for why it was wrong, other than  i say so Do you even know to what you are admitting? You are saying it's ok to have a system of laws with NO justification behind it other than the will of the mases. That's inane. That's what your argument logically leads to. It's bad. If we made a law that the "majority" supported that told you that you couldn't have kids "just because," what would you say to that? Oh well! I guess it's the will of the masses? Next topic?Stating that their need not be justification, only mass support is nonsensical sophistry and a vain attempt to avoid any responsibility for your actions: plain and simple.Yes. The will of the masses, sadly, is what makes the world go around, not rational justification, untill it happens to you. However, there's no argument to support making a law and it being right just because someone says so. Laws with no justfication are, well, unjustified. Lets look at what unjustified means:adj : lacking justification or authorization; "unreasonable searches and seizures"; "desire for undue private profit"; "unwarranted limitations of personal freedom"I guess you also find no problem with the masses supporting a law that allowed the government to illegally search the home of a group of people they didn't like: say jews, for instance, and confiscate any material they found to be "impure christian values." Of course, that's where your "will of the masses," justification = irrelevant, leads.A law, whether or not the people want it, must be justified through logic and objective reasoning or it has  no basis . It's as good as saying: murder is legal becauses the masses say so (hypothetically). So you are basically saying you like living in a nation that feels free to legislate unjustified laws. You find it fantastic to have discrimination because the majority says so? You would find it nice to live in a country that tries to ban you from getting married? Please. That's worse than a dictatorship. It's a dictatorship of the uneducated masses.Information on conversions isn't credible, and this is comming from the APA and the AAA. No one expects you to believe anything based on what he/she says. In fact, it's based on professional inquiry; anthropology and science.Ex gay claims are largely bs. They are disreputible nonsense organizations who get small "success rates" by using unethical practices to force their victums into psychological remission. It's not a cure, it's brainwashing and unethical.How bout lets try to run tests on you and try to repress your sexual orientation through medications and treatment? Wanna volunteer?And the founding fathers were right, as well as the ancients: Democracy is the worst type of government if left unchecked by reason and justification.

Sounds like you read my earlier posts. :)

I would just like to know why the term "marriage" needs to be used? Marriage has been something sacred between a man and a woman for over a thousand years (not including the few who practiced polygamy). Why don't you come with some other term? It's like your trying to change the dog into a cat.

He "hung out" where the Asian automakers were. And yes, I'd call them "questionable" at a minimum.Heterosexual marriage isn't relatively recent unless you think in terms of geological epochs. The Bible speaks of marriage as the union of one man/one woman in Genesis. And Genesis wasn't written recently. emoticonXRolleyes I doubt that I'll have to. As long as gay activists keep pushing for an all or nothing in your face resolution, the majority of Americans will push back. Light the fuse and "boom", new Constitutional amendment.

Biblical views, monogamy, and romance aside, I think they have a pretty hard sell on their hands anyway to convince people that gay marriage was widespread and accepted in historical times. Maybe if they had something substantial other that wishful thinking to back up such assertions, it would help.

That is a rather odd viewpoint you have. I have personally been to Thailand several times on vacation: Bangkok (6 times), Pattaya, Phuket Island / Patong Beach (4 times), and Chaing Mai. I have never seen it. But then I wasn’t looking for it either. And I have news for you. It IS illegal in Thailand. Anyone would be a fool to even think about it and end up spending the rest of their life in a Thai prison (You think Mexican prisons are bad? You ain’t seen nothing!)So here you are, trying to represent all gay people as pedophiles based on hearsay evidence from an unidentified source. Perhaps the reason your “friend” saw it was because he was looking for it.And what the heck does it have to do with gay marriage in the USA anyway?

Whoa buddy....back up. Not once did I state, suggest or imply that pedophiles were homosexuals. In fact, if you go back to the beginning of this thread, you'd see that I stated pedophiles can be gay, straight or bisexual. I mentioned pedophelia as an example of practices that are condoned in other countries. I agree that pedophelia is illegal in Thailand, but it is still a widely practiced activity. It was a response to Tigerlilly about a country's freedom to make their own laws and not be bound by other country's ideas of morality.

I get what you mean, that no matter if it's justified or not, people will do what they want. This is because people in general are stupid in the world. I mean, come on. 50% of the population believes in a literal translation of the bible. That takes zero objective thinking. 40% of the population believes in ghosts, goblins, and magical transcendentalism, which, according to Neurotheology describes religious "awakenings" as brain dysfunction.WHen you have a majority of people who can't think logically or rationally, you get laws that reflect that. In my opinion, and it's justified, any law ought to be struck down if it doesn't match up with some objective reason to have it (redundancy, uselessness, frivolous law, injurious to others).Well, in reality it does happen some what. They are mislabeld "activist" judges, when they, in reality, are acting on the merit of a law and the basis of moral justification, rather than just "gimmie what I want cause I outnumber you."Without the masses, segregation wouldn't have been there in the first place, and neither would have slavery before it. The masses got it and then they finally got rid of it only when it was no longer economically effective and it caused too many problems. They didn't do the right thing, they did it out of convenience and agitation.1. I really doubt I am failing to give the masses that much credit. Millions are in poverty and have little education and over 50 million people are fundamentalists (no brain at all), and then you have the seriously old, the feeble young, and then finally the people who are apathetic and don't give a hoot about politics (For example, in a recent poll, the majority of young males don't give a rat's XXX about the first amendment and they can't even recite whatt it is when given a multiple choice test on it). This is pathetic. These are the XXXXXX who are going to be future voters and legislators. The people who don't "care."Don't forget why they couldn't vote in the first place.And? Democracy isn't some sacred cow government, and the United STates isn't a Democracy anyway. It's a Federal Democratic Republic. It's not a government structure in which the masses rule. It's a balance between minoirty and majority. Secondly1. No. A monarchy isn't good, because the power of making laws isn't based on how powerful someone is or how many people there are. The reason a law ought to be passed is based competely on it's merit and logic. I fyou can't come up with any logical reasons for having the law, there's no reason to have the law, is there?If you can't explain logically how this law operates and why, it's mere nonsense.2. And yes. The number of people involved in making laws doesn't matter. Opinions should be overruled by objective evidence and sound reasoning. The people don't belong making laws. Educated, objective thinkers do. Democracy isn't a good system, but the way politics and education works nowadays, everyone is indoctrinated in political ideology insomuch that they don't actually care about how the system  should  run or could run.Think of the system as a type of logical positivism/ SM.3. No one person decides; the system decides. The people come up with laws through legislators, and then yo have people who analyse them and weed out the BS and explain it to the public, because the public is generally stupid. You have myriad councils of professionally trained ethicists and logicians who work in concert with men who use the Scientific Method (very objective thinkers). These people take an analysis of the laws and match them up against Objective Ethical systems and logical reasoning. The end product is a system of checks against legal stupidity and doubletalk.Do you know how many logical fallacies are used in Political lawmaking and debate? Bush and Kerry used at least 5-6 throughout the debates, and few, if any people, pick up on them. THey just keep chugging down the BS like it's free candy. Politicians throw red herrings at each other all the time, they focus on little more than Ad Hominems on top of total bifurcation of issues. It's not a good system, and that's why there are so many problems. People of the masses are usually too stupid to understand the basic concepts being discussed or WHY these debates aren't real debates at all in the first place.Kerry tauts the "working class," when he couldn't give a flying **** about the working class. Bush is for the common man, yet he has nothing in common with the common man. They focus things like SS and HC, but know nothing about them and most often just spew propaganda which the masses latch onto. They then hit up on origin and ad hominems, not facts and logic. THey distort the facts and initiate strawmans, and then throw in some red herrings.Lawmakers don't give a **** about reality or the people, they make laws that are illogical based on illogical ideologies.Half the people I know voted for Democrats because they are the colour blue. No one knew any of the issues, and when confronted, most people can't make sense of them, because it's all BS anyway. If you have logic behind the laws, you would know whether or not y ou ought to enact such a law. Perhaps if Socialists, for example, took a look at the facts, or if conservatives took a look at the facts, and looked at it ethicaly and analytically, you wouldn't have the conflicts that arise from making ill conceived laws. Having logicians instead of moronic masses making laws through elected officials would fix a lot of problems.However, these people would be bound by constitutionality, so as not to make any malicious, yet logical laws.I don't think it's a good system. The masses cannot be trusted, no matter how much I feel sorry for them. Leadership talent is few, and educated people are getting more and more rare. THe protections placed in the constitution seem not to work against mass stupidity in legislation and the people.Homosexual marriage and relations aren't recent either. It goes in cycles and was/is found in many cultures and does no objective harm to anyone. Who cares what the Bible says? It's an ancient book of fallacies, mutiple authors, and archaic, bloodythirsty rules. Why treat it with anything other than a literary note? It's not like it's a book of facts, in general.Sure wish those gay activists pushed as hard as the idiotic Fundies on the Right.There should be no debate, because the opposing side has no logic behind their arguments, and since there's no logic, there concusions don't follow from their premises, and most of their premises are untrue anyway.

Fair enough, I agree that governing shouldn't have anything to do with such beliefs. But let's face it: it's a bit of an elitist mentality to automatically assume people are "stupid" if they believe in the supernatural.I don't think there was any U.S. government mandate that set slavery in motion, or women's lack of right to vote--they just weren't included. Either way, the will of the people ultimately prevailed in undoing what people had set in motion as a bad precedent to begin with. There are always going to be evil people in the world, and to hope that along the way, people don't do something bad (like start segregation and racism) is unrealistic as well. Laws are often in place for the sake of dealing with past problems and mistakes.Worldwide, yes. Not here in the U.S.Everything you say sounds good on paper, but in the end people are still the ones inacting it. Judges can still be biased, and I'd rather see the will of a lot of people rather than the will of one judge with no checks and balances on him. The good thing about having the masses decide is that a lot of people have to be in agreement before sweeping change takes place, good or bad.

Yet because enough of the masses realized it was wrong, the law changed.I've heard some argue that there is really no such thing as American poverty. While I wouldn't go that far, I understand why some say that. Because of our welfare system, even our poor here in the U.S. are rich by the standards of many countries. If anything, it underscores how poverty is a relative concept.Still requires someone to have of view of what constitutes such "objective ideology", and as long as there are people involved there is the possibility for bias. It's flawed no matter how you look at it.

FYI, I have live and worked in Mexico for over 15 years. I have spent the night with families of the people who worked for me, in dwellings made of pallets and cardboard, in 20 deg. F temperatures. I have been there. I have lived there. I have been to 3rd world countries. I know how they will respect you IF you respect them. They don't want your selfrighteous pity. They want an opportunity for the same right to live that you so jealously deny them and others.Talk about "The Ugly American".

Thailand is a beautiful country filled with many wonderful people. As for the "research" you're relying on, why don't you conclude that Asian automobile executives "widely practice" pedophilia instead of slandering an entire nation?

Whoa buddy....back up. Not once did I state, suggest or imply that pedophiles were homosexuals. In fact, if you go back to the beginning of this thread, you'd see that I stated pedophiles can be gay, straight or bisexual. I mentioned pedophelia as an example of practices that are condoned in other countries. I agree that pedophelia is illegal in Thailand, but it is still a widely practiced activity. It was a response to Tigerlilly about a country's freedom to make their own laws and not be bound by other country's ideas of morality.

Oh no no no! That's not historically accurate. The reason why slavery was outlawed had  little  to do with rational ethical justifications. The reason slavery was outlawed was due to  punishement  and political advantage. Moral suasion only got a minority of the people.Another major factor in the outlawing of slavery was not a majority support or care for slaves, rather economics and political dangers of it. Slavery simply become obsolete and politically hazardous. It was eliminated out of pragmatism and convenience, not because they wanted to en mass.Of couse American poverty isn't at the level of poverty in third world countries. That's not the issue. Poverty is somewhat relative, but comparing the US poverty to quadamalan poverty is switching goal posts. That wasn't the original claim. The original claim was there is no poverty problem in the US.The Census and Labour bureaus disagree. Poverty doesn't have to equate to the worst poverty in the worst nation on earth for it still to be considered poverty. Democracy is inherently flawed. All human endeavours are, but I would trust trained objective boards over joe bloe and the redneck from Virginia and Kentucky! Get the shotgun Jeb!The fact is that the masses, on average, are not educated or objective enough to efficiently use a vote. THe people elected usually are nothing more than a worthless monied class who got in through somehow duping the poor suckers.You know why he doesn't conclude that? If he did, his acknowledgement of his own "hasty-generalization" fallacy would XXXX away his argument.What research did he provide to prove his statement? Or did he tell you that you were being "childish" when you asked for it.Hahah. That got a good laugh in class.
