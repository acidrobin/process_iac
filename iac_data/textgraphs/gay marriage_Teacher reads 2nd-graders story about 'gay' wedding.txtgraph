http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=49813Society is never going to change its discriminatory ways towards gays and lesbians unless parents stop reacting to things like this in such a negative manner. They would have nothing to say if this were a book about a prince and princess getting married. Some will say that this is inappropriate for this age of children but I totally disagree. It was not about sex, it was about a prince that didn't like girls, fell in love with another prince and got married to him. So what? I have known many children that have known about boys likeing boys and girls likeing girls since they were very young. They are older now and are the most well adjusted, non-judgemental, kind young adults you would ever want to meet. And straight, in case your wondering. The parents say that they would like the opportunity to explain there views about this subject to the child. This is the problem, the parents want to instll bigotry and discimination into there children. Children should learn from the beginning that some girls and boys like each other, sometimes girls and girls and boys and boys like each other just like the boys and girls do. I commend those parents that do actually teach tolerance and acceptance.

Teacher reads 2nd-graders story about 'gay' wedding

Bigots will be bigots. The parents oblivious to their heterosexual privledge. You are right they would never have objected to a story of a prince and princess getting married. The double standard is outragious and an example of their heterosexual privledge.I don't have a problem with removing all gay issues from the schools as long all heterosexual issues are also removed. So what are these parents that protested this book reading going to teach thier children about gay families?

I have to side with the parents on this one. It's one of those issues that many parents would rather be the one to talk to their kids about it, rather than them learning about it from a school teacher. It's yet another case of teachers going past their role of education on the area they're supposed to educate the kids in, and taking on responsibilities the parents should have. I'd feel the same way about a teacher that tried to tell them about heterosexual relationships too. It's not an issue of tolerance and acceptance; its an issue of whether or not parenting is going to be left to the parents.Too many parents want schools to do a parent's job these days. I'll do that myself, as a parent, thank you.

The problem is that heterosexuality is envasive in the schools allready. Need to balance that out. Then again you may not understand being that you are oblivious to the heterosexual privledge that your soak in.

Fine you can do that anyway you want. But don't restrict a PUBLIC school from actually TEACHING your child. I think that's something the general public forgets what is supposed to be done in schools. All too often parents what their child's school to only teach stupid "feel good" classes that don't actually TEACH our children anything. And then we are parents wonder why we cannot compete on an international platform. emoticonXBanghead

I have no disagreement with that, but I also don't think it contradicts in any way what I said.I don't think it's invasive at the 2nd grade level, in the school. At least it shouldn't be--rather than teachers teaching about relationships, I think they should teach about the subjects that schools are there for. You know, Writing, math, elementary science, geography, etc.

That doesn't mean I think there should be NO reading and literature. I just have an issue with those that try to preach morality and/or relationships to kids (even if it doesn't seem preachy). I'd feel that way about pretty much ANYTHING, including religion or heterosexual relationships. Remember, these are 2nd graders we are talking about here. They're into Clifford, Dr. Suess, etc. Teaching them about marriage just seems to me like something parents ought to do. I have a feeling you'd feel differently if it were your kid hearing something about marriage YOU disagree with. How would you feel if you found out there was a teacher reading a story to 2nd graders about a wife who stays home and cooks all day, and is submissive to her husband? I wouldn't want that read either, but the point is that leaving issues related to relationships up to 2nd grade teachers is something I for one would rather not do, period. That's just me, though. This isn't about one view over another, it's about whether or not the education system is to be relied on for teaching values, instead of parents. I'd feel the same way no matter what the issue.

First of all, please don't confuse me with the close-minded. I don't feel a need to only fill my own and my child's mind with only things I agree with or a fractioned view of the world. Nor have I ever been much of a censor. When he asked me about sex in the 1st grade, I answered his questions. When he was three he had two classmates in pre-school with two daddies. I told him that sometimes boys fall in love with boys and girls fall in love with girls. It was as simple as that. As soon as he was able to hold a conversation, he knew about the evils of violence and that there are people in this world who hurt other people. My son watches the news. He is aware of the world he lives in. He is a heck of a kid. I have even let him see things I don't like or agree with - but I tell him why I don't like or agree with them. All knowledge is more power for him. He is ten times more armed and capable than these paranoid parents second graders will be. I would say he posseses more maturity and a better check on reality than THE PARENTS. The only things I would concern myself about is the teaching of religion in an un-academic manner, the display of porn, or gratuitiuous violence. Literature does and should speak of all of us. The book was age level appropriate and spoke of a portion of the world these children live in. It could have been opportunity for these parents to discuss this matter with their kids, even talk about how they feel about it. Instead these kids get to learn that the world should just be what they want it to be - rather than be what it is. They learn they should shut down the things they personally don't like or understand, than ever bothering to understand them.By the way, are suggesting that every child's book that has characters that reside in any kind of family setting should be banned from schools?And to answer your question about the submissive husband and wife story - go ahead and read it to him. My son already knows I don't agree with it. I am OK with him knowing that some people do.

Fair enough. Parenting is one of those things that every parent has their own opinions about how to do it. I won't condemn your style of parenting if you won't condemn mine. The main thing is that we respect each parent's right to do it as they feel is right. Speaking for myself, I'd rather be the one to teach my 2nd grader about these things.

Knock me over with a feather!Well then, have at it. The theme of the day was weddings. Almost everything taught that day, except for this one story, was about heterosexual marriage. Go on, show us your argument against teaching kids about how this society organizes familes.Your opposition to this, homo- or heterosexual, is so obviously contrived. School is there to help socialize children and instruct them in how to be good members of this society, AND YOU KNOW IT. The idea that you would prefer them to ignore discussions of family -- while you simultaneously assert that this society rests on the family and tradition -- is ludicrous.Come on, jyoshu, you don't have to argue this one... we won't tell your supervisor.

Do you not think you could state a point, instead of asking rhetorical questions? :)Whenever parents want something to not be taught in school, it's almost inevitably because they have one very specific, narrow view on that topic, and they don't want their children exposed to any ideas which contradict that view. And I've never heard of a good, wholesome point of view that couldn't stand up to exposure to another idea. Whenever parents are afraid of having their narrow views challeneged it's becuase they know that they won't stand up to comparison with another idea. They know their stand is indefensible. And of course the most common indefinsible views these days are based on prejudice and biggotry. So assuming that the parents who are pushing censorship are doing so based on prejudice is not a big leap.

Now, now, that's not very nice.You said, "I think it's an issue of the parents wanting to ensure that they can teach their kids the prejudices that they have, instead of allowing the kid to get all sides of the issue..."Given that you're saying you never meant their motives could only be bad, what is it about this situation, then, that makes you think they ARE bad? Given that you were talking about this situation when you made the comment. What's different with this situation than one where motives AREN'T bad?Why do you assume that THIS situation isn't parents making their decision without prejudice?I think the situation given  in that article  is one such example. Unless of course you can definitively prove prejudice played a role. I tend to think it's better to make provable accusations than non-provable, such as in the case of accusing them of prejudice. In what way did they do that? What, specifically, makes you think it's prejudice? Please restate your question and I'll do my best to answer it.

Do you really think you'll get an honest answer from that question?

Absolutely; the issue is not with Worldnet, yet you are using things Worldnet said as examples if why you think the parents were motivated by bigotry. The parents didn't say "traditional values organization;" Worldnet used that phrase so I find it odd you are using THAT to exemplify bigotry on the part of the parents. Do see what I'm saying here?It's controversial because there is enormous disagree about it and a great many people don't agree with the state. Sort of like the abortion issue--it's a controversial one as well.No, the school should not ban those children. So the only controversial issue you DO think 2nd graders should be exposed to is that of gay marriage?Are you familiar with logical fallacies? Do you not realize that by expecting me to prove they weren't bigoted when you've claimed they are (without proof), you are asking me to prove a negative? That's not the way sound argumentation works. No, you don't have to prove your assertion that it was bigotry that motivated these parents, but without it, it's hard to take your accusations seriously. You're basically saying here "they're bigoted, now prove they're not." I'm saying, you gotta first prove their bigoted. Otherwise, why should I believe you? (shrug)Some homeschooled familes are one such example. Another is this case. Sometimes parents just don't want their kids around a lot of controversy. And it stands to reason that they know their kids best. (and by the way, this was in the news on general sites too, before you start in on it being WorldnetDaily.)I don't think I've dodged your question. I really do believe the parents in the article here are an example of what you're asking for.I am not lying, and it amazes me that you accuse me of such when I can prove my claim so readily...The point is that I'm not the one making that statement or using that term ("crashed").

Do you have evidence that the worldnetdaily organization lied about their claim?Because if you don't, you're babbling away about nothing of worth.So you're advocating that we hide all reality for "controversial issues" from 2nd graders?Is that what you're advocating?Then how do you rectify the situation?If the kids shouldn't hear about gay marriage or gay parenting, but they're going to because they ACTUALLY KNOW a child being raised by such, what do you do?Stick your head in the sand?You're trying to side-track the issue with irrelevant questions. I see no point in it.There are a lot of things people can see as "controversial". Some should probably not be presented to 2nd graders. Some are "controversial" because some XXXXXX make them so, and the children of those XXXXXX can be catered to, but in no way should that require that no 2nd grader hear about it.Satisfied?Do you know what "proving a negative" actually means with regards to logical fallacies?Your response demonstrates that you don't.If I asked you to prove that God doesn't exist, that would be requiring a negative proof.If I asked you to prove that John wasn't at the bar on Saturday night, and he spent the entire week-end in jail, some would claim that would also be asking for proof of a "negative", but obviously it COULD BE PROVED.Likewise, if you can show a NON-BIGOTTED motivation for this couple, and PROVE that non-bigotted motivation, THAT would be proof.So don't try to malign "logical fallacies" in your efforts to avoid proving this.And ironically, do you realize your argument would have defended my position in the whole "egg roll" thing???? Ever think about that???<snort>YOU are never going to take any assertion that disagrees with you seriously.That was proven in the egg roll thing.I had a very simple assertion. Like a "red car" needs to be both "red" and a "car", a "political message" needs to be both "political" and a "message".Yet in all of that, I don't think you saw my position "seriously" at all....MAN you lie like a rug!I'm saying "I THINK they're bigotted, and this is why...If you CLAIM they aren't bigotted, and you want others to take you seriously, you need to provide the SAME PROOF that you demand from others."I was VERY EXPLICIT in my request.And you continue to be disingenuous in obfuscating your response...Your responses do not even say ANYTHING about homosexuality, and thus are completely non-topical and irrelevant to my question.Why don't you scrounge up some honesty, and actually just say "No. I don't have any specific and verifiable examples of what you ask..."Of course you don't "think"...... that you dodged my question.You keep answering with things that aren't what I asked for.It's like asking: "What's 2+2?", and you answer "Green".I asked for the following: "Have you ever heard of a situation where parents insisted their kids not be taught about homosexuality, because the parents wanted to insist that it be they who teach their kid about homosexuality in a manner devoid of prejudice, while teaching all sides of the issue?"You have shown NO EVIDENCE that they want their kid out of this class "because the parents wanted to insist that it be they who teach their kid about homosexuality in a manner devoid of prejudice, while teaching all sides of the issue".Until you do, it's like asking for proof of Santa Clause, and you reply that you think he's in a Dairy Queen in Kentucky...(But supply no proof of your claim...)So you claimed that the article summed it up quite nicely, but said ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about the title...... which you now claim "went over the top"...Well, I guess your backpedalling on that is about as good as we can expect...Now if we can just get you to admit that the anti-gay families involved were egregious in their protest, THAT would be something...

A "lot of people" may not like it (a minority in Massachusetts, by the way) but same-sex weddings are legal and do take place in Massachusetts. I suppose you could argue that the teacher has no business telling the kids that adults get married.But that would make you very odd, I think.

Religion is a controversial issue, does that mean schools shouldn't tell young kids anything about religion?

Well what is the root cause of that outrage? Who and which group is making a legal issue contraversial? I did notice that the parents that complained were members of the group that is fighting the civil rights of gay people. What groups do the only parents to complain belong too? They are the ones who do not want to acknowledge that same sex marriages are a reality. I think that a better discussion with the children would be a story about groups that want to harm others in our society. Such as certain christian groups that do not want others to be free. Maybe I will write a childrens book.

Dude, are you even trying to follow this thread?? I don't think you are. I'm not saying they're lying. I don't know if they are or not, nor do I care in this case because it has nothing really to do with our discussion. YOU used something worldnet said to "prove" the parents were bigoted, and of course that doesn't work. You are SO trying to obfuscate here, it's hilarious. Tell you what, see if you can go back through my posts and find where I claimed that we should hide "ALL reality" for controversial issues from 2nd graders. That way at least you will have done your homework and it will help you aviod asking embarassing questions that are all-to-easy to verify, as in this case.That said, I see no good reason to drag 2nd graders into the issue of abortion, the death penalty ("gee dad, how DO they execute criminals?"), homosexuality, or any other controversial social issue. They're 2nd graders, for goodness' sake!

You don't have to go into the ins-and-outs of homosexuality or give them a lesson on the differences between heterosexuals and homosexuals. Suffice it to say that 2nd Graders are going to be fine with simply the explanation that "Joey has two dads" or "Billy has 2 moms." Those aren't statements about sexuality. There's not even any indication that "Joey's dads" are in a homosexual relationship. Of course, I get the impression you'd want to make sure they know it. I see no more reason to explain homosexuality to a 2nd grader than to explain heterosexuality to a 2nd grader. It's silly.Pot, meet Mr. Kettle. Oh wait, you two met long ago already.Whoa!

Yes, that's expecting me to prove a negative. Would you like a link to a site explaining logical fallacies so you can read up on them?I don't need to prove something based on what YOU'VE asserted. Again, it's like you making an argument that the earth is flat and expecting everyone else to prove it's round. Why should you not be expected to prove your premise to even be taken seriously? When you offer some proof, maybe I'll take it seriously. You've made a very serious accusation here by saying these parents are bigoted. Such an accusation needs to backed up substantively. I don't think that's too much to ask . . . if someone accused YOU of bigotry you'd want them to prove it, right? This isn't rocket science.[QUOTE=foundit66]I asked for the following: "Have you ever heard of a situation where parents insisted their kids not be taught about homosexuality, because the parents wanted to insist that it be they who teach their kid about homosexuality in a manner devoid of prejudice, while teaching all sides of the issue?"And I said yes, I have. The article was one such example. If that's not good enough for you, it's your problem. I also gave you homeschooling as an example of parents who prefer to be the ones to teach their kids about controversial issues, AND I gave you a link to another such case. It seems you aren't really reading my posts.It's more like a case of you saying Santa exists, me saying "you're going to have to offer some proof" and then you expecting me to give you cases where Santa HASN'T been seen as proof of my position that he's not real. Remember, YOU made the assertion here of bigotry.It's telling that you'd rather argue the title than the article itself. I guess it presents an easier challenge for you.I've already addressed that. (Proof again you aren't even really reading the thread very much.) But I'll say it again: I think there was no need for their counter-protest. The gay families at the easter event weren't getting out of hand or anything.

Do you have evidence that the worldnetdaily organization lied about their claim?Because if you don't, you're babbling away about nothing of worth.So you're advocating that we hide all reality for "controversial issues" from 2nd graders?Is that what you're advocating?Then how do you rectify the situation?If the kids shouldn't hear about gay marriage or gay parenting, but they're going to because they ACTUALLY KNOW a child being raised by such, what do you do?Stick your head in the sand?You're trying to side-track the issue with irrelevant questions. I see no point in it.There are a lot of things people can see as "controversial". Some should probably not be presented to 2nd graders. Some are "controversial" because some XXXXXX make them so, and the children of those XXXXXX can be catered to, but in no way should that require that no 2nd grader hear about it.Satisfied?Do you know what "proving a negative" actually means with regards to logical fallacies?Your response demonstrates that you don't.If I asked you to prove that God doesn't exist, that would be requiring a negative proof.If I asked you to prove that John wasn't at the bar on Saturday night, and he spent the entire week-end in jail, some would claim that would also be asking for proof of a "negative", but obviously it COULD BE PROVED.Likewise, if you can show a NON-BIGOTTED motivation for this couple, and PROVE that non-bigotted motivation, THAT would be proof.So don't try to malign "logical fallacies" in your efforts to avoid proving this.And ironically, do you realize your argument would have defended my position in the whole "egg roll" thing???? Ever think about that???<snort>YOU are never going to take any assertion that disagrees with you seriously.That was proven in the egg roll thing.I had a very simple assertion. Like a "red car" needs to be both "red" and a "car", a "political message" needs to be both "political" and a "message".Yet in all of that, I don't think you saw my position "seriously" at all....MAN you lie like a rug!I'm saying "I THINK they're bigotted, and this is why...If you CLAIM they aren't bigotted, and you want others to take you seriously, you need to provide the SAME PROOF that you demand from others."I was VERY EXPLICIT in my request.And you continue to be disingenuous in obfuscating your response...Your responses do not even say ANYTHING about homosexuality, and thus are completely non-topical and irrelevant to my question.Why don't you scrounge up some honesty, and actually just say "No. I don't have any specific and verifiable examples of what you ask..."Of course you don't "think"...... that you dodged my question.You keep answering with things that aren't what I asked for.It's like asking: "What's 2+2?", and you answer "Green".I asked for the following: "Have you ever heard of a situation where parents insisted their kids not be taught about homosexuality, because the parents wanted to insist that it be they who teach their kid about homosexuality in a manner devoid of prejudice, while teaching all sides of the issue?"You have shown NO EVIDENCE that they want their kid out of this class "because the parents wanted to insist that it be they who teach their kid about homosexuality in a manner devoid of prejudice, while teaching all sides of the issue".Until you do, it's like asking for proof of Santa Clause, and you reply that you think he's in a Dairy Queen in Kentucky...(But supply no proof of your claim...)So you claimed that the article summed it up quite nicely, but said ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about the title...... which you now claim "went over the top"...Well, I guess your backpedalling on that is about as good as we can expect...Now if we can just get you to admit that the anti-gay families involved were egregious in their protest, THAT would be something...

Oh, now THAT would be something to read! I can see it now . . . a children's book on how to get retribution, revenge, and eye-for-an eye persecution of religious people.

Well what is the root cause of that outrage? Who and which group is making a legal issue contraversial? I did notice that the parents that complained were members of the group that is fighting the civil rights of gay people. What groups do the only parents to complain belong too? They are the ones who do not want to acknowledge that same sex marriages are a reality. I think that a better discussion with the children would be a story about groups that want to harm others in our society. Such as certain christian groups that do not want others to be free. Maybe I will write a childrens book.

Two very good reasons, at least for mentioning same-sex relationships. One, some of the kids probably know someone with gay parents. Two, and frankly much more important, in a class of 30 kids, several ARE gay and they need to know it's OK. Because IT IS.But that's PRECISELY what the teacher was doing. Quite appropriately, she was having a class day focused on marriage. Until this year, it was only about heterosexual marriage. It's called learning.You're starting to look pretty silly, arguing against a book written for second-graders because the subject should be brought up in a way geared towards second-graders.

You know, this whole "controversial issues" aspect is just plain XXXX.A parent has a right to object to what HIS CHILD hears on the issue if THAT parent thinks it is too controversial.And if enough parents feel the same, and can get their policy enforced to age restrict the school lessons, so be it.But here we have a couple of parental couple group...That's it, unless somebody can point out more in this school...So if the rest of the parents don't have a problem with perceptions of "controversy" and "age", let their kids be taught...Just because some religious XXXXXX throw up a stink over an issue doesn't mean the rest of the parents, who may not have such a problem with "controversy", shouldn't be allowed to have their kids taught...If enough parents throw a controversy over evolution, does that mean the science of evolution cannot be taught in schools??There comes a point where the "controversy" is just an excuse to prevent something from being taught. A self-justifying excuse, as the person can support the "controversy", and then use the fact that he's helping to make it a "controversy" as an excuse not to teach...

Hmm . . . I did some searching on this and can't really find much on it either way (whether or not teachers are allowed to deviate from or add to approved curriculum in schools). Logically, I would think they can't, or at least would be discouraged from it. If they could then there would be nothing to stop a teacher from, upon finishing the approved science textbook, bringing out a religious text to go into intelligent design, for instance. This isn't so much censorship, because there is still nothing to stop the teacher from giving his or opinion. But utilizing a different text that the school's approved curriculum would be going too far, I would think. I can't prove it in this case (yet) because I so far haven't been able to find much on this issue. So, I could be wrong. If anyone else knows of a site that gives light on this subject, could you please let us know? I suspect the issue is also complicated by the fact that it could largely be determined by the indivdual schools instead of any "law of the land."But even with all that said, I still find it noteworthy that this was a case where the teacher acted outside of approved curriculum--a fact that shouldn't go unnoticed.

So essentially, your reasoning for the issue of homosexuality and/or gay parenting to be taught in the classroom is that gay people are sometimes ridiculed and teased. The problem I see with that reasoning is that there are many things for which kids get teased in which that reasoning is never applied. By your standards, we should be teaching kids not just about gay people, but bullied people, short people, people with deformities, people who wear glasses, people who who don't have many friends, people who are religious, people who have lisps . . . . the list goes on and on and on to the point where it would take all the time a teacher had. Why does the issue of homosexuality get special treatment here? Don't get me wrong; I do think your reasoning is honorable. I don't think people should be ridiculed and teased for ANY reason, being gay included. But I think the way to deal with that is to teach kids not to tease for ANY reason, and to be sensitive to the feelings of other people. That way ALL reasons for teasing are covered. My opinion is that schools should really focus on standard educational disciplines (math, science, HOW to read, geography, etc.) rather than playing the active role of shaping a child's social and cultural views and ideologies. Bullying and teasing can be combatted a number of other ways.

My opinion is that schools should really focus on standard educational disciplines (math, science, HOW to read, geography, etc.) rather than playing the active role of shaping a child's social and cultural views and ideologies. Bullying and teasing can be combatted a number of other ways.

But we're not just talking about deviating from the lesson plan here, we're talking about using texts that are not part of the school's curriculum. No one here is talking about a teacher merely giving his or her own opinions or deviating from the lesson plan. But I doubt you ever had a teacher who used a different textbook or gave an assigned reading book outside of what the school approved. I could be wrong, of course. Aside from all that . . . . Look, it seems very clear that you and I have gotten off on the wrong foot here for whatever reason. It just does neither of us any good to call each other names, be rude, ask very pointed rhetorical questions intent to be rude, or make snide comments about each other. I just have no interest in continuing that type of exchange. I think we would both enjoy dialog with each other much more if we just made it a point to be civil and respecting of each others' opinions. What do you say? Shall we each start anew here and do this a better way? I'll start myself by saying that whatever insults I've thrown at you, I apologize. And really, even if you aren't interested in "cleaning things up" as well, I'm going to endeavor to be respectful to you, regardless of what you do or don't do. How 'bout it? Deal? emoticonXHoho

Hmm . . . I did some searching on this and can't really find much on it either way (whether or not teachers are allowed to deviate from or add to approved curriculum in schools). Logically, I would think they can't, or at least would be discouraged from it. If they could then there would be nothing to stop a teacher from, upon finishing the approved science textbook, bringing out a religious text to go into intelligent design, for instance. This isn't so much censorship, because there is still nothing to stop the teacher from giving his or opinion. But utilizing a different text that the school's approved curriculum would be going too far, I would think. I can't prove it in this case (yet) because I so far haven't been able to find much on this issue. So, I could be wrong. If anyone else knows of a site that gives light on this subject, could you please let us know? I suspect the issue is also complicated by the fact that it could largely be determined by the indivdual schools instead of any "law of the land."But even with all that said, I still find it noteworthy that this was a case where the teacher acted outside of approved curriculum--a fact that shouldn't go unnoticed.

You'd better take that up with people who only believe in the Old Testament. (Or if you really want to do a good thing, stop the attempts to chain yank with such off-beat comments altogether. emoticonXGood Otherwise, the religion forum is that way ----> )

I hope with all my heart that your kids aren't gay.Back to square one on sexuality again, eh? What a loser.My sexual orientation was fully set and I knew it at that age. You, apparently, are still in the undecided category.What, in your fevered imagination, do you think the teacher did, show a porn video? She read a book. A book about love.That's what really gets you, isn't it?The teacher spent the rest of the day talking about HETEROsexual weddings.Ooooo... I'm outraged.y a w nP.S. Are they paying you by the word now?

Even if that's true, why is it a reason for them to be taught about it? So what if they have a friend somewhere with a gay dad? They probably know kids with a left-handed parent as well; they might even know a kid who had a dad in prison. Would you raise a stink about THOSE cases possibly not getting read to the kids as you're doing here? Why does this even need to be an issue? Furthermore, since gays make up less than 10% of the population (probably closer to 5% if stats out there are true), and an even smaller percentage are gay AND parents, then chances are that few of them know someone with a gay parent. In other words, it's really not that common. I wonder how many books out there focus on single-parent families, or kids being raised by grandparents. Or maybe kids that are on the street with no parents. Probably not many. I just find it odd that only with books about gay parents do some people seem to think it's crucial for some unknown reason to make sure everyone knows about it. As if somehow kids are going to be damaged if they don't know that kids exist being raised by a gay mom or dad. Or more importantly, that they might be damaged if we actually dare leave it up to the parents to explain such issues. Wow--actually trusting parents to prepare their kids for life . . . . imagine that. emoticonXRolleyes Maybe, maybe not. We don't really know how developed "sexual orientation" is at 2nd grade. Assuming sexual orientation is even really any more than an vague concept that's gotten blown WAY out of proportion because the gay rights movement jumped all over it.So you'd really be fine with limiting the 2nd graders to what I said, and not going into what it means to be gay or even bringing up being gay? (riiiight.) There's a difference between saying a kid has 2 dads, and saying the kid has a gay parent. I don't think the class limited the discussion to 2 parents of the same gender, or there wouldn't have been such a fallout over it.You know, at the end of the day, this all comes down to whether or not we think it's ok for parents (instead of schools) to determine what they think is right for their kids to be exposed to, and when, regarding controversial social issues. I think it's absolutely fascinating that some of you can't seem to agree that they should just because of your pet issues being at stake. The same people who are acting like it's some gawd-awful tragedy that some parents objected to this would probably be the first to raise a stink if the teacher read a book about something disagreeable from THEIR point of view. Imagine if the teacher actually read a book that mentioned God or focused on a household with a mom and a dad.

Careful, jyoshu, I can hear the rumbling thunder from way out on the left coast. Everyone else, step away from jyoshu. He's about to get zapped!

So essentially, your reasoning for the issue of homosexuality and/or gay parenting to be taught in the classroom is that gay people are sometimes ridiculed and teased. The problem I see with that reasoning is that there are many things for which kids get teased in which that reasoning is never applied. By your standards, we should be teaching kids not just about gay people, but bullied people, short people, people with deformities, people who wear glasses, people who who don't have many friends, people who are religious, people who have lisps . . . . the list goes on and on and on to the point where it would take all the time a teacher had. Why does the issue of homosexuality get special treatment here? Don't get me wrong; I do think your reasoning is honorable. I don't think people should be ridiculed and teased for ANY reason, being gay included. But I think the way to deal with that is to teach kids not to tease for ANY reason, and to be sensitive to the feelings of other people. That way ALL reasons for teasing are covered.

Yet all of those are examples of controversial issues in our society. That's why they were grouped together in this situation. But didn't you really already know that? What does that have to do with wanting to be the one to guide them instead a teacher I really don't know that well? Isn't a parent taking responsibility a good thing?If they did turn out to be gay, I'd love them no less. Not that it's really any of your business in the first place.You already were physically and romantically attracted to people in the 2nd grade?? No offense, but I find that hard to believe. You would have to have set the historical record for early puberty.

You have a point, but kids getting killed because they are gay isn't that common either, really. I'm not belittling it, I'm just stating the truth. It's not like kids getting killed for being gay happens often. (Of course, 1 time is too many, but the point here is that kids are tormented for numerous reasons, and I think of we are going to take one reason and make it a big issue in our schools, we have to fairly take all the reasons it happens. But the best solution is to let schools educate on the basic subjects (math, science, HOW to read, geography, etc.) and leave the social ideology issues up to mom and dad. (Or dad and dad, or mom and mom, I suppose, given the topic. :) )In that case, I could agree here, although I still think the better way is to let the parents take care of that.
attacks
How many times have you heard about a kid getting KILLED because he wore glasses?Tormented, including by the SCHOOL STAFF, to the extent that the kid had to leave school?I would think the other issues should also be included in a general discussion.But I think circumstances demonstrate that special attention should be shown on the areas that have received more trouble...

I know precisely what makes you bring up negative comparisons all the time. It's in your manual under "Tried and True".Perhaps. Chances are quite high, though, that they'd hate themselves.Oh, the general upbringing of children is only YOUR business. I see.I tried to give another boy a Valentine in grade school... first or second grade. The teacher asked who it was for. I told her. She ripped it up and told me to write a new one to a girl.You find everything you don't like hard to believe. Puberty has nothing to do with orientation. Were you completely uninterested in girls until your balls dropped? Maybe you were just way behind the curve.

It seems to me a bigger indicator would have been your attractions, since that's generally how "sexual orientation" is determined. I don't believe a 1st or 2nd grader is really capable of serious romantic attractions. Maybe fondness or admiration, certainly. But physical attraction? No.I agree puberty and "orientation" are not the same thing. But I don't believe "orientation" can really be determined until puberty starts setting in. Maybe you were just an enigma.

Ok, so we don't go out of our way to teach children about homosexuality. But when it does come up, what do you think the parents are saying with such protest? Aren't they sending their kids a message that will definitely help form their views and would most likely lead to a gay child or a child of gay parents being harmed emotionally by their intolerance?

Parents often don't talk about this with their children because they assume their children are not gay or are not going to be gay. So they stay quiet. Once the child realizes the parents position it causes a rift among them and the relationship becomes more and more distant as the child ages. The gay child feels rejected, guilty and unworthy of living. This is from my experiences and the experiences of just about every gay person I know.

Why do you think he has this view? "I think there are people who have a real agenda that they're trying to promote and teach the children", Wirthlin said.Could this possibly be contrued as her wanting to teach her child about homosexuality in a manner devoid of all prejudice, while teaching all sides of the issue like foundit66 said?

Why do assume their motivations could only be bad? Do you not think there is any possibility of parents who simply want to be sure they're the ones who teach their kids about it, with no prejudice? Do you not think parents themselves are capable of teaching all sides of the issue?

I think it depends on the motivations of the parents. If they are doing it because they don't like gay people, then yes. If they are doing it because they would prefer themselves being the ones to guide their children on such issues, then not necessarily. It seems that you feel there are only 2 possible outcomes here: kids being gay and their parents fully accepting it, or kids being gay and thinking their parents hate them or them hating themselves. But I know of people who struggled with being gay as well, and their parents made it clear to them they loved them dearly but couldn't condone gay behavior. These kids didn't hate themselves, they knew their parents loved them but also had to stick to their moral beliefs. It's the same idea as when a parent finds out their kid is into any sort of behavior that a parent doesn't approve of. They can still show enormous love to the kids without condoning that behavior. Sure, these kids struggled with their desires (as anyone would who struggles with an issue), but they came through it and live pretty normal lives, and learned that libido isn't everything. I'm just saying that the two outcomes you are proposing may not be the only possibilities.I myself struggled with temptations (not related to this) in other areas as a kid. My parents loved me, and I know they loved me, but they didn't approve of everything I did. Before I come to definite conclusions here, I'd prefer to hear about or from people who struggled with gay tempation in their youth, but realized later that their parents didn't hate them and actually loved them, and learned to live fullfilling lives. There are people like that out there--some of them are in what you'd probably call the ex-gay movement. I appreciate your input. And maybe you are right on this. Ok, but what about parents who have definite religious beliefs that homosexual behavior is wrong? How can we expect them to not raise their kids the way they believe is right?

Well as a parent I feel pretty strongly that if I am advocating against a certain behavoir my child os displaying, it had better be because I have HIS BEST INTERESTS in mind. Every reputable medical and psychological organization has made it clear that attempting to not be gay when you are IS NOT IN YOUR BEST INTEREST. It is mean and hateful to expect your child to live a lie or live alone to appease a religion - and quite frankly one of the most UNLOVING things a parent could do.

If I'm not mistaken, the schoolbook in question was used the year before also. With no problems. If the school wanted to exclude the book from their "approved" list, they would have done so. But instead, they defended it.Ergo, I think it's fairly obvious that the book is fine.I have never heard of any teacher getting in trouble for what you describe.Once again, for the "pro-gay" perspectives, you are adopting ridiculously stringent rules.I respect honesty.When I see consistent honesty from you, you'll be treated accordingly.And you should take it to heart that I don't say that as an intended insult, but rather precisely as how I see some of your posts.I really don't care about any "insults" you've thrown my way. The only time "insults" become a deal for me is when somebody uses them INSTEAD OF responding to the argument. If somebody uses them in conjunction with their arguments, I really couldn't care less.Being a gay man, you develop a thick hide against simple words and names.If I see dishonesty, I'll make a point of pointing it out.I expect nothing less from anybody else.

I've asked this question before with no tangible response.WHY should the "moral dilemma" of two sets of parents restrict ALL the kids of the other parents from hearing this story or getting taught in the manner that the rest of the parents want it taught?If Parents of children A and B see something as a "moral dilemma", but Parents of children C through Z have no such dilemma, why should two of the parents make policy for the majority?To put it in another perspective, if people want "majority rules" and "democracy" for the "gay marriage" issue, then why wouldn't that same thinking apply here?Okay. I just HAVE to know this now.Do you actually KNOW ANY gay people?Do you know any gay people on a "friends" basis where if they called you up on a Friday night, you wouldn't be shocked?Because I AM a gay man who has heard a variety of stories from people who experienced discrimination first hand, and my perspective and "experience" is quite the opposite of yours.

If I'm not mistaken, the schoolbook in question was used the year before also. With no problems. If the school wanted to exclude the book from their "approved" list, they would have done so. But instead, they defended it.Ergo, I think it's fairly obvious that the book is fine.I have never heard of any teacher getting in trouble for what you describe.Once again, for the "pro-gay" perspectives, you are adopting ridiculously stringent rules.I respect honesty.When I see consistent honesty from you, you'll be treated accordingly.And you should take it to heart that I don't say that as an intended insult, but rather precisely as how I see some of your posts.I really don't care about any "insults" you've thrown my way. The only time "insults" become a deal for me is when somebody uses them INSTEAD OF responding to the argument. If somebody uses them in conjunction with their arguments, I really couldn't care less.Being a gay man, you develop a thick hide against simple words and names.If I see dishonesty, I'll make a point of pointing it out.I expect nothing less from anybody else.

I think I mis-phrased my earlier statement.There is a difference between something not being on the "prescribed" list, and something being on the "excluded" list.I see it more as a "curriculum" which directs the teacher to discuss different types of religion, and then gives examples of Christianity, Jewish, and Muslim.If the teacher wants to also discuss "Hindus", I have no problem with that.If the teacher THE YEAR BEFORE discussed "Hindus", and the school DEFENDED that act, then that demonstrates that it's not an issue.I have explicitly stated when I saw you being dishonest. If you want to discuss my rationale behind my assessment, I am open.If not, your denial is incredibly empty.If you want to discuss any specific instance, I am more than happy to.You ever hear of somebody telling another person, "You are insulting my intelligence"?I am usually pretty flexible. When I see somebody being reasonable and honest, I treat them accordingly.If I see them acting beyond reason and with dishonesty, I see no reason to pretend non-existent respect.Example of irrational? Complaining about gays "protesting" an event they have tickets for, when there is no sign of "protest" beyond colored leis, while you ignore the bigots at the fence with the bull-horns and picket signs that demonstrate ACTUAL protesting...And then you "commend" some conservatives, while making no mention of the people who were actually disruptive...You reveal wayyyyy too often where your opinion truly lies."Actions" sometimes speak louder than words...

But the teacher admitted it wasn't part of the approved curriculum, so it was excluded from their approved list.With all due respect, I've never been anything but honest with you. It's the tone, petty insults, and rude comments that I'm talking about, that you and I both know we let ourselves sink to. This isn't good dialogue and does no one any good. I hope we can both do better than that, and I certainly plan to.

I understand what you're saying and ultimately the school will have to make the descision, not the parents. Well, let's keep in mind that none of the parents are in the position to make policy here. The school does that. It's their descision what to do, and chances are they will continue to allow the book to be read. I agree with you that one set of parents shouldn't be given precendent over everyone else, but that's not really what I'm arguing for. I'm arguing that the parents who are objecting are certainly within their right to protest, and should be looked on no differently than any parent doing what they feel is best for their kids.Yes, I do. Yes. One of my best friends is gay; though he moved to a different town a couple of years ago. I don't disagree with you at all that gay people are sometimes discriminated against. I agree with you on that 100%. I'm just saying that, from what I've seen, most of the opposition to homosexuality on religious grounds is based in religion, and most of it is people simply trying to do what they think is right. Whether they are ill-informed is a different matter, but many times their motives are not evil. They really do believe that homosexuality is a sin. It's not bigotry, it's their religious belief. This is what I've seen, and I've been around a LOT of Christian people of that mindset. (I'm an ex-fundie.)

I've asked this question before with no tangible response.WHY should the "moral dilemma" of two sets of parents restrict ALL the kids of the other parents from hearing this story or getting taught in the manner that the rest of the parents want it taught?If Parents of children A and B see something as a "moral dilemma", but Parents of children C through Z have no such dilemma, why should two of the parents make policy for the majority?To put it in another perspective, if people want "majority rules" and "democracy" for the "gay marriage" issue, then why wouldn't that same thinking apply here?Okay. I just HAVE to know this now.Do you actually KNOW ANY gay people?Do you know any gay people on a "friends" basis where if they called you up on a Friday night, you wouldn't be shocked?Because I AM a gay man who has heard a variety of stories from people who experienced discrimination first hand, and my perspective and "experience" is quite the opposite of yours.

Excuse me, but a definitive "NO" to part of your statement...Yes. They should be allowed to protest. I don't see anybody denying them that right.No to the second part. It may be your opinion that these parents "should be looked on no differently"...But that just ain't gonna happen.People are judged on their actions. Sometimes, on their sexual orientations.I find it ironic that people who would judge me based on my sexual orientation should be excluded from being judged based on their actions.Have you ever talked to him about your statements that you have made on this message board?Both with this ID that you are now using, and others that you have used in the past?Blink! Blink!Didn't we already have a similar discussion?ALL BIGOTS are doing what they think is right, sometimes based on religion.The terrorists who flew their plane into the Twin Towers thought they were doing right.I'm curious.Would you be willing to apply this philosophy to muslim extremist terrorism?Religious belief CAN BE bigotry.There is nothing that mutually excludes the two.I have no doubt that they are of that mindset. It's a mindset which demonizes something they truly don't understand. Passing judgment on something based on the orders of the Bible. A book which has NUMEROUS other orders which the Christians have already disregarded as antiquated and not "right".It's the type of thinking that would tell a black man "nothing personal" as the white man insists on segregation...

Not necessarily. Every year schools go through a curriculum approval process. It's a yearly thing; in other words what was 'approved' or 'prescribed'' or 'defended' one year may in fact not be the next. I addressed this earlier already, and I quote: "I think there was no need for their counter-protest. The gay families at the easter event weren't getting out of hand or anything."In other words, I agreed with you! Did you not see where I wrote that?Oh, and FWIW, another good reason for us to cease and desist things like calling each other a liar (when we're not lying) and throwing insults is simply that it's against the forum rules.

This is the only "ID" I've used.He certainly knows my views, and he agrees with me on a lot of it--he's a Christian man who used to struggle greatly with gay desires. Now he's married and has kids, and loves his life! That's not to say he doesn't deal with temptation from time to time--just like any person who is tempted to do things he feels is wrong. But he's an excellent case of someone who has successfully learned to live a fulfilled life when he was gay. And frankly, his experience and comments is a lot of the reason I don't put much stock in the gay pride movements' insistence that gay's can't change, and that they can only be miserable if they try. It's hard to take that seriously when you've seen the very opposite played out in the life of someone you know very well.In my opinion, bigotry is a motivation. So is religion. Religion is a belief in God, and the doctrines. I see religion as something different than bigotry.The muslims that attacked on 9/11 had an extreme hatred of America. THAT was bigotry. If they had been following religion, they wouldn't have participated in the attack because the Koran does not condone their actions. Their's was a case where bigotry superceded their religion. It wasn't one and the same. So I disagree; I think religion in and of itself is benign. It is when religion becomes controlled by bigotry that problems arise.

You claim you're for civil unions.But then you spend (from what I have seen) virtually ALL of your time criticizing gay people...And when an opportunity comes up to criticize the anti-gay side, you either ignore it or water it down...(Thus, the reason I keep mentioning the "egg roll" thing with your limited comments on the egregious and disruptive nature of the anti-gay side...I was actually trying to give you a chance to correct the oversight.

This sounds so much like my cousin. He was raised in a very strict pentecostal family. He was gay. When he admited this to his family they had absolutely no tolerance for this whatsoever. So he really felt as if he had no choice but to become "ex-gay". He felt so pressured that he found a girl, had 3 children, would profess how happy he was with his life. He even tried to talk me into the same path he took. We lost touch for about 8 years. I started dating a guy and when he realized my last name he said "hey, are you related to Terry?" I said yes I am his cousin. He said wow, for several years now he calls me up about every 2-4 months and we get together. He proceded to show me all kinds of photos of the two of them and tell me how the two of them would get together and have sex before he would go back to his pentecostal life. His two lives could never collide or he would lose everything. I never confronted him about this and never said a word to the family. I'm not trying to say this is at all the same as your friend but ya know it could be. You'd never know. The last person they would confess something like I described to would be a religious friend. I have NEVER met anyone that has become straight after being gay. IMO they can make everyone else think so, to make the family situation easier but I don't think they ever really are straight. Sexual orientation just can't be changed.

<Slaps forehead>One out of twenty people are gay, but being "gay" isn't as obvious as skin color.That is why people come "out of the closet". That's part of the point of "pride".Most people DO KNOW a "real gay person", but probably don't know it.It's not a point of being "in your face", but in actually SHOWING people who "real gay" people actually are!But let me guess, that's part of what you call "in your face"?Have you ever stopped to think that these "talking points" are issues that AFFECT OUR LIVES?The people who showed up at the egg roll to protest the gay presence weren't carrying signs that said "Don't politicize Easter". They were carrying signs lambasting gays in general.And people like you look at that situation, and you focus on the gays to criticize.Unbe-fricken-lievable!It's you who is indulging the "talking points" here...What the heck do you think is a "gay way of life"?Please define that for me.Do you think that I live a "gay way of life"?I suspect because you're too busy hunting for negative information about gays, and you don't bother to figure out the other side of the equation...Actually, some of them were written by Paul...Not ones condoning death, but the ones labelling gays as *bad people* and the like.And are you separating "Christianity" from what people say Christianity is?As in, you have a definition of "Christianity" which you apply, but other definitions are wrong?You criticize the gay pride movement, but not gay people?Talk about splitting semantical hairs!I suppose the "gay pride movement" were the "parents" you were criticizing in the other thread?But regardless, this is part of the point, which I was actually talking about a few days earlier. It's like you are claiming that you like omelettes, but you complain when somebody wants to crack an egg.There is a lot of your "criticism" which is harping on about something which is really insignificant...Just out of curiousity, when a "gay adoption" thread has popped open, have you ever said in that thread that you support gay adoption?Have you ever argued for gay adoption in that thread, while giving reasons why you support it?

This whole "approved curriculum" stuff is silly. There is, in all likelihood, no such thing as an approved curriculum for second grade kids. There may be a reading list that has to be included, but I seriously doubt that teachers are obliged to stick to it and ONLY it. If teaching really has become that restricted, it's a real, real shame.

But the teacher admitted it wasn't part of the approved curriculum, so it was excluded from their approved list.With all due respect, I've never been anything but honest with you.

You say somewhere else that he doesn't consider himself gay anymore. Why do you refer to him that way? Is it permanently "tainted"?All sorts of bigotry throughout history has been quite sincere. The question, of course, is how to tell at the time. There are all sorts of repeated patterns, repeated claims, repeated justifications. Many of them are apparent in modern, American, fundamentalist Christianity.In another post you claim to be able to tell the difference between "real" religions and religions behaving badly. Well, I don't know how you do it (and, frankly, I think your conclusions about some religions is way off), but one of the things I look for in "good" religions versus "bad" ones (I think they're all "real") is whether they openly and honestly examine themselves for those repeated patterns, claims, and justifications I mentioned up there ^ and, if and when they find them, they STOP.

I understand what you're saying and ultimately the school will have to make the descision, not the parents. Well, let's keep in mind that none of the parents are in the position to make policy here. The school does that. It's their descision what to do, and chances are they will continue to allow the book to be read. I agree with you that one set of parents shouldn't be given precendent over everyone else, but that's not really what I'm arguing for. I'm arguing that the parents who are objecting are certainly within their right to protest, and should be looked on no differently than any parent doing what they feel is best for their kids.Yes, I do. Yes. One of my best friends is gay; though he moved to a different town a couple of years ago. I don't disagree with you at all that gay people are sometimes discriminated against. I agree with you on that 100%. I'm just saying that, from what I've seen, most of the opposition to homosexuality on religious grounds is based in religion, and most of it is people simply trying to do what they think is right. Whether they are ill-informed is a different matter, but many times their motives are not evil. They really do believe that homosexuality is a sin. It's not bigotry, it's their religious belief. This is what I've seen, and I've been around a LOT of Christian people of that mindset. (I'm an ex-fundie.)

Ask him if those temptations are the same as other temptations. I'd be surprised if he says yes.

This is the only "ID" I've used.He certainly knows my views, and he agrees with me on a lot of it--he's a Christian man who used to struggle greatly with gay desires. Now he's married and has kids, and loves his life! That's not to say he doesn't deal with temptation from time to time--just like any person who is tempted to do things he feels is wrong. But he's an excellent case of someone who has successfully learned to live a fulfilled life when he was gay. And frankly, his experience and comments is a lot of the reason I don't put much stock in the gay pride movements' insistence that gay's can't change, and that they can only be miserable if they try. It's hard to take that seriously when you've seen the very opposite played out in the life of someone you know very well.In my opinion, bigotry is a motivation. So is religion. Religion is a belief in God, and the doctrines. I see religion as something different than bigotry.The muslims that attacked on 9/11 had an extreme hatred of America. THAT was bigotry. If they had been following religion, they wouldn't have participated in the attack because the Koran does not condone their actions. Their's was a case where bigotry superceded their religion. It wasn't one and the same. So I disagree; I think religion in and of itself is benign. It is when religion becomes controlled by bigotry that problems arise.

Let's try to get some perspective on this issue of "not bigotry, it's their religious belief"...There exists a good chunk of history whereby religious prejudice and bigotry existed, but was also a "religious belief".First commandment. Thou shalt have no other Gods before me.In modern times, we understand that different people have different religions, and that having a different religion, which may be in the minority, is not grounds for persecution or discrimination.Discrimination on religion doesn't gain us anything. It doesn't make the Jew want to be Christian.We've learned to evolve past our religious differences, even though we may not understand other religions. They just aren't that important in the big scheme of things.Likewise, we have sexual orientation differences as well. And the discrimination against gays doesn't really gain the anti-gay side anything.The few gays who do try to change their sexual orientation often overwhelmingly fail. People like your friend are often still attracted to people of the same gender, as your discussion of his "temptation" mentioned.How is it that in this country we have evolved to the point where we understand that we can have freedom of religion, but not freedom from religious rules? Especially when freedom of religion would obviously violate the first commandment religious rule.The point being simple. Your analysis of "bigotry" is biased.If we had people running around in great numbers who wanted to limit the rights of the Jews, based on the religious beliefs, would you say it wasn't bigotry but rather just "religious beliefs"?

Sure, but after seeing the words and actions of gay activists (you included, to be honest--you wanted honesty, after all), I think a lot of what the gay pride movement says is total B.S. pursuing gay relationships.Do people say Christianity means to go a stone gay people? Because I've NEVER heard a Christian say that. Every Christian I know realizes that the law in the OT that says to stone gay people was changed in Christ's coming.Tell you what, if you really want to know (and if it's really important enough for you) do a search.No, this is where your misunderstanding is becoming clear. I'll explain the difference as best I can. When reloigious people disapprove of gays, it's not the "being gay" they are disapproving of. Its the behaviors they believe are associated with it--having gay relationships. They really do believe the Bible frowns upon gay relationships. For them, it's no different than any other sort of relationship the Bible frowns on, like incest or adultery. That's what they believe. Their opposition is not about you being gay, it's about gay behavior. Have you ever heard a preacher rail against someone for having a gay sexual orientation? Probably not. But many preachers have probably railed over people being in gay relationships. So the bottom line is that for religious people with this issue, it's not about your state of being, it's about behavior. When the KKK goes out and burns a cross in a black person's yard, they do it because they're black. That's the reason. When religious people take a stand you don't like on homosexuality, they almost always don't hate you (although the gay pride movement talking points will tell you they do). They just believe your actions are wrong. That's not bigotry, it's actually a form of concern. I don't hold out much hope that you'll actually stop and think about this some, and learn from what I've written, based on the posts you've made so far. But I lay it out for others who are willing to read it and think about it.

<Slaps forehead>One out of twenty people are gay, but being "gay" isn't as obvious as skin color.That is why people come "out of the closet". That's part of the point of "pride".Most people DO KNOW a "real gay person", but probably don't know it.It's not a point of being "in your face", but in actually SHOWING people who "real gay" people actually are!But let me guess, that's part of what you call "in your face"?Have you ever stopped to think that these "talking points" are issues that AFFECT OUR LIVES?The people who showed up at the egg roll to protest the gay presence weren't carrying signs that said "Don't politicize Easter". They were carrying signs lambasting gays in general.And people like you look at that situation, and you focus on the gays to criticize.Unbe-fricken-lievable!It's you who is indulging the "talking points" here...What the heck do you think is a "gay way of life"?Please define that for me.Do you think that I live a "gay way of life"?I suspect because you're too busy hunting for negative information about gays, and you don't bother to figure out the other side of the equation...Actually, some of them were written by Paul...Not ones condoning death, but the ones labelling gays as *bad people* and the like.And are you separating "Christianity" from what people say Christianity is?As in, you have a definition of "Christianity" which you apply, but other definitions are wrong?You criticize the gay pride movement, but not gay people?Talk about splitting semantical hairs!I suppose the "gay pride movement" were the "parents" you were criticizing in the other thread?But regardless, this is part of the point, which I was actually talking about a few days earlier. It's like you are claiming that you like omelettes, but you complain when somebody wants to crack an egg.There is a lot of your "criticism" which is harping on about something which is really insignificant...Just out of curiousity, when a "gay adoption" thread has popped open, have you ever said in that thread that you support gay adoption?Have you ever argued for gay adoption in that thread, while giving reasons why you support it?

Can you see where this perspective is problematic for gays? We Christians don't hate you for being gay. We just object if you behave like you are gay. If you do something abominable like pursuing a relationship, that is what we have a problem with. In addition, if you behave that way we will compare it to incest or adultery (or much worse), but we mean no offense at calling your behavior these things. We cannot fathom why you would have a problem with these labels for your behavior.See we have no problem with your gayness. If you were not gay, your behavior - like pursuing relationships - would be perfectly fine. But because you are gay, it is abominable. All you gays need to do is act like you are not gay at all, and Christians would have no problem with your behavior. That's all. Can you see how that smacks of a disingenuous argument? Hating the sin for all practical purposes is tantamount to hating the sinner.

I realize you do. And it's based on ridiculous assessments and insistences which are not found for other groups.You will be happy to condemn the gay people for something, but ignore the more heinous transgressions of the religious right. Actually, I HAVE heard that phrase from a variety of different people on different boards. But I think they are typically trolls.When the people who aren't trolls bring it up, they are usually trying to justify their degree of anger that they demonstrate towards gays. And THAT is the point...Actually, I found one gay adoption thread in the past, and true to form you were criticizing the gays. I didn't review the whole thread, but I didn't even see you mention a support for gay adoption in that thread.And the thing here is that my question was incredibly simple. And yet you avoided it.Sometimes, that's an answer unto itself...I've heard this claim before and it's b.s.When they prevent gay adoption, do they require that the gay people involved be only the gays who have "gay behavior"? How about gays in the military?Our gay behavior IS what they are preoccupied, but make no mistake. The prejudice isn't just aimed at "behavior", but the entire group.And the KKK and the Nazis really do believe the Bible frowns upon blacks, Jews, etc...Just because they "believe" a rule exists doesn't mean it justifies prejudice.Do you even know what the "ex-gay" community really is?A bunch of people insisting that you not only not be "gay"...... but they want to make you "straight" instead.Why isn't it just about making people who are "gay" to be celibate?There's a lot that isn't covered in your claims.It's amazing how you unilaterally make claims about "they".When I see somebody who "doesn't hate" me enough to actually LIE about how I am a pedophile and a child molestor and how kids aren't safe around me and ....THAT demonstrates HATE.And it's in abundance in the religious right. With examples. Not just "claims" of how "they" feel.Actions speak louder than words Jyoshu. It's a lesson you should learn.And what I have found is that when I JUST SAY that I am gay, without actually saying what type of "behavior" I engage in, I get condemned.I have NEVER had ANYBODY stop and ask me, "But do you engage in gay behavior? Or not." first.So you see, your distinction is arbitrary and virtually non-existent. In ACTUAL PRACTICE, I just don't see it.Oh Jyoshu. You think you're some sort of Messiah giving me a brand-new message, but you just don't realize that it's all stuff I'VE HEARD BEFORE.And I understand what you're saying. I KNOW how some people want it to come across like that.But I also KNOW the reasons it is not seen like that.If it was just about "gay behavior", then why the unilateral ban on gay adoption preventing every gay from adopting? Why the unilateral ban on gays in the military, regardless of whether or not they engage in that "behavior"?Why am I habitually condemned just for SAYING I am gay, without anybody pausing to ask first whether or not I actually engage in "gay behavior"?It's an empty distinction that you make. You think that I won't think about your words, but I already had.Are you willing to think about my reply, and treat it with some honest reflection?

Come come now if the dietary laws and the punishment laws don't apply any more then why should we think that the moral laws still apply? Is it because certain christian groups want to pick and choose?They can have all the opposition they want as long as they leave it in there homes and churches and do not infringe upon my life and make laws that hurt me and my family. IT is bigotry when viewed from our prespective. We see a group that wants to discriminate against us, exclude us from marriage, adoption, employment, and protection under the law for our families all based upon a factor that is common to gay people. If this isn't bigotry then what is it? If they wanted to exclude balck or asian peoples then it would be considered bigotry. I see no difference.

The only thing I can tell you is that, from the Christian persepective, it's not that way. Christians often view homosexual behavior in the same way they would view any other vice.

http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=49813Society is never going to change its discriminatory ways towards gays and lesbians unless parents stop reacting to things like this in such a negative manner. They would have nothing to say if this were a book about a prince and princess getting married. Some will say that this is inappropriate for this age of children but I totally disagree. It was not about sex, it was about a prince that didn't like girls, fell in love with another prince and got married to him. So what? I have known many children that have known about boys likeing boys and girls likeing girls since they were very young. They are older now and are the most well adjusted, non-judgemental, kind young adults you would ever want to meet. And straight, in case your wondering. The parents say that they would like the opportunity to explain there views about this subject to the child. This is the problem, the parents want to instll bigotry and discimination into there children. Children should learn from the beginning that some girls and boys like each other, sometimes girls and girls and boys and boys like each other just like the boys and girls do. I commend those parents that do actually teach tolerance and acceptance.

this makes absolutlely no sense at all. didnt jyoshu specifically spell out that its the BEHAVIOR that christianity has a problem with? any man comitting a gay sexual relationship, regardless of orientation, is committing a sin according to the bible. if you have a problem with that, then disregard the bible. thats all

The extent of discrimination that this country has exhibited, and to which some Christians do support against gays, IS an "attack" against gays.And on another level, "The Christian anti-gay movement" inaccurately portrays gays as being an attack on the "traditional family".They show gays as being an attack against society.Hell. In another thread Steeeve seems to be claiming that allowing gay marriage would be preventing his freedom of religion.But, yet again, you're only giving half the story aren't you Jyoshu...And it's the story against gays...Ex-squeeze me?Gay people ARE victimized by numerous examples of discrimination.Are you going to deny THAT now too???I allow for many ways of thinking.It's just hard to believe somebody's claims of "full acceptance" when they spend the vast majority of their time criticizing a lot of completely irrelevant things that they see gay people doing...It's hard to believe somebody's claims when they say that stories show one thing of the anti-gay side, and the evidence points to something entirely different...

In this case, evidence has been clearly shown that THESE parents DO want to instill their child with views prejudiced against gays.If you can bring up a REAL LIFE example where parents want to prevent their kid from hearing the school's discussion, and also not instill prejudice and discrimination, we're all ears!1) What good does it do to "disregard the bible" when there are Christians wanting to enforce the laws of the Bible on gays regardless of whether or not we "regard" it???2) Jyoshu's explanation spelled out a theoretical approach, but the actual application to this approach shows prejudice and discrimination against gay people. Not just gay people who engage in gay behavior, but gay people.3) That distinction is inane, in practice. It's like saying that you are prejudiced against "Jewish behavior"...The impact is the same. Prejudice against Jews.It's like saying that you're against people who help make GM cars, but you're not against people who work for GM.4) If laws were created which discriminated against "heterosexual behavior", would you think that they don't target heterosexuals?That they're not against heterosexuals?If a person said they were prejudiced against CHRISTIAN behavior, as opposed to being prejudiced against Christians, would you think that is a meaningful distinction?

Please stop with the "your movement" stuff. This is one person talking to another.My point is that it is impossible to be gay and be OK in the eyes of the Christians that condemn homosexuality unless we behave contrary to our nature. That which makes gay people different from straight people is the way in which we behave affectationally to one another, the very essence of sexuality. So to say that christians are only disapproving of "one" aspect, really isn't logical - that one aspect is the whole kit and kaboodle. At the risk of asserting a counter-example, it is like saying to a Christian: "I accept you for your beliefs. However, don't ever pray so I can hear you or go to church or demonstrate in any outward way that you are a christian. I will love and accept you if I can't tell you are a christian and you act just like me. Furthermore, I will work to pass legislation that prohibits you from doing so. Also, I hope you are not offended when I say that going to church is the equivalent of having sex with animals or child rape. Have a nice day"

The only thing I can tell you is that, from the Christian persepective, it's not that way. Christians often view homosexual behavior in the same way they would view any other vice. So in the same way, they don't hate people who commit adultery, but they do disapprove of the action. Your movement, I'm convinced, portrays religious opposition as an attack on people instead accurately portraying the opposition to be over the actions of people. Your movement does this because it's a way to vilify religious people and play the victim, and it's another way that your movement lies. I'm not talking about gay people here, I'm talking about the gay pride movement.But although your movement puts out that line of thinking, I'm not discounting the fact that you really do believe it's disingenuous. However, the problem is that you only view this two possible ways: full acceptance of people or none at all. The third way, which you aren't allowing for (and happens to be the correct one) is full acceptance of people but disapproval of some actions. Actions and one's state of being are two different things.

Unkerpaulie is correct--the irony here is that even if a person is straight, religious people will still disapprove of that person engaging in homosexual relations. That fact alone is plenty of indication that for religion it's not an issue of innateness or state of being at all, but of behavior.The thing is, this (like most public policy discrimination issues) is much more complex than simply religious people wanting to discriminate and put it into law. It's just not that simple. People who oppose religious people on this issue should be clear here--is their intention to only stop what they perceive as discrimination, or to stop the religious view about homosexual relations, or is it both? And what of people who oppose homosexual relations or legalized gay marriage, or both, but who aren't religious and therefore don't even use religion as an argument?If the point is to simply oppose religious people because they have the religious view that gay relations are immoral, then it's a hopeless cause for gay rights. That much is certain. The Bible and it's predominant interpretation that gay relations are wrong has been around far longer than the gay rights movement and has survived far worse attacks in the past.If the point is to simply oppose discrimination but NOT the religious view, then one has to wonder why they are attacking the religious view at all instead of simply dealing with the legal matter purely on legal grounds. Wasting time and resources trying to convince millions of people to turn their backs on their time-honored and sacred religious beliefs, or trying to convince them that their doctrine is some sort of bigotry only takes emphasis off the legal and constitutional arguments. And if the gay rights issue is such a given and a slam-dunk as the gay rights movement would have us believe, then one would think they would have no need to bother attacking the religious view.

In this case, evidence has been clearly shown that THESE parents DO want to instill their child with views prejudiced against gays.If you can bring up a REAL LIFE example where parents want to prevent their kid from hearing the school's discussion, and also not instill prejudice and discrimination, we're all ears!1) What good does it do to "disregard the bible" when there are Christians wanting to enforce the laws of the Bible on gays regardless of whether or not we "regard" it???2) Jyoshu's explanation spelled out a theoretical approach, but the actual application to this approach shows prejudice and discrimination against gay people. Not just gay people who engage in gay behavior, but gay people.3) That distinction is inane, in practice. It's like saying that you are prejudiced against "Jewish behavior"...The impact is the same. Prejudice against Jews.It's like saying that you're against people who help make GM cars, but you're not against people who work for GM.4) If laws were created which discriminated against "heterosexual behavior", would you think that they don't target heterosexuals?That they're not against heterosexuals?If a person said they were prejudiced against CHRISTIAN behavior, as opposed to being prejudiced against Christians, would you think that is a meaningful distinction?

I ask you. How often does that happen?

If, for the church, it was about BEING gay that's wrong, the church would still reject these people.

yes, THESE parents did indicate such. my contention was about parents explaining from their point of view, not preventing their children from hearing the school's view. a parent has every right to explain, or even refutr, what is taught in schools if the school's teaching goes against what the parents knows to be fect, or gainst the parent's opinion. you cant assume this means discrimination or something negative just because the parent feels he or she should explain to her child what was discussed in schoolbecause the question of whether or not a gay act is a sin is purely religious, and has nothing to do with law. read carefully what i postedand thats different and contrary to what jyoshu posted. can a straight man commit a gay sex act? or is it only gays that can do this? how do you draw the line?or prejudice against childish behavior, or terrorist behavior. neither is a form of discrimination against children nor humans, because we are lead to believe that behaviors are within the control of the individual to change. unless you also believe that all behaviors are permanent, innate and unchangeableis it possible for somebody to work at gm and not help make gm cars? i suppose it is, but chances are that person wont have his job for long.no it isnt. there is a problem with the common definition of what a gay person is. i believe i might have a perspective of the definition which might differ from yours and jyoshu's. but it doesnt make sense to distinguish between a gay person and someone who commits gay sexual acts.

Yes, and this view of human sexuality and sexual orientation is utterly inconsistent with reality.You say that my asking about a straight guy having gay sex is beside the point. (huh?) I am not talking about this issue from a theoretical standpoint. I understand the christian position. I keep trying to say that the real world outcome of that position is that people get hurt. Gay sex is a sin. If I am gay but am celibate for my entire life, all would be OK in the eyes of the christian. (And to be perfectly clear, I mean the type of christian that still thinks this is sinful,)That puts a rather severe restriction on me. Name another sin, any other sin. I am serious, go ahead. If I stopped that sin forever I could live a happy, fulfilling life. There are consequences to other people involved here. We are not talking asking murderers to stop murdering. We are talking about asking human beings to stop being human beings.You keep explaining the religious position. The "rationale" behind the position is clear. I am just saying that it is medieval. The problem with this viewpoint is this. A lot of policital and statutory action occurs because of this. It is not kept within the confines of the church. I have battled several state ballot measures in which the other side specifically took a religious point of view. Our side lost the last time. Also, grade school teachers get grief for innocent behavior.

Well, now that's the bottom line disagreement between you and many religious people, now isn't it: whether or not gay behavior is benignly part of just "being human" or whether or not it's an immoral behavior. The thing is, you are asking them to turn their back, overnight basically, on their religious beliefs only because some recent (relatively speaking) medical associations suddenly say that it's just a normal part of human behavior. Put yourself in their shoes for a moment and take another vice (since they view gay sex as a vice) as an example: if suddenly several medical associations said that it's a normal part of human behavior to act out violence, would you so readily accept that violence is ok? Or maybe sexual activity with children? (And understand I'm not using that analogy to say gay relationships are similar, I'm only using it to help you see this from their point of view. The only way to do that is to find something that you would consider an immoral behavior, because that's the way many religious people view gay relations. I'm NOT saying gays are like people who do these things or even equating them.) You're basically asking them to change their view just like you would have to change your view on THOSE matters. Now even if religious people are wrong on this, do you think hundreds of years of belief can be dropped overnight? Don't you think a better tactic would be to be at least somewhat understanding toward their position and not be hostile to them, realizing that it's going to take some time (and that it may never even happen)? And for that matter, what if these medical and psychological associations are wrong? They've been wrong on things before. Why should their views on this be taken as dogma?Agreed, and I too have a problem with Christians trying to legislate their doctrines. I don't think state ballot initiatives are a good idea for Christians to start up. That's not to say I think they are illegal or unconstitutional--they are part of the democratic process. But as a Christian myself, I tend to think that Christians should have better things to do that to lobby for things like this. There are certainly more important things mandated in Christian scripture, such as worship, helping orphans, helping the poor and homeless, simply showing the love of Christ, etc.

1) How often does that happen?2) I don't refute the fact that Christians object to "homosexual behavior".That's not the point.The point is that saying that it's not "being gay", but rather "gay behavior", is essentially meaningless. Gay behavior ENCOMPASSES "being gay".3) Can you point to ANY LAW which prohibits "straight people who have gay relations" in their exclusion, while they exclude gays?The MAJORITY of the laws on the issue target GAY people.It's both.The homosexuality is an innate aspect. To restrict oneself from "homosexual behavior" would be to go against that innate attribute of their being.Kind of like insisting that a heterosexual not engage in heterosexual conduct, and then not talking about how that demand affects an innate quality.Only stop the discrimination, speaking for myself.As to stopping that discrimination, I identify the root causes of that discrimination. And religion is one of those root causes.And thus, it's not the religion itself that I seek to stop, but rather the religious involvement in legislation.I argue against them with regards to whatever argument they muster.Do we have any of those on this message board?Because from what I can see, it's primarily the "religious" argument counter...I could care less about their views, as long as they don't try to make religious morality into law.That is expressly forbidden on multiple levels.As did the biblical stance allying with misogyny.As did the biblical stance on slavery.As did the biblical stance on the earth being the center of the universe.Funny thing is, the Bible keeps "changing" it's interpretation...1) Can't we do both?2) Actually, I HAVE TRIED to debate this on the legal grounds. Nobody seems interested.Is that fact relevant?Isn't the fact that the religious people are the ones moving away from the legal grounds rather poignant to your attempted point?<snort>You're analysis is bass-ackwards.Would you care to stop this attempt of yours of deriding the gay people, who you label as "gay rights movement", and actually debate the legal issue?Or will you avoid such a discussion, proving my point?

I see that statement and I just want to shout B.S!If it weren't, in part, about innateness, they wouldn't be so insistent in trying to present it as a "choice"...1) Who is saying that? 2) They attack what they don't understand.No argument here. In fact, I think I have been trying to make that point...You ADMIT that is what "they" say, but you don't want to get into the significance of their choice of that term?A significance which detracts from your attempted point?Why don't you finish the phrase Jyoshu?Isn't it typically phrased as "gay lifestyle CHOICE"???But oh yeah. You claim they're not interested in "innateness"...Wake the heck up Jyoshu.They call themselves EX-GAYS!!!When they no longer label themselves as gay, THEN and ONLY THEN are they accepted.It's about BOTH the behavior AND the being gay.You keep denying that while ignoring the arguments refuting your claims...

Even if the parent refutes the SCIENTIFIC FACTS of the issue?But regardless, I fully support the parents from pulling THEIR child from the event. I've stated as such...Invariably, without contrary exception being shown, a parent who wants to restrict their child from receiving a talk on homosexuality is prejudiced against and supports discrimination against gays.While it may not be "always" the case, the pink winged unicorn parent who acts in that way without supporting prejudice has not been found.If you wish to show that parent, then do so.Do you realize that you just ignored the point of my question?Personally, my responses to these issues have often IGNORED any attempt to refute what they claim the bible says, but rather to EXPLICITLY STATE that the bible has NO PLACE for being the sole justification for our governmental laws.I contradicted Jyoshu? The sky must be falling...Yes. A straight man can commit a gay sex act.But do the laws which prevent gay adoption, or gay service in the military, really care about a "straight" man who commits a gay sex act?The laws typically discriminate against GAYS. Not just gays who engage in gay behavior. Not really straights who have had a gay sex act.But GAYS.Tell me.How many laws against gays discriminate EXPLICITLY against gay behavior and not gays in general?And likewise, what category would you have for gays who do not exhibit "gay behavior"?Celibate?

What nonsense. Gay people have been and are fighting for legal rights. If you don't think religion should come into the discussion, take that up with your side.

Speaking for myself...No. I'm not.I don't care if they don't believe being a homosexual is acceptable. If they are gay and they feel that way, they can put themselves through whatever hoops they like...What I am asking is that they not take their religious beliefs, and demand that others stick to them. I do not share their religious beliefs on homosexuality, nor should I be forced to accept their laws based on their religious beliefs against homosexuality.It's funny you should pick those two examples.Think about it."Violence" is wrong, regardless of the fact that the majority of times it occurs REGARDLESS of mental illness. Being a mental illness has no intrinsic part of that morality."Pedophilia" is a mental illness, and still obviously wrong. It involves child degradation and often rape. It leaves a child mentally and/or physically scarred. Regardless of whether or not it was a mental illness, it would STILL BE WRONG because there is a victim involved. An innocent child.I don't understand why some people have such a difficult time in feeling that the view "homosexuality is a mental illness" has to be an inalienable part of their morality regarding homosexuality. Even with it not being a mental illness, it could still be wrong just like thousands of other things in our United States penal system are wrong without requiring a stamp of "mental illness"...Think about it.** Science is based on scientific standards. Research. Evidence. Conclusions are typically never completely concrete, and are open to be revisited WITH evidence...** Religion is based on the statements recorded about men who lived thousands of years ago, who claimed they could talk to God.If somebody today said that they talked to God, they would probably be locked up as mentally ill...** Science invites questions to further knowledge. It is refutable if it is wrong, substantiated with evidence.** Religion consists of words once spoken, and then the people who follow those words often refuse to even entertain the idea that the person who said it might be wrong. It doesn't invite questions, but rather often demands blind belief.Do you really want to compare the two and figure out which has a stronger basis??? Because I would love to do that in a realistic and objective discussion.I am happy to debate a variety of different secular positions as to why "homosexuality" is supposed to be immoral and wrong. I often find that the Christian response is rigid and refusing debate, utilizing phrases found in the Bible which are not open for debate...And when people sometimes try to debate the Biblical standards, other people start accusing them of "attacking" their "religion"...Do you really want to compare the two and figure out which has a stronger basis??? I'm guessing you really don't...There was a poll done a little while ago which asked people not associated with the Christian religion to rank their opinions of certain groups of people...Lawyers, Gays, Lesbians, Prostitutes, born-again Christians, ...The average ranking found that these people ranked born-again Christians SECOND TO LAST, beating out only prostitutes.You criticize the "gay rights movement" for not being more understanding, and question whether or not they are hurting themselves more than they are helping.You ever stop to ask the same question about the actions of Christians???Feh. Another response which I'm betting will get ignored...

Or maybe sexual activity with children? (And understand I'm not using that analogy to say gay relationships are similar, I'm only using it to help you see this from their point of view. The only way to do that is to find something that you would consider an immoral behavior, because that's the way many religious people view gay relations. I'm NOT saying gays are like people who do these things or even equating them.) You're basically asking them to change their view just like you would have to change your view on THOSE matters. Now even if religious people are wrong on this, do you think hundreds of years of belief can be dropped overnight? Don't you think a better tactic would be to be at least somewhat understanding toward their position and not be hostile to them, realizing that it's going to take some time (and that it may never even happen)? And for that matter, what if these medical and psychological associations are wrong? They've been wrong on things before. Why should their views on this be taken as dogma?Agreed, and I too have a problem with Christians trying to legislate their doctrines. I don't think state ballot initiatives are a good idea for Christians to start up. That's not to say I think they are illegal or unconstitutional--they are part of the democratic process. But as a Christian myself, I tend to think that Christians should have better things to do that to lobby for things like this. There are certainly more important things mandated in Christian scripture, such as worship, helping orphans, helping the poor and homeless, simply showing the love of Christ, etc.

It's truly bizarre that opposition to homosexuality has become a central tenet of fundamentalist, insert-qualifying-terms-here-as-needed Christianity. Politically expedient but theologically bizarre.

You know, I have still yet to figure out why granting gays civil rights is "forcing Christians to turn their backs on their deeply-held beliefs" (just 'cause of something like science, which I guess has to has to be validated by the length of time something is known, rather than its demonstrability and proof, which must be a new one on scientists), yet allowing people to legally eat non-Kosher foods is not "forcing Jews to turn their backs on their deeply-held beliefs."

If this is not the case then explain why they didn't accept the fact that the teacher read this book and then explain there views in addition too? Why do they only want the child to hear their view? Foundit66 asked this quetion of Jyoshu, maybe you can answer it: Have you ever heard of a situation where parents insisted their kids not be taught about homosexuality, because the parents wanted to insist that it be they who teach their kid about homosexuality in a manner devoid of prejudice, while teaching all sides of the issue?

are you kidding? a parent wants to explain to their child their views on the subject, and that is a problem? and you immediately and automatically assume that the parents want to instill bigotry and discrimination in the child? this has got to be a joke. please...

We were talking about politics in churches, which is a problem.Sure I do. But this is the Gay Rights forum, where we discuss gay rights and it's movement. No doubt, there are Christians who have given Christianity a bad name. And then part of the problem is people who hate certain groups of Christians, and simply vilify Christians in general at any given opportunity because of it.Anti-religious prejudice is the last socially acceptable form of bigotry.

It's been over a hundred years since that position was first put forth. Since that time, we've made a lot of progress and have routinely been pushed back by bigoted religious leaders using us and their own followers' ignorance to control society.Yeah, right. Since Leviticus is the basis for the discrimination against us, why don't you use examples from Leviticus. Are you afraid of how stupid your arguments would be if you chose eating lobster or talking to women during their periods? Hypocrit.Yeah, and that's why you've chosen to spend years arguing against gay rights (which you supposedly support).

I think everyone here has made it clear that they are referring to the christians that are oppressive and try to legislate their views. I think the one of terms used was banned.

Honestly, do you really think that gay people care one iota about the beliefs of christians. I can tell you that I haven't met one. It is clear that conern is only towards some christians actions. When they circulate a petition to put their religious views into law, the backlash is hardly because we care about their views, its because we care about how they want to impose their views on us. It's obivous to the these christians, that do this, that gay rights is a slam dunk. Otherwise they wouldn't need any constitutional admendments. If gay rights were not something we are entitled to they wouldn't bother getting involved with such initiatives.

Unkerpaulie is correct--the irony here is that even if a person is straight, religious people will still disapprove of that person engaging in homosexual relations. That fact alone is plenty of indication that for religion it's not an issue of innateness or state of being at all, but of behavior.The thing is, this (like most public policy discrimination issues) is much more complex than simply religious people wanting to discriminate and put it into law. It's just not that simple. People who oppose religious people on this issue should be clear here--is their intention to only stop what they perceive as discrimination, or to stop the religious view about homosexual relations, or is it both? And what of people who oppose homosexual relations or legalized gay marriage, or both, but who aren't religious and therefore don't even use religion as an argument?If the point is to simply oppose religious people because they have the religious view that gay relations are immoral, then it's a hopeless cause for gay rights. That much is certain. The Bible and it's predominant interpretation that gay relations are wrong has been around far longer than the gay rights movement and has survived far worse attacks in the past.If the point is to simply oppose discrimination but NOT the religious view, then one has to wonder why they are attacking the religious view at all instead of simply dealing with the legal matter purely on legal grounds. Wasting time and resources trying to convince millions of people to turn their backs on their time-honored and sacred religious beliefs, or trying to convince them that their doctrine is some sort of bigotry only takes emphasis off the legal and constitutional arguments. And if the gay rights issue is such a given and a slam-dunk as the gay rights movement would have us believe, then one would think they would have no need to bother attacking the religious view.

Gays only act out of some mysterious (but not genetic, apparently) orneriness that goes with being gay, apparently. We don't criticize Christians for a REASON (like the fact that that they're organizing to deprive us of our rights) but just because we're all, en masse, anti-Christianity. We don't criticize the Bush administration because they're pushing for an amendment to deny us the right to marry the person we love, we do it because we're all, en masse, "anti-Bush." We don't have sex with each other because we feel any real attraction for the same gender, we do it because we all, en masse... well...ask them. I can't figure out why the hell they think we do it if not for that.Evidently, the concept of "cause and effect" is beyond some people.

Dude!I was reporting the results of a POLL! What the POLL said!WE on this message board have been trying to be careful to delineate between the two. The general "Christian" and those who are "oppressive"...The POLL (which I did not create) I was quoting DID NOT delineate between the two.If I had said the poll referred to "christians that are oppressive and try to legislate", then I would have been lying about what the poll had said, because the poll did not say that.And you'll note that in that sentence, I was talking about what the POLL said.Not what my opinion was.Got it?

I think it's gone both ways. If gay rights people only focused their invective on the ones who circulate petitions, or the ones who truily are out to take away their rights, I'd agree with you. Or even acknowledge that actually very few Christians (in fact very few people) "hate" gay people.But you're right--some misguided Christians have tried to legislate against gay people, in the form of a marriage amendment and laws that regulate their behavior. And I can see how that would anger gay people.

I have to say that I disagree.I see the frustration with the religious types as a result of the actions of the religious types.There just isn't that big of a group running around trying to pick fights with religious people. It exists. I'll admit that. But I think that they pretty much stick to people of their own mind-set, instead of creating more people of that mind-set.What groups do you see running around trying to vilify Christians?Let me guess...Gay Rights Movement is on that list?

I put this post here because it was statements made in this thread which gave me the idea for this test...Yesterday, about 24 hours ago, I opened up two new threads. A thread on gay adoption, and a thread on gays in the military.Those two issues, along with gay marriage, are what I see as the primary legal thrust for equality in this country.I opened them to try and check something out. If gay people were the ones who were dragging these arguments into the "religious" arena while avoiding other areas, or if it was the opposition that was dragging these arguments into the "religious" arena while avoiding other areas.My opinion was, and still is, that it is the opposition that is doing the dragging, and that the gay point of view discussion is just a reaction to the focus of the religious focus of the anti-gay crowd. I believe my experiment helped affirm this point. And granted, only 24 hours has passed, but I think we can continue to see whether or not these issues will even be broached by the anti-gay side, or if they will be broached in a way that doesn't focus on religion.Because, from my perspective, when a gay proponent attempts a non-religious argument, it is typically either dropped or ignored like my two threads yesterday were ignored.My two examples did not include the "big" issue of gay marriage, but I can point to two separate threads with discussions with two separate posters where I brought up the gay marriage legal argument, and the issue was dropped by them. Not me.And moreover, nobody else from the anti-gay marriage side picked up the gauntlet to argue the legal points I was putting forward...And on the flip side, you have at least a couple of posters against gays who I have seen on here who are approaching this issue on an almost exclusively religious manner. So any discussion with them will typically be of that sort. If anybody can point me to posters who bring the gay issue up mostly on religious issues from a pro-gay perspective, I am all ears. It would be the start of a good rebuttal attempt.Another couple of examples I have seen is when people have focused on "why do gays bring up religion" issues, which ironically IS A MEANS of bringing up the religious issue, courtesy of the gay critics without prompting from the gays.And thus, these are a few of the reasons that I believe that it is the anti-gay side which has provided the focus on religion for the "gay issue".Any comments, hopefully with reasoning for their position, from people who believe I am wrong in this?

Your post makes no sense. Who said that adopted parents are enlightened and parents who create children are ignorant or bigots? Any parent who reacts this way to this situation, IMO is a bigot. How they became parents is irrelevant.
