As a creationist, there are some points I have to concede:First point: Lurch et al have much more extensive knowledge than most (if not all) creationists on this board, whether it is admitted by the creationists or not. I am not saying they are more intelligent than the creationists on this board. What I am saying is that the evolutionists all seem to either work in the various scientific fields or do not have a life and do nothing but research this (this is not meant as an insult), whereas the creationists on this site don't seem to have near the information or the inclination to find it. I must include myself in that group since I cannot dedicate my time to researching these subjects since I have a life to lead outside this forum. What I see is various creationists who read some books, get some points, and come here to push those points (see point two). This is a huge mistake, and these attempts invariably get shot down (I have made this mistake).Second point: I have recently been reading publications from various creationist sources (specifically Hank Hanagraff's new booklet - can't remember the name right now). Most of these seem to be very shallow in nature. They seem to be pointed directly at uninformed people who accept evolution blindly (yes, there are many who accept creation blindly as well). They also seem to be outdated. They seem to be attempting to discredit evolution without doing any real research. I know for a fact that there are reputable scientists who are creationists(http://www.icr.org/creationscientists.html), but they don't seem to be brought into the fray very often, if at all.Third point: This is a point that lurch has brought up on numerous occasions, and it is a point that I also must concede. No one here that I have read is trying to show the evidence FOR creation. They are trying to disprove evolution without giving evidence for the creation theory. Though I am not a scientist, I have always been taught that in order to disprove a theory, the evidence you bring against it must also prove another theory (please tell me if I am wrong in this). I am not conceding these points because I am starting to doubt my faith. Why I am conceding them is because I have no choice. The creationists on this board, including myself, seem ill-prepared to bring any real challenge to the evolution arguments posted. Though winning an argument does not mean you have convinced the person you were arguing with, it is a little disconcerting to see this happen.I needed to get this out.

Grudgingly conceding some points

The evidence for creation is in the Bible - but every one of the evolutionaries here won't even accept that as 'evidence', so, I for one must talk to them using their own definitions of things and see if these hold up.We need a common ground for understanding and as Lurch and others quite clearly state that the Bible is fantasy, then there's no point me discussing the various merits of the Bible... we are forced by necessity to discuss evolutionary science alone.

No, it doesn't have to work towards another theory.However, many Creationists seem to think that Creationism is somehow the default idea and if they can refute evolution, Creationism is automatically verified. It isn't.

WarriorPoet, I think what you have said here is very honest. While some might say that your concession towards the evolutionists on some points shows a lack of faith I think just the opposite. Being able to accept new ideas and reject ideas that don't hold up is not only what science is all about but also a very spiritual practice. I myself am a Buddhist and we are taught examine the truth and see it for ourselves. I don't know if Christianity holds this tenet, but if it doesn't maybe it should. So if you ever want to give up on being a creationist you would make a good scientist and/or Buddhist.

But you haven't presented any evidence. You have claimed your superstition as evidence.Of course things exist outside of science's capacity to describe. And when doing science, you must use the limited framework of science. But that isn't the "big" picture any more that green elves pushing the moon around the earth is the big picture. You see, no one ever claimed that science was the source of all knowledge. Science deals only with the naturalistic.Right. That part about which we can gain emperical knowledge. No claims other wise have been made to my knowledge.And you reveal your ignorance of science. Science doesn't deny that of which there is no evidence. That is why science doesn't deny the god that you creationaries claim exists. There isn't any evidence one way or the other. Science has no opinion. It is silly to claim that science denied the existance of a planet before it had been observed. But on the other hand, science didn't claim that it existed either - well, I take that back. Actually, more than one planet was discovered because it was predicted to exist based on the observations of the perturbations in the orbits of other planets. But that prediction makes them scientific, doesn't it?No. Belief implies acceptance based on no evidence, just like you believe in the 6 days of creation, the garden of eden and a global flood. That is faith because there is no evidence that these bronze age myths have any foundation in fact. I don't believe in extra-terrestrial life but I recognize the possibility that it may exist. I assume that you weren't limiting your question to mean intelligent life.

Signing a pledge to follow a creed and following a creed without signing a pledge are essentially the same thing. You are following the evolutionary creed. They are following the creationist creed. They approach science from a creationist perspective. You approach it from an evolutionary perspective. Same, same. You won't admit it, but they are the same. --------INSERT ARGUMENTS HERE-------- This is a debate board, not a "I think that is XXXX because it I think that is XXXX" board. If you can accuse creationists of not thinking, then come back with a simple, non-sensical reply with no evidence, then you are being dishonest.

But you haven't presented any evidence. You have claimed your superstition as evidence.Of course things exist outside of science's capacity to describe. And when doing science, you must use the limited framework of science. But that isn't the "big" picture any more that green elves pushing the moon around the earth is the big picture. You see, no one ever claimed that science was the source of all knowledge. Science deals only with the naturalistic.Right. That part about which we can gain emperical knowledge. No claims other wise have been made to my knowledge.And you reveal your ignorance of science. Science doesn't deny that of which there is no evidence. That is why science doesn't deny the god that you creationaries claim exists. There isn't any evidence one way or the other. Science has no opinion. It is silly to claim that science denied the existance of a planet before it had been observed. But on the other hand, science didn't claim that it existed either - well, I take that back. Actually, more than one planet was discovered because it was predicted to exist based on the observations of the perturbations in the orbits of other planets. But that prediction makes them scientific, doesn't it?No. Belief implies acceptance based on no evidence, just like you believe in the 6 days of creation, the garden of eden and a global flood. That is faith because there is no evidence that these bronze age myths have any foundation in fact. I don't believe in extra-terrestrial life but I recognize the possibility that it may exist. I assume that you weren't limiting your question to mean intelligent life.

The "evidence" is a document that is not supported by objective evidence, and in actually suggests things that observations of the real world contradict. If you start with the assumption that the bible is correct, and then interpret the objective evidence found in the real world to fit what the bible says, and then insist this shows support of the bible... this is circular logic. Science tries to describe the natural world, or describe the world with regards to what can be objectively observed. that's fine if you want to say that there are things beyond the natural world, however you can't suggest that science should acknowledge their existence because they are simply out of the scope of science.

It is spurious to suggest that there is objective evidence! Everyone interprets evidence filtered through and by their own senses and facilities.That is the circular logic displayed by evolutionaries, that somehow, even though they are flawed and failed people, that they can someone reach out over these things and reach an level of objectivity beyond the realm of mere mortals. And then, to continue in that light, that their scientific truths are more rational than any others. If this were so, then how is it that science, especially evolutionary science has been subject to accepting quite a number of frauds, and continues to preach known fallacies?Why is it that the same evidence points to serval competing and conflicting pathways in the ascent of man? It is because the evidence is evidence that exists outside of us, but it is useless to us unless we interpret it. And in interpreting it, we are subjecting it to our own limited capacities.Even you give tacit recognition in this by saying 'Science tries..." not 'science does'.As to things existing outside and beyond science, this happens all the time.Has science explained the passion you feel about the subject of science?Either a) science has described it, which means you are no more than a random conflux of chemicals, or DNA mutating, or magnetic fluctuationsorb) science can't describe it, or shouldn't try, which means that science itself can never be the peak explanatory system of beliefs, because it is so limited.Use your imagination.

Wow. I have accepted evolution for many years, and I became absolutley convinced of its reality when I engaged in gradute research on the molecular phylogeny of Primates. In all that time, I never once heard of any "creed", or "paradigm", or "worldview" that I supposedly - apparently unwittingly - held dear.Please explain to me what this "evolutionist creed" is, where I can read about it, and why, even if it does exist, it is on equal footing with being required to sign an oath that one will never offer arguments of evidence that could undermine the YEC "worldview."Ok.Steve Austin, ICR geologist. He claims - 'witnesses', I believe it is called - that he was an 'old earth evolutionist', and probably even claims to be have been an atheist, until he did research at Mt.St.Helen's in 1980 when he was 'convinced' that the bible stories could be true and later had a conversion to YECism.Problem is, he had been writing creationist articles under the pseudonym "Stuart Nevins" (clever little anagram, eh?) for several YEARS before the eruption.As that is the type of person held in high esteem at ICR - an obvious liar - why should an objective person be convinced by any of their arguments, when one can get contrary argumnets form multiple better-qualified sources who do not have integrity and honesty issues?Isn't it a conservative mantra - Character Counts?

emoticonXBangheadNo, I didn't invite ad hom. I hoped for a more mature, informed answer. Obviously that was a mistake. Signing a pledge to follow a creed and following a creed without signing a pledge are essentially the same thing. You are following the evolutionary creed. They are following the creationist creed. They approach science from a creationist perspective. You approach it from an evolutionary perspective. Same, same. You won't admit it, but they are the same. --------INSERT ARGUMENTS HERE-------- This is a debate board, not a "I think that is XXXX because it I think that is XXXX" board. If you can accuse creationists of not thinking, then come back with a simple, non-sensical reply with no evidence, then you are being dishonest. Even an opinion has to be backed by evidence for it to be taken seriously. You, of all people, have to realize that people looking at that site are not necessarily going to come to the conclusions you do. But they would just be stupid, blind devotees to nomadic herdsmen in your opinion anyway, so what does it matter. Whatever, lurch.-WarriorPoet-

True. However, just as their are informed and uninformed opinions, there are informed and uninformed interpretations of data. I have yet to see an informed interpretations of data from a creationist.You seem to be foisting your own insecurities and frailties upon others, just as you did at CreationTalk. Especially the "flawed and failed" part. Another demonstration of ignorance both of science in general and of evolutionin particular. What 'known fallacies' are still being "preached"? And the 'frauds'? You mean the mistakes like Nebraska man? Or the hoaxes like Piltdown? "Discoveries" that were doubted by many evolutionists at the times they were announced, and later discovered to be mistakes, hoaxes, etc., BY other evolutionsts? Those?Indeed. And some have more limited capacities than others. For example, the folks that claim that Neanderthals were really the biblical patriarchs. Or that they were just people with arthritis or rickets. THAT is a demonstration of limited capacity

Science would consider the actions of bacteria under certain conditions (outlined by the experiment), so yes you are correct. However if a theory was put forward by a scientist that bacteria were "excited" by nature, first he would have to define exited, then he would have to purpose why, then he would have to predict the results of other experiments (not the ones already performed).If the bacteria was not "excited" when looked at under ultra violet light, or infra red light, or very low levels of white light... the theory that bacteria were not naturally "excited" would be a theory supported by evidence. creationism on the other hands states "bacteria are living, breathing, thinking entities, because it says so in the bible". when bacteria is observed under light they use this as proof that the bible is correct. However if the bacteria were to be observed under different lights, ant not seen to be excited creationists would try to point to certain flaws in the tests, and reliability of non-white light sources in general. their interpretations of the evidence would always take in to account their basic assumption that bacteria are alive and well.I agree that science interprets their observations through assumptions... i'm saying the assumptions science makes should be considered and followed until they are not sufficient to explain the natural (observable) world.

Another example Gleick gives is that science over-looks reality for the sake of convenienceIf you want to measure the surface area of a wooden table, you work from the measurements of the sides, however what you are in fact doing is over-looking all the little imperfections on the table surface. If you look closely there's lots of little divots and bumps. The closer you look the more bumps you find. Each little bump and divot affects the surface area, soon you'd have to go down to a molecular level, to measure the spaces between molecules...But we don't. It's far simpler just to declare the surface area is 'x' and leave it at that. And no one really thinks about it... it is like a legal-fiction, only for science.

do you have an actual example?i have one. in physics class you calculate objects falling at 9.8 meters per second... but this isn't quite right. To find the attraction forces between objects you need to use the gravitational constant, and distance between objects to have a really accurate calculation. but even then that isn't enough because you need to take into account all other objects around the earth, and all other objects around... well the falling object. but this is making a simple matter overly complex... like describing how a car works in terms of the molecular properties of carbon, and combustion, and oxidation and reduction, and mixing metals to produce components of the car, and creating polymers to create other components... etc.In all practicality it is enough to say the engine powers the car using gasoline, and the wheel is used to aim the tires. Science doesn't just ignore the details... it tries to get as detailed as it can... just in day to day practice it is inconvient to take certain details into account.do you have an example of something science has decided to stop examining closer because it gets too detailed? and does the level of detail they refuse to study imply that some of the basic assumptions science makes is flawed?

Thank you, WarriorPoet for such an honest post. I am impressed by your commitment to being open-minded - to truly debating, and I hope I will learn from it. We all have biases and need to be aware of it when debating. Much of the debate in this forum is high-level and intelligent, and I'm impressed by that and hope to learn from it as well.I am new to these forums, so maybe what I have to say has been heard, but hopefully I can give some scientific arguements for creation. I think one of the strongest argument against evolution is the watch-maker arguement. Every day it gets stronger, as new discoveries are made about the miraculous(no other word truly describes it) complexity and beauty of the natural world. For one thing, such things as rotors and universal joints have been discovered in bacteria. (If you want references, ask and I'll try to find them) So the question is, how can we beleive that something so unbeleivably more complex than a watch as, say, myself was caused by completley random forces - when no-one would ever believe a watch lying on the ground had come to be by random forces as well?The complexity of living organisms exceeds that of anything intelligent humans have designed by leaps and bounds. So the basic point is, evolution(by which I mean elements to bacteria to humans) is a long-shot. The chances of a planet such as Earth, capable of supporting any carbon-based life for any amount of time, occuring randomly are so low that you would expect very few to arise, even in our entire universe. So there's another long-shot. The long-shot's pile up until you basically have this...The chance of random evolution occuring in our universe in 15 billion years, going from elements to people, are so low that the only possible way to believe in it occuring is to say there are an infinite number of random universes where evolution has a chance to occur, and it did occur in ours. But, according to science, individuals whithin a particular universe can never find evidence of another universe. So the scientific explanation must be based on there being only one universe. You can't assume there are other universes and still be scientific. So it comes down to something like this: We have flipped a coin ten-thousand times and it landed on heads every time. Yet some people say 'I don't beleive it is weighted, there must be millions of other people who are flipping coins as well, and we the the ones who happened to get only heads', while others say 'doesn't it make more sense if the coin is weighted, or two-headed?', and still others say 'of course the coin is weighted, we've know it for centuries!'.So, that is the most basic and general evidence that we were created, as I know it. I would be happy to hear what everyone has to say about it and try to elaborate on some of the general statements I made if you want something more specific.

Robbie, you are making many misconceptions common to creatinists in your post.I think one of the strongest argument against evolution is the watch-maker arguement. Every day it gets stronger, as new discoveries are made about the miraculous(no other word truly describes it) complexity and beauty of the natural world. I don't see why you think this is a strong arguement. I have never read of any discovery that has been labeled 'miraculous'. We can see many of the pathways evolution has taken, there is no process or organ that has mysteriously formed. How does the watchmaker arguement get stronger everyday? Clearly this is ony wishful thinking on your part.So the question is, how can we beleive that something so unbeleivably more complex than a watch as, say, myself was caused by completley random forces - when no-one would ever believe a watch lying on the ground had come to be by random forces as well? Your igonorance of evolution is showing. Evolution doesn't claim that we were formed by completely random forces. Mutations are selected by nature, the environment they express themselves in, as to whether they are beneficial, detrimental or neutral. This is natural selection and is certainly not random. The complexity of living organisms exceeds that of anything intelligent humans have designed by leaps and bounds.  But this complexity is clearly not beyond nature as evolution has been observed, it is a fact. No need for a supernatural designer.....The complexity of living organisms exceeds that of anything intelligent humans have designed by leaps and bounds. So the basic point is, evolution(by which I mean elements to bacteria to humans) is a long-shot. The chances of a planet such as Earth, capable of supporting any carbon-based life for any amount of time, occuring randomly are so low that you would expect very few to arise, even in our entire universe. So there's another long-shot. The long-shot's pile up until you basically have this... Sorry, it's still not established that evolution is a long shot, any such attempts are mere speculation with absolutely nothing to back them up.What it really comes down to is the evidence. the evidence supporting the Theory of Evolution is overwhelming. Clearly it best explains the diversity of life on this planet. Supernatural creation, on the other hand, is completely without any evidence whatsoever. You cling to it on faith alone, faith in a book of primitive myths over 3000 years old.

The long-shot's pile up until you basically have this...The chance of random evolution occuring in our universe in 15 billion years, going from elements to people, are so low that the only possible way to believe in it occuring is to say there are an infinite number of random universes where evolution has a chance to occur, and it did occur in ours. But, according to science, individuals whithin a particular universe can never find evidence of another universe. So the scientific explanation must be based on there being only one universe. You can't assume there are other universes and still be scientific. So it comes down to something like this: We have flipped a coin ten-thousand times and it landed on heads every time. Yet some people say 'I don't beleive it is weighted, there must be millions of other people who are flipping coins as well, and we the the ones who happened to get only heads', while others say 'doesn't it make more sense if the coin is weighted, or two-headed?', and still others say 'of course the coin is weighted, we've know it for centuries!'.So, that is the most basic and general evidence that we were created, as I know it. I would be happy to hear what everyone has to say about it and try to elaborate on some of the general statements I made if you want something more specific.

I suggest "the blind watchmaker", by Richard Dawkins, as it addresses this specific argument. It's not overly in depth, but it makes a lot of sense.do you mean the chance of any kind of life arising are too small to have happened, or that the chances of evolving were too small to happen? or both? correct, but then you can't assume the existence of a creator either with out being unscientific. an unobservable, untestable creator is just as elusive as infinite universes. And the truth is there are 2 limiting factors in the probability calculation. 1) we don't know how likely it is that life would arise by chance. Claims that we do know the probability are based on many many factors that are complete guesses. and 2) we don't know how often life has just happened by chance. it is possible that there is simple (or even complex) life on thousands and thousands of other planets. we just don't know about them. Of course it is also possible that there is no life except for us in the universe. but as for the actual probability calculation... right now it's just a big giant question mark.but actually, most of this is beside the point. evolution deals with the mutation of compelx life from non complex life. it says nothing about the original probability of life forming. Evolution must explain how probable speciation has occurred, and possible how probable it is for single celled organisms to become multi celled organisms.

Thank you, WarriorPoet for such an honest post. I am impressed by your commitment to being open-minded - to truly debating, and I hope I will learn from it. We all have biases and need to be aware of it when debating. Much of the debate in this forum is high-level and intelligent, and I'm impressed by that and hope to learn from it as well.I am new to these forums, so maybe what I have to say has been heard, but hopefully I can give some scientific arguements for creation. I think one of the strongest argument against evolution is the watch-maker arguement. Every day it gets stronger, as new discoveries are made about the miraculous(no other word truly describes it) complexity and beauty of the natural world. For one thing, such things as rotors and universal joints have been discovered in bacteria. (If you want references, ask and I'll try to find them) So the question is, how can we beleive that something so unbeleivably more complex than a watch as, say, myself was caused by completley random forces - when no-one would ever believe a watch lying on the ground had come to be by random forces as well?The complexity of living organisms exceeds that of anything intelligent humans have designed by leaps and bounds. So the basic point is, evolution(by which I mean elements to bacteria to humans) is a long-shot. The chances of a planet such as Earth, capable of supporting any carbon-based life for any amount of time, occuring randomly are so low that you would expect very few to arise, even in our entire universe. So there's another long-shot. The long-shot's pile up until you basically have this...The chance of random evolution occuring in our universe in 15 billion years, going from elements to people, are so low that the only possible way to believe in it occuring is to say there are an infinite number of random universes where evolution has a chance to occur, and it did occur in ours.

Behe is an old earth creationist who accepts all evolutionary processes. He just wants to believe that his god is guiding them.Then I am sure that you will be able to cite some specific references to actual science that these XXXXXX have done. Where have they published their scientific research?Do you know who the designer is? They claim that they don't.It is getting a hearing from creationist politicians who have managed to get themselves elected to positions where they have some influence. So far, ID hasn't had any support and has much opposition from "educational circles." Moreover, the scientific community is almost universally opposed to IDiotism.Why do you christianary creationaries want to impose your religion on everyone under the guise of science?Can you present any evidence for you position? Can you present an hypothesis based on that evidence? What prediction can be made from that hypothesis, and how was it tested? This includes IDiotism, which is just another effort to pretend that fundamental christianity is science. "Let's just not mention god."

well behe mainly shows that because of irreducible complexity evolution could not have been a completely natural process, and there must have been some designer at some point. behe actually tosses around the idea that evolution as it is suggested today happened in it's entirety, except for the natural evolution of certain IC processes, which could have even been genetically coded into in the first single celled life forms.Since robbie's main problem was the argument paley made i pointed him to a book that addressed that situation, and since robbie is also already leaning toward the creationist camp a point of view from the other side might be good... why try to tell him something he already knows?

Thanks for the replies, 'The Blind Watchmaker' and 'Darwin's Black Box' are added to my book list. I've heard of 'Darwin's Black Box' before, but haven't read it. Actually, I am one of the creationists who've only read a few books, like WarriorPoet said. My arguments are based mostly on a book by Hugh Ross, I'm curious what you all think of him.So, first with the watch-maker arguement...I think it is a strong arguement simply because life is more complex than anything we creative and intelligent humans can match, therefore the most sensible beleif would be that life was created. Your statements seem to indicate that we now know a very detailed history of evolution. I was not aware of this, please give me some examples.I agree partly with this statement - the main problem with the watchmaker argument is that it talks about completely random forces, whereas natural selection that 'favors' good mutations could be seen as non-random. However, there would be no natural selection before there was any life at all, so the first life would have had to be perfectly random. Also, though natural selection could be non-random, it is certainly not creative or intelligent (unless you want to start speaking of it as Nature, as some evolutionists understadably do) so I hold that even a psuedo-random force is very unlikely to have caused the kind of complexity we see in life.Creation has been observed, it is a fact. Neither statement makes a good arguement, do they?Again, I am not aware of all this evidence. Why would a random, or sortofnotrandom force explain the stunning diversity and beauty of our planet better than a superintelligent, creative God? Its not debating when you say you're right and I'm wrong. I think your ignorance of the Bible is showing. For one example, multiple times in the bible it says God stretched out the heavens, in the same sense as expanding a tent. It seems to me that these prophets knew about the Big Bang a long time before our scientists did.I haven't read 'The Blind Watchmaker' yet but I have come across a quote by Dawkins that pertains to the Watchmaker argument..."Paley's argument is made with passionate sincerity and is informed by the best biological scholarship of the day, but it is wrong, gloriously and utterly wrong. The analogy between telescope and eye, between watch and living organism, is false. All appearances to the contrary, the only watchmaker in nature is the blind force of physics, albeit deplored in a special way. A true watchmaker has foresight: he designs his cogs and springs, and plans their interconnections, with a future porpose in his mind's eye. Natural selection, the blind unconscious, automatic process which Darwin discovered, and which we now know is the explanation for the existence and apparently purposeful form of all life, has no purpose in mind. It has no mind and no mind's eye. It does not plan for the future. It has no vision, no foresight, no sight at all. If it can be said to play the role of watchmaker in nature, it is the blind watchmaker."It seems to me that all Dawkins has done is say that Paley is wrong and outdated because his analogy speaks of random forces while natural selection does favor benificial genes. I don't see that it proves anything, since the heart of Paley's analogy is that life is more complex than anything we creative and intelligent humans can match, therefore the most sensible beleif would be that life was created by Someone who is superintellent and creative. (as I stated above)TheoMorphic: When I was talking about long-shots I did mean both the chance of life ever happening in the first place, and of it continuing to become more complex. I have some more specific arguments to give you from Hugh Ross's book (I think it is 'Creator of the Cosmos', but am not sure) but I don't have it at the moment.Interesting. Again, I'm wishing I had that book right now. You definatly have a good point, but surely you would admit that the probablities are, in the least, somewhat mind-boggling.This is an important point. When I think of evolution, I always think of the Athestic Evolution, which seems to almost scramble desperately in its attempt to be rid of God and sets up Nature in His place. (I mean no offense to Atheists, just that I think you often are deeply biased in favor of evolution only because it seems to prove there is no God. And, of course, I am biased too.) So, are we to debate only evolution, after life had already begun, or do you want to include other feilds?Lurch, you complain about creationists trying to 'impose your religion on everyone under the guise of science?'I have a complaint to make too. I object to Atheists trying to prove there is no God by way of evolution. They impose their religion on others just as much, if not more.

Robbie, a bit more detailDarwin's Black Box shows that regardless of the 'small steps' argument of Dawkins, some biological systems can't be made in such fashion. Behe wrote after Dawkins, so he goes over a lot of Dawkins' arguments.That the blood-clotting cascade can't be put together bit by bit because it is a system that either works as a whole or not - with fatal results.Many people will try to critcise, but not the argument, but against the arguer so e.g.Behe is religious, or Johnson is a lawyer (or a religious lawyer).You will hear the argumental phrase "strawman" crop up so many times, as well.

Creation has not been observed. If you mean all the life forms around us are proof of creation... that's a little different (and debatable). As far as god's original creation... that was not observed by anyone. the authors of the bible were not around at that time, and not even adam and eve were created yet to observe it. what if god was hanging out, and the universe popped into existence by chance with adam and eve and god just took the credit... (j/k)The goal of atheists is not to prove there is no god... well... there may be some like this, but for the most part they are concerned with discovering the truth through science. Science doesn't even try to take a stance on god. it's always going to remain "there is no evidence either for or against the existence of god. an individual's thinking science is a threat to their religion is not justification to call the methods or observations of science into question. However if a person sees an actual mistake science has made in observation or methodology they should be with out a doubt bring that mistake into light. All to often however, creationists have ulterior motives for calling science into question (religious only). Not only do some creationists unjustly challenge science, some try to pass their religion off as science. This would be fine only if they adhered to the rules of science... but normally they do not.

I think it is a strong arguement simply because life is more complex than anything we creative and intelligent humans can match, therefore the most sensible beleif would be that life was created. Your statements seem to indicate that we now know a very detailed history of evolution. I was not aware of this, please give me some examples. I don't think it follows that because we can't create complex life, it must have been a greater creator, God. At one point man did not understand electricity, could not create electricity, therefore does it follow that the primitive people who attributed it to the gods were right because they couldn't create lightning bolts? This is a God of the Gaps arguement, if/when we can create complex cells and lifeforms, does this disprove creationism? As for a 'very detailed history of evolution' how detailed are you talking about? Take a look at the fossils for reptile to mammal evolution, or the evolution of the whale, or human evolution. I think examples such as these and hundreds more overwhelmingly support the theory of evolution. Incremental changes, selected for by the environment over generations can radically change organisms, complexity can dramatically increase. And while we can see many of the mechanisms of evolution at work, there is still no evidence of supernatural intervention.However, there would be no natural selection before there was any life at all, so the first life would have had to be perfectly random. Also, though natural selection could be non-random, it is certainly not creative or intelligent (unless you want to start speaking of it as Nature, as some evolutionists understadably do) so I hold that even a psuedo-random force is very unlikely to have caused the kind of complexity we see in life. Firstly sorry about the ignorant crack I made, I'm not here to insult. (And I even spelled it wrong, talk about 'igonorance'......)And the formation of life isn't part of the theory of evolution. Since we don't know the exact conditions when life first formed, we can't know how random it was. As for natural selection, no of course it isn't creative or intelligent. But for the myriad ecological niches, changing environments, I think it is the best explaination. The fact that evolution uses what works and doesn't somehow design the best systems and adaptations for any given environment, to me, is evidence that an unintelligent force has shaped the diversity of life on the planet, not a creative, omniscient creator.Creation has been observed, it is a fact. Neither statement makes a good arguement, do they? I have to disagree with you here. Evolution has been observed, mutations that cause the change, the environment that they express themselves in. We can point to it and study it. But I have yet to see a creationist point to a specific organism and say "See, this is an example of creation because...." and then give a plausible explaination.Again, I am not aware of all this evidence. Why would a random, or sortofnotrandom force explain the stunning diversity and beauty of our planet better than a superintelligent, creative God? Its not debating when you say you're right and I'm wrong. I think your ignorance of the Bible is showing. For one example, multiple times in the bible it says God stretched out the heavens, in the same sense as expanding a tent. It seems to me that these prophets knew about the Big Bang a long time before our scientists did. A non random force acting on an uncountable number of ecological niches that periodically change, sometimes dramatically, would produce a stunning array of diversity. As for evidence, look at the fossil record, we see a progression of change, we don't see static creatures that suddenly appear and show no signs of evolution. We don't see a mixture of older, more primitive organisms with modern organisms, the fossil record is in a temporal order that is predicted by the theory of evolution. Genetics shows organisms that we observe to be closely related are genetically more similar, just as the theory of evolution predicts.As for my ignorance of the Bible, well, I've read it more than few times.I still don't believe it is a book of science and I don't think the prophets had any idea of modern scientific theories. I think it takes a whole lot of rationalization say that a spreading tent describes the Big Bang.

Creation has not been observed. If you mean all the life forms around us are proof of creation... that's a little different (and debatable). As far as god's original creation... that was not observed by anyone. the authors of the bible were not around at that time, and not even adam and eve were created yet to observe it. what if god was hanging out, and the universe popped into existence by chance with adam and eve and god just took the credit... (j/k)The goal of atheists is not to prove there is no god... well... there may be some like this, but for the most part they are concerned with discovering the truth through science. Science doesn't even try to take a stance on god. it's always going to remain "there is no evidence either for or against the existence of god. an individual's thinking science is a threat to their religion is not justification to call the methods or observations of science into question. However if a person sees an actual mistake science has made in observation or methodology they should be with out a doubt bring that mistake into light. All to often however, creationists have ulterior motives for calling science into question (religious only). Not only do some creationists unjustly challenge science, some try to pass their religion off as science. This would be fine only if they adhered to the rules of science... but normally they do not.

Creation has been observed. By the Creator! It has also been observed through the intervention of the Holy Spirit; by a great many Holy Fathers.Generally the goal of atheists and Christians is to convert - otherwise we'd not have this forum. I doubt anyone is here to just to discuss, but there is an element of learning about each other tooIt is when science calls my methods of observation into question. It is when it denies my evidence as evidence... it could deny it as not being 'scientific evidence' but then no one on this forum's done that. Lurch and Crim have just said ... "it's not evidence" period!Creationists and creation science are two things. What are the 'rules of science' and has anyone observed abiogenesis?Has anyone observed alien life? Yet it is perfectly reasonable (amongst many scientists) to look for life, to spend big on SETI etc.

Unfortunately for creationists such as monty, the blood clotting cascade, like all of Behe's other cited examples of irreducible complexity, has been shown to be not the case. Russell Doolittle cites some experiments with mice where progeny which are missing two genes involved in the blood clotting cascade were normal. See this articleTherefore the vertebrate blood clotting system is not irreducibly complex. Miller addresses the issue of how the vertebrate blood clotting cascade could evolve hereBehe's irreducible complexity argument as evidence for an intelligent designer does not even rate as a strawman until he actually comes up with a valid example.

Robbie, a bit more detailDarwin's Black Box shows that regardless of the 'small steps' argument of Dawkins, some biological systems can't be made in such fashion. Behe wrote after Dawkins, so he goes over a lot of Dawkins' arguments.That the blood-clotting cascade can't be put together bit by bit because it is a system that either works as a whole or not - with fatal results.Many people will try to critcise, but not the argument, but against the arguer so e.g.Behe is religious, or Johnson is a lawyer (or a religious lawyer).You will hear the argumental phrase "strawman" crop up so many times, as well.

As WJA thinks that pointing to a web-site argument is itself an argument, then I shall do likewise...http://www.arn.org/docs/behe/mb_inde...ingcascade.htmIs Behe's debunking of Doolittle's critique.Here's a bit of what it says "Professor Doolittle argued that new laboratory work showed two components of the blood clotting cascade could be eliminated ("knocked-out") from mice and the mice got along fine without them. However, Doolittle misread the laboratory work: the double knock-out mice have severe problems and have no functioning blood clotting system They are not models of evolutionary intermediates. "

so you’re going to take his word for it? Hopefully you’ll require some kind of qualification, or proof from someone (something) before you blindly believe what they say. So what’s his proof? “I created the universe, I’m all powerful, and I never lie”. well, the creation of the universe is in question, so claiming that is just circular logic, and isn’t admissible as proof. Same with the second, creating the universe could suggest he’s all powerful, but again it would be circular logic to accept this as the creation of the universe is in question. And the last… how do we know he never lies? Well, most of his assertions (the bible) can’t be independently confirmed, so we’re not sure about the accuracy of that either. er… don’t confuse Christian goals with non-Christian goals. Maybe that’s the goal of some, but there is no atheist dogma that states atheists should convert theists to atheism. That’s certainly not my goal here.

Religious beliefs that state the origins of the universe are fine by me, just as long as they don’t insist it was a factual, historical event that is supported by scientifically confirmable evidence. I’m not certain, but I think they have made comments like that with out supporting reasons because it should be blindingly clear why the bible is not admissible as evidence… that is for anyone who is familiar with the scientific method.

It is somewhat a waste of time to expound upon the writings of religious dogma when most of the people don't share your faith.All that explains is why you don't believe in evolution, not why others shouldn't.

I have been thinking about what lurch said about us creationists wanting to convice people to accept Jesus Christ as their savior and friend. It's quite simple really. If you beleived a person would suffer unimaginable despair if they didn't, would you keep it to yourself?It's my opinion that atheists are motivated by their faith just as much as creationists. They champion evolution because they think it says there is no God, and because it does say that God took no personal part in our creation. Very few are the pure scientists with no belief one way or the other. If any. So in some theories science says nothing about God, but in practice it is not that way. Maybe I'm getting off topic, but I am convinced that the same biases creationists are accused of exist equally on the other side. It seems to me that the atheists make too big a deal out of the bias a creationist has, when they have it too.I don't think science can provide no evidence for the existence of God, rather, no proof.:) Here I was expecting just another arrogant evolutionist who'd never cracked a Bible cover when you come out and say this! I was wrong to assume you were ignorant about the Bible, but then I was justifyably steamed up when you said I was clinging to primitive myths by faith alone, although I have begun by pure faith. Primitive myth wasn't the most neutral description of what I (hopefully) live by.When I said that the statement 'creation is fact' is not a good standalone arguement, I was trying to say that you kept saying stuff like - well - 'evolution is fact' without giving me any reason or evidence I could look at.Finally, you made a statement that tried to show the logic behind evolutionary theory, rather than saying its right! I mean no offense, but you've been talking as if there was no need for logic to accompany your statements that evolution is fact. OK, first with the other statements... I honestly don't know where to find the fossil records you speak of, that's my problem here! Where in the theory of evolution does it say that organisms related genetically should be similar??? I think it's something else to say a pseudo-random force would produce the array of diversity we see, but that's just me I guess :) What do you say about irreducibly complex structures?The point is, if years and years of purposed work by us intelligent, creative humans still hasn't changed 'primordial soup' in the most favorable conditions into any form of life(I'm talking about the attempts to cause abiogenisis) then surely it's unlikely that random forces could have, unless given infinity universes to work in. And no it isn't proof. It is saying that the most logical cause is the one to pick. And yes, this isn't talking about evolution per se, it is talking about Atheistic Evolution.And if the whole history of creative human effort cannot hope to match life then how likely is it for a non-intelligent, non-creative force to have done it?You've said: "We can see many of the pathways evolution has taken, there is no process or organ that has mysteriously formed." basically implying that we've mapped out the evolutionary history of all processes and organs. Where can I find these maps? Where can I find an observed case of drastic complexity increase? We only see the mecanisms of micro-evolution, we haven't seen species change. Has evolution stopped? Why do 0 new species occur, while thousands upon thousands dissapear? You speak as if evolution were everyday common sense and I say that I must have missed something if this is the case, and won't you please show me where I can find what I've missed!

I think it is a strong arguement simply because life is more complex than anything we creative and intelligent humans can match, therefore the most sensible beleif would be that life was created. Your statements seem to indicate that we now know a very detailed history of evolution. I was not aware of this, please give me some examples. I don't think it follows that because we can't create complex life, it must have been a greater creator, God. At one point man did not understand electricity, could not create electricity, therefore does it follow that the primitive people who attributed it to the gods were right because they couldn't create lightning bolts? This is a God of the Gaps arguement, if/when we can create complex cells and lifeforms, does this disprove creationism? As for a 'very detailed history of evolution' how detailed are you talking about? Take a look at the fossils for reptile to mammal evolution, or the evolution of the whale, or human evolution. I think examples such as these and hundreds more overwhelmingly support the theory of evolution. Incremental changes, selected for by the environment over generations can radically change organisms, complexity can dramatically increase. And while we can see many of the mechanisms of evolution at work, there is still no evidence of supernatural intervention.However, there would be no natural selection before there was any life at all, so the first life would have had to be perfectly random. Also, though natural selection could be non-random, it is certainly not creative or intelligent (unless you want to start speaking of it as Nature, as some evolutionists understadably do) so I hold that even a psuedo-random force is very unlikely to have caused the kind of complexity we see in life. Firstly sorry about the ignorant crack I made, I'm not here to insult. (And I even spelled it wrong, talk about 'igonorance'......)And the formation of life isn't part of the theory of evolution. Since we don't know the exact conditions when life first formed, we can't know how random it was. As for natural selection, no of course it isn't creative or intelligent. But for the myriad ecological niches, changing environments, I think it is the best explaination. The fact that evolution uses what works and doesn't somehow design the best systems and adaptations for any given environment, to me, is evidence that an unintelligent force has shaped the diversity of life on the planet, not a creative, omniscient creator.Creation has been observed, it is a fact. Neither statement makes a good arguement, do they? I have to disagree with you here. Evolution has been observed, mutations that cause the change, the environment that they express themselves in. We can point to it and study it. But I have yet to see a creationist point to a specific organism and say "See, this is an example of creation because...." and then give a plausible explaination.Again, I am not aware of all this evidence. Why would a random, or sortofnotrandom force explain the stunning diversity and beauty of our planet better than a superintelligent, creative God? Its not debating when you say you're right and I'm wrong. I think your ignorance of the Bible is showing. For one example, multiple times in the bible it says God stretched out the heavens, in the same sense as expanding a tent. It seems to me that these prophets knew about the Big Bang a long time before our scientists did. A non random force acting on an uncountable number of ecological niches that periodically change, sometimes dramatically, would produce a stunning array of diversity. As for evidence, look at the fossil record, we see a progression of change, we don't see static creatures that suddenly appear and show no signs of evolution. We don't see a mixture of older, more primitive organisms with modern organisms, the fossil record is in a temporal order that is predicted by the theory of evolution. Genetics shows organisms that we observe to be closely related are genetically more similar, just as the theory of evolution predicts.As for my ignorance of the Bible, well, I've read it more than few times.I still don't believe it is a book of science and I don't think the prophets had any idea of modern scientific theories. I think it takes a whole lot of rationalization say that a spreading tent describes the Big Bang.

but that’s hardly reason to invalidate evolution. They are arguing over the details. All these schools of thought agree that evolution happened, they just aren’t sure about the specifics. But at the end of the day one scientific theory will hold, and the others will be falsified.I forgot why this came up in the first place… so we know what we see of the sun isn’t happening in real time… but so what? Does that mean we can’t trust what we do observe? So they believe that a literal interpretation of the bible should be taken. Do these authors who say a literal interpretation should be taken offer any new evidence as to the validity of genesis? It’s hardly convincing to say that individuals say genesis should be interpreted literally. This is not evidence that genesis happened, unless they bring new information to light. Genesis still has to stand on it’s own.This is a good point. Is testimony from individuals from other religions proof of their religion? If yes, what does that say about your religion? If not, why the hypocrisy?

If you doubt the people making such claims. Did you not read my quote from Michel de Montaigne?Simply put there is a huge amount of speculation based on small pieces of evidence. Take for example mutually exclusive theories that it contains, quite happily. I've documented these on other posts, such as the several different schools of thought how mankind arose. They're all using the same evidence, but coming up with different theories, yet it's all still accepted as true.At any given point in time, when you feel the sun's rays, you could say "I know the sun is there", but it may have exploded. It takes some time (granted a very short time) for the sun's rays to reach you. So what you are experiencing is something of a past event. A better analogy would have been any other star, but the principle's the same. What you observe is true, but to a point.Did you not read my post about the allegorical approach to the Bible? Sometimes I feel that you don't read what I've written.(but see below)You assume wrongly... The single biggest Christian denomination is the Catholic Church. Next biggest is the Orthodox Church. Both these follow Holy Tradition. Not numerically as great are the Coptic Churches. So, you've simply argued past the majority of Christians.Holy Tradition is the faith of the Orthodox Church. It is the Bible as interpreted by the Church. We believe that Holy Tradition is the Bible as best understood. So, likewise, if you read a law, you might want an interpretation of the law, so you pick up a law book, hopefully written by someone who's studied the subject.Likewise we have the Church Fathers, and lesser writers who have commentated on the Scripture.The basis for this is... the Bible didn't fall out of heaven fully written. It took time to compile. The first teachings of Christ were oral. Christ commissioned his Apostles to go out and preach in His name. They did so, they established the early Church and the offices therein.When it came time to put the Bible together the Church gathered together and looked at over a hundred books that were in circulation. They said "Which of these are in keeping with what we've always taught?" and guided by the Holy Spirit they compiled the Bible.Peter, who knew Jesus, taught others their faith. Clement of Rome was one of his disciples. Clement also wrote on issues, so we can read Clement's epistle. Ignatius of Antioch's another one. All the way down to the present when we have writers today.What you are critiquing therefore is but a tiny part of our Christianity. Like trying to discern Australia society by reading the few pages of our Constitution only.Thus, on another post, when dealing with the Orthodox idea of love and marriage, I listed sources:Those who have written about love, marriage (that is a union under God of a man with a woman) and sexuality:Basil the Great (330-79)Gregory of Nyssa (331-95)John Chrysotomon (347-407)The Desert Fathers (4th-5th centuries)Isaiah the Solitary (5th century)Diadochos of Photike (5th century)Dorotheos of Gaza (6th century)Gregory the Great (540-604)Theodore the Ascetic (7th century)Maximos the Confessor (580-662)Thaslassios the Libyan (7th century)Dionysios the Areopagite (c.500)John Klimakos (579-649)Symeon the New Theologian (949-1022)Nicholas Kavasilas (1322-96)Symeon of Thessalonika (d.1429)Dimitri of Rostov (1651-1709)Macarius of Optino (1788-1860)Ignatius Brianchaninov (1807-67)John of Kronstad (1829-1908)Silouan of Athos (1866-1938)Alexander Elchaninov (1881-1934)Kallistos of Diokleia (b.1934)list taken from "Love, Sexuality, and the Sacrament of Marriage" by John ChryssavgisOr, on Genesis, I could go to the writings of some of the Church Fathers who have written on this particular subject; John Chysotomon, Epharim the Syrian, Basil the Great, Ambrose of Milan, John Damascene, Anthanasius the Great, Gregory of Nyssa et al. AND THESE WRITERS SUGGEST A LITERAL INTERPRETATION.People such as those writing on these posts seem to think that I'm stupid for submitting to the will of my Church. I recognise their long standing and expertise.*Scripture alone.

It would seem rather odd. If I heard on the news a prosecutor in America was calling before the court 14 different black men, each who had nothing to do with each other, on account of a murder, then I'd not say, 'so long as it's a muder trial, and one of them must be guilty... it's okay'. I'd be very suspicious if the DA had 'evidences' that each individual was a prime suspect.I would suspect bias. And, lo and behold, many of the people who believe in evolution don't believe in God. Thus I suspect bias, because they are all looking around for an explanation that doesn't involve God.This is why Crick had to come up with the idea of panspermia"Francis Crick also thinks that life on earth may have begun when aliens from another planet sent a rocket ship containing spores to seed the earth. This is no idle thought; Crick first proposed it with chemist Leslie Orgel in 1973 in an article entitled "Directed Panspermia" in a professional science journal called Icarus. A decade later Crick wrote a book, Life Itself, reiterating the theory; in a 1992 interview in Scientific American on the eve of the publication of his latest book, Crick reaffirmed that he things the theory is reasonable."

Such a great saint as Augustine swears that he saw: a blind child restored to sight by the relics of Saint Gervaise and Saint Protasius at Milan; a woman in Carthage cured of a cancer by the sign of the cross made by a woman who had just been baptised; his close friend Hesperius driving off devils (who were infesting his house) by using a little soil taken from the sepulchre of our Lord, and that same soil, borne into the Church, suddenly curing a paralytic; a woman who, having touched the reliquary of Saint Stephen with a posy of flowers during a procession, rubbed her eyes with them afterwards and recovered her sight which she had recently lost...

I certainly don’t. I suppose in a way that’s faith, but it’s very different from religious faith. Religious faith can exist with out any evidence, however, every time we see the sun, that is further evidence that it exists. It’s “faith” (or a belief) but it is not void of any evidence. The sun has always existed before… why should it stop now?I fail to see how the time the article was written has anything to do with it’s validity. No one (except for, as you say, god) was around for the first creation, so any revelations that say he did it would have to come through him. 1) no I don’t accept all theories of evolution to be true. I believe one theory will withstand the test of time, and will be shown to be a much better model than all the other. And you make it sound like there are some huge discrepancies. The discrepancies come from details that could have happened in several different ways. They all believe evolution happened. for example, if you and several other people were to see a car crash, you would all know a car crash happened. but you may not agree on if a man or a woman was driving, or the time of day, or the color of the car… however debating the details does not take away from the fact that the car crash did happen…however, more importantly:2) You claim personal revelations are valid evidences for your religion… would you take the same stance on personal revelations concerning OTHER religions? I’m not saying this is proof to cancel them all out. What I mean to gain is to find out if you are either a hypocrite, or you’ll admit that other religions have valid supporting evidence (according to you).

I said I looked for other polls but couldn’t find any. In the US at least 80% of supports of evolution also believe in god. If you want to say most Muslims, and Hindus, and whoever mostly don’t believe in evolution back up the claim with sources. Otherwise you can be accused of making up information.ok, I suppose it could be… however most things in the middle of the road, that look like car crashes are actually car crashes, and not modern art. While other people are going around trying to figure out what happened, you can just smugly sit there and claim to know it’s modern art because some guy standing next to you says it is modern art, and he designed it. Even if some of the things the “artist” says should be found in the modern art piece are not found by the investigators, you still hold an accident did not occur, and instead it was designed. That’s fine if you want to sit off to the side and hold that belief, but to try and convince the people examining the accident that their investigation if fundamentally flawed because they don’t communicate with the “artist” is destructive to their investigation… unless you can provide credible evidence that the “thing that looks like a car wreck” was actually designed. “the source of the experience”? So since it comes from your god it is admissible as evidence? This sounds like you are dismissing their “evidence” (again according to you communication from god is admissible) because they do not say it come from the same place as you. So it looks like you are a hypocrite. You accept “evidence” that supports your belief (because it comes from a reliable source), and reject “evidence” that does not support your belief (because it obviously comes from a fallacious source). You then in turn attempt to use this “evidence” as support of your religion… and now that it has been confirmed to you that this religion is the true one, you can accept and reject more evidence based on if it supports or goes against this established religion. This is circular logic.

theomorphic, one of your web-sites I don't like.I think religious tolerence is over-rated and widely misunderstood.

I think it was you who made the statement to begin with, that and tried to show by using polls of Americans that this correlates to the rest of the world... including non-Americans and non-Christians.However as educational standards in most third world countries are known to be inadequate, and that the basics of schooling are usually just reading and writing it is far more certain to propose that the majority of people who believe in God, have never even heard of evolution. Therefore they are unlikely to believe in something they've never heard of.The Orthodox Church has made no formal acceptance of evolution.What is your problem that I accept God's teachings and reject people's teachings that don't come from God? How is that 'hypocritical'? I am in fact practicing what I preach. I accept that their experiences are true (see below), but come from different sources than mine. I have stated this, you seem to believe that I believe it... so what's your problem? Why would I accept evidence from something I believe to be an unreliable source?However, I'd like to revisit what you said... quote:"You accept ?evidence? that supports your belief (because it comes from a reliable source), and reject ?evidence? that does not support your belief (because it obviously comes from a fallacious source)" is something you do! You are being hypocritical, by your own standards! For, not only do you not accept religious evidence as anything other than subjective experience, you don't even believe all that you consider 'objective' evidence. You said in an earlier post " no I don?t accept all theories of evolution to be true" Soa) how do you know which evolutionary truths are true?b) what makes you certain that these are right, when other scientists can give rational explanations for their beliefs?Why would it be wrong for me to believe in God and believe that other people have the wrong message? You don't seem to be arguing that my truth isn't THE TRUTH, you're arguing that I can't believe in THE TRUTH.But you're misunderstanding me completely. And I'm not fully understanding you either.There are two issues here. I'm not sure which it is that you're arguing. Thata) I know God existsorb) That people can have religious experiences.People having religious experience: I believe a person who says they have a religious experience, I'm not judging them of that. You are. I said the sources of that experience are varied. Some people can have a religious experience having sex, or smoking dope. I never said that I doubted their genuineness at all. You doubt it because you don't believe in religious experiences, just science. You might accept that they are having an 'experience' but that it is not religious or supernatural. So, let's look at genuinely supernatural experience...People having 'genuine' religious experience in the sense of what you really mean... that is an experience with something/someone supernatural. And again I don't doubt Hindus, Muslims, non-Orthodox are having genuine experiences with the super-natural. But you'd doubt this too. Even though you accept the limitations of science (as stated in an earlier post) you don't accept the notion of people who have extra-science experience. I find this odd. I can't understand what you're arguing against, unless you have some 'third way' idea that's neither supernatural/religious, nor scientific.The supernatural is a big place. That is why I suggested that their experiences come from different sources. I believe mine come from God. There are many being out there: God, angels, demons, Satan.Another issue here is certainty. And here again, at best, you are uncertain of what you believe in and are trying through logic to show flaws in why I should be certain of my beliefs; even though you also admit you're not out to convert anyone. This makes no sense. You admit there's a small possibility that you might just be a brain in a box... so why then do you believe in what you believe in? How do you know anything you experience is 'real' in the sense that it doesn't just exist by your experience of it?IF you don't know, then why believe in particular in evolution and why not religion? -what is it about not believing in God that appeals?IF you are certain, then why is it amazing that I would be certain too, especially when you claim that the two aren't mutually exclusive? Or is it that you are certain, and you just want to see if I've come to this certainty the same way you have?How do you know anything? How do you know that is real? What if your experiences are just an attempt to put into order a jumble of feelings?Here's a very long argument about the existence of God. I hope you spend many days reading it.http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06608b.htmI've no idea what you mean by this. I think though the simple claim made by you was 'most people who believe in God, believe also in evolution'. There is no proof of this.

You insist science should accept individuals testimony that messaged from God, are actually from God, and should be used as evidence. However, you only want to accept religious testimony that comes from people who say they heard YOUR God. what objective evidence (not religious, because that’s in question) do I not believe? You say I don’t even consider all objective evidence… please give me a few examples (my definition of objective evidence).As for evolution: I don’t know what theories are true… but I’m pretty sure it only happened one way. Not several. When everything is known about the earth’s past (physical evidence only) one theory of evolution will survive over the others. Science doesn’t claim to know everything about evolution… studies are still being done, and ideas are still being tossed around. In the end I’m pretty sure one “rational” belief will continue to be rational, and other will become irrational (and woe be to the scientist who clings to his scientific “truth” despite evidence contrary).[quote=montalban]Why would it be wrong for me to believe in God and believe that other people have the wrong message? [/quoteNothing wrong here.correct, I don’t know if your truth is the truth. Ideas like that can’t really be argued for or against. I say you can’t KNOW the truth. If you want to believe some truth, fine… but it is impossible to know ANYTHING (except for one thing… remember what that is?) again if you claim that you KNOW this truth, let me make up a scenario for you. You don’t actually know if god exists (see above). Maybe people have religious experiences, and maybe they even come from God… but this is inadmissible as scientific evidence because it is subjective (not independently verifiable).No. maybe they are having religious experiences, even from god… but I don’t know if it’s real, thus the subjective nature.Science doesn’t say one way or the other whether their experiences are from a higher deity or not. Since the experiences (whatever they are) are subjective, they are inadmissible as scientific evidence. Again, since it is unverifiable it is inadmissible as scientific evidence. I’m not certain, but what I believe in explains all the observations around me, or has the potential to explain all the observations around me. I’m agnostic. I believe it can’t be known whether a god exists or not. You may think you know, but you don’t actually know. Again, see above for a challenge.I’m not trying to prove there is not god. I’m trying to get you to understand you can’t be certain whether a god exists or not. I’ve already admitted I can’t be sure whether the earth orbits the sun… however all my observations indicated that the earth does orbit the sun. Just because you admit that you don’t KNOW something for certain, doesn’t mean you have to drop that belief. I’ll keep going on assuming what I observe is all there is until I have reason to believe this is not true. It seems you’ve already been convinced there is more… I’m not trying to make you stop believing that. I’m trying to get you to admit there may not be more. No, I didn’t claim most believers in god believe in evolution… instead I claim most believers in evolution also believe in god (way different). You claimed that evolution was just an atheist attempt to disprove god to theists:most people who believe in evolution also believe in god. In the US at least around 80% believe in god. Only 20% are atheists, suggesting evolution is not some method to explain away god. It doesn’t matter how many non-believers in evolution. To show that evolution was somehow directed by atheists you would have to show most supports of evolution are also atheist (and THEN we could consider their ulterior motives.)

This is lifted from another post I wrote... but it covers what you wrote...Observation in labs doesn't 'prove' anything other than observation in labs!This is a paraphrasing of a case put forward in "Chaos" by James GleickSuppose that you are a scientist working in a lab? and you are given newly discovered bacteria and you are asked to describe its nature.You peer at it through a microscope and notice that the bacteria is quite ?excited?You write a paper explaining your observations.Other labs around the world, under similar conditions observe the same behaviour in the same bacteria.The conclusion is that the bacteria ARE as you had stated.But what you are failing to realise is that in order to observe the bacteria through a microscope, you are shining a light onto them. The bacteria could be reacting with the light, so how they ARE normally might be quite different to how they ARE when you observe them.Repeat observations would only confirm your misunderstanding!"Thus it is wholly subjective!

I read Behe's claptrap a couple of years ago. It didn't impress me then, and it impresses me even less after having read all of his goal post moving and such when critics have pointed out answers to his questions and such...His target audience - lay creationists and political conservatives - gobbled it up, of course...

Your lack of knowledge about the scientific method is appalling. Really it is. I suggest you do some serious research into what the scientific method is, why it’s tentative, why it’s so powerful, why it’s such a good system to build a basis of knowledge, and why it is very limited. You don’t even have to agree with the scientific method… but until you should at least educate yourself you’ll continue to look like a XXXXX for ascribing religious attributes to science. For example:All these comments hint that you lack a basic understanding about the scientific method, and certain definitions about science. I suggest taking some time here:http://phyun5.ucr.edu/~wudka/Physics...www/node5.htmlI looked over it, and it doesn’t seem too overwhelming. I’ve never said my perception is superior to yours. I’ve said I only rely on evidence that I can confirm.

Well, regardless of if you actually have doubts or not, you don’t know if what you believe is absolutely true. Go watch “The Truman Show”, “The Matrix” and “The thirteenth floor”… wait… not sure about that last one… I reserve the right to change the movie title of that last one. All these movies point to the fact that we can’t absolutely know what we observe is a reflection of reality. Even religious revelations may be synthetic in some way.Science does fall into this pit too, however they don’t deny there is a pit. Science says “well of course we can’t absolutely know if this is accurate… but so far we have no reason to believe it’s inaccurate, so we’ll continue just assuming it is right until we have reason to believe otherwise”. Ok, this next part is long, so bear with me.“Why We Don’t Know: Chapter 1”:Pretend instead of the God you know of there was instead a malicious and deceitful god. Now this god didn’t create the universe… actually his only power is to send psychic feelings and messages to creatures with brains. So this God is sitting in the empty universe minding his own business when suddenly the big bang happens, and matter is strewn about the universe. Billions of years later life starts to crop up on this planet earth. This God decides to have some fun with a newly emerging species that is showing to be incredibly smart and clever when compared to the other animals. So this God starts telling them things in their head. He starts impressing stories onto them,… now this along with their oral tradition they get the idea that some God created the universe as they see it today, and they should listen to this God. Well some doubting Thomases crop up and they ask “well how can we be sure this God is who he says he is?”. Well another one of the messages God had passed down is that you had to have faith no matter what. To do otherwise is evil. So these doubting Thomases are ignored, or persecuted, and so they shut up. So eventually this God sees attention to him is waning, so he find 4 really really gullible people and starts to give them story after story that they must write down and put into a single book. They do it, and include themselves as main characters. Of course the entire book isn’t an outright lie… there is a mix of history, but a lot of the stuff just never happened. Fast forward to 2000 years and now you have supporters and believers in this book all over the world. Now you still have some doubting Thomases, but people who believe the religion are convinced they are right because every time they pray to their God they get messages and warm feelings inside. Sometimes he even grants miracles for them (as it turns out though this isn’t in his power… fortunate things just happen to them every once in a while and he takes credit for it). And these people just don’t quite remember all the times that they asked for something, and it wasn’t delivered. After all, God moves in mysterious ways. ~fin~Ok that was kind of winded, and I know the story seems absurd… but how does this story (in the end) differ from real life as we see it today? We have a holy book, and believers based on individual experience, and it is exactly what we see today. How could you tell this world from our world now? by the way you’re not allowed to say “I would just know” .

The idea of the movie. The movie makes you think. One of the thoughts is “yeah… how COULD I tell the difference between a synthetic world, and a real world?”.are you doing this on purpose? I am not “certain” of science because of it’s uncertainty. I see science as the best way to build a body of knowledge of the physical world. I’m passionate about it because I see it to be the best way to build a body of knowledge of the physical world. No other system has ever done something like this in the past. How are you certain of your religious beliefs? How could you POSSIBLY tell the difference between a synthetic world, and a real world (please answer this question)?I have ALWAYS said science is not absolute. I challenge you to find a quote (in context) that has me claming science was the absolute arbitrator for truth, or it was infallible. I’ve never tried to “judge” God. The most I have said about god is “I have no evidence that supports the existence of God.” And I do not try to convince other people that there is no evidence of God. If they have subjective experiences that show otherwise… or even no experiences, they can believe whatever they want. You can be as certain as you want… but you will never actually know. Again, how could you tell the difference from a synthetic universe, and a real universe?

The idea of the movie. The movie makes you think. One of the thoughts is “yeah… how COULD I tell the difference between a synthetic world, and a real world?”.are you doing this on purpose? I am not “certain” of science because of it’s uncertainty. I see science as the best way to build a body of knowledge of the physical world. I’m passionate about it because I see it to be the best way to build a body of knowledge of the physical world. No other system has ever done something like this in the past. How are you certain of your religious beliefs? How could you POSSIBLY tell the difference between a synthetic world, and a real world (please answer this question)?I have ALWAYS said science is not absolute. I challenge you to find a quote (in context) that has me claming science was the absolute arbitrator for truth, or it was infallible. I’ve never tried to “judge” God. The most I have said about god is “I have no evidence that supports the existence of God.” And I do not try to convince other people that there is no evidence of God. If they have subjective experiences that show otherwise… or even no experiences, they can believe whatever they want. You can be as certain as you want… but you will never actually know. Again, how could you tell the difference from a synthetic universe, and a real universe?

Simply asserting it again doesn’t make it true. Please tell me how you could tell the difference between a synthetic world and a real world. Bald ascertains just don’t count, they are not reasons, they are just claims. I’m sure flat earthers way back in the day never questioned that the earth was flat… does that make their strong absolute beliefs correct?Why is it the best way to build a body of knowledge about the physical world? The proof is in the pudding. Using scientific theories we have sent men to the moon in back, we have increased the food production of the world to keep up with our growing numbers, we have cured diseases (and irradiated them in some cases), we have looked inside atoms, and we have seen the far reaches of the universe. It’s the best way we know of now. If there was some “thing” that had effects on the physical world, but no existence in the physical world, if miracles (that all could see) happened every day with no physical explanation, if the laws of physics were completely random (always changing) then the scientific method would not be enough… and until one of the afore mentioned problems crops up, it will still be the best way to address everything we have observed. To you it may seem like science is pretending to be infallible… but the conclusions drawn using the scientific method are always tentative. Did you look at that website I gave you about the scientific method? Please go read it. And about water boiling… I’m going to have to take that back. It doesn’t quite work because the Celcius scale is defined by water boiling at 100 degrees. So observing it to boil at 100 degrees is circular logic. Try this for an objective observation: A feather and a marble in a vacuum drop at the same speed.if you agree that God is purely supernatural in nature, then science has no business explaining it. Stemming from that God today would have no impact on the physical world. Personal revelations, and subjective experiences are not admissible as evidence because they are not verifiable, and not objective.err… well sure. I know (don’t harp on me claiming I “know” something… it’s always tentative) that Hollywood stunts exist, and there is a show called punk’d, and people lie, and are deceitful, and sometimes trick one another. If something is inexplicable, why should I automatically assume God? Inexplicable does not mean Goddidit.

no, this is reasoning, and logic. When I make a claim I back it up with reasons.

This says nothing about falling bodies, or properties of a vacuum, or air resistance… that observation exists in the real world, and everyone can see it.God sending a message to someone is subjective because outside the person’s head there is no proof that the event happened. This does not deem the incident false, it just isn’t confirmed to be true either. I’m not familiar with prions.

You still have yet to answer my reasoning. I’m serious… I want an answer from you. I gave you reasons for my claim, so answer those reasons.I “plow on” with science in physical testable matters because it has shown to be reliable. In the end I can’t know if it’s all real, or all completely accurate, but so far it has suited me fine, so I see no reason to change. Do you have a list of a prior facts you made about me the first time you saw me post, and just keep referring to that, and then responding to what’s on that page? It would hold to character in that you assume to have the answers before looking at evidence. It’s faith based on observations, and experiences. You keep harping about limitations of science… it’s not a limitation if science never goes to the spiritual world. A butter knife is not limited as long as no one expects to cut a tree down with it. Do you want to admit to religions limitations in the physical world? Of course not, because religion is not meant to explain how the physical world works. I can see that about your primary belief system, why can’t you see that about mine?

Religion:a. Belief in and reverence for a supernatural power or powers regarded as creator and governor of the universe. b. A personal or institutionalized system grounded in such belief and worship. 2. The life or condition of a person in a religious order. 3. A set of beliefs, values, and practices based on the teachings of a spiritual leader. 4. A cause, principle, or activity pursued with zeal or conscientious devotion. The closest one is the last… and with that definition everything from soccer to sex is a religion.

Robbie, sorry it took me a while to get back to you.but then I was justifyably steamed up when you said I was clinging to primitive myths by faith alone, although I have begun by pure faith. Let me just say I don't think your faith is primitive, you've found something that works to make your life better, so I say good for you, you're a lucky man. But I still think that a belief in a six day creation, a global flood, denying evolution are primitive attempts at explaining some of the big questions. I don't see how you can exclude the evidence we've accumulated since the Bible was written solely on faith. My intent is not to insult you but that's how I feel.Finally, you made a statement that tried to show the logic behind evolutionary theory, rather than saying its right! I mean no offense, but you've been talking as if there was no need for logic to accompany your statements that evolution is fact. OK, but evolution is a fact, we see it occur. We see organisms adapting to there environment, we see new species forming so we see macroevolution in action. Look up stuff like nylon eating bacteria, Farhoe Island mouse for just a few examples of new species we have ovserved evolving. We understand and can observe and test some of the mechanisms, like mutation. Biologists overwhelmingly concurr, evolution does occur. Where in the theory of evolution does it say that organisms related genetically should be similar???  I'm getting a little out of my league, but all mammals have hair, produce milk, all fish have gills, etc....,their are similarities between organisms and their genetic structure will support this and does.What do you say about irreducibly complex structures? I say show me one. All the examples proponents of IC have used have been shown to have plausible evolutionary pathways, the eye, flagellum, blood clotting, I haven't seen a structure that is irreducibly complex. Give me an example of an IC structure and we'll discuss it.The point is, if years and years of purposed work by us intelligent, creative humans still hasn't changed 'primordial soup' in the most favorable conditions into any form of life(I'm talking about the attempts to cause abiogenisis) then surely it's unlikely that random forces could have, unless given infinity universes to work in. And no it isn't proof. It is saying that the most logical cause is the one to pick. And yes, this isn't talking about evolution per se, it is talking about Atheistic Evolution. But we still don't know what was in the original primordial soup! This existed roughly 3.5 to 4 billion years ago. So far we haven't been able to find anything but the faintest of clues as to what it was made of. Your arguement seems to be "if we haven't been able to do it by now, we never will and that proves only God could have started life". God of the gaps arguement. Science hasn't discovered everything, we don't know everything. But we continue to learn, we continue to explore, we continue to investigate. Would you have us stop experimenting with the origins of life because some fundamentalist Christians think it's futile? NASA is planning to launch a probe to Satun's moon Titan because it looks like it's atmosphere may be like primordial earths, isn't this a worthy undertaking? You've said: "We can see many of the pathways evolution has taken, there is no process or organ that has mysteriously formed." basically implying that we've mapped out the evolutionary history of all processes and organs.  OK, once again, I might be getting in over my head but there are evolunarily plausible explainations for most processes and organs. Check a good book on evolution or biology. I'm sure there are still some that are a mystery but over all, we can trace the evolution of most organs and processes back to their most likely origins. Hey I'm not a proffesional biologists, so if someone more qualified wants to support or correct me, I'd love to hear it.Where can I find an observed case of drastic complexity increase? Look up nylon eating bacteria, an organism that experiences a frame shift mutation and then gains the ability to digest nylon which it didn't have before, certainly sounds like a drastic increase in complexity to me.We only see the mecanisms of micro-evolution, we haven't seen species change. Has evolution stopped But microevolution and macroevolution are essential the same, they use the same verified mechanisms. What prevents the accumulation of micro changes from adding up to a macro change? What is that barrier?Don't just say "we see microevolution but macroevolution is impossible..."show me why it's impossible. We have seen new species arise, I think I gave a few examples previously, so evolution certainly hasn't stopped. In fact, all life is actually in transition.won't you please show me where I can find what I've missed! Their are a lot of books on the subject. You can check out the TalkOrigins website, many creationists don't like it but it has a wealth of information and they site all their sources so you can double check them.At the very least, you need a better understanding of the theory of evolution just to argue against it more effectively.

Well, regardless of if you actually have doubts or not, you don’t know if what you believe is absolutely true. Go watch “The Truman Show”, “The Matrix” and “The thirteenth floor”… wait… not sure about that last one… I reserve the right to change the movie title of that last one. All these movies point to the fact that we can’t absolutely know what we observe is a reflection of reality. Even religious revelations may be synthetic in some way.Science does fall into this pit too, however they don’t deny there is a pit. Science says “well of course we can’t absolutely know if this is accurate… but so far we have no reason to believe it’s inaccurate, so we’ll continue just assuming it is right until we have reason to believe otherwise”. Ok, this next part is long, so bear with me.“Why We Don’t Know: Chapter 1”:Pretend instead of the God you know of there was instead a malicious and deceitful god. Now this god didn’t create the universe… actually his only power is to send psychic feelings and messages to creatures with brains. So this God is sitting in the empty universe minding his own business when suddenly the big bang happens, and matter is strewn about the universe. Billions of years later life starts to crop up on this planet earth. This God decides to have some fun with a newly emerging species that is showing to be incredibly smart and clever when compared to the other animals. So this God starts telling them things in their head. He starts impressing stories onto them,… now this along with their oral tradition they get the idea that some God created the universe as they see it today, and they should listen to this God. Well some doubting Thomases crop up and they ask “well how can we be sure this God is who he says he is?”. Well another one of the messages God had passed down is that you had to have faith no matter what. To do otherwise is evil. So these doubting Thomases are ignored, or persecuted, and so they shut up. So eventually this God sees attention to him is waning, so he find 4 really really gullible people and starts to give them story after story that they must write down and put into a single book. They do it, and include themselves as main characters. Of course the entire book isn’t an outright lie… there is a mix of history, but a lot of the stuff just never happened. Fast forward to 2000 years and now you have supporters and believers in this book all over the world. Now you still have some doubting Thomases, but people who believe the religion are convinced they are right because every time they pray to their God they get messages and warm feelings inside. Sometimes he even grants miracles for them (as it turns out though this isn’t in his power… fortunate things just happen to them every once in a while and he takes credit for it). And these people just don’t quite remember all the times that they asked for something, and it wasn’t delivered. After all, God moves in mysterious ways. ~fin~Ok that was kind of winded, and I know the story seems absurd… but how does this story (in the end) differ from real life as we see it today? We have a holy book, and believers based on individual experience, and it is exactly what we see today. How could you tell this world from our world now? by the way you’re not allowed to say “I would just know” .

I appreciate that you don't wan't to insult, thanks. However, do you realize your statement sounds condescending? Still, thankyou. I don't actually beleive in 6-day creation. Instead, I beleive that the days in Genesis actually meant ages. Support for this is: In Isaiah it says that to God, a thousand years is like a day(sorry I don't remember the exact reference), Adam named all the living creatures in one 'day', and after each day it says the day ended - but it doesn't say that after the 7th day... possibly suggesting that the 7th 'day' is still continuing. I don't think I exclude evidence... a few years ago I was having doubts about my faith since the media protrays science as anti-Christianity. It seemed as if evolution was a completly given thing, that it was common knowledge that abiogenisis had occured and that the universe had popped out of nothing and nothing else made sense. I have since come across scientific and common-sense reasons why beleif in God makes sense. If I hadn't, the only way I could have held onto my faith would be to 'bury my head in the sand'. The fact that I'm involved on this board shows that I haven't.Well, I've never heard anyone assert that we can see macroevolution. I'll look up the mouse and bacteria. Of course species adapt to their environment, but that's microevolution.This supports genetics. This doesn't support evolution! :) Well, I was thinking about the eye. Could you explain to me what the plausible evolutionary pathways are?I don't think this is 'God of the gaps'... What I'm saying is that intellgent humans haven't figured it out, creative beings can't match it, so it is more likely that it was done by a superintelligent and creative being than random forces, natural selection, and mutations. I disagree that Christianity is anti-science. Many universities were founded by Christians. Newton was Christian, wasn't he?If you could suggest some books to me I will try to get a hold of them. 'Plausible' is a lot different from fact, which is how you first presented it. It may be plausible for evolution to have occured - if there are huge numbers of chances for it to occur... like near infinity earth-like planets or near-infinity universes... we can't discover the universes, so I'd have to see evidence for huge numbers of carbon based life-supporting planets in our universe before I could consider evolution as a possible explanation for the biological complexity we see. Otherwise, the chances are really quite impossible.Well, that sounds pretty cool. Have you heard of a discovery that some bacteria populations that were beleived to be mutating and changing in response to antibiotics were actually going through a regular cycle... it was something like the 'mutation' actually occured every few generations regardless of antiboitic exposure?Assuming that there really have been several species arrive, they certainly don't keep up with the numbers dissapearing, so why is this? Again, I've never heard that micro and macro evolution are so much the same. Did I say 'macroevolution is impossible' ? These are good points, though. Please don't think I'm avoiding them, but I have to go. I'll try to adress them later.

Robbie, sorry it took me a while to get back to you.but then I was justifyably steamed up when you said I was clinging to primitive myths by faith alone, although I have begun by pure faith. Let me just say I don't think your faith is primitive, you've found something that works to make your life better, so I say good for you, you're a lucky man. But I still think that a belief in a six day creation, a global flood, denying evolution are primitive attempts at explaining some of the big questions. I don't see how you can exclude the evidence we've accumulated since the Bible was written solely on faith. My intent is not to insult you but that's how I feel.Finally, you made a statement that tried to show the logic behind evolutionary theory, rather than saying its right! I mean no offense, but you've been talking as if there was no need for logic to accompany your statements that evolution is fact. OK, but evolution is a fact, we see it occur. We see organisms adapting to there environment, we see new species forming so we see macroevolution in action. Look up stuff like nylon eating bacteria, Farhoe Island mouse for just a few examples of new species we have ovserved evolving. We understand and can observe and test some of the mechanisms, like mutation. Biologists overwhelmingly concurr, evolution does occur.

I agree, but be warned, evolutionaries will heap a whole lot of double-speak now at you!They will show that it's a fact based on evidence. What is this evidence? Well, there's so much of it about, even though it's used to back different hypotheses. So, you'll have all these different and conflicting hypotheses and yet some how, evolution is still a fact!They will say it has been observed through the arrival at new species! Then they can't really tell you what a species is anyway!My specialty is not science. It is the liberal arts; history, religion, politics. I have done formal study in learning language. Here I can apply my studies to evolutionaries and there beliefs. For science to be meaningful, it needs to describe things, and here they use language and here I can look at their language and see if it makes sense.They spit off mantra after mantra that means little if nothing, such as "Survival of the Fittest"I am truly amazed at how they just accept a whole bunch of meaningless phrases and smile and pretend that they've solved things.

We should be careful how we describe things. 1) Evolution is not a fact it is a theory.2) Evolution has never been actually observed (as even microevolution takes generations) it has been deduced from what has been observed.To state that it is fact and observed is highly incorrect. Very few evolutionary thinkers (biologists in particular) would say that it is a fact. Admittedly, it is a long standing theory with few other opponents other than creationism.Certainly genetic mutation occurs as does natural selection. However, it has never been observed (actually watched) of one species changing into another. New species have been discovered yes, their origins traced, yes, but not actually observed.

It seemed as if evolution was a completly given thing, that it was common knowledge that abiogenisis had occured and that the universe had popped out of nothing and nothing else made sense.  Evolution is a given thing, it does happen, we have observed it in our life times, we see bacteria evolving in the lab, we genetically engineer bacteria in the lab. we see new species evolving in the wild and the fossil record can be explained by no other theory except the theory of evolution. Abiogenesis is not a theory yet. We do not have enough evidence, I think it is the most likely source of life on this planet but that is only my opinion. The Big Bang has a great amount of evidence supporting it and it is in the realm of possiblity according to current models that it did pop out of nothing, but once again not enough evidence to conclude what came before it (OK, actually no evidence).This supports genetics. This doesn't support evolution But genetics supports evolution. DNA is subject to mutation, we have seen beneficial mutations arise. That's all evolution needs.Well, I was thinking about the eye. Could you explain to me what the plausible evolutionary pathways are? I would think that since we see all grades of eyes in the world of nature from simple spots of photosensitive chemicals to the highly refined vision of the hawk, the eye can not possibly be Irreducibly complex. We see all the levels, we can see how the eye got more complex, we can deduce what mutations and changes were needed to make it more complex. After all, if we see simpler eyes occurring in nature, how can you say that any eye can not made even simpler? Here's a good web site that goes into more detail than I could:http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~lindsay/...ye_stages.htmlWhat I'm saying is that intellgent humans haven't figured it out, creative beings can't match it, so it is more likely that it was done by a superintelligent and creative being than random forces, natural selection, and mutations.  But are you claiming that humans have figured out everything yet? I don't accept your point that just because we haven't figured it out YET, God had to do it. That is what the God of the gaps arguement is! If we don't understand it, must have been God! Why is it more likely that a supernatural being who we have no evidence even exists, sidestepped the natural laws He had to have set up and popped life into existance?We have seen complex organic molecules form, true we haven't seen life form yet and I can't discount the possiblity that God (or some other supernatural entity) did create that first life, but I find it much more likely it formed on it's own in accord with the natural world. And we have seen mutation and natural selection in action in the natural world.I disagree that Christianity is anti-science. Many universities were founded by Christians. Newton was Christian, wasn't he? And who said Christianity is anti science? Not me! Many Christians are scientists and very good scientists. It's the fundamental creationists I have a problem with. The people who deny the TOE and spout that nonsense about a 6 day creation 6000 years ago, I consider them anti science.If you could suggest some books to me I will try to get a hold of them. 'Plausible' is a lot different from fact, which is how you first presented it.  we were talking about evolutionary pathways for specific organs and systems, that's why I said 'plausible', not evolution as a whole but evolution is a fact, it does happen. This web site covers many of the objections you've made, if you have a chance, take a look at it and we can discuss any of the points you have a problme with:http://www.skeptictank.org/hs/factfaq.htmHave you heard of a discovery that some bacteria populations that were beleived to be mutating and changing in response to antibiotics were actually going through a regular cycle... it was something like the 'mutation' actually occured every few generations regardless of antiboitic exposure? I must admit I haven't heard of this discovery, but it seems to me that if the bacteria was just cycling through these changes, they wouldn't be gaining a permenant immunity to the vaccines we use against them and that clearly is not the case.Assuming that there really have been several species arrive, they certainly don't keep up with the numbers dissapearing, so why is this?  yes new species are arriving all the time, evolution is an ongoing process.Are they keeping up with the number of species going extinct? i don't know, I can see man destroying so many environments as a factor but I just don't know the answer to that. How would this be a problem with evolution?

My but aren't you the argumentative one. 1st, just saying I am wrong does not make it so. Evolution is a deduction based on allele changes. It is not the only possibility, it is one. Most people no longer accept lamarkian principles but at one time it was the advanced thought of the day. It was a theory. They heralded it as fact. I do not define "observe" lightly just to make a point. I use the definition of science based practice. I am a scientist and well educated. Your definition of observe hardly fits within the use of general english language let alone scientific usage. I will say this again, One CANNOT observe evolution. It is not observable. One can see new species, one can identify alleles that appear to have changed. We have never actually observed the allele changes as the process of DNA electrophporesis denatures the DNA and its supporting histones. We can identify genetic material that is different one generation to the next. Mutations do occur.As for your argument that because mutations occur and natural selection occurs that is all that is needed for evolution to happen. True, but it does not mean that evolution must happen. Evolution is one explanation. Evolution has in the nature of it the idea that animals PROGRESS as a result of their genetic mutations. To determine that progression requires many generations of observance. I have done many lab experiments mutating the genes of various animals and insects and plants. I have yet to cause a mutation that did not harm the animal.If you must insist that evolution is observed, then i suggest you pay closer attention in your classes. Your algebra teacher might appreciate it as well.

Err… just because montalban seems incapable of seeing the differences between his hypothetical conversations and what demon38 actually says:this is not equivalent to:notice the use of “evolution” and “the theory of evolution”I doubt anyone has ever made arguments like that to montalban… they seem to be his gross interpretation of what he thinks conversations consist of.

My but aren't you the argumentative one. 1st, just saying I am wrong does not make it so. Evolution is a deduction based on allele changes. It is not the only possibility, it is one. From here:http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?art...49809EC588EEDF"In addition to the theory of evolution, meaning the idea of descent with modification, one may also speak of the fact of evolution. The NAS defines a fact as "an observation that has been repeatedly confirmed and for all practical purposes is accepted as 'true.'" The fossil record and abundant other evidence testify that organisms have evolved through time. Although no one observed those transformations, the indirect evidence is clear, unambiguous and compelling. All sciences frequently rely on indirect evidence. Physicists cannot see subatomic particles directly, for instance, so they verify their existence by watching for telltale tracks that the particles leave in cloud chambers. The absence of direct observation does not make physicists' conclusions less certain."From here:http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/art..._12_7_2000.asp"But in science, a theory is a statement of general principles that explain many facts by means of natural processes. The proposition that the planets revolve around the sun (Copernican theory) explains a great many astronomical facts and also is considered true beyond a reasonable doubt. In the same way, geological examination of rocks demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that the earth is extremely old. The theory of evolution explains a tremendous number of biological and paleontological facts, and it, too, is true beyond a reasonable doubt. Nevertheless, all these theories could be altered or replaced if new observations yielded new scientific evidence that contradicted predictions of these theories."OK, so now it's not just me saying you're wrong, it's Scientific American, the National Academy of Science and the National Center for Science Education. Is that enough for you?I will say this again, One CANNOT observe evolution. It is not observable. As a scientist you use a particularly narrow definition of 'observe', doesn't observation of evidence count? In the case of the nylon eating bacteria we know that there was no population of these bacterium before 1935, nylon didn't exist. But then suddenly they appear and can consume nylon. With extensive DNA examination, we can see that this organism could not consume nylon before a frame shift mutation created a new enzyme that allowed it to metabolize nylon. What would you call the research and conclusions reached about this organism?From here: http://www.nmsr.org/nylon.htm"This case is most interesting. Nylon didn't exist before 1935, and neither did this organism. Detailed examination of the DNA sequences of the original bacterium and of the nylon-ingesting version show identical versions in the gene for a key metabolic enzyme, with only one difference in over 400 nucleotides. However, this single microevolutionary addition of a single thymine ('T') nucleotide caused the new bacterium's enzyme to be composed of a completely novel sequence of amino acids, via the mechanism of frame shifting. The new enzyme is 50 times less efficient than its precursor, as would be expected for a new structure which has not had time to be polished by natural selection. However, this inefficiency would certainly not be expected in the work of an intelligent designer. The genetic mutation that produced this particular irreducibly-complex enzyme probably occurred countless times in the past, and probably was always lethal, until the environment changed, and nylon was introduced."Now I'll grant you, probably no one has directly observed a new organism being born and actually seeing the new species being born and recognizing it for what it is (although I could be wrong about that....), but you give the impression that indirect observation is not enough to draw a strong conclusion......is this your intent?As for your argument that because mutations occur and natural selection occurs that is all that is needed for evolution to happen. True, but it does not mean that evolution must happen.  What? What does it mean if the allele frequencies of a population change? What besides evolution has occurred? Take the example of the nylon eating bacteria above, we know what the mutation was, we know were it occurred, we know that because it occurred in an environment that contained nylon, it was a beneficial mutation, what else would you call it, what other theory explains it if not the theory of evolution?I have done many lab experiments mutating the genes of various animals and insects and plants. I have yet to cause a mutation that did not harm the animal. But you do know that mutations in and of themselves are neutral, whether they are beneficial or detrimental is based on the environment they express themselves in. What experiments did you conduct to cause the mutations and how did you determine whether they were all harmfull to the organisms if the environment determines this?

Err… just because montalban seems incapable of seeing the differences between his hypothetical conversations and what demon38 actually says:this is not equivalent to:notice the use of “evolution” and “the theory of evolution”I doubt anyone has ever made arguments like that to montalban… they seem to be his gross interpretation of what he thinks conversations consist of. Either that, or montalban has not gained much ground against … well anyone, and must resort to debating hypothetical people in order to make points. Straw man. http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/straw-man.html

An interesting thing about my Psycology textbook is that while it says evolution is a generally supported theory, one trait of a true scientist is the willingness to tolerate uncertainty. Therefore, evolution, or any other theory cannot be a given thing or fact. The fossil record shows that, during relativley short periods of time, very large numbers of species apperared, followed by longer 'lulls'. It seems to me that this would support a creationist beleif that God was creating new species at the beginning of a new 'day'(or age). It seems to me that this would be less supportive of evolution, which requires very long periods of time to be occur.I agree with the 'Big-Bang' theory. (maybe this is more because it gives evolution little time to have occured therefore supporting my own bias, but hey) The following might not be perfectly exact.... When Einstien found that his formula for gravity predicted our universe would start from a singularity, expand, and eventually squish, he didn't like it. It meant that the universe could not have existed forever... or at least so long that he wouldn't have to worry about a beginning. So he made up a variable that said once two things were far enough apart gravity would reverse... therefore making it possible for the universe to have continually expanded for a near infininite time before we appeared on the scene. (thus making evolution feasible) He later called this the greatest mistake of his career. Now, as you said, the Big-Bang theory is very much supported. It says our universe began, expanded, and will squish. It also says that the universe is about 15 billion years old. This is not much time for evolution, which is why Einstien didn't want to beleive it.Evolution also needs a lot of time, because beneficial mutations are so very rare the mutation rate has to be slow... so that the bad mutations won't pile up before natural selection 'deselects' them. If the mutation rate is too fast, everything deteriorates until they die. I don't know enough to effectively argue this, so I concede the point. If anyone else can, please do. I'm NOT saying 'God did it'. I'm saying that it is more LIKELY for God to have done it!!!I apologize for having assumed you meant Christianity is anti-science. It was the impression I got, though. You certainly are not cautious in your condemnations.Hilarious website!! I enjoyed very much, except when it was so vehemently attacking and generalizing creationists. I didn't find it all that convincing though. Actually, it mostly just asserted that it was right - although it was informative in it's description of various theory's of evolution. I don't have much else to say but this bit...point 13 - evolution is not atheistic.... No, but it often accepted by atheists who want confirmation of their beliefs... therefore it is influenced by atheism.20. is not dependent on the supernatural,In fact, must exclude itself from this realm. Evolution, as all science, must depend on exactly less than one miracle. No God(s) required nor desired. .... I disagree with this point because it basically implies that if scientific evidence pointed to creation it would not be scientific.21. does not claim that "Man came from apes",... This point goes on to state that Humans and apes came from a common ancestor. The statement that 'Man came from apes' seems more plausible than 'Man came from one single-celled bactiria' - which would be much more accurate - so it isn't a straw-man. The point is that Macroevolution says 'Man is decended from something that was a different species' (kind of wordy, but accurate) That is the point. And it is true. So 'Man came from apes' really represents a non-significant misunderstanding of Macroevolution.New species are not arriving all the time. First, it would be all over the news. Second, the sum of examples in that funny site was probably not over 10. Extinction is occuring at rates between 1 per day to numbers like 1 per hour or more. My point was that the current number of species would not be explained if extinction outstrips speciation so badly. However... it is likely that the effect of humans causes a majority of the extinctions. Also, since we have existed for such a short period of time, speciation rates and extinction rates cannot be reasonably extrapolated to all of history.(assuming speciation does occur) I knew that my arguement was poor, but I kind of ignored that for the sake of saying something, and mostly since I was in a rather emotional state after you continued to repeat 'evolution is fact' as your sole arguement. Lets define some parameters here... evolution - meaning the change of frequency of alleles in a population over time - certainly does happen. It is even described in the Bible... when a population of sheep became more spotted and speckled over time. This seems to me a very obvious point. I'm talking about evolution - meaning the idea that simple, one-celled bacteria became us through macroevolution. When I say evolution, that is what I mean. If I want to include abiogenisis, I will call it Atheistic Evolution.
attacks
It seemed as if evolution was a completly given thing, that it was common knowledge that abiogenisis had occured and that the universe had popped out of nothing and nothing else made sense.  Evolution is a given thing, it does happen, we have observed it in our life times, we see bacteria evolving in the lab, we genetically engineer bacteria in the lab. we see new species evolving in the wild and the fossil record can be explained by no other theory except the theory of evolution. Abiogenesis is not a theory yet. We do not have enough evidence, I think it is the most likely source of life on this planet but that is only my opinion. The Big Bang has a great amount of evidence supporting it and it is in the realm of possiblity according to current models that it did pop out of nothing, but once again not enough evidence to conclude what came before it (OK, actually no evidence).This supports genetics. This doesn't support evolution But genetics supports evolution. DNA is subject to mutation, we have seen beneficial mutations arise. That's all evolution needs.Well, I was thinking about the eye. Could you explain to me what the plausible evolutionary pathways are? I would think that since we see all grades of eyes in the world of nature from simple spots of photosensitive chemicals to the highly refined vision of the hawk, the eye can not possibly be Irreducibly complex. We see all the levels, we can see how the eye got more complex, we can deduce what mutations and changes were needed to make it more complex. After all, if we see simpler eyes occurring in nature, how can you say that any eye can not made even simpler? Here's a good web site that goes into more detail than I could:http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~lindsay/...ye_stages.htmlWhat I'm saying is that intellgent humans haven't figured it out, creative beings can't match it, so it is more likely that it was done by a superintelligent and creative being than random forces, natural selection, and mutations.  But are you claiming that humans have figured out everything yet? I don't accept your point that just because we haven't figured it out YET, God had to do it. That is what the God of the gaps arguement is! If we don't understand it, must have been God! Why is it more likely that a supernatural being who we have no evidence even exists, sidestepped the natural laws He had to have set up and popped life into existance?We have seen complex organic molecules form, true we haven't seen life form yet and I can't discount the possiblity that God (or some other supernatural entity) did create that first life, but I find it much more likely it formed on it's own in accord with the natural world. And we have seen mutation and natural selection in action in the natural world.I disagree that Christianity is anti-science. Many universities were founded by Christians. Newton was Christian, wasn't he? And who said Christianity is anti science? Not me! Many Christians are scientists and very good scientists. It's the fundamental creationists I have a problem with. The people who deny the TOE and spout that nonsense about a 6 day creation 6000 years ago, I consider them anti science.If you could suggest some books to me I will try to get a hold of them. 'Plausible' is a lot different from fact, which is how you first presented it.  we were talking about evolutionary pathways for specific organs and systems, that's why I said 'plausible', not evolution as a whole but evolution is a fact, it does happen. This web site covers many of the objections you've made, if you have a chance, take a look at it and we can discuss any of the points you have a problme with:http://www.skeptictank.org/hs/factfaq.htmHave you heard of a discovery that some bacteria populations that were beleived to be mutating and changing in response to antibiotics were actually going through a regular cycle... it was something like the 'mutation' actually occured every few generations regardless of antiboitic exposure? I must admit I haven't heard of this discovery, but it seems to me that if the bacteria was just cycling through these changes, they wouldn't be gaining a permenant immunity to the vaccines we use against them and that clearly is not the case.Assuming that there really have been several species arrive, they certainly don't keep up with the numbers dissapearing, so why is this?  yes new species are arriving all the time, evolution is an ongoing process.Are they keeping up with the number of species going extinct? i don't know, I can see man destroying so many environments as a factor but I just don't know the answer to that. How would this be a problem with evolution?

i really shouldn't have to point all this out to you. information about science, and the scientific method are available all over the place.evolution (allele frequency changes in populations) has been observed. it is as observable as falling bodies, or the speed of light in a vaccume, or hydrogen and oxygen combining to form water. details about the theory of evolution (the process by which allele frequencies change in populations) are still being hammered out. There are conflicting hypothesis about how certain things happen, but every hypothesis has prediction, and is falsifiable. As tests are done, and new evidence emerges some hypothesis will be shown to be false, and some will be shown to be more likely true.evidence can be objective. speed of light in a vacuum (says nothing about what light is), falling bodies in a vacuum (says nothing about why they fall, or why they fall at the same speed), iron filings lining up around a magnet (says nothing about magnetic fields), iron filings lining up around a current (says nothing about electrons, or electromagnetism). all the above observations are objective because they exist in the real world (as we know it), and are repeatable. It doesn't matter how people explain the observations, they exist in the real world, so they are objective.

Bad mutations won't pile up because they are being selected against by the environment they express themselves in. And whether a mutation is good or bad (or neutral) is based solely on the environment it appears in. If a mutation appears that hinders an organisms survival, the organisms with that mutation will die off and won't spread that mutation to the rest of the population, so how does it pile up?The fossil record shows that, during relativley short periods of time, very large numbers of species apperared, followed by longer 'lulls'. It seems to me that this would support a creationist beleif that God was creating new species at the beginning of a new 'day'(or age). It seems to me that this would be less supportive of evolution, which requires very long periods of time to be occur. But what about the lines of fossil evidence that show organisms evolving? Look at the line of fossils showing the evolution from reptile to mammal. Or the evolution of the whale, or of the horse. This in no way supports creationism. And those relatively shorts periods of time where new organisms appear generally occur after major world wide extintion events. This falls very much in line with the TOE. I really don't know much about God creating whole sets of completely new organisms at the begining of a "new day". Would these new days correspond to the 6 days of creation?I'm NOT saying 'God did it'. I'm saying that it is more LIKELY for God to have done it!!! But you haven't said why it is more likely for God to have done it. If we see that natural causes account for all processes we have studied and understand, if we have clues that things we don't understand, like abiogenesis could have happened by natural means, even if we don't understand that process yet, why is it more likely that an undetectable, omnipotent being is responsible? Sorry, I still don't understand why you say it is more likely for God to have done it..... I disagree with this point because it basically implies that if scientific evidence pointed to creation it would not be scientific. But the scientific method can only look at the natural world, creation, as defined by fundamental creationists, was supernatural, and therefore can not be examined by science. On your last point, you kind of lost me. I showed examples of new species being observed to have come about in our life time. Man has not looked in depth for the formation of new species in many habitats on our Earth, there are still isolated jungles, deserts, the deep ocean, so we do not know all the new species that have formed. But it is cetainly in the bounds of evolution for one species to dominate an environmental niche and push other species to extinction. Man is a good example. There is no sub law of evolution that says there must be an equilibrium of the number of species.

Interesting point: Variations in currently existing traits certainly occur. There are zero occurences of the formation of a new organ. This would be necessary for evolution.

The argument is that evolution is seen every day. It is observed. We observe variations in current traits. There are no observations of actual new organs. What is the need? Good Question. We wouldn't know that unless we could predict the future. It is easy with hindsight to look back and discuss how a new organ was needed to evolve from bacteria to a fish for example. We can't know what need might create a new organ. The point is that it doesn't exist. Why do we not see that? You cannot say there is no need, that would require an amazing amount of predictive ability which no human can possess.If evolution, true evolution, with progressive new traits developing into new species and eventually a new genus were to be seen then one would expect to see the formation of such new organs.To be extreme: Why hasn't man developed a new organ to deal with polution as it seems to be killing millions annually. There is a need. Yet we continue to die. No mutation has occurred that seems to help. Not because mutations can't occur because we have adapted our environment. Perhaps a new filter organ would be helpful. It sure seems that way.

1) such a mutation would not give an individual person any survival advantage over anyone else. People with genetic defects can still lead a normal life, and reproduce at the same rate as people with out the genetic defect. and 2) evolution happens at a phenomenally slow pace. i've heard an analogy to the effect of: pretend that time can be expressed in distance. Now pretend that one step equals the amount of time it took for all dogs as we see them today to be produced form a common ancestor. the "distance" that all life has had to evolve in is from London to Jerusalem.humans only live for a little less than 100 years. the common era is 20 of our life times. recorded history goes back 100 lifetimes. the age of the earth is estimated around 45 million life times.

You argue only the extreme part of my post. I was a bit out in left field on that, intentionally. The issue that I argue is that Evolution is "observed". If your aargument holds then it is not observed but deduced because it is impossible for man to observe something over the distance you describe. Again, we are back to the fact that it is a theory based upon what has been observed, not a fact. Demon38 claimed it was a fact and observed.

evolution (allele frequency changes in populations of organisms) is a fact, because it has been observed. The theory of evolution (how various allele propagate through a species) is just that: a theory. to sound horribly wishy washy, yes it can be both ways. evolution and the theory of evolution are two different things. As far as new organs being produced over time... well organs don't really fossilize, however why can't the fossil record be used to show that organisms change over time? and as far as minor mutations, that has been clearly observed in the lab and in the field. http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releas...-dtm031902.phphttp://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/speciation.htmland of course... the infamous peppered moths...

I will certainly agree that a majority of scientists support evolution. But, what do you mean there is no valid arguement against it? Would a scientific argument against it be invalid? No.Well, Einstien didn't think a non-infinite time would be very palatable, did he? I agree that I don't have much support beyond that... but you surely would agree that it would require a long period of time for bacteria to evolve into us? If the mutation rate was too fast, a majority of organisms would have multiple mutations... a huge majority of these(at least) would be detrimental in their environment so, basically, they would all die.

An interesting thing about my Psycology textbook is that while it says evolution is a generally supported theory, one trait of a true scientist is the willingness to tolerate uncertainty. Therefore, evolution, or any other theory cannot be a given thing or fact.  Yes all facts are provisional in science, but evolution has been observed, we've seen the allele frequencies of populations change, so evolution does occur, the theory of evolution explains why this happens. And you're right, if a new theory explained this fact better than the TOE, science would embrace it. But nothing has. I posted this quote from the National Center for Science Education in a previous post, I think it applies here also."But in science, a theory is a statement of general principles that explain many facts by means of natural processes. The proposition that the planets revolve around the sun (Copernican theory) explains a great many astronomical facts and also is considered true beyond a reasonable doubt. In the same way, geological examination of rocks demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that the earth is extremely old. The theory of evolution explains a tremendous number of biological and paleontological facts, and it, too, is true beyond a reasonable doubt. Nevertheless, all these theories could be altered or replaced if new observations yielded new scientific evidence that contradicted predictions of these theories."This is the view of mainstream science, there is no valid arguement against it. Evolution also needs a lot of time, because beneficial mutations are so very rare the mutation rate has to be slow... so that the bad mutations won't pile up before natural selection 'deselects' them. If the mutation rate is too fast, everything deteriorates until they die.  Why isn't there enough time for evolution to occur? You throw this in here with no real support. Bad mutations won't pile up because they are being selected against by the environment they express themselves in. And whether a mutation is good or bad (or neutral) is based solely on the environment it appears in. If a mutation appears that hinders an organisms survival, the organisms with that mutation will die off and won't spread that mutation to the rest of the population, so how does it pile up?The fossil record shows that, during relativley short periods of time, very large numbers of species apperared, followed by longer 'lulls'. It seems to me that this would support a creationist beleif that God was creating new species at the beginning of a new 'day'(or age). It seems to me that this would be less supportive of evolution, which requires very long periods of time to be occur. But what about the lines of fossil evidence that show organisms evolving? Look at the line of fossils showing the evolution from reptile to mammal. Or the evolution of the whale, or of the horse. This in no way supports creationism. And those relatively shorts periods of time where new organisms appear generally occur after major world wide extintion events. This falls very much in line with the TOE. I really don't know much about God creating whole sets of completely new organisms at the begining of a "new day". Would these new days correspond to the 6 days of creation?I'm NOT saying 'God did it'. I'm saying that it is more LIKELY for God to have done it!!! But you haven't said why it is more likely for God to have done it. If we see that natural causes account for all processes we have studied and understand, if we have clues that things we don't understand, like abiogenesis could have happened by natural means, even if we don't understand that process yet, why is it more likely that an undetectable, omnipotent being is responsible? Sorry, I still don't understand why you say it is more likely for God to have done it..... I disagree with this point because it basically implies that if scientific evidence pointed to creation it would not be scientific. But the scientific method can only look at the natural world, creation, as defined by fundamental creationists, was supernatural, and therefore can not be examined by science. On your last point, you kind of lost me. I showed examples of new species being observed to have come about in our life time. Man has not looked in depth for the formation of new species in many habitats on our Earth, there are still isolated jungles, deserts, the deep ocean, so we do not know all the new species that have formed. But it is cetainly in the bounds of evolution for one species to dominate an environmental niche and push other species to extinction. Man is a good example. There is no sub law of evolution that says there must be an equilibrium of the number of species.

Of all the mutations occurring in man today, which are the ones that are best suited for survival?You say 'evolution has been observed'... tell me then if you will, what do you forsee by your observations?

I will certainly agree that a majority of scientists support evolution. But, what do you mean there is no valid arguement against it? Would a scientific argument against it be invalid? No.Well, Einstien didn't think a non-infinite time would be very palatable, did he? I agree that I don't have much support beyond that... but you surely would agree that it would require a long period of time for bacteria to evolve into us? If the mutation rate was too fast, a majority of organisms would have multiple mutations... a huge majority of these(at least) would be detrimental in their environment so, basically, they would all die. Beneficial mutations could not survive because they would be right in there with all the bad ones... drowned out.

Because the bad mutations are eliminated through natural selection and the "almost without exception" mutations are retained. But more than that, you are wrong. Mutations are almost without exception neutral.But the "speed" of evolutionary change isn't insufficient as far as I know. What "population explosions" are you talking about?

There are volumes of evidence that support evolution while there is none that supports your mythology.There are several mutations that offer immunity to malaria. Those have been very successful. But of course, only an idiot would think that a given mutation is universally beneficial. All of them depend on the environment. There is also a mutation that offers an immunity to the HIV virus. That is an extremely beneficial mutation when you consider that AIDS is a heterosexual disease everywhere but in the U.S. Another is the mutation that supresses the wisdom teeth. Until quite recently impacted wisdom teeth were quite serious. Even with successful surgery, it was possible to die from infection. It still is since bacteria have evolved to become resistant to most antibiotics. It is actually possible to die from a minor cut on the finger that becomes infected.But of course, your question is basically silly. It shows a lack of basic understanding as well as a lack of thought. If I have a mutation that makes me immune to malaria, I am not likely to be aware of that. If I am immune to AIDS, how would I know? Every person has between 10 and 100 mutations. If your claims are true, the population should be going down rapidly.No, a scientific argument against the theory of evolution would not be invalid.

If the effect is positive, the allele will become a permanent part of the gene pool. If the effect is very successful, it will quickly become a dominant allele. If the effect is neutral or negative, the allele will not spread rapidly through the gene pool and, usually, will disappear from the gene pool. If more than one mutation is being tested at the same time, usually the case, then it is the summed effect tested. Not all good mutations make it. Some mutations would be good at one time and bad at another, depending on the environment then. A mutation that was necessary at one time may become unnecessary at another time and be consequently negated.

This is a commonly held yet moronic belief by many creationists. Helen Fryman, wife of Barry Setterfield of the c-decay fraud fame, would regularly post a list of disorders with a genetic link on many a cre/evo forum. Her point was always the same as implied in your link. That there is a 'growing number' of genetic-related disorders, this is due to the Fall, and it is God's curse on all humanity for all time (now THERE is a being worthy of worship!), and all this is right in line with YECism.Whewnever she would do this, I would point out the obvious - as of just a few decades ago, we had almost no way of knowing that genetic disorders existed (excpet for the observation that some disorders ran in families). It is because of rapidly expanding technology that we are now able to relatively easily discover genetic links ot many diseases, most of which were previously considered to be caused by other things.In other words, it is not that the number of genetic-related disorders is growing, it is just that we are identifying more and more disorders as such. This simple, reality-based explanation was always met with an additional reference to the list and not much else...Yes, it is fun to see how "Christian" creationists distort and make caricatures of that which they clearly cannot comprehend...

It might be in order to point out that the saltational events which Gould et al pointed to, and creationists have long hailed as fatal to evolution, are in fact not all that common. In multiple taxa, there is a nice gradualistic pattern of morphologic change over time, without the need to invoke magical gaps (the most studied have been Cenozoic megafauna and Miocene teleosts). Moreover, the Cambrian "explosion," is increasingly in question. The diversity of the Vendian fauna, and our knowledge of Hox gene evolution and regulatory influence, suggests that what formerly appeared as a serious saltation, was in fact a mild adaptive radiation (ergo, a case of tachytely).Vindex Urvogel

Sure. We now know that the basal portion of the bacterial flagellum is homologous with the TTSS, the motor proteins (MotA and MotB) are homologs of membrane transport proteins (ExbB and ExbD), homologs of its ATPase, etc.As for the eukaryotic cilium, many of the component parts (tubulin, dynein, nexin, etc) are already functional elsewhere. The centriole is a homolog of the basal portion of the cilium, etc.Long story short: it is wrong -- plain, flat-out wrong -- to say that the parts of IC systems have no selectable function outside the system itself. They clearly do, and functional intermediates are seen even today.-GFA

NATURE NEWS SERVICE - on the evidence against the Cambrian ExplosionIf a recent analysis of animal evolution is correct, then the famed "Cambrian explosion" in the evolution of multicellular animals was not so much a Big Bang as simply the end of a long, slow, crawl. In the most recent issue of The Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Daniel Wang and colleagues from Pennsylvania State University in the USA have looked at the molecular evidence for the timing of animal evolution. By looking at the molecular clocks represented by differences in the DNA sequences of some 50 genes in present-day animals, they have pushed the time of origin of the major animal groups (phyla) hundreds of millions of years further back into the Precambrian. The apparent Cambrian explosion is one of the most intriguing events in evolutionary history. The Cambrian period began 543 million years ago: about 530 million years ago, most of the main groups of present-day animals appear for the first time in the fossil record. Animals as diverse as worms, arthropods, and our own chordate ancestors all appear within a few tens of millions of years. With no apparent fossil forebears in thePrecambrian, a vast amount of evolution and diversification of animal body plans seems to have been packed into a period of around 50 millionyears. Such a rapid and dramatic spurt of evolution is not easy to explain. Nothing like it has been seen since, and evolutionary biologists have often wondered whether there might be some alternative explanation. Is the fossil record in the Cambrian just a record of the appearance of animals with hard skeletal parts that fossilized well? Is it just a multitude of tips of a flotilla of hidden icebergs of evolution, stretching back hundreds of millions of years? Wang and colleagues' analysis supports the second contention. Instead of requiring arthropods (insects and crustaceans) and chordates vertebrates and allies) to have evolved from a common ancestor in a mere few tens of millions of years, they estimate that these two lines diverged as far back as 993 million years ago. This gives these two very different groups of animals an extra 400 million or so years of evolution to play with, which is in many ways a much more likely scenario. Throwing their net wider, they place the fundamental time of divergence between animals, plants and fungi at around 1500 million years ago. Nematode worms come along at around 1200 million years ago, on their estimate, again much earlier than the fossil record would suggest. The most primitive animals,the sponges and coelenterates, would therefore have evolved somewhere between 1500 and 1200 million years ago. But although molecular clocks work fine in theory, no-one knows just how reliable they are in reality. The principle is simple.

It might be in order to point out that the saltational events which Gould et al pointed to, and creationists have long hailed as fatal to evolution, are in fact not all that common. In multiple taxa, there is a nice gradualistic pattern of morphologic change over time, without the need to invoke magical gaps (the most studied have been Cenozoic megafauna and Miocene teleosts). Moreover, the Cambrian "explosion," is increasingly in question. The diversity of the Vendian fauna, and our knowledge of Hox gene evolution and regulatory influence, suggests that what formerly appeared as a serious saltation, was in fact a mild adaptive radiation (ergo, a case of tachytely).Vindex Urvogel

Ok, these examples are not as strong as they appeared... However, all the major components of each must be there at the same time for it to work. So how can that have evolved? Don't you still need all three components at the same time? What are examples of the functional intermediates? - I assume they are simpler things doing the same thing?
attacks
Sure. We now know that the basal portion of the bacterial flagellum is homologous with the TTSS, the motor proteins (MotA and MotB) are homologs of membrane transport proteins (ExbB and ExbD), homologs of its ATPase, etc.As for the eukaryotic cilium, many of the component parts (tubulin, dynein, nexin, etc) are already functional elsewhere. The centriole is a homolog of the basal portion of the cilium, etc.Long story short: it is wrong -- plain, flat-out wrong -- to say that the parts of IC systems have no selectable function outside the system itself. They clearly do, and functional intermediates are seen even today.-GFA

It is interesting that the argument for a more gradual adaptive radiation of Metazoa (animals) 540mya, predates the use of Hox gene evolution and molecular coalescence dating. The argument was initially built on the diversity of the pre-Cambrian Vendian fauna. Indeed, the major question today is not so much how rapid the alleged "explosion" was or wasn't, but rather whether or not the transition focused on the derivation of calcified exoskeletons, or indeed did represent the derivation of some modern phyla. Currently, the data suggests the former, as there is a distinct dichotomy between the Cambrian boundary and the Vendian, in which we see soft-bodied forms and then hard-bodied forms preserved in the fossil record.As for a review of the reliability of molecular clock methods as a whole, I primarily refer you to Mayr's brief but cogent analysis (2001), as well as Sibley & Ahlquist (1990).

NATURE NEWS SERVICE - on the evidence against the Cambrian ExplosionIf a recent analysis of animal evolution is correct, then the famed "Cambrian explosion" in the evolution of multicellular animals was not so much a Big Bang as simply the end of a long, slow, crawl. In the most recent issue of The Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Daniel Wang and colleagues from Pennsylvania State University in the USA have looked at the molecular evidence for the timing of animal evolution. By looking at the molecular clocks represented by differences in the DNA sequences of some 50 genes in present-day animals, they have pushed the time of origin of the major animal groups (phyla) hundreds of millions of years further back into the Precambrian. The apparent Cambrian explosion is one of the most intriguing events in evolutionary history. The Cambrian period began 543 million years ago: about 530 million years ago, most of the main groups of present-day animals appear for the first time in the fossil record. Animals as diverse as worms, arthropods, and our own chordate ancestors all appear within a few tens of millions of years. With no apparent fossil forebears in thePrecambrian, a vast amount of evolution and diversification of animal body plans seems to have been packed into a period of around 50 millionyears. Such a rapid and dramatic spurt of evolution is not easy to explain. Nothing like it has been seen since, and evolutionary biologists have often wondered whether there might be some alternative explanation. Is the fossil record in the Cambrian just a record of the appearance of animals with hard skeletal parts that fossilized well? Is it just a multitude of tips of a flotilla of hidden icebergs of evolution, stretching back hundreds of millions of years? Wang and colleagues' analysis supports the second contention. Instead of requiring arthropods (insects and crustaceans) and chordates vertebrates and allies) to have evolved from a common ancestor in a mere few tens of millions of years, they estimate that these two lines diverged as far back as 993 million years ago. This gives these two very different groups of animals an extra 400 million or so years of evolution to play with, which is in many ways a much more likely scenario. Throwing their net wider, they place the fundamental time of divergence between animals, plants and fungi at around 1500 million years ago. Nematode worms come along at around 1200 million years ago, on their estimate, again much earlier than the fossil record would suggest. The most primitive animals,the sponges and coelenterates, would therefore have evolved somewhere between 1500 and 1200 million years ago. But although molecular clocks work fine in theory, no-one knows just how reliable they are in reality. The principle is simple. Given the same gene in two different animals, an insect and a mammal for instance, one can count the differences in the nucleotide sequences to estimate how long ago the ancestors of those two animals diverged. But previous estimates of animal origin times using these sorts of methods have yielded some wildly different timescales.

Let me be as clear as I can here Robbie. Behe's argument is one about the *per se* impossibility of the evolution of IC systems; he claims that the entire system must because present to be selected, because the component parts themselves lack selectable function. To refute his argument, I most certainly do not have to detail, step-by-step, the evolution of an IC system. Behe is too clever to put that forward as an argument, because its little more than an argument from ignorance. All I have to do is what ive already done; that is, show that the component parts have a selectable function outside the system itself.That being said, and because im not here to do all your homework for you, i'll give you *a* intermediate step for the cilium. Cavalier-Smith has shown that a non-swimming appendage made of microtubules can, by increasing surface area, help the protozoan remain suspended in water, among other things. This selectable function is hardly idle speculation, because some organisms with analogous anatomical features do the same thing, and find it quite useful.-GFA

One of the best examples is Tom Schneider's simulation of protein binding co-evolution.http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/pa...tex/index.htmlFrom the paper:"The ev model can also be used to succinctly address two other creationist arguments. First, the recognizer gene and its binding sites co-evolve, so they become dependent on each other and destructive mutations in either immediately lead to elimination of the organism. This situation fits Behe's [34] definition of `irreducible complexity' exactly (``a single system composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning'', page 39), yet the molecular evolution of this `Roman arch' is straightforward and rapid, in direct contradiction to his thesis."That's the idea.The thing with aspects of organisms is that they often can serve more than one purpose. If you have two different componets that evolve separately, when placed together, they can also begin to serve a third purpose when they are together due to their interactions with eachother. In the case of "apparent" IC, the original functions of the two independent elements can become superfluous and disappear, leaving the combined system which now appears to be irreducibly complex. You can not subtract any parts to the system now without making it non function. Of course the trick is that you actually have to "add" the now missing bits to get back to the original two reducible components.This is the "roman arch" evolutionary pathway for irreducible complexity to evolve.Again.. it's really that "if any bits are missing" that it won't work. The original molecule may have actually had 10% ---MORE--- amino acids than the present molecule, not less. The 10% that is missing allowed the two halfs of the molecule to perform two other independent functions previously. This is the blunder that Behe makes. He doesn't take into account the fact that the present molecule may be smaller than previous molecules. The roman arch method of evolving IC is not about adding each block from the base of the arch, its building an arch from the ground up, then removing the center.For example.. lets say the original insulin molecule was a product of the combination of two slightly different somewhat simpler molecules which originally performed two other functions. When combined together, they act as insulin. But the original extra bits of the combined molecule (originally used for the previous two separate functions) are no longer needed. What you're left scratching your head over is how the molecule came together all at once when any part of it is taken away. But once you realize bits can be removed as well as added, it's no longer much of a mystery.Behe and the ID proponents count on the common laymen simply not being aware of any of this. Then again, why should they? It practically demolishes their entire argument. No more speaking fees from eager congergations anxious to hear how "science" has proven evolution to be impossible.Hmmm yeah.It is unreasonable to see the scope and evidence for evolution back to 2 billion years ago with very simple prokyrotes.. and not expect that the line of evolution does not continue back beyond what we see.It's really a trivial extrapolation.

Well, I don't know how much I would trust a computer simulation. It would be very easy for the experimenter to bias the program - even without meaning to. And, of course, a simulation cannot be perfectly accurate. However, the 'roman arch' analogy does a good job of giving a possible explanation for irreducible complexity. I will be looking for counter-arguements to it.So, in the case of the rotor, can we see where any two of the main components together have a function? Otherwise, all three would have to 'combine' at one time. How does the combination of whole, formerly unrelated parts occur?"This is the blunder that Behe makes. He doesn't take into account the fact that the present molecule may be smaller than previous molecules....later....Behe and the ID proponents count on the common laymen simply not being aware of any of this.

I think it's unreasonable to assume Behe and the ID group are ignoring things on purpose.Abiogenisis is fundamentally different from evolution. Evolution claims that natural selection chooses the things that work. Nothing 'works' in Abiogenisis - there is no natural selection until you have a self-reproducing cell. In the link you gave me, the 'natural selection' was removed after the thousandth generation, and the information went right down to zero before generation 1500. It's not a matter of extrapolating at all. The estimated chances of an extremely simple cell 'coming together' is 1 in 10^5700. There are estimated to be 10^80 electrons in the universe.http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs/217.asp

That is not my understanding of Behe.One of the counters to Behe is that the flagella might have been made in a step-by-step process from existing parts, either wholly used, or slightly changed. The flagellum has parts that don't come from pre-existing parts... it is not other parts simply re-arranged.Behe therefore suggests that step by step evolution could not be accounted for... because you'd be saying that some parts were brought to together - to make a non-working flagella, whilst other parts were still yet to be developed.What evolution is saying is that there's a whole lot of things being randomly created, but not completed. And eventually the are parts that will then be created new to be added on, also at random to the existing thing, and lo and behold, you've got a working flagella.This seems very unlikely. We don't all start getting a flap at the end of our nose, and then someone gets something new develope to add to that flap, and then we've got a whole new appendage!

It is so common that it is likely the way most complex evolve systems form.

An unsupported claim. The problem is that it is impossible to prove that this is so. Since we see evidence of so many "irreducibly complex" systems being derived from combinations of prior parts in just this way, it easier to believe that it is just another example of such a process, as opposed to being created by magic.Who says the prior combinations need to act as a flagella? Are you insisting that no other system that consists of "some" of the parts that are now part of the flagella could be useful? Again, it is impossible to prove this.. and since there are plenty of examples where this is deomonstrably so it is unreasonable to believe that "magical" creation is more likely.Each step in the process is "complete" in that it functions to aid the organisms survival. These prior combinations just aren't flagella.No, each combination is useful alone. But changes to those working systems can be useful in new ways.Hmmm.. more like arms covered in feathers for insulation, which also seem to aid in jumping further during escape.Features evolved for one purpose often are found useful for another unrelated purpose. Step by step evolution for the "final" purpose is rarely if ever how features evolve. What exists at any given point is modified for other uses.

This is also change in function as well.And the funny thing with things that are "correct".. it is fiendishly difficult to find good counter arguments to them.As for computer simulations, the fundamentals of genetic evolution are very simple and lend themselves quite easily to simulation. However, if you have any specific criticisms of these simulations (avida, or the co-evolution simulation), then feel free to point them out.Mistakes are constantly being introduced in coding genes which cause novel combinations of preexisting proteins. If you have two independent proteins with shapes which fold to perform two different unrelated functions, and who have a significant likelyhood of being recombined into another third useful molecule.. it will occur.If this third molecule now provides a different function, the superflous bits of the original two proteins will be pruned, leaving what appears to be an irreducibly complex single protein which is larger than the two originals, but which no part can be removed.If this occurs again, you will then have combined three different independent proteins originally evolved for other purposes into a much larger, and now irreducibly complex single protein. And again, that protein will likely have more bits "pruned".. leaving another "irreducibly complex" final protein.This happens all the time. Molecular biology is replete with descriptions of proteins which are recognizably similar to other existing but similar independent proteins.Why? Haven't you ever known anyone who purposefully ignored or pooh poohed counter evidence to their position rather than accept the fact that they were wrong?Hmmm.. molecules form bonds and react. These seem to "work" just fine.What part of life is not based on chemical reactions?All that is necessary for natural selection is imperfect duplication of an existing chemical metabolic system.Yes.. without natural selection, you don't have evolution.. you have random chance. Good thing evolution is a combination of both.As far as your calculations of probability, let me give you an example. If I asked you to roll a dice 100 times, and roll a "six" every time, what would the likelyhood of this occuring be?On the other hand, if I told you to roll the dice, but only count the rolls where you do roll a six, it would be trivial for you to roll 100 sixes (as every other roll would just be discarded).This is how evolution works. At any given point, if you have a protein with 5 amino acids, and you add another to make 6, it only "counts" if that new acid aids in the survival of the organism. Otherwise that amino acid (and the organism that has it) is discarded. This is how, step by step, you go from 4, to 5, to 6, to seven amino acids in sequence.And as I've described above, it only takes two 20 amino acid protiens, which when combined together serve a new purpose, to in one fell swoop make a new 40 amino acid protein.Now in the case of pre-cellular evolution, we're talking chemical metabolisms, not proteins. A system of independent interacting molecules which form a small replicating system.One suggestion that seems to have merit is the thioester metabolism, as it is fairly simple, and also exists as a fundamental aspect of cellular energy production.In any case, as far as abiogenesis is concerned, denial of the possibility is merely an argument from incredulity. This might make sense if it was considered without the overwhelming evidence for evolution from simple cellular life onwards. However, it's almost impossible to ignore the fact that the entire body of evidence for evolution creates a giant arrow, who's tip points squarely to abiogenesis.

Since we see evidence of so many "irreducibly complex" systems being derived from combinations of prior parts in just this way, it easier to believe that it is just another example of such a process, as opposed to being created by magic.Who says the prior combinations need to act as a flagella? Are you insisting that no other system that consists of "some" of the parts that are now part of the flagella could be useful? Again, it is impossible to prove this.. and since there are plenty of examples where this is deomonstrably so it is unreasonable to believe that "magical" creation is more likely.Each step in the process is "complete" in that it functions to aid the organisms survival. These prior combinations just aren't flagella.No, each combination is useful alone. But changes to those working systems can be useful in new ways.Hmmm.. more like arms covered in feathers for insulation, which also seem to aid in jumping further during escape.Features evolved for one purpose often are found useful for another unrelated purpose. Step by step evolution for the "final" purpose is rarely if ever how features evolve. What exists at any given point is modified for other uses.

If you mean that I provided no support, then you are correct. However I'm not sure if you're directing this at me, or Behe.I must say you are beginning to sound dogmatic, and a wee bit snide - especially with that 'magic' jibe.You can not see 'irreducibly complex' systems so emerging, otherwise they'd not be 'irreducibly complex'!" I defined irreducible complexity as a single system which is composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, and where the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning. (1996, 39)"http://www.arn.org/docs/behe/mb_self...sandjoplin.htmEnough with the 'magic' tags hey? It is a rhetorical ploy used to demean the argument of the opposition, rather than deal with the constructing a counter-argument. It is in effect name calling.This 'who says' argument is not a proof, it is another rhetorical ploy. By coming up with any number of countless hypotheticals, you will ensure the exhausting of argument as the onus of proof will always be on my side. I'd have to continually try to prove negatives.Be positive. Show me the pathway of step-by-step evolution that lead to the flagella.Show me the steps. Actually, present an argument based on an actual ideal, rather than just coming up with negatives.Show me the steps But before you do, you might like to see a response to Miller (who has already tried to do this) athttp://www.theism.net/article/39Three times you've said it. I could be cruel and quote back at you your own words "An unsupported claim" but I'm interested in dialogue.Step-by-step evolution has not been shown to lead to a flagellum! It is only supposed to have happened becausea) the flagellum existsandb) you believe in step-by-step evolution.

Well, I'm really quite ignorant as for as genetics and computers go, but... One problem I think I could point out is that there was no possiblitly for recessive mutations. Only the positive mutations were passed on in each generation. While I think this would hold true as far as dominant mutations, 'bad' recessive genes are actually the majority of mutations which have an effect. These would be passed on, and never be selected against unless two copies were combined in a particular organism. Indeed, there seems to be no way of selecting against single, recessive genes. As an aside, I think I will venture that creation theory would predict a build up of 'bad' mutations while evolution theory should predict a build up of 'good' mutations over time. "The number of harmful mutations that arise in each generation has been measured, and it is surprisingly high. 4.2 mutations per person per generation." (James F. Crow, Nature, Jan. 28, 1999, p. 232, 293-294) "About 38% are estimated to have been eliminated by natural selection... indicating that the rate specific to protein - coding sequences is nearly to the upper tolerable limit." (Adam Eyre-Walker, Peter D Keightley, High genomic deleterious mutation rates in hominids Nature, Jan. 28, 1999, p. 344-347).So the simulation completely ignores recessive mutations. How can we be evolving if the average person gets about 3 bad mutations passed on per generation?How do these mistakes work? Should I be able to find this in a biology textbook? Is there an online reference? I really have never heard this before. "Molecular biology is replete with descriptions of proteins which are recognizably similar to other existing but similar independent proteins."If a Creator made these proteins it would make sense that they shared a common basic structure and similarity. So I think that would cut both ways."Haven't you ever known anyone who purposefully ignored or pooh poohed counter evidence to their position rather than accept the fact that they were wrong?"It was contradictory because first you said it was a mistake, then you said it was purposeful. I just think it isn't good debate to attack the people involved unless you have good reason to.The duplication of these metabolic systems means you have to have DNA or RNA, right? "The proteins-to-life idea is being replaced by the RNA-to-life idea. It is called "the RNA world," and the claim is now that the first living cell, from which we supposedly evolved, was started by RNA instead of protein. Nucleotides, we are told, linked together to form chains of RNA which brought about the first life. The schoolbooks I have checked fail to mention the fact that RNA, like protein, does not form anywhere in nature except in already living cells. Neither do the nucleotides from which RNA is made. Here it is from a philosopher of science:"Though a few organic substances-for instance, certain simple amino acids-can form relatively easily under prebiotic conditions, other biochemical building blocks, such as nucleotides and lipids, require for their synthesis a 'real factory.'"2 Since nucleotides which are the building blocks of RNA and DNA do not form spontaneously, neither do RNA and DNA. In fact, RNA and DNA can't even be made in the laboratory 3 "http://www.creationism.org/heinze/Fi...01Overview.htmSo, if RNA has not been made on purpose in labs, why should it have spontaneously generated by chance?The probablity was for abiogenesis. There is no natural selection in abiogenesis. So the probability was valid unless you can show me a different probablility or a different problem with it. Evolution theory says it proceeds by natural selection. Abiogenesis does not. They are really quite different. It has been stated by others in these forums that evolution says nothing about abiogenesis. I think that they are separate theorys - although both are involved in our beginnings. How is it 'merely an argument from incredulity' to say that, if the probablity of abiogenesis of an extremely simple cell is 1 in 10^5700 or any where near that that it shouldn't be accepted as reasonable?

This is also change in function as well.And the funny thing with things that are "correct".. it is fiendishly difficult to find good counter arguments to them.As for computer simulations, the fundamentals of genetic evolution are very simple and lend themselves quite easily to simulation. However, if you have any specific criticisms of these simulations (avida, or the co-evolution simulation), then feel free to point them out.Mistakes are constantly being introduced in coding genes which cause novel combinations of preexisting proteins. If you have two independent proteins with shapes which fold to perform two different unrelated functions, and who have a significant likelyhood of being recombined into another third useful molecule.. it will occur.If this third molecule now provides a different function, the superflous bits of the original two proteins will be pruned, leaving what appears to be an irreducibly complex single protein which is larger than the two originals, but which no part can be removed.If this occurs again, you will then have combined three different independent proteins originally evolved for other purposes into a much larger, and now irreducibly complex single protein. And again, that protein will likely have more bits "pruned".. leaving another "irreducibly complex" final protein.This happens all the time. Molecular biology is replete with descriptions of proteins which are recognizably similar to other existing but similar independent proteins.Why? Haven't you ever known anyone who purposefully ignored or pooh poohed counter evidence to their position rather than accept the fact that they were wrong?Hmmm.. molecules form bonds and react. These seem to "work" just fine.What part of life is not based on chemical reactions?All that is necessary for natural selection is imperfect duplication of an existing chemical metabolic system.Yes.. without natural selection, you don't have evolution.. you have random chance. Good thing evolution is a combination of both.As far as your calculations of probability, let me give you an example. If I asked you to roll a dice 100 times, and roll a "six" every time, what would the likelyhood of this occuring be?On the other hand, if I told you to roll the dice, but only count the rolls where you do roll a six, it would be trivial for you to roll 100 sixes (as every other roll would just be discarded).This is how evolution works. At any given point, if you have a protein with 5 amino acids, and you add another to make 6, it only "counts" if that new acid aids in the survival of the organism. Otherwise that amino acid (and the organism that has it) is discarded. This is how, step by step, you go from 4, to 5, to 6, to seven amino acids in sequence.And as I've described above, it only takes two 20 amino acid protiens, which when combined together serve a new purpose, to in one fell swoop make a new 40 amino acid protein.Now in the case of pre-cellular evolution, we're talking chemical metabolisms, not proteins. A system of independent interacting molecules which form a small replicating system.One suggestion that seems to have merit is the thioester metabolism, as it is fairly simple, and also exists as a fundamental aspect of cellular energy production.In any case, as far as abiogenesis is concerned, denial of the possibility is merely an argument from incredulity. This might make sense if it was considered without the overwhelming evidence for evolution from simple cellular life onwards. However, it's almost impossible to ignore the fact that the entire body of evidence for evolution creates a giant arrow, who's tip points squarely to abiogenesis.

If you want an example of Macroevolution, just look at how much animals have changed based on the number of them that could have been on Noah's ark.

Ok, I said I would answer this... almost forgot.No one has seen Macroevolution. I think it is presumptuous to say it is the same as Microevolution - because we haven't seen it happen. The theory says its the same - but we haven't seen it. However, I'm not sure I can satisfactorily answer the question "what is the barrier?". I guess I would say that the barrier is irreducible complexity. Which I argue for in the above post.As for the new species... are we to say that some populations of birds getting different sizes of beaks, and choosing not to mate with the other bird who has a shorter beak, proves Macroevolution?"all life is in transition" Creation theory agrees with this. It says we have been degenerating since the Fall.

Do you think that much diversity could have happened by Macro-evolution in the roughly 5000 years since the Flood? It is my understanding that Macro-evolution must occur very gradually.I've been reading at www.creationism.org and I now see a difference between micro and macro evolution. Micro-evolution and macro-evolution occur through different processes. Micro-e is the change of allele frequencies through generations. In an example like the peppered moth, the white moths outnumbered the dark ones by 95%, I believe, until the environment got polluted. Then the dark ones increased in frequency. After environmental cleaning the frequencies returned to their former state. If, say, the dark ones had been wiped out, the population would have had an actual elimination of an allele. At first, it would seem like macro-e but it actually represents a loss in information and a reduction in the ability of the population to survive changing conditions.The point is that allele-frequency change cannot 'add up' to big changes. It only shuffles between existing info and may eliminate some as well. Macro-e must 'progress' by mutations of the existing information. But then there is the combination theory which Rationalist has explained. I think it is intriuguing, but I don't see how the different protiens become combined, nor do I see that there is a good likely-hood of them being useful if accidentaly combined - but there's always the billions of years which evolution must rely on in which anything is possible!*edit* A seeming change in diversity of animals since the flood could be explained by allele changes. For example, dog breeding has resulted in such different breeds as a Chiuaua(however you spell it) and a Great Dane. This has not been through mutation, but by such things as the elimination of 'big' genes in the Chiuaua and the elimination of 'small' genes in the Dane. So it would seem that there may have been only one breed of 'dog' on the Ark - something like a wolf I suppose - and that breed has diversified due to different allele frequencies being caused by different environments.

Hi RobbieI am going to assume that you are saying that a pair of wolfs on the ark would be a "kind". I am also going to assume that you are saying all the wolfs, foxes, coyotes, jackals, dingos, hyenas, dogs and the like evolved from the wolf kind. If so, would you consider that macro or micro evolution?

As far as I know, dogs and wolves can interbreed. Therefore how have they 'evolved' depends on how you define species.

Hello I guess I would define micro-evolution as allele-frequency change and macro-evolution as increase of information through random mutations. (and natural selection involved in both)I would consider it micro-evolution, since 5000 years is in no way enough time for it to have occured by mutation. The only way for it to have happened would be changes in allele-frequency. Doesn't the theory of dog 'origons' say that selective breeding has brought about all the dog breed we see from a wolf or wolf-like ancestor? This would show that large changes are possible through directed micro-e. I don't know about the foxes, hyenas, and so on, I think it would be possible for them to have micro-evolved from a common ancestor and it would also be possible for there to have been two or more 'kinds' of dog-like creatures on the ark.

Changing the size of animals through selective breeding is very little evolutionary change. A species that is not able to breed with another species is a fair amount of evolutionary change. If you are saying that all the different species I listed are descended from one pair, then we can have a discussion about evolution and how long it would take for that to happen. If you are saying that all the different species I listed were on the ark, we can have a discussion about how many different species would fit on the ark. I’m trying to find out where you stand so we can narrow the discussion and try to reach some conclusions. Would you give me an answer on where you stand on this specific question?

I don't have a particular stance as of now, so I guess I'll pick one. Let's say I believe that all the species mentioned decended from one origional pair on the ark about 5000 years ago.Chiuauas and Great Danes are unable to breed with eachother, as stated by Lurch in a different thread. A test was done to artificially inseminate a Dane with a Chiuaua and the embyos were still-born. According to the classification used in certain bird species they are clearly different species. The differences between the two breeds are not little."The size difference between dog breeds varies amazingly, from theChihuahua (six to nine inches tall, two to six lbs) to the Great Dane(30-34 inches tall, 120-160 lbs)"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/free-p...ent/message/16The Dane roughly weighs 35 times more. For height... the difference is 4 times. These are enormous differences!

Since I’m new here and you don’t know anything about me, let me start by saying that I am not in any way trying to prove you wrong. I have a strong belief in a loving God. I have had my years of struggle with my beliefs and have for a long time settled that area of my life. And I don’t think science is the end all of knowledge. However to me there are some things that I know I would be lying to myself if I tried to accept. And creationism is one of those. That being said I want to look at what you have proposed.BTW I did not know that about the Great Dane and the Chihuahua and found it amazing that there has been that much genetic change between dogs over the period of time that man has domesticated dogs. I think that has only been about 5000-6000 years.Okay you want to start with saying the fox and the dog came from the same pair on the ark. And you used the figure of 5000 years. However according to the Bible, the earth was created 6000 years ago (rounding off some) and the flood was 1650 years after the creation. That gives a time of 4350 years from the flood till today. But Jesus talks of foxes as well as dogs. That of course means that foxes and dogs existed at the time of Jesus which brings us to 2350 years for foxes to diverge from dogs. The Old Testament speaks of both foxes and dogs as early as Exodus. This leaves only a few hundred years and at the most say a 1000 years for that much divergence to take place. I have never heard of an evolutionist who would propose that much change in that short a period of time, because with that much change in that short of a time period, we would certainly be able to observe a lot more evolution than we can see in mammals in one human lifetime. Especially when scientist do selective breeding. Of course this is just one example. We could look at all the different cats as well as some other animals. But for starters, what are your thoughts on this much diversity between the wolf kind in this short of a time period.

I apologize for the confusion Robbie because I realize I didn’t make the statement very clear. I do believe in evolution. I was trying to say that I am not trying to tell you that you are wrong and I am right. Of course I believe I am right but I am just trying to discuss the logic of the two beliefs. I believe God created us, but he did it with evolution.John Woodmorappe wrote a book titled “Noah's Ark: A Feasibility Study” which you may be familiar with. It is typically used by creationist as the apologetics for the ark. In that he basically uses the family as the “kind” referred to in the Bible. This would be what you are referring to as a wolf kind. Even using the family, he has to put the larger animals in as what he calls juveniles, which is about 75% of the total space used for the animals. This raises all kinds of questions in itself but I won’t diverge at this point. However I will point out that if you break the division of animals on the ark down to species, it’s an easy task to show the impossibility of getting that many animals on the ark. This leaves either the kind being the family with rapid evolution afterwards or too many animals to fit. My brain says something has to give.

Indeed. That's why it's typically labeled "apparent" irreducible complexity.And this bit --> "where the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning" <-- is the fundamental blunder of IC.It must be stated this way --> "where the removal OR ADDITION of parts causes the system to cease functioning." Typically IC systems are created by combining two previously independent proteins, then that combined protein loses the redundant parts of the originals to form an apparent IC protein. You have to RE-ADD those missing bits to be able to split the system apart again. Only by not permitting ANY change at all to the system can you close off all avenues of gradual step by step change.No, you simply have to provide evidence that such has never, or rarely been noted to occur. You can't provide this evidence because it is quite common.The prevalence of deconstructable apparent IC systems is an achillies heel to IC in general. It clearly demonstrates that if molecule "A" appears to be IC, but in fact has a variety of precursors.. then it is unlikely that "B" which is presently unknown does not as well.If I show you how the flagella evolved stepwise, then you will abandon creationism right? After all, it seems that if we can just identify the evolutionary history of any given IC system, creationists will then give up on IC for good. Be honest now. Even if the flagella were described, you would then dig around to try and find some other supposed IC system, and cling to that until that too was understood. This has been happening ever since the eye or heart was proposed as IC. Each were not, but that never stopped the creationists.Okay..http://www.health.adelaide.edu.au/Ph...s/flagella.htmThis scenario coopts preexisting homologous secretion strutures with similar shapes, and produces a primitive pre-flagella with limited motility. This is the type of recombination of existing structures evolved for different purposes that is typically the source of IC systems. The homology of the secretion protein structure and the secretion system is seen as good evidence that this was the case in this instance.In this case I made no claims.. I made a reasoned argument. The argument demonstrates a pathway by which IC can arise even though the "removal" of any of the components of the system cause it to no longer function. The evidence for the separate claim that such is the case in the natural world is common enough. Why then do the components of the flagellum resemble the structure of the proteins in the secretion system? Could it be that one is derived from the other via the well known processes which always produce apparent IC?a) the flagellum existsb) the protein components of the flagella are similar to other proteins which evolved for other purposesc) the primitive flagellum is a result of a recombination of these existing structured) this is only one example of many that evolved apparent IC in a similar fashion

After environmental cleaning the frequencies returned to their former state. If, say, the dark ones had been wiped out, the population would have had an actual elimination of an allele. At first, it would seem like macro-e but it actually represents a loss in information and a reduction in the ability of the population to survive changing conditions.The point is that allele-frequency change cannot 'add up' to big changes. It only shuffles between existing info and may eliminate some as well. Macro-e must 'progress' by mutations of the existing information. But then there is the combination theory which Rationalist has explained. I think it is intriuguing, but I don't see how the different protiens become combined, nor do I see that there is a good likely-hood of them being useful if accidentaly combined - but there's always the billions of years which evolution must rely on in which anything is possible!*edit* A seeming change in diversity of animals since the flood could be explained by allele changes.

(some of this information is also derived from www.creationism.org)

Then you say there's a prevalence of deconstructable apparent IC systems, but don't name any. I don't think you understand IC at all, because you are reducing something to a non-working state and therefore claiming that this debunks IC... such as talking about independent proteins. The flagella is not a protein, it is a system that needs all the component parts to work. It doesn't matter an iota if a protein within that system can exist by itself.When you say "You can't provide this evidence because it is quite common" I've no idea what you are referring to. Behe says that the flagella can't be drawn together piece by piece... because it wouldn't work with parts missing. It would serve as a hindrance to the creature, not a help, the same as if you had a 12foot piece of skin hanging off the end of your nose. (Sure, one day it might in theory be part of a trunk)."...as biochemists have begun to examine apparently simple structures like cilia and flagella, they have discovered staggering complexity, with dozens or even hundreds of precisely tailored parts. It is very likely that many of the parts we have not considered here are required for any cilium to function in a cell. As the number of required parts increases, the difficulty of gradually putting the system together skyrockets, and the likelihood of indirect scenarios plummets. Darwin looks more and more forlorn."http://www.windowview.org/ARNfiles/Flagellum.htmlAs I said, you are being dogmatic. This unfair rhetorical ploy has no basis in an argument other than to confirm that you are already biased.There are a number of problems with your arguments.1) if you could show flagella was not IC, that would not disprove the IC concept, only this example2) the statement you made could be turned on you... If I show you that the flagella is indeed IC, then you will abandon evolutionary theory right? (see how it doesn't work as an argument)(there were so many spelling errors in this I doubt the person's competence, however...)Are you saying this is how it happened? No, you're saying this is how it might have happened. Your argument (the site you cite) takes the independent protein approach. But could it really have happened?"Miller asserted that the flagellum is not irreducibly complex because some proteins of the flagellum could be missing and the remainder could still transport proteins, perhaps independently. (Proteins similar -- but not identical -- to some found in the flagellum occur in the type III secretory system of some bacteria. See Hueck 1998). Again he was equivocating, switching the focus from the function of the system to act as a rotary propulsion machine to the ability of a subset of the system to transport proteins across a membrane. However, taking away the parts of the flagellum certainly destroys the ability of the system to act as a rotary propulsion machine, as I have argued. Thus, contra Miller, the flagellum is indeed irreducibly complex. What's more, the function of transporting proteins has as little directly to do with the function of rotary propulsion as a toothpick has to do with a mousetrap. So discovering the supportive function of transporting proteins tells us precisely nothing about how Darwinian processes might have put together a rotary propulsion machine."To this let me add: A system is irreducibly complex in Behe's sense if all its parts are indispensable to preserving the system's basic function. That an irreducibly complex system may have subsystems that have functions of their own (functions distinct from that of the original system) is therefore allowed in the definition. It seems that Miller is unclear about the distinction between a definition and an argument. Irreducible complexity is a well-defined notion that is appropriately and ascertainably applied to the bacterial flagellum. Miller's concern ultimately seems not over the definition but over its use as an argument to rebut Darwinism. Miller's point here generally is that if subsystems can be found with functions of their own (perforce different from that of the original system since otherwise the original system would not be irreducibly complex), then those subsystems and their functions can be grist for selection's mill and underwrite a Darwinian account of how the original system arose. Let's now turn to that possibility.""Miller's whole argument that the bacterial flagellum evolved by Darwinian means rests on the existence of the type III secretory system (TTSS). The TTSS is coded for by about ten genes, each of which is homologous to genes in the bacterial flagellum. Thus Miller sees the TTSS as embedded in the bacterial flagellum, capable of being selected for on its own, and as a possible evolutionary precursor to the flagellum. He writes: "The TTSS does not tell us how either it or the flagellum evolved. This is certainly true, although Aizawa has suggested that the TTSS may indeed be an evolutionary precursor of the flagellum (Aizawa 2001).""Accordingly, the TTSS may be thought of as a possible subsystem of the flagellum that performs a function distinct from the flagellum. Nevertheless, finding a subsystem of a functional system that performs some other function is hardly an argument for the original system evolving from that other system. One might just as well say that because the motor of a motorcycle can be used as a blender, therefore the motor evolved into the motorcycle. Perhaps, but not without intelligent design. Indeed, multipart, tightly integrated functional systems almost invariably contain multipart subsystems that serve some different function. At best the TTSS represents one possible step in the indirect Darwinian evolution of the bacterial flagellum. But that still wouldn't constitute a solution to the evolution of the bacterial flagellum. What's needed is a complete evolutionary path and not merely a possible oasis along the way. To claim otherwise is like saying we can travel by foot from Los Angeles to Tokyo because we've discovered the Hawaiian Islands. Evolutionary biology needs to do better than that."http://www.designinference.com/docum...r_Response.htmI did suggest you read before you responded.

Indeed. That's why it's typically labeled "apparent" irreducible complexity.And this bit --> "where the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning" <-- is the fundamental blunder of IC.It must be stated this way --> "where the removal OR ADDITION of parts causes the system to cease functioning." Typically IC systems are created by combining two previously independent proteins, then that combined protein loses the redundant parts of the originals to form an apparent IC protein. You have to RE-ADD those missing bits to be able to split the system apart again. Only by not permitting ANY change at all to the system can you close off all avenues of gradual step by step change.No, you simply have to provide evidence that such has never, or rarely been noted to occur. You can't provide this evidence because it is quite common.The prevalence of deconstructable apparent IC systems is an achillies heel to IC in general. It clearly demonstrates that if molecule "A" appears to be IC, but in fact has a variety of precursors.. then it is unlikely that "B" which is presently unknown does not as well.If I show you how the flagella evolved stepwise, then you will abandon creationism right? After all, it seems that if we can just identify the evolutionary history of any given IC system, creationists will then give up on IC for good. Be honest now. Even if the flagella were described, you would then dig around to try and find some other supposed IC system, and cling to that until that too was understood. This has been happening ever since the eye or heart was proposed as IC. Each were not, but that never stopped the creationists.Okay..http://www.health.adelaide.edu.au/Ph...s/flagella.htmThis scenario coopts preexisting homologous secretion strutures with similar shapes, and produces a primitive pre-flagella with limited motility. This is the type of recombination of existing structures evolved for different purposes that is typically the source of IC systems. The homology of the secretion protein structure and the secretion system is seen as good evidence that this was the case in this instance.In this case I made no claims.. I made a reasoned argument. The argument demonstrates a pathway by which IC can arise even though the "removal" of any of the components of the system cause it to no longer function. The evidence for the separate claim that such is the case in the natural world is common enough. Why then do the components of the flagellum resemble the structure of the proteins in the secretion system? Could it be that one is derived from the other via the well known processes which always produce apparent IC?a) the flagellum existsb) the protein components of the flagella are similar to other proteins which evolved for other purposesc) the primitive flagellum is a result of a recombination of these existing structured) this is only one example of many that evolved apparent IC in a similar fashion

Well... the mouse trap that behe presents is reducibly complex, as is the bacterial flagella. Do you have more examples?As far as you're separate proteins, the proteins perform a function at every point. When they are separated, they are part of the secretory system. It is only when they have a small amount of motility when combined together that they are coopted for locomotion instead. They work at every stage.Who cares. It will work with parts added. You think that evolution only adds, never subtracts? The flagella is a combination of multiple other molecules which formed part of other systems, with parts of them now deleted.Since real evolution doesn't work like this, I'm not sure what your point is.In real evolution, you go from a working nose which is gradually selected for length. Real evolution must work at every stage.So something is complex, therefore it can't evolve? It didn't work for macroscopic evolution (the eye or the heart), and it doesn't work for molecular biology either.No, I'm just asking whether you are.And yes, I am biased in the sense that based on experience, I don't believe that showing the steps in the evolution of any claimed IC system ever changes any creationists mind. Even if we can plausibly explain 99.9% of all evolved systems by showing functional precursor.. there will always be something left unexplained.But again, the problem with IC is not with this or that unexplained anatomical or molecular system.. it's with the reasoning itself. Apparent IC is formed often by the removal of pieces from a system, meaning a system can evolve step by step by "both" adding and removing parts to the system. If you ignore adding back in parts, you've made a fundamental error.No, the proof that IC is flawed is in its blatant errors in reasoning. The examples of IC that are not actually IC just highlight those errors.Well, it isn't. But you're still missing the point. Behe's IC claims are based on flawed logic. They're trivial to refute, as they were immediately by almost all competent biologists when he published his book. These refutations are the same ones I've posted. I've simply paraphrased them here.You switch from defending the logic behind IC, which is fundamentally flawed, to trying to claim that this or that system or function must be IC because we don't know how it evolved.But if the basic premises of behe's IC are broken, simply claiming that we don't know how this thing or that thing evolved can't fix them.The misspellings are in my portion. I often type fast when responding to long posts.. and spelling errors are the result.So what? Behe is claiming it couldn't evolve, not that it at some point wasn't a flagella.Huh? This statement simply doesn't make any sense. First behe says that a system that can not evolve stepwise is IC, then he says that a system that formerly performed another function when it was evolving must be IC? But that's not IC.Really? If these proteins evolved for another purpose, and they are found in the flagella, that is good evidence as to how the flagella was put together from other parts previously performing other functions.This is exactly how the evolution of apparent IC systems work, and here we have evidence of the same in Behe's flagship example. I think that is a devastating XXXX to behe's hypothesis. Not like it really needed it though.So then what does this have to do with creation/evolution. If such systems can easily evolve.. then what is the point of this definition exactly?I thought we were originally arguing about the possibility of IC systems evolving.So the flagellum can evolve step by step.. but it's still IC under behe's definition. Well okay.. I'll accept this argument. It's basically an admission of defeat.It certainly is. Why one think it wasn't?The point is that the flagella seems to be a combination of parts which evolved to serve other purposes. This is what evolution predicts, and we see evidence of the same. It makes the recombination of these parts into a primitive flagella highly plausible.Since neither motorcycles nor blenders evolve, what is the point of this analogy?If you have functional molecules in a system, and a chance recombination of those molecules will form a primitive flagella, then would you figure that a primitive flagella could evolve?Yes, this includes evolved systems.It sure shoots a big gaping hole in the claim that it couldn't possibly have happened.No, it's like saying we can travel from LA to New York because we've discovered the I-40.And what is the point of all of these faulty analogies anyway. The fact is that we've found a highly plausible way for the flagella to evolve from existing known molecular precursors. You know.. that response sounds like a person saying "ahemmm.." and "yes but". It is sort of a tacit admission that he was wrong.

This is highly dogmatic.There's no baseless charge if you accept that everyone is faulty. Even your beloved evolutionaries - the scientists that you follow - because your argument itself was flawed to being with... an argument that we have two sides here, one full of bias and irrational thinking (religious people) vs. rational sane objective people (evolutionaries).If you can't accept that even evolutionaries are flawed individuals then you've established them on some kind of super-human status, and they certainly don't deserve ubermenschen stature.Anyway, Behe's flagellum still has not been properly demonstrated to have come about in step-by-step fashion. There's one argument you put forward which involves giant leaps rather than 'steps'.And, you did load your argument saying that if I didn't accept this argument I'm showing up my willingness to accept truths, even when thrust in front of me.

A chance mutation can do this by insertion. The codons for one protein are inserted or appended to the codons of of another. This is especially likely if the genes are near eachother.Another means by which this can occur is in the folding of the proteins. Two proteins can fold such that they interact because of their shape. If the proteins interlock or attach, they can form new combined structures.

Oh! I'm afraid I'm rather famous for my (lack of) memory.

No 'we're' not. You might be. But I'm not, neither is Behe as the flagella isn't comprised solely of pre-existing parts. Your restrictions don't work. I suppose you're going to say that the lens of the eye was a pre-existing part used for some other function and was co-opted into an eye.How droll. It has everything to do with it. Mutations are happening all the time. Mutations are, according to you neither good nor bad (by inference of design - nature just throws these up at random; and some by chance happen to help). So, we should be getting masses of differences all the time. The baby example sounds absurd to you, but why should it be absurd? Shouldn't nature keep throwing up freakish things?As I said, we should be seeing hundreds of thousands of these things all over the world, humans here there and everywhere getting a third ear or a extra long nose.So, how did the new parts come about? What caused the parts to come together. What happened to the old systems when the parts that pre-existed were taken away and co-opted to make the flagella?In effect you're saying.Nature is blind. Mutations occur all the time. The flagella that exists as it is today is an example of mutation - pre-existing parts coming together to form a new thing... but that a mutation like a trunk-like growth of flesh is ridiculous - when it's a mutation and might one day be beneficial.

We're talking about an existing "functioning" system in an organism being coopted or combined to form a novel function.I don't know. Since this has nothing to do with what we're talking about, I'm puzzled as well.Since the present flagella consists of components of the secretory system (apparently), but somewhat modified. If the original combination had been optimal, it is unlikely the modifications would have evolved.Some of the parts are unique. The rest were components of the secretory system. None of the components were ever serving "no other purpose".The arguments.

Folding proteins... Show me where and how this happens. Why is it that one protein is able to fold into the right shape to attach itself to another? If this is happening all the time we'd see more mutations all the time.Good theory you've got there. Saying something can happen doesn't mean that it does!

First your claim is that it couldn't have evolved because it wouldn't have worked as a flagella until all the parts were combined.Now your claim is that, sure, maybe the parts evolved stepwise for other purposes and combined to form a primitive flagella, but there are "more" parts now.The problem is that stepwise evolution easily accounts for the original parts, the combination of those parts to form the primitive flagella, as well as all of the additional parts that have evolved since. At no point is there any stage where there is not a possible small step from one point to the next. In addition to this, the structural similarity between these molecules is good evidence that this is indeed exactly what happened.Like.. say, a transparent membrane? I suppose none of these can be found on extant organisms.It does. Saltational mutations make up the bulk of grotesque deformities in all species.However, you always will have natural selection to contend with. Arms growing out of heads, and eight fingers are rarely beneficial.We do see these things, but again, saltational mutations almost always detrimental. In computer simulations of evolution we see why. Evolution accretes complexity. The early major steps form the base of later evolved systems, and future changes evolve to work with these earlier systems. When a random change is made to one of the earlier evolved systems, it typically causes major problems for the rest.This is why human beings can't "backwards" evolve .. say .. radial symmetry, or eight arms. These sudden changes cause serious problems to the rest of the body because of all the other mutations that have evolved expecting 2 arms and bilateral symmetry.On the other hand, mutaions which lead to a lengthening of the arm, or thickening of the hair, color change, etc. are more common. This is the typical grist of evolution.So.. what does saltational mutations have to do with IC again anyway?Step by step mutation and selection... just like ordinary evolution. The only hard bit was getting from the secretory system to the primitive flagella.A chance mutation that caused the parts to combine.They were duplicated. When you have a duplication, one of the duplicates can mutate to produce a new protein, while the other still manufactures the original protein.That's right. The secretory system was always around and available to be recombined and mutated because it served a purpose all by itself.A duplication then a change in the protein coding would possibly be all that was needed. This is the change in function path to (apparent) IC.The flap of skin, on the other hand, is not beneficial to the organism by itself and would be actually selected against.

Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't see how the folding of 2 protiens together could be passed on genetically. Mutations occur because of radiation, correct? I really don't see how it is likely for this to happen. Why should two presumably efficient and self-sufficient protiens be better together?

Proteins don't just accidentally fold or fold like your laundry. It is the DNA that codes for the RNA which codes for the production of ...............................Yep Proteins.The mutations that Rationalist speaks of occur at the DNA level. This cause the RNA to be changed in such a way that it codes for a protein that now folds where it did not before. This mutation can be passed on to progeny although infrequently does that happen as many of the genetic mutations that occur tend to be lethal or sterilizing in effect, at least in mammals. In smaller organisms such as bacteria or even sea creatures this doesn't have the same effect. At least that is my understanding from the one graduate genetics course that I took.

Minor changes in a proteins shape are often tolerated. It depends on what the protein does.And the the changes in folding when you catch a cold are due to the hypermutation and selection of antibodies in your immune system.

This is what Rationalist said. This looks to me like 2 proteins bump into each other and attatch to make one protien. Isn't this just an accident? It doesn't mean there's now a new protein code in DNA that tells you to make the combined protein. This is what I'm confused about.

Mutations cause the folding in the first place. Secondly, mutations are caused by radiation, chemicals, and a whole host of other items. Cosmic radiation is present in almost all places on the planet. You have to go very very deep inside the earth to eliminate them. It doesn't take much. More makes it happen more readily but a little can cause it as well. As I said though, Chemicals can cause it as can radiation, as can simple spontaneity and the codons themselves can actually code for a mutation to occur. A DNA switch can switch on a gene that actually codes for enzymes that code for the mutations.Also mutation can occur at the RNA level. Mrna could be coded incorrectly, tRNA could malfunction, rRNA could also code incorrectly and produce an enzyme (read protein) that causes a mutation in one of the sex cells or otherwise.Genetic mutations or alterations can occur macroscopically or even what are called point mutations where there is a singualr change in one nucleic acid. In DNA replication a nucleic acid can be missed entirely shifting all of the nucleic acids one down in the chain. This has catastrophic consequences usually. However, point mutations can simply cause a slightly different protein that simply folds.

I think there is an alternate way to view the fossile record. Just because we find seeming progression of fossiles, does not mean that it was a progression. That is a conslusion we draw based on the evidence. Other conclusions would be that those species did not evolve, one from the other but were created.As for Natural selection, I hold nothing against tht at all. I do not believe that the Bible and natural selection are mutually exclusive.

Such a view has not been forthcoming that I am aware of. The fossil record is characterized by a vived ordered progression of morphologically diverging lines of organisms that are arrayed in a tree pattern from the lower strata to the most recent.There are no identifiable 'kinds' that match biblical descriptions in this record.There are very few modern forms in the record except in the topmost layers.There are no modern humans, or most other modern mammals except in the topmost layers.There are a large number of creatures in the record which defy classification as one modern form or another. They contain features of both their ancestral and modern forms (transitionals).They are distributed in patterns across landmasses which precisely match the position and connectivity of those landmasses in that epoch (biogeography). etc.We see the mechanism, and the historical artifacts that match precisely what we would expect of that mechanism working over time. I think together that does indeed mean that there was a progression.Those conclusions ignore most if not all existing evidence in favor of a hypothesis which is in contradiction with a good deal of evidence.Yes, only with a literal intepretation of it.

The evidence for creation is in the Bible - but every one of the evolutionaries here won't even accept that as 'evidence', so, I for one must talk to them using their own definitions of things and see if these hold up.We need a common ground for understanding and as Lurch and others quite clearly state that the Bible is fantasy, then there's no point me discussing the various merits of the Bible... we are forced by necessity to discuss evolutionary science alone.

Ezekiel predicted Babylon would conquer Egypt and was wrong.Ezekiel predicts that Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon will conquer Egypt utterly destroying it, slaying and scattering it's people, and that it will stay uninhabited for 40 years.In 568 BCE Nebuchadrezzar tried to conquer Egypt and Egypt survived with no apparent damage.Aahmes ruled for another generation over a prosperous Egypt and lived to see Nebuchadrezzar die. No Egyptians were scattered or dispersed.(Ezek 29:10 NRSV) therefore, I am against you, and against your channels, and I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation, from Migdol to Syene, as far as the border of Ethiopia.(Ezek 29:11 NRSV) No human foot shall pass through it, and no animal foot shall pass through it; it shall be uninhabited forty years.(Ezek 29:12 NRSV) I will make the land of Egypt a desolation among desolated countries; and her cities shall be a desolation forty years among cities that are laid waste. I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them among the countries.(Ezek 30:10 NRSV) Thus says the Lord GOD: I will put an end to the hordes of Egypt, by the hand of King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon.(Ezek 30:11 NRSV) He and his people with him, the most terrible of the nations, shall be brought in to destroy the land; and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.The Bible contains a great deal of evidence but it is not always in favor of their being a God. This segament alone has forever changed my view on the 'evidence' presented in the Bible. The evidence for creation can only be assumed to be true without needing proof if the Bible is 100% factual and is proof enough in itself. As long as a flaw exists in the Bible it cannot be considered to be proof enough in itself and therefore is not reliable evidence for creation.

[QUOTE=WarriorPoet]As a creationist, there are some points I have to concede:First point: Lurch et al have much more extensive knowledge than most (if not all) creationists on this board, whether it is admitted by the creationists or not. Second point: I have recently been reading publications from various creationist sources (specifically Hank Hanagraff's new booklet - can't remember the name right now). Most of these seem to be very shallow in nature.Third point: This is a point that lurch has brought up on numerous occasions, and it is a point that I also must concede. No one here that I have read is trying to show the evidence FOR creation. Although I really should not be here, because it is excessively time consuming I cannot resist - Your first and second point can be answered at the same time: Most "creationists" do not study evolution from a secular point of view. Therefore, they do not have the best answers and when they do come up with something interesting it is easily refuted.Your third point: If Lurch does not hold a PhD he probably should.I went to a state university to study evolution with the sole purpose of refuting it. I do not have all the answers, but I am willing to do the research if you post some responses here. I am the only student who went in a Christian believing in 6 days of creation and went out the same way.The main problem is you are trying to convert the members of one religion (forgive me lurch but if you look up the definition you will see I can use it here) to another. I believe Christians should rename what we call science and avoid the stuff completely. Why? By definition, science discovers things through hypothesis. This is why you can never scientifically prove creation. You cannot form a hypothesis about the supernatural. It is in the scientific rulebook. God is supernatural so you cannot form a hypothesis about him. You cannot form a hypothesis unless you can test it. God clearly says we are not to test him so any hypothesis about God is not valid (strike two). Finally, You can only form hypothesis about things you can disprove. Well, God exists so you cannot disprove him so once again science has blocked us from proving to them His existence. You cannot convert someone from his or her religion.You ask for proof of the Bible. Something is deemed historically correct if it can be verified by more than one source. With the gospels and Josephus Jesus would be historically correct. Kings and Chronicles are two sources, which describe what happened to the tribe of Judah. What about the flood? Well, funny that every single culture on the face of this earth has a worldwide flood story. Yes, these stories have slight variation as do Chronicles and Kings and as do Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. However, if you handed in a paper to a teacher that was word for word the same between you and four of your friends she would not think it was your own work. Their variation proves different authorship.Science began with Socrates, who denied the existence of all the Greek gods, but accepted the existence of one God because he realized that bicycles (I am using bicycles as an example do not e-mail me to say they didn't have bicycles in ancient Greece!) do not just form themselves. To get a tool to do such a precise activity it must be designed. He deemed that since all of nature had a precise job it was to accomplish it could not have just formed. However, his contemporary philosophers (which is where our modern science evolved from) could only see the ridiculousness of their polytheistic mythology and began to deny that any god existed.

I must include myself in that group since I cannot dedicate my time to researching these subjects since I have a life to lead outside this forum. What I see is various creationists who read some books, get some points, and come here to push those points (see point two).

Most of these seem to be very shallow in nature. They seem to be pointed directly at uninformed people who accept evolution blindly (yes, there are many who accept creation blindly as well). They also seem to be outdated. They seem to be attempting to discredit evolution without doing any real research. I know for a fact that there are reputable scientists who are creationists(http://www.icr.org/creationscientists.html), but they don't seem to be brought into the fray very often, if at all.Third point: This is a point that lurch has brought up on numerous occasions, and it is a point that I also must concede. No one here that I have read is trying to show the evidence FOR creation. They are trying to disprove evolution without giving evidence for the creation theory. Though I am not a scientist, I have always been taught that in order to disprove a theory, the evidence you bring against it must also prove another theory (please tell me if I am wrong in this). I am not conceding these points because I am starting to doubt my faith. Why I am conceding them is because I have no choice. The creationists on this board, including myself, seem ill-prepared to bring any real challenge to the evolution arguments posted. Though winning an argument does not mean you have convinced the person you were arguing with, it is a little disconcerting to see this happen.I needed to get this out.

This is good. I like this. You say that science does not presume anything beforehand. Yet they have to in order to form a hypothesis, a scientist must have some presumptions. Now lets review a little history. I will be brief and only give three examples. Lets start with DNA. Hmmm, in the beginning (fifty years agoish) scientist had a longstanding hypothesis. Proteins were the genetic material. Then some nice scientists came along and attached a marked to DNA and protein and clearly discovered with reproducible results that DNA was the genetic material. The scientific community refused their experiments until is could not longer be denied. Now with these prions, we have returned to the same question and science is trying to explain how proteins can alter a cell's genetics without being genetic material. Now lets take a more recent turn of events. The universe is expanding a constant rate. This has been documented and I believe it is even a scientific law. However. for the big bang to occur, it would have been impossible, so scientists are changing the law to say that in the beginning (excuse the wording) the universe expanded very quickly and then slowed shortly afterward to a constant speed that has never changed since.Finally, lets talk about evolution. What is the theory of evolution (not the vague "things change over time without God")? Well, originally it was things change slowly over a period of many billions of years. Sadly, the fossil record does not support this view. According to the record, things have a burst of diversification, then they have a dying off period, then a space and then another burst of diversification. Well, that is a bit harder to stomach than a nice slow one mutation at a time, one gene at a time theory, but eventually the evolutionists will have to explain it (if they haven't already come up with some good excuse) because they are certain that the theory of evolution is true. No, I am sorry, but scientists by nature jump to conclusions just as badly as “creationists” do.

The "evidence" is a document that is not supported by objective evidence, and in actually suggests things that observations of the real world contradict. If you start with the assumption that the bible is correct, and then interpret the objective evidence found in the real world to fit what the bible says, and then insist this shows support of the bible... this is circular logic. Science tries to describe the natural world, or describe the world with regards to what can be objectively observed. that's fine if you want to say that there are things beyond the natural world, however you can't suggest that science should acknowledge their existence because they are simply out of the scope of science.

The universe has never expanded at a constant rate. It is slowing down. The question is whether it is slowing down enough that gravity will eventually reverse the process. Last I read the evidence strongly points towards an infinite expansion. I think you are talking about the speed of light being constant except for a microsecond right at the beginning of the big bang when there was what is called hyper-expansion. That’s pretty funny. You’ve fallen into the creationist propaganda. Nothing in evolution happens in burst. It all happens nice and slow. There are just periods of time when changes happen faster than other periods of time. Mainly because the environment changed drastically.

This is good. I like this. You say that science does not presume anything beforehand. Yet they have to in order to form a hypothesis, a scientist must have some presumptions. Now lets review a little history. I will be brief and only give three examples. Lets start with DNA. Hmmm, in the beginning (fifty years agoish) scientist had a longstanding hypothesis. Proteins were the genetic material. Then some nice scientists came along and attached a marked to DNA and protein and clearly discovered with reproducible results that DNA was the genetic material. The scientific community refused their experiments until is could not longer be denied. Now with these prions, we have returned to the same question and science is trying to explain how proteins can alter a cell's genetics without being genetic material. Now lets take a more recent turn of events. The universe is expanding a constant rate. This has been documented and I believe it is even a scientific law. However. for the big bang to occur, it would have been impossible, so scientists are changing the law to say that in the beginning (excuse the wording) the universe expanded very quickly and then slowed shortly afterward to a constant speed that has never changed since.Finally, lets talk about evolution. What is the theory of evolution (not the vague "things change over time without God")? Well, originally it was things change slowly over a period of many billions of years. Sadly, the fossil record does not support this view. According to the record, things have a burst of diversification, then they have a dying off period, then a space and then another burst of diversification. Well, that is a bit harder to stomach than a nice slow one mutation at a time, one gene at a time theory, but eventually the evolutionists will have to explain it (if they haven't already come up with some good excuse) because they are certain that the theory of evolution is true. No, I am sorry, but scientists by nature jump to conclusions just as badly as “creationists” do.

1. No the present rate at which the universe is expanding is basically the same. Look up the Inflationary Theory which is the theory that I am referring to about how the universe spent the first fraction of a second expanding very quickly and then suddenly slowed. Whether or not the universe will continue to expand or will stop has not been determined yet. Once again, in this field their are many Theories that need to be formed to try and explain why the universe did this, and the scientists who support the big bang are trying to form them to explain how their idea is true. Not by looking at it without bias.2. Sorry, as I stated earlier, I do not read much on creationist theories (unless I am looking to see how unscientific they are) only evolutionist ones actually written by evolutionists. Get a good book on the fossil record and you will see that this is a correct adjustment to the theory. (as I believe you are admitting). We find animals in the fossil record in groups of diversity. Then there is a period where we find little to no fossils. In high school, we learn about nice round circular orbits in which electrons float around the nucleus of an atom. In college, we learn this is not the truth, electrons are most likely in an orbital which are anything but perfect circles and only the predictable spots where we can expect the electrons at a given point in time. A pair of evolutionary scientists wrote the book I read, although I believe it was called "The Myth of Evolution" it had a deceiving title in that aspect. I got it at the public library which was a surprise to me because usually I have only found non-scholarly works there. Someone else in this post had pointed out that a person who is a scientist and believes in God goes about his experiments in such a way as to prove that he is right and this invalidates his work. The point I was making was not to disprove evolution based on these facts, but to say that an evolutionist forms his theories on the preconcieved notions that evolution is correct in the same way someone who believes in God bases his theories on the preconceived notions that he is correct. 3. I agree that science is subject to peer review. Its precision in some of its discoveries is part of why I love it. But science is not a constant. You are wrong to assume that a creationist can just say,"God did it" and that is an answer. It is true that people who believe in creation should have a blind faith, but a scientist examines the world and realizes that something must have created it. Based on his obsevations, he determines that through a series of chemical reactions the world was created. A creationist can look at the world and determine that although chemical reactions are carried out quite naturally, that there is something more than that driving nature and determines it to be God. A buddhist monk can be just a scientific and determine the same thing can be karma.The biggest problem is that evolution belongs on the philosophical end of the scientific spectrum. It is impossible to prove without a doubt who is right until, of course God returns, but the scientist and the buddhist both say that will not happen.

The universe has never expanded at a constant rate. It is slowing down. The question is whether it is slowing down enough that gravity will eventually reverse the process. Last I read the evidence strongly points towards an infinite expansion. I think you are talking about the speed of light being constant except for a microsecond right at the beginning of the big bang when there was what is called hyper-expansion. That’s pretty funny. You’ve fallen into the creationist propaganda. Nothing in evolution happens in burst. It all happens nice and slow. There are just periods of time when changes happen faster than other periods of time. Mainly because the environment changed drastically. But that discovery didn’t challenge the theory of evolution, it just showed how evolution worked.Scientist may sometimes jump to conclusions because they are humans like everyone else. But everything they do is subject to public review by other scientist. Any kind of error is soon discovered. Whereas creationist can just say God did it and there’s your answer.

I will address your Noah's ark issue and a few others. The ark was about as big as a football stadium and contained three separate floors. Yes, they were on the ark for a little over a year. Even more shocking contrary to popular belief, they did not just take two of every kind. Some kinds they had to take seven pairs (fourteen animals) onto the ark. Therefore, as big as it was it does lead us to wonder how could they have done it and had enough food?A football stadium is relatively large, but with all those animals, it would have been crowded. However, some or the animals that were taken in seven pairs would have been food animals for the other animals. In addition, most large animals do not reproduce as quickly as smaller animals and so this would have helped as well. In addition, when God instructed Noah about "kinds" and "animals" it is probable that these terms were not all inclusive (in other words they did not mean every living species at the time of the flood). Before the flood, a mist covered the surface of the earth. I am sure it was thicker than what we find today in rainforests. All the animals God created to live in this environment would not have been able to survive after the flood so I am sure God did not have Noah waste space on the ark with them. In the recent past, we have discovered how to make many hybrids of animals and plants. Since humans are involved this in not evolution. Although Mendel was named the father of modern genetics, I believe that humans who were allowed to live for 700 - 900 years would have been able to come to some of their own discoveries. I also believe that after Noah exited the ark he and his sons were able to help speed the process of diversification. Once again since it was human controlled, it is not evolution.

No one wants to address the Noah's ark crowding problem I brought up?

Priscilla2,you make many fundamental mistakes concerning evolution in particular and science in general.But you fail to mention that the presumption needed to form the hypothesis is based on observation. And then that hypothesis is tested and reviewed by the scientists peers. It will ultimately stand or fall on it's ability to explain the evidence, not on what any one scientist wants. The scientific method is remorseless, presumptions that are not supported by the evidence are discarded, even presumptions that are well loved and accepted. Take creationism for example, up until about 200 years ago it was scientifically accepted that the earth was young and all life was discretely created. This was the mainstream scientific presumption, backed up by the Bible. But then Christian geologists started looking at the Earth, at quarries and excavation sites, at mountains and they realized that the layers in the geologic column couldn't have possibly been formed in a few thousand years, that the Earth had to be millions of years old at least. Notice the presuposition was a young earth, but the extrodinary evidence forced them to change their theory. The same goes for evolution. Darwin was a christian, his presupposition was not evolution, just the opposite. But the evidence forced him to change his view. In all the time between Darwin and now, all the evidence has confirmed his original hypothesis, all life evolved from a common ancestor. Discoveries of DNA and the fossil record only confirm this. Your comments on evolution happening in bursts is not correct, as Hank said, evolution can happen at different rates depending on many things, like how rapidly the environment changes for example. This is not a problem for the theory of evolution.Science doesn't deal in "Laws", laws are a function of math. The highest you can go in science is a theory.But how does the creationist determine this? Surely not by observing the evidence, because there is no evidence for or against God. And because there is no evidence either way, science says nothing about God, doesn't deny or support Him.Why does it belong on the philosophical end of the spectrum? We have overwhelming evidence of it occurring in the past, we see it occurring today, we understand some of the mechanisms that drive it, we understand them so well that we use it in industry, we use it in medicine.Your contention that if it is caused by humans then it is not evolution is wrong.I'll deal with the myth of Noah in another post........

Before responding specifically to these statements, I would like to address the consensus among the pro-evolutionists in this forum. They constantly relate repeatedly that the Bible is a book of complete fiction. It irks me to see people who are claiming to be educated not accept the Bible as a historical document. Aside from doing various other tests for authenticity and dating of artifacts (and translation which some also consider falling under the same category), science is not history and scientists are not historians. Historians recognize any written material from the past as important to decoding history. If you throw out the Bible as a historical document and consider it a fiction, then you must also throw out hieroglyphics, which historians recognize as history even though they have been proven to contain gross historical errors in favor of Egypt. In fact, since most of recorded history before the Common Era was lost, and historians rely on second hand sources such as Herodotus and Josephus to fill in the dark eras, you would also have to discount them. In effect, you might as well say that history never existed because it could not be effectively tested, which is about as unscientific a statement as can be. I am not asking for those involved here to accept the Bible as the divinely inspired Word of God and that every detail is accurate (regardless of what I believe). What I am saying is that you do not need to discredit every letter of it as being an inaccurate mythology story. This claim only shows you ignorance of how history is compiled.Now lets address Ezekiel. Obviously, this information was discovered from and anti-Christian atheist source, which looked only at what Christian commentators were saying about the subject and had a poor source for, recorded history. Because you were consulting such a reference to begin with, I can only conclude that the statement you make where you imply objectivity beforehand is false.First, instead of consulting commentaries, which interpret what Ezekiel meant, lets talk about prophecy and it genre. Prophecy was a style of writing as well as one that claims to foretell future events. Just as your average Joe cannot pick up a scientific journal and understand the relevance of an article about the differentiation of sea urchins (not a magazine about scientific issues with photos) he also cannot hope to comprehend a form of writing that was popular thousands of years ago without first examining all the examples of it. Another example, someone who has never read a poem in his entire life cannot hope to pick up the works of Tennyson (or worse yet Pope) and be able to decipher them. With that in mind, understand that most prophecies are not meant to be read like a book, they actually are more like poetry. In your quotes, you assume that since the verse are close together in the book of Ezekiel that they refer to the same situations and events. If you examine other works (even non-Jewish ones), you will discover that prophesy writings are more like a puzzle that has been shaken apart and put back together in a more poetic form.Now let us talk about history. Our only sources of history covering this point are from Herodotus and Josephus –who consulted manuscripts no longer available to us and wrote much after the fact- and the Bible, cuneiform tablets, and hieroglyphics. These are the only sources covering this area for this period.Piecing together history from these sources, we begin with Apries who was pharaoh during Nebuchadnezzar’s (further referred to herein as Neb.) siege on Tyre. After this time Apries lost popularity and Amasis usurped him and caused a civil war. When Apries was captured, he was handed over to the crowds to be dealt with as they pleased. Much of the Egyptian history about the siege of Jerusalem (which Apries was pharaoh during) is missing. It is possible that during this time Neb. Marched against Egypt and subjugated them. In addition, there is one badly preserved record of Neb. Taking military action against Egypt during the reign of Amasis but because it is the only source and in very poor condition it is regarded historically as not having happened. Before the time of Neb., Egypt was a super power whose borders at one time extended through Israel. They even sent their troops to the aid of other countries. After the time of Neb., they preformed only campaigns solidifying their borders with Ethiopia no major campaigns to take other land for their own are recorded. After Amasis, Egypt was conquered by the Persians –from whom they eventually broke free. Then we read of Artaxexes who did decimate Egypt and destroy its temples. From that point in history onwards, Egypt never again had a native pharaoh. Being a subordinate of another country seems to me like they were made low to me. Under the Turks rule, they actually were suffers of plagues and famine. I do not see Egypt as a top world power today either.

Ezekiel predicted Babylon would conquer Egypt and was wrong.Ezekiel predicts that Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon will conquer Egypt utterly destroying it, slaying and scattering it's people, and that it will stay uninhabited for 40 years.In 568 BCE Nebuchadrezzar tried to conquer Egypt and Egypt survived with no apparent damage.Aahmes ruled for another generation over a prosperous Egypt and lived to see Nebuchadrezzar die. No Egyptians were scattered or dispersed.(Ezek 29:10 NRSV) therefore, I am against you, and against your channels, and I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation, from Migdol to Syene, as far as the border of Ethiopia.(Ezek 29:11 NRSV) No human foot shall pass through it, and no animal foot shall pass through it; it shall be uninhabited forty years.(Ezek 29:12 NRSV) I will make the land of Egypt a desolation among desolated countries; and her cities shall be a desolation forty years among cities that are laid waste. I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them among the countries.(Ezek 30:10 NRSV) Thus says the Lord GOD: I will put an end to the hordes of Egypt, by the hand of King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon.(Ezek 30:11 NRSV) He and his people with him, the most terrible of the nations, shall be brought in to destroy the land; and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.The Bible contains a great deal of evidence but it is not always in favor of their being a God. This segament alone has forever changed my view on the 'evidence' presented in the Bible. The evidence for creation can only be assumed to be true without needing proof if the Bible is 100% factual and is proof enough in itself. As long as a flaw exists in the Bible it cannot be considered to be proof enough in itself and therefore is not reliable evidence for creation.

If I predict you'll die if you drink poison, and you survive - because you didn't drink it, am I wrong?Jonah went to a city, Ninevah, claiming it would be destroyed. It wasn't, because they mended their ways. Was Jonah wrong?Please show me the verses that suggest there is no God.It's interesting that one passage of the Bible has affected you so.What has Ezekiel got to do with Genesis?

Not according to evoultionist Stephen J Gould. The thing about evoultion is you've assumed that there's one theory. There are many competing theories.If you want even faster evolution, try looking at Goldschmidt and his hopeful monsters.What about creation scientists? Where do they stand in this scheme you've invented?

SETI is a scientific program set up to look for evidence of extra-terrestrial life. Have they observed aliens already? They've just made an assumption without observation. Sorry.Christians looked at the earth? Who are you kidding Darwin's great geology friend hated Christianity. He made the assumption that the Earth must be far older than the Bible, and then scientists have been out collecting only the evidence that matches this belief.Hank saidIn other words evolution happens both fast and slow. Which suggests 'bursts' can happen.Maths is a science.There is evidence for creation. There is evidence for God. I wrote extensively before about miracles. You must have missed that.It is a belief system that helps godless people sleep better at night.Evolution caused by humans? Here I was believing that it was a natural thing, caused by blind chance, no creative/intelligent force in it. Obviously there must be two kinds of evolution then. Natural and un-natural. How do you tell them apart?

Your comments on evolution happening in bursts is not correct4. Darwin was a christian,QUOTE]1. & 2. I am not here to teach you a basic science lesson about the hypothesis. But if it will make you feel better I can write a whole post explaining the formation of a hypothesis, obtaining funding, experimentation, publication and repetition of the experiment by peers. I merely listed the criteria required for forming a hypothesis. In addition, showing that not allowing the usage of crediting God with originally designing the system being investigated it has removed God from it. (Science test question: Why can’t God be included in a hypothesis?) Since science relies completely on the cognitive ability of men to try to figure all of the universe's questions, it denies the need for God. Science could not say flat out that there is no God simply because most scientists are Christian in one sense of the word. 3. & 4. I have not made a point yet about denying evolution. My point so far has only been that science changes its views over time and when someone disproves a former theory beyond the shadow of a doubt, science will continue to cling to its original line of thought for often many years before changing. Darwin was never a Christian. After doing poorly in school because he couldn’t keep his mind on his studies, his father forced him to attend a seminary because he felt since he didn’t have any talent the only thing he could ever be was a clergyman. He left the seminary when the chance to go on the HMS Beagle arose. Since someone else had actually developed the theory before him and he rushed its publication because he wanted the credit for it, I do not see how it strained his conscious too much. While the scientists of his day did accept it, Christian England is the one that gave him the problems. He was not a martyr.Since Darwin wrote Origin, the theory of evolution has had to change because new developments have come up. I could not find the book at the library again which means that its title was not “The Myth of Evolution” and I will probably never find it again since it was checked out on a whim. However, I have before me “The Field Guide to Prehistoric Life” which give a very picturesque description of the fossil record. Using it as a reference, you can see that most diversification of species occurs over mere 30 – 60 million-year intervals and then there is usually about 100 million years before the next diversification burst occurs. This to me shows bursts not gradual diversification. I am sorry, but you cannot just say, “Evolution doesn’t happen that way because I say so.”

[QUOTE=Demon38]Priscilla2,5. Science doesn't deal in "Laws", 6. accepted that the earth was young 7. Why does it belong on the philosophical end of the spectrum?[QUOTE]5. Mathematics is a science. What teachers have you had that you have never heard of the law of gravity, the three laws of thermodynamics, and the law of inertia? I can give you a longer list if you would like. A law in science is an irrefutable fact and thereby the highest you can get. However, I agree that very few observations make it to this level. When something obtains the status of “theory”, it is also a high honor, but even theories can be eventually overturned in the ever-changing spectrum of science.6. I believe the real reason that scientists abandoned the young earth theory was because they did not realize the effects of placing more than 600 atm of pressure on the earth’s surface for several months would do to it. The reason many scientists maintain a belief in God is simply because when one learns of all the wonders that occur in biology: our bodies produce enough acids and enzymes to digest ourselves and yet we remain unharmed. O2 is one of the most corrosive gases on the earth and yet our bodies use it without destroying themselves, pure water is the only safe thing for a pregnant woman and yet our species still manages to reproduce viable offspring. Because scientists recognize the completeness of the design the often recognize God. However, in a true scientist's work, God would never be allowed for a second. 7. I do not deny that mutations occur, or that there is much observable evidence for evolution today. The part that needs to be placed on the philosophical end of the spectrum is in origins of the earth and universe. In other words, whether God created the earth in 6 – 24 hour days or whether is took billions of years. This is not something that can be observed. The experiments they are currently doing to support how life was originally formed are flawed in that they make educated guess based on what we know is needed to create life and then perform experiments to see if we can form life’s building blocks. If the experiment is successful then it is deemed that we have the correct components. That is not a justifier of pre-life conditions. It is impossible to discern what the conditions of a pre-life earth were.

Scientifically, humans cannot aid evolution. Humans can exterminate and entire mangrove island to set up an experiment, but they cannot aid in the migration. Human intervention in mutation is genetics not evolution. All the sciences do interact with each other to some extent (especially mathematics and chemistry), and there is often argument as to who should be doing which experiment. Evolution is definitely defined as being spontaneous not cause by human intervention.10. You do not have to try to refute my Noah’s ark post. Hank wanted an explanation and I gave him the reasons I believed it would be possible. The only facts I have stated so far about the flood were the size of the ark, the length of the flood and the pressure on the surface of the earth. Now, if you want to write a grant and get me several million dollars so I can build an ark, gather animals and food, and then live on it for a year with my family (There will probably only be seven of us so you are welcome to come too). Then I would have the evidence need to back up my claim. That brings up another way in which science is often biased: funding.

Priscilla2,you make many fundamental mistakes concerning evolution in particular and science in general.But you fail to mention that the presumption needed to form the hypothesis is based on observation. And then that hypothesis is tested and reviewed by the scientists peers. It will ultimately stand or fall on it's ability to explain the evidence, not on what any one scientist wants. The scientific method is remorseless, presumptions that are not supported by the evidence are discarded, even presumptions that are well loved and accepted. Take creationism for example, up until about 200 years ago it was scientifically accepted that the earth was young and all life was discretely created. This was the mainstream scientific presumption, backed up by the Bible. But then Christian geologists started looking at the Earth, at quarries and excavation sites, at mountains and they realized that the layers in the geologic column couldn't have possibly been formed in a few thousand years, that the Earth had to be millions of years old at least. Notice the presuposition was a young earth, but the extrodinary evidence forced them to change their theory. The same goes for evolution. Darwin was a christian, his presupposition was not evolution, just the opposite. But the evidence forced him to change his view. In all the time between Darwin and now, all the evidence has confirmed his original hypothesis, all life evolved from a common ancestor. Discoveries of DNA and the fossil record only confirm this. Your comments on evolution happening in bursts is not correct, as Hank said, evolution can happen at different rates depending on many things, like how rapidly the environment changes for example. This is not a problem for the theory of evolution.Science doesn't deal in "Laws", laws are a function of math. The highest you can go in science is a theory.But how does the creationist determine this? Surely not by observing the evidence, because there is no evidence for or against God. And because there is no evidence either way, science says nothing about God, doesn't deny or support Him.Why does it belong on the philosophical end of the spectrum?

SETI is a scientific program set up to look for evidence of extra-terrestrial life. Have they observed aliens already? They've just made an assumption without observation. Sorry.Christians looked at the earth? Who are you kidding Darwin's great geology friend hated Christianity. He made the assumption that the Earth must be far older than the Bible, and then scientists have been out collecting only the evidence that matches this belief.Hank saidIn other words evolution happens both fast and slow. Which suggests 'bursts' can happen.Maths is a science.There is evidence for creation. There is evidence for God. I wrote extensively before about miracles. You must have missed that.It is a belief system that helps godless people sleep better at night.Evolution caused by humans? Here I was believing that it was a natural thing, caused by blind chance, no creative/intelligent force in it. Obviously there must be two kinds of evolution then. Natural and un-natural. How do you tell them apart?

Now I see there have been several post and I don’t think I have the time to answer every one that replied to my post. In addition it seems there has been a shotgun effect of posting lots of different items to discuss which makes it even more difficult to respond to. If anyone is interested, I would like to focus the debate on the flood. So here are some of my questions.It has been stated that the ark was the size of a football field. I think the floor area is about the size of two football fields. That being said, what do you think is the possibility of successfully cramming any large or even medium size zoo into two football fields for a year?How long and how did the South American sloth get to South America?How and why did almost all the marsupials go to Australia?How about using this to start the debate?

Hank, why not talk about the fluidity or plasticity of evolutionary terms.The term 'ancestor type' is used quite a bit. It brings to mind something that is actually the forefather of something, but it needn't be, it could be used instead of 'archaic'... something that's just old, but not directly the progenitor of anything.Same with species. There's so many different definitions.Yet all these terms go into evolutionary parlance

I disagree with limiting this post strictly to Noah’s ark, but I would like it to return to what I deemed to be its original objective: instead of using science to debate against evolution to use it to defend creation.Here are the observations that have led me to my conclusions about Noah’s ark:1. Modern research facilities: Instead of our floating zoo image we need to take in a more practical view of the ark. In modern research facilities, there are no spacious 15-foot high cages. The cages on the ark were probably just big enough for the animals to lie down, stand up, and eat in and were probably built in layers. (By the way, there were three layers to the ark.)2. The ark design: Instead of cages only along the outer wall, I imagine there were many inner walls designed in such a way as to utilize wall space for more cages.3. Speciation: Domesticated animals I count from one line. For example, wolves and foxes can be counted as two different species, but dogs do not get a count. This is the same for cats. Cattle, oxen, and the like would be counted as having one ancestor on the ark. Sheep would have one, goats would have one, etc. You must also remember that sometime we call the same animal by different names, i.e. doves and pigeons. We have records from 2000 B.C. that they were breeding something like 200 different types of sheep in Mesopotamia so we know that our ancestors had some knowledge of the practice.4. Dinosaurs: we can take two pieces of evidence for my belief they were not on the ark for whatever reason. First, it is possible they became extinct beforehand. In fact, the mass extinctions could easily be explained as caused by humans. A recent example of this is DDT. Second, since we find entire herds of thousands of dinosaurs fossilized together in flood beds, we can assume one of two things. Either dinosaurs had no sense animals today have to take cover when they know bad weather is approaching, or there was no place for them to take cover when the flood that buried them came.5. Finally, as to food storage, you should read the book Kon Tiki.6. I have not thought about the fact of different species specifically those in Australia. (The South American ones could have come across the land bridge, which in my opinion remained until sometime after Babel.) At the moment, I can think of two conclusions: they either came with the people, or there were other land bridges that were destroyed by natural disasters after Babel.As long as you back up your proof with something better than, “I said so” I will welcome debate to it.

I am not surprised about the finch debate. Evolutionists have a way of assuming that different environments mean different species. If my cat gives birth to two striped kittens, one black kitten and one white kitten do I assume they are different species? If I place all four of them out in the snow and all but the white one is carried off by a hawk, do I assume the white one had evolved to best suit its environment? I agree it was the best adapted for the environment, but that doesn't mean that its progeny will all be white and if eventually that are no longer any color but white then it has become another species.

Yes, and another silly notion they put forward is 'survival of the fittest'.When two male reindeer are butting heads, they can lock antlers. It happens that they can't separate and therefore they die. Thus the weakling cowardly male reindeer watching from the side-line gets to mate.Also, if the strongest male passes his genes on, why is this beneficial? One of the weaker males might have the DNA capability to fight a disease.Survival of the strongest was a nineteenth century execuse to justify white colonalism.

Priscilla2,No mathematics is not a science, it is a tool of science. you are still very confused by what laws and scientific theories are. There is no law of gravitation, the nature of gravity is still highly theoretical. It is a theory that is even less understood than the theory of evoution. laws are used to describe specific observations that seem to hold true constantly. Theories are explainations of large chunks of related observations. As such, a theory is the highest explaination you can attain in science. The laws you mention describe small, discrete actions and make no attempt to explain these actions. So no, theories do NOT graduate into laws at some point. That is why it is still the theory of gravity, the atomic theory, the heliocntric theory, the germ theory and the theory of evolution.

I wasn’t trying to limit this post to Noah’s ark, I was trying to focus on a few things that I could discuss instead of having 50 items back and forth that create long post and lots of time researching and writing.True but you are talking about small animals. So can you take the equivalent of a large zoo, plus a whole lot of other animals as zoo’s don’t have nearly all the animals in the world, and keep them alive for a year. If any of the unclean animals died, that would eliminate the kind.I’m not quite clear on what you are saying here. Are you saying that all wolves and foxes and dogs were the same kind? All cattle and oxen are the same kind? All sheep and goats are the same kind?For the first, that would mean that God created the dinosaurs and in 1500 years they were all dead. And all these huge animals were killed by humans? Even the ones in the America’s.For case two that is false right out if you believe the Bible because it plainly says that God told Noah to put at least one pair of all living animals on the ark.I probable won’t find the time to read something else. Anything specific you want to discuss?So your theory is that the marsupials traveled from Australia to where Noah’s ark was before the flood, then they all traveled back or were carried by humans. Then during recorded history some kind of natural disaster of epic proportions created a 600 mile gap between Australia and any other main land and there is no record of that natural disaster.And the second theory is that someone took all the animals that are specific to South America only, and carried them across a land bridge and down into South America.And for both these theories, the animals were not domesticated, but just out of some strange impulse humans decided to carry these animals along with them, feed them, keep them from eating them or each other, and never allow any offspring to leave this convoy along the way.I’m really not trying to be sarcastic but these are questions I would have to ask myself if I was being honest. This theory would be too much of a stretch for me.So far I have only been talking about common sense ideas. I will provide evidence for anything that is required.

From talk orgins"Survival of the fittest" is a poor way to think about evolution. Darwin himself never used the phrase. What Darwin said is that heritable variations lead to differential reproductive success. It is a prediction which can be, and has been, experimentally verified.

Species are expected to often have imprecise boundaries because evolution is ongoing. Some species are in the process of forming while others are recently formed and still difficult to interpret. Creation, defining things as kinds that were created once and for all, implies that all species should be clearly defined, and that there should be a clear and universal definition of "kind"/species. Since there is not, creationism, not evolutionary theory, has something to explain. Different definitions of species serve different purposes. Species concepts are used both as taxonomic units, for identification and classification, and as theoretical concepts, for modeling and explaining. There is a great deal of overlap between the two purposes, but a definition that serves one is not necessarily the best for the other. Furthermore, there are practical considerations that call for different species criteria as well. Species definitions applied to fossils, for example, cannot be based on genetics or behavior because those traits don't fossilize. I assume you are talking about Archaeopteryx. It is a transitional type and I don’t know what you are talking about when you say it is not transitional in the normal sense of the word or that they have discovered that no dirds descended from it. Can you be more specific?There are competing theories but they are more or less accepted in the scientific community based on how well they are supported by evidence. As we discover more and more humanoid fossils which tell us more and more about how we evolved, scientist are able to narrow down to the model that best fits the evidence.If you believe the Bible is the in-errant word of God, and I’m not sure you do but it’s still an example, then you would think that Christians would agree on every detail. Yet there are thousands of different denominations with various beliefs. Some of the differences are quite large. Why would you expect any less from scientist since they are working with newly discovered evidence all the time?Maybe this is a good time for you to tell me what you believe about creation and the Bible in general so I will have a better handle on how to discuss things with you.BTW I get a lot of my material from talk orgins as I said before.

I'm not so sure that this is true. There are pretty distinct different kinds of life. There's birds, dogs, cats, humans, apes, etc among land creatures. There's fish, whales, octopii(gotta love that word), mollusks amoung sea creatures. I can easily identify a cat vs. a dog, even when cats vary between tigers and houses cats, and dogs between great danes and chiuahuas. Now, you'll say that they have come from an origional ancestor, yet in my admittedly limited knowledge of prehistoric creatures I don't remember seeing something where I said "is that a dog or a cat??".

It is used by science. It is also a science.There's a whole field called mathematical science.If you keep publishing howlers like that you'll lose the little credibility you have left.

Priscilla2,No mathematics is not a science, it is a tool of science. you are still very confused by what laws and scientific theories are. There is no law of gravitation, the nature of gravity is still highly theoretical. It is a theory that is even less understood than the theory of evoution. laws are used to describe specific observations that seem to hold true constantly. Theories are explainations of large chunks of related observations. As such, a theory is the highest explaination you can attain in science. The laws you mention describe small, discrete actions and make no attempt to explain these actions. So no, theories do NOT graduate into laws at some point. That is why it is still the theory of gravity, the atomic theory, the heliocntric theory, the germ theory and the theory of evolution.

It's simple. Darwin's Finch is an example of speciation as put forward by evolutionists. Species can't interbreed (according to the standard definition). Darwin's Finch has been shown to interbreed. Therefore Darwin's Finch is not an example of speciation.How can you claim that Darwin's Finch is an example of speciation then deny that you can define species. It's trying to have the best of both worlds. Species for the sake of macro animals is defined by either actual breeding groups or potential breeding groups.In both cases the finches break the mould as they are both potentially capable and actually do interbreed.You're suggesting that evolution is ongoing is fine, but then when pushed, it was evolutionists who a) drew the line for species, b) declared that the said Finch was an example of speciation.It seems very much that you too are like the others in that you're valiantly arguing that such and such happened, but then hedge your bets and say, but it's all really blurred and we're never really sure.You either need to argue one thing or the other. This is what's so frustrating for me in arguing with evolutionaries. I can't pin them down on anything.You can't say 'x' happened and then rearrange the criteria for judging 'x' or say that in the long run you can't define that criteria.Put it even more simple, you tell me what your definition of 'species' is and we'll see if Darwin's Finch falls into it.This isn't the only time evolutionaries do this smoke and mirrors trick.Evolution is a gradual process is a proclamation oft used.Not according to evolutionists such as Gould who had moderate change, and Richard Goldschmidt who had very rapid change. All of these people believe in evolution; speciation through natural means, i.e. without God, so to greater and lesser extents, it's all still deemed scientific.It is an absolute disgrace that anyone would adhere to a system that only has one thing/theory in common at the end of the day, God was absent in the process.As I said about the ascent of man, there's several different and mutually exclusive schools of thought as to how man arose. But it's all good as long as it excludes God (that is, it's a natural process). I am annoyed too that many evolutionaries will berate religious people because they say that evolution is a fact, based on evidences, but these same evidences support different theories. It's amazingly preposterous.If you check out my earlier debates, I showed about six different schools, and even a school of thought that believes some apes descended from man!I'm glad that you agree that that tautology is rather hollow.a) your web-site might say this, do any search on any search engine and you'll find zillions still using it.b) Show where it has been seen.c) " 1: Darwin used the term "natural selection" in his book "On the Origin of Species" but was persuaded that Spencer's phrase "survival of the fittest" was probably 'more convenient' "http://www.perceptions.couk.com/genes1.html#rst"Darwin did not believe that the environment was producing the variation within the finch populations.

Species are expected to often have imprecise boundaries because evolution is ongoing. Some species are in the process of forming while others are recently formed and still difficult to interpret. Creation, defining things as kinds that were created once and for all, implies that all species should be clearly defined, and that there should be a clear and universal definition of "kind"/species. Since there is not, creationism, not evolutionary theory, has something to explain. Different definitions of species serve different purposes. Species concepts are used both as taxonomic units, for identification and classification, and as theoretical concepts, for modeling and explaining. There is a great deal of overlap between the two purposes, but a definition that serves one is not necessarily the best for the other. Furthermore, there are practical considerations that call for different species criteria as well. Species definitions applied to fossils, for example, cannot be based on genetics or behavior because those traits don't fossilize. I assume you are talking about Archaeopteryx. It is a transitional type and I don’t know what you are talking about when you say it is not transitional in the normal sense of the word or that they have discovered that no dirds descended from it. Can you be more specific?There are competing theories but they are more or less accepted in the scientific community based on how well they are supported by evidence. As we discover more and more humanoid fossils which tell us more and more about how we evolved, scientist are able to narrow down to the model that best fits the evidence.If you believe the Bible is the in-errant word of God, and I’m not sure you do but it’s still an example, then you would think that Christians would agree on every detail. Yet there are thousands of different denominations with various beliefs. Some of the differences are quite large. Why would you expect any less from scientist since they are working with newly discovered evidence all the time?Maybe this is a good time for you to tell me what you believe about creation and the Bible in general so I will have a better handle on how to discuss things with you.BTW I get a lot of my material from talk orgins as I said before.

The fact is, friends and enemies, that evolution is disproven in all aspects of the field. There is no need to get sucked into an arguement on the big-bang theory (the theory leading up to evolution, now being doctored with all sorts of co-insiding theories: interesting stuff but not based on much besides speculation), for example, because there is no reasonable credability at all. I mean if this big-bang can come from "nothing" (now being made out to be a perception by strange and perverse men out to decieve even themselves), how come we cant re-create something simular in all of our supposed "glory"? In all of our complexity we lack in even nearly the amount of genious behind our creation. But, People who know better based on logic and understanding are constantly sucked into a "matrix" of lies and irrelevant issues which is put out to decieve the feeble, and ultamitely, to try to deny the existence of the Resurrected King of Glory, who is Jesus Christ. Jesus is God, and has left us amazing evidence of this very thing, (unlike silly speculation the supposed scientists put out for those who will "worship" man instead as if they really offer anything in this area other than more stupid questions and rediculous idealogies for the weak to chew on).

God was there. God inspired the Bible's books.He certainly communicated directly with Moses and other prophets. Then Jesus, God Incarnate, talks of God as Father, and Creator etc.

I'll try. You said that "Creation, defining things as kinds that were created once and for all, implies that all species should be clearly defined, and that there should be a clear and universal definition of "kind"/species. Since there is not, creationism, not evolutionary theory, has something to explain."My problem with that is that we have dogs, we have cats, but we don't have dogcats. I'm saying that there is, in fact, defined species.

Back to the dark ages when the church decided what people could believe and what they could think. No thank you. I’ll stick with the free country we live in. You can leave start your on theocracy somewhere else.Your ignorance of science is mind-boggling. You do still live in the dark ages. We now have the theory of gravity, theory of electro-magnetics, theory of relativity, and many others besides the theory of evolution. All of them would still stand if the Big Bang theory fell because none of them are based on the Big Bang theory. I doubt you even know what the theory of evolution is.According to the most recent polls by the Institute for Creation Research, I pick that one because you certainly could not question it’s motives, in America, the most religious nation on earth, 47 percent of the people believe in creationism and a recently created earth, 40 percent believe in a God directed evolution and an old earth, and 9 percent believe in a naturalistic evolution that God did not interfere with. Other polls show that less the 5 percent of the population is atheistic. Since half the population believes in evolution of some type and 5 percent of the total population are atheist, you can see that 10 percent of the people that believe in evolution are the maximum percentage that could be non-theist. That’s assuming you can do the elementary math and that may be a stretch. Since you advise other people to not engage in evolution debates and you have engaged me in an evolution debate, that makes you a hypocrite. And you know what Jesus said about hypocrites.

I thought your comments were interesting and I really enjoyed researching this reply. One of the things I like about debating is that prods me into learning.Speciation is the process of biological species formation. As such, Darwin’s finches are an excellent example of that process. What would be a logical progression of living organisms diverging into different species.1. Physical separation of groups of individuals that prevented interbreeding.1. Different environments that produce divergent physical characteristics over time.1. The changes result in some preference to mates based on those divergent physical characteristics.1. Further changes that result in so much preference that groups will not interbreed without definite restraints. For example a solitary pair than cannot find a partner of their group so they interbreed.1. Further changes that result in infertile offspring if restricted to mates.1. Further changes that result in aborted offspring if restricted to mates.1. Further changes that result in no interbreeding of any kind.In Darwin’s finches you can see ever phase of speciation except for stage 3 listed above. That is why it is such an excellent example of that process.The definition of a species is somewhat difficult to define. Not because scientist are trying to be deceitful, but because of the nature of the concept. It’s not unusual for something to be hard to define. The concept of the trinity is also hard to define but many people believe it. The reason it is difficult to define a species as groups that don’t interbreed is because living organisms that are separating into different species don’t just wake up one morning or one generation and say, “hey we’re not going to interbreed with that group anymore”. It is a gradual process but at some point, they do change into different species. I think everyone agrees that if a group cannot interbreed, they are definitely different species. On the other hand I believe that there are cases when animals and plants can interbreed that I think everyone agrees they are different species. Like lions and tigers or horses and donkeys. I would think that even you would agree these are different species.As far as my definition of a species, I’m not a scientist in that field as I said so I couldn’t give an intelligent definition. All the ones I found were very similar so I’ll just post one of them here.A species is a small gene pool protected from too much variability by a reproductive barrier. In other words, the species is a population adapted to a certain niche, and if the members of different species could interbreed with each other, too much genetic variability would occur, reducing the success of the adaptation.Okay now could you give me a definition of a “kind”.Gradual relative to the life of a man. However the term gradual does not mean or imply that the change is constant over time. There are times when the environment dictates that changes must occur more rapidly than at other times. If the environment is not changing, there is little incentive to modify a successful organism. Everything that I could find on Goldschmidt showed that he did not believe in macroevolution and all his theories were before the science of molecular genetics existed. If you are saying that there are a few crackpots even in the science fields, I will agree with you. But most scientist agree on the basics.Evolution has nothing to do with whether there is a God or not. You probably read my previous post showing that most people who believe in evolutionist in America also believe in a God.I’m sorry but as I’ve stated I’m pressed for time and don’t have to search. If you will point me to some post I will take a look. Again if you want to say there are some crackpots out there I will agree with you. However the scientific community does not accept them in general. I could point out some crackpot Christian theorist. I’m not sure what your point is. You seem to be upset that the term “natural selection” is used when discussing evolution. This relates to my discussion of Darwin’s finches above.I’m not asking you to debate me if it’s too much trouble. I know how time consuming this can be. But again, I don’t have the time to research this. If you will point me to the post I will read them.

Sorry Hank, I forgot to mention something you will probably find important. I believe that a sort of Pangea existed before the flood. I also believe that a meteor (or several meteors) struck the earth and this is what created the flood and the continents to break apart.Okay, now I will try to answer you in order: Research facilities do use bigger animals. Take for example those that use gorillas. These creatures need a huge amount of space to live in yet in a very spacious research facility one can be found existing in a 9’ x 9’ space. You are correct that if an unclean animal died it would illuminate its kind, but we would have to assume they all survived (by Devine Providence) which is unscientific. The only science I can offer you is that (monkey) research facilities are not in the habit of losing any of their animals since they are expensive to obtain. Wolves and foxes were not the same kind. Dogs however, were created by human domestication of one of these animals. Evolutionarily, cattle, oxen, sheep, and goats all came from the same descendant. However, I would allow for sheep and goats to be considered two kinds, but cattle and oxen are so close to each other (and since cow worship was very popular after the flood) I feel that they might have been very successful in breeding these.Now dinosaurs: once again, I believe they had access to humans (because of the single continent). In the geological column, we see various periods of mass extinctions. Evolutionists have come up with many explanations but none of them is sufficient in describing why only most and not all of the animals died. My theory is humans caused each mass extinction purposely or inadvertently. This would explain why not all the animals died. I have no doubt that the land bridge existed from Asia to North America. Because of this, I believe the animals were driven to South America (by God). I also believe that at least some of the Sunda shelf was above water and this is why the trip to Australia would not have been so difficult. I believe that after the flood in order to speed the drying process God put most of the water into the ice caps and these began melting which was the natural disaster (which wouldn’t have been recorded) that raised the sea level and cut off the Australian land bridge (at least). Just out of curiosity, how do you feel about the evolutionists’ theories on island inhabitation? I haven’t fallen back on those out of mere stubbornness, but if you really want scientific…(The “I said so” jibe was not targeted at you – it was targeted at the other person who keeps proclaiming to know science but usually responds with things that are wrong according to any science book.Questions are always logical, but proclaiming fiction as fact is not.)I hope I have given a little more logic to it all, but I welcome your questions. In my opinion, true proof is impossible to obtain until we get to heaven and ask God. But my beliefs are based on what I have observed and what I know of science. I am also not a scientist, but until a person has obtained his or her phD, I would never give them that title. I have know too many people with a Masters who had pursued the career simply because they became stuck in it and didn't care for it at all. You have to have a love to be a scientist.

I wasn’t trying to limit this post to Noah’s ark, I was trying to focus on a few things that I could discuss instead of having 50 items back and forth that create long post and lots of time researching and writing.True but you are talking about small animals.

If any of the unclean animals died, that would eliminate the kind.I’m not quite clear on what you are saying here. Are you saying that all wolves and foxes and dogs were the same kind? All cattle and oxen are the same kind? All sheep and goats are the same kind?For the first, that would mean that God created the dinosaurs and in 1500 years they were all dead. And all these huge animals were killed by humans? Even the ones in the America’s.For case two that is false right out if you believe the Bible because it plainly says that God told Noah to put at least one pair of all living animals on the ark.I probable won’t find the time to read something else. Anything specific you want to discuss?So your theory is that the marsupials traveled from Australia to where Noah’s ark was before the flood, then they all traveled back or were carried by humans. Then during recorded history some kind of natural disaster of epic proportions created a 600 mile gap between Australia and any other main land and there is no record of that natural disaster.And the second theory is that someone took all the animals that are specific to South America only, and carried them across a land bridge and down into South America.And for both these theories, the animals were not domesticated, but just out of some strange impulse humans decided to carry these animals along with them, feed them, keep them from eating them or each other, and never allow any offspring to leave this convoy along the way.I’m really not trying to be sarcastic but these are questions I would have to ask myself if I was being honest. This theory would be too much of a stretch for me.So far I have only been talking about common sense ideas. I will provide evidence for anything that is required.

You're the first evolutionist to say something nice to me.I agree that that's what the textbooks say. It's a fait accompli, in that we have different species through 'speciation'. It's a backwards way of looking at things; such as the notion 'evolution is true - how else did we get here'. It is in fact another tautology; species separated through the process of separation.Again, the theory is great. Yet the finch has moved to different areas, but as they have been shown to interbreed then they are no more different species than dogs are different species.I do strongly recommend you look at the previous posts (thread: "How does a new species come about?"). The Finches are not separated, in that they share the same islands. They are not 'prevented' from interbreeding, because as I said, they do interbreed.There are several islands which have more than one 'species' on it (despite popular theory).(post 17 I wrote: The classic example given in textbooks is Darwin's Finch, which is said to have speciated into 13 distinct groups.

Sorry Hank, I forgot to mention something you will probably find important. I believe that a sort of Pangea existed before the flood. I also believe that a meteor (or several meteors) struck the earth and this is what created the flood and the continents to break apart.Okay, now I will try to answer you in order: Research facilities do use bigger animals. Take for example those that use gorillas. These creatures need a huge amount of space to live in yet in a very spacious research facility one can be found existing in a 9’ x 9’ space. You are correct that if an unclean animal died it would illuminate its kind, but we would have to assume they all survived (by Devine Providence) which is unscientific. The only science I can offer you is that (monkey) research facilities are not in the habit of losing any of their animals since they are expensive to obtain. Wolves and foxes were not the same kind. Dogs however, were created by human domestication of one of these animals. Evolutionarily, cattle, oxen, sheep, and goats all came from the same descendant. However, I would allow for sheep and goats to be considered two kinds, but cattle and oxen are so close to each other (and since cow worship was very popular after the flood) I feel that they might have been very successful in breeding these.Now dinosaurs: once again, I believe they had access to humans (because of the single continent). In the geological column, we see various periods of mass extinctions. Evolutionists have come up with many explanations but none of them is sufficient in describing why only most and not all of the animals died. My theory is humans caused each mass extinction purposely or inadvertently. This would explain why not all the animals died. I have no doubt that the land bridge existed from Asia to North America. Because of this, I believe the animals were driven to South America (by God). I also believe that at least some of the Sunda shelf was above water and this is why the trip to Australia would not have been so difficult. I believe that after the flood in order to speed the drying process God put most of the water into the ice caps and these began melting which was the natural disaster (which wouldn’t have been recorded) that raised the sea level and cut off the Australian land bridge (at least). Just out of curiosity, how do you feel about the evolutionists’ theories on island inhabitation? I haven’t fallen back on those out of mere stubbornness, but if you really want scientific…(The “I said so” jibe was not targeted at you – it was targeted at the other person who keeps proclaiming to know science but usually responds with things that are wrong according to any science book.Questions are always logical, but proclaiming fiction as fact is not.)I hope I have given a little more logic to it all, but I welcome your questions. In my opinion, true proof is impossible to obtain until we get to heaven and ask God. But my beliefs are based on what I have observed and what I know of science. I am also not a scientist, but until a person has obtained his or her phD, I would never give them that title. I have know too many people with a Masters who had pursued the career simply because they became stuck in it and didn't care for it at all. You have to have a love to be a scientist.

Perhaps I can clear up the Trinity for you Hank (or further confuse you). We have water, ice and steam. All are of the same substance, but all have different properties. Each has a spciefic purpose in nature, but each is the same. When God wanted to talk to humans and he talked to them in His form (as God the Father), humans didn't like it. So God came down as Jesus (the son) in human form instead of in pure God form and although they were one and the same, Jesus and the Father were different in that they served different purposes. Then God wanted to provide a part of Himself that would live in his people. As both Jesus and God this was not possible, so He made Himself into another form that could live within humans (the Holy Spirit).

Maths is not a science, it is based on definition and deduction, not on experiment and observation. This is why some universities give BA's in Mathematics, and some offer choice of either a BA or BSc.Priscilla,The use of 'law' in science has no proper definition, nor do things categorised as laws have a higher truth value (Newton's laws of motion vs. Einstein's Theory of Relativity, for example). The use of the term 'law' is mostly found in earlier scientific studies, most working Scientists would consider using the term arrogant.In any case whether we call it a Theory, a law, or a piggeldy-widgitonimator makes utterly no difference to whether it is true or not. A rose by any other name and all that.

Sorry but I’m not going to debate that way. I’m not accusing you of this, but I know it is a tactic of creationist to only debate evolution because it is a complicated subject and the issues can easily be clouded. The reason I have some sympathy for scientist trying to debate evolution with creationist is because I’m in the same situation, except the subject does not raise emotional issues. I’ll give you a personal example. As a structural engineer, there are many times when my customers, contractors, interested parties, etc. will ask a question like “How much load will this structure take”. It seems like a simple question that a structural engineer should be able to answer, but I can’t. What I can do is tell you what load the structure will safely take which is what I am responsible for. The reasons any engineer or I can’t tell you exactly when a structure will fail are complicated and varied. For instance, steel has a minimum strength. Statistically, any individual steel will have about a 99% chance of being stronger than the minimum specified. It may even be a whole lot stronger. And that is just one of the reasons. Now I’m saying all of this to explain that science is complicated and there are often not simplistic answers that the lay public can easily grasp. And I know that is used by dishonest creationist to make their point. Again I’m not accusing you of that, but I believe there are those that honestly believe they are helping the cause of religion by defending creationism in any manner they can, even deception. In other words, they believe that the end justifies the means. Are their dishonest scientists? Of course there are. They are human just like everybody else. But scientific proposals and theories must be reviewed by their peers. And as an engineer who is similar to a scientist in lots of ways, I do not believe there is this vast conspiracy to deceive the public, just as I know there is no conspiracy in my field to deceive. Okay I’ve said my sermon. LOL You have presented question that I believe you think are valid question and have in no way been rude. I have tried to respond in kind. I perfectly understand the time issue and your resentment of others that argue against you being dishonest, and as you can imagine, I am often up against the same problem as I have done this a few times myself. I am pretty secure in my beliefs and think I can justify them with the evidence. I try to be completely honest with myself and others and have no problem admitting if I make a mistake. The subject is complicated and no one can know everything about it. Especially a lay person, as you have already seen that I rely on the experts for much of my material. But I do this for fun and to learn and I’m not interested in a one way debate where I don’t get to ask any questions. And I don’t think I am being unreasonable to ask you to define a similar concept after you have made a considerable issue of evolutionist not being able to tie down the exact definition of a species. As you yourself stated, it is unfair of you.Okay all that being said, I have enjoyed our short debate and hope we part friends. I look forward to debating you on other issues if we have the chance. And if you change your mind about this just let me know and we can continue.

They are not crack-pots. They are respected. Which school do you believe in?And besides, what makes a crack-pot scientist? Even the crack-pots have theories and they're still using science!No, just that you said that Darwin never used it. I put to you two examples of where he did. Then, I actually thought that this was a deflection from the issue that 'Survival of the Fittest" is a nonsense, because it is a tautology. I think I gave examples of where it doesn't makes sense; viz, moose locking antlers etc.Further, that the proof is Darwin's non-natural selection.Natural selection can't explain anything. As I said, the 'strongest' animal doesn't necessarily have the genes that will ensure future survival. Strength as a bonus was seen as a plus only by Victorians who wanted to go out and colonise the world. Bigger is not always best, hence there aren't many T-Rexs about.I'm not trying to be rude.

The level of honesty displayed amongst them was microscopic.(They all left this debate though because Lurch made a stupid statement, and rather than accept it, he kept pressing it, and quite dishonestly, his cohorts kept deflecting attention rather than deal with the issue. It got rather petty as they objected to me coining the word 'evolutionaries' as a collective noun for them.)But in short I will not post these things again, unless you raise some issue to which they are pertinent. And yes I'm reluctant to repost 'kind'. One evolutionary debate per thread at a time for me.

If you read the article in Encarta, you'll see that Newtons "Law" is flawed, so your original statement, "A law in science is an irrefutable fact and thereby the highest you can get." is wrong. The entire list you present are used to describe limited, specific phenomenon and have no explainitory power. Your implication that a theory becomes a law in science or that a law is somehow more valid than a theory is wrong.Theories are the highest you get in science, they don't become laws.The law of gravitation does not explain the nature of gravity, and so we still have the theory of gravity. It is still the atomic theory, yet we use this to harness atomic energy, it is still the heliocentric theory even though we can see the sun in the sky and it is considered common knowledge that we orbit around the sun and it is still the theory of evolution even though it is considered a fact that life evolves, we are still studying the mechanisms that drive it.

Sorry but I’m not going to debate that way. I’m not accusing you of this, but I know it is a tactic of creationist to only debate evolution because it is a complicated subject and the issues can easily be clouded. The reason I have some sympathy for scientist trying to debate evolution with creationist is because I’m in the same situation, except the subject does not raise emotional issues. I’ll give you a personal example. As a structural engineer, there are many times when my customers, contractors, interested parties, etc. will ask a question like “How much load will this structure take”. It seems like a simple question that a structural engineer should be able to answer, but I can’t. What I can do is tell you what load the structure will safely take which is what I am responsible for. The reasons any engineer or I can’t tell you exactly when a structure will fail are complicated and varied. For instance, steel has a minimum strength. Statistically, any individual steel will have about a 99% chance of being stronger than the minimum specified. It may even be a whole lot stronger. And that is just one of the reasons. Now I’m saying all of this to explain that science is complicated and there are often not simplistic answers that the lay public can easily grasp. And I know that is used by dishonest creationist to make their point. Again I’m not accusing you of that, but I believe there are those that honestly believe they are helping the cause of religion by defending creationism in any manner they can, even deception. In other words, they believe that the end justifies the means. Are their dishonest scientists? Of course there are. They are human just like everybody else. But scientific proposals and theories must be reviewed by their peers. And as an engineer who is similar to a scientist in lots of ways, I do not believe there is this vast conspiracy to deceive the public, just as I know there is no conspiracy in my field to deceive. Okay I’ve said my sermon. LOL You have presented question that I believe you think are valid question and have in no way been rude. I have tried to respond in kind. I perfectly understand the time issue and your resentment of others that argue against you being dishonest, and as you can imagine, I am often up against the same problem as I have done this a few times myself. I am pretty secure in my beliefs and think I can justify them with the evidence. I try to be completely honest with myself and others and have no problem admitting if I make a mistake. The subject is complicated and no one can know everything about it. Especially a lay person, as you have already seen that I rely on the experts for much of my material. But I do this for fun and to learn and I’m not interested in a one way debate where I don’t get to ask any questions. And I don’t think I am being unreasonable to ask you to define a similar concept after you have made a considerable issue of evolutionist not being able to tie down the exact definition of a species. As you yourself stated, it is unfair of you.Okay all that being said, I have enjoyed our short debate and hope we part friends. I look forward to debating you on other issues if we have the chance. And if you change your mind about this just let me know and we can continue.

If I may say so, I'm glad to see such cordiality in this forum. I agree with montalban's saying that there are 12 species of finch rather than 1 or 2 because they are Darwin's finches. Maybe this is on purpose, more likely it is not. I want to point out that the speciation of the finches doesn't prove macro evolution, in the same way that the current difference between Chiuahuas and Great Danes don't prove it. As far as I know, the differences are due not to changes in information, but the elimination of information. That's how micro evolution works. (example - the peppered moth's went from mostly light color to dark because the light color genes were being eliminated) One particular group of finches grows bigger beaks because the genes for smaller beaks are being lost. (the genes that repress the growth of the beak) They aren't growing new beaks. So, as far as I know, its really a non issue in regards to proving or finding evidence for macro evolution.

You're the first evolutionist to say something nice to me.I agree that that's what the textbooks say. It's a fait accompli, in that we have different species through 'speciation'. It's a backwards way of looking at things; such as the notion 'evolution is true - how else did we get here'. It is in fact another tautology; species separated through the process of separation.Again, the theory is great. Yet the finch has moved to different areas, but as they have been shown to interbreed then they are no more different species than dogs are different species.I do strongly recommend you look at the previous posts (thread: "How does a new species come about?"). The Finches are not separated, in that they share the same islands. They are not 'prevented' from interbreeding, because as I said, they do interbreed.There are several islands which have more than one 'species' on it (despite popular theory).(post 17 I wrote: The classic example given in textbooks is Darwin's Finch, which is said to have speciated into 13 distinct groups. "They are also a classic model of speciation: again, they figure in virtually all of the textbooks, very often as the central illustration. That is why these birds have become such a universal symbol of Darwinism process, so that their beaks now represent evolution the way Newton's apple represents gravity." http://www.crossroad.to/articles2/2002/darwin.htm Further..."Biologists now have applied modern methods of DNA analysis to Darwin's finches. Not surprisingly ? for Darwin was almost always right, though he knew of neither genes nor DNA ? they have found that the finches are all descended from a single ancestral species." http://www.bibledecoded.com/understanding221.html This seems pretty convincing stuff.David Lack who studied them in 1937 had said "in no other birds are the difference between species so ill-defined." So, perhaps it's because they are the same species! The so-called proof of them being separate species derives from Lack's study when he tried to mate a single pair (from different 'species') and could not. Other people have continued with that mistake. " The respected ornithologist John Gould was especially thrilled with "a series of ground finches, so peculiar in form that he was induced to regard them as constituting an entirely new group containing 14 species, and appearing to be strictly confined to the Galapagos Islands." http://www.crossroad.to/articles2/2002/darwin.htm But, not all is so clear...Let's look at the most widely known book at present - Jonathan Weiner's "The Beak of the Finch : A Story of Evolution in Our Time" (for which he won the Pulitzer Prize). (he's an evolutionist)"Back in 1983, for instance... a male cactus finch on Daphne Major (a Galapagos Island), a scandens, courted a female fortis. This was a pair of truly star crossed lovers. They were not just from opposite sides of the tracks, like the Prince and the Showgirl, or from two warring families, like Romeo and Juliet: they belonged to two different species. Yet during the chaos of the great flood, they mated and produced four chicks in one brood." How then, are they different species? This is a case of a scientist who can't see the woods for the trees, it's starring him in the face... they aren't different species at all... but he's a trained mind, who's had it drilled into him... Evolution is true, Darwin's Finches are proof of Evolution! Further studies by Grant or Graham (I can't recall the name) showed that they 'cross-pairings' are often the most successful!Thus the classic example of specification actually is not proof or evidence of specification at all!(all quotes taken from Milton, R "Shattering the Myths of Darwinism", p143ff, unless otherwise sourced)"As I say, Darwin's Finch is said to be 12 or 8 or 1 species (the later according to me based on the fact that they can interbreed). The first two figures are given by scientists studying them. And, you seem to be having it both ways, because scientists do say that the finch in question IS an example of speciatation. It either is; and then the evidence should back it up, or if they're unsure, then they can't make such a claim.The concept of the Trinity doesn't constantly change. It won't change if we discover new saints.Then the Chihuaha and the Great Dane are a different species of dog. They are physically incapable of breeding (naturally). You've discovered a new species of dog!As far as my definition of a species, I?m not a scientist in that field as I said so I couldn?t give an intelligent definition. All the ones I found were very similar so I?ll just post one of them here.A species is a small gene pool protected from too much variability by a reproductive barrier. In other words, the species is a population adapted to a certain niche, and if the members of different species could interbreed with each other, too much genetic variability would occur, reducing the success of the adaptation.Why do I need to define 'kind'? I know this is unfair, but I'm debating evolution. Yes, it's unfair of me.What basics? The definition of species?As I said, there are two basic definitions of species. Animals that have separated to form populations that can not naturally interbreed, or animals that will not naturally interbreed.If the first, then my dog analogy works to discredit it, because the can't naturally interbreed.If the later, that is, based on actual breeding populations; where an animal could but doesn't then you've discovered another new species; in man. I know of many white guys who won't 'soil' themselves by having sex with blacks. Even though they can interbreed, they won't, because of 'sexual preference'. Therefore they are new species of humans.That's just wishful thinking. Evoultion is all about natural processes. Find me a respected evolutionist who believes that God was present at every step. Evolution is a 'science'. Science is about measurable things.

You caught me before I could change part of my response. I could not figure out what this "Theory of gravitation" was that everyone was talking about. So I looked into it further (I never read Encarta, I was just trying to give you an easy access to the laws of science and I checked to see if it was there). You are correct, the "theory of gravitation" by Newton is just that: a theory that is currently being debated. However, the laws of gravity are unchanged irrefutable facts and if you would have given me 7 hours after that original post, you would have never seen it (it has been changed now). How is it that you do not see the laws of thermodynamics as applying to all areas of life. Most of the laws listed apply to the basic ways that life proceeds. Well, at least you are grudgingy conceding that laws exist. I find it funny that even though I have never implied the "Its just a theory" belief (which I wouldn't) that you still fight to the end in upholding the untouchableness of them. Theories change just as almost everything in science does. One minute Galeleo's contemporary scientists are running to the church and telling them to persecute him as a heretic and then the next millenia they are blaming the church for being blind.

Based on what my science professors have explained to me this is not true. However, this is not the thread I wanted to debate. My original statements were made to prove that science changes its theories over time (they are not constant). After making that statement someone decided to state that a theory was the highest you could achieve and that science had no laws. All the information I have found is trying to prove two points: Science has laws (which don't change- let me know if you have seen a scientist stating the laws of thermodynamics are false or possible false in some instances), and theories do change over time. I don't want to continue debating this unless someone can bring me a quote from a college level (science text) book stating specifically that science does not have laws or that theories never change over time.I have just contacted my college evolution professor, in hopefully what is the final word on this, he said, that yes science has laws, and they are still open to being disproven, but they have not changed over a long period of time. Theories on the other hand do change and have changed recently. He also stated that the burst theory of evolution is currently being debated by evolutionists. As a final note, he couldn't see what point we were trying to make arguing about such silly things as wording (my words not his), with which I completely agreed. In other words, there are scientists today who go back and forth with such things as whether a law or theory is more important, but if they can't come to an agreement, how could we?

Maths is not a science, it is based on definition and deduction, not on experiment and observation. This is why some universities give BA's in Mathematics, and some offer choice of either a BA or BSc.Priscilla,The use of 'law' in science has no proper definition, nor do things categorised as laws have a higher truth value (Newton's laws of motion vs. Einstein's Theory of Relativity, for example). The use of the term 'law' is mostly found in earlier scientific studies, most working Scientists would consider using the term arrogant.In any case whether we call it a Theory, a law, or a piggeldy-widgitonimator makes utterly no difference to whether it is true or not. A rose by any other name and all that.

Species is the Latin word for “kind” or “appearance”. The Hebrew word translated as kind means genus or species. There are currently four different concepts scientists use for species. Scientifically, all of them are correct at this point in time.The morphological concept of species: uses anatomical differences to describe what a species is. Taxonomists use this and by this definition, the finches are separate species.The biological concept of species: uses reproductive isolation to describe what a species is. In other words, one species cannot reproduce with another. It does not work for asexual, extinct, or geographically isolated animals because we cannot observe this quality.The recognition concept of species: a species only recognizes certain mating characteristics and will not attempt to mate with others who do not display the same characteristics. I do not like this theory simply because baboons and small chimpanzees have been observed attempting to mate so they would be placed in the same species by this definition.The cohesion theory: in this theory, similarities in genes are what determine species. Since I tend to like more analytical methods this is my favorite, however the amount of work it would take to create entire genomes of every living creature on the planet may be quite overwhelming.It seems like there is also some confusion as to what exactly evolution is. If I may start from a quote, “The environment did not create beaks specialized for larger or smaller seeds…” Biology, 4th Ed., CampbellEnvironment has no effect on the mutations that are beneficial. Mutations occur everyday regardless of environment. After the mutations occur, Darwin (and evolution) says that the environment will determine which ones will have a better chance of surviving and therefore will continue their line. It does not matter what terms Darwin used (he only used “evolution” once in Origin), we (should) understand that “survival of the fittest” refers to the survival of those who are best adapted to their environment and this is pure evolution. It is for this reason that there is an ongoing debate as to whether humans have stopped evolving (not just the fit of us survive).

What? I'm pretty clueless on what you are talking about and what you are asking. Can you clarify that some?

Priscilla I like the way you think. It’s seems you are open to logical discussion of the subject. But I want to comment on something you said before spending too much time on this reply.What I want to say is that we could debate, or even just have a discussion, about a particular point on evolution or creationism and I could spend a lot of time and energy researching the subject only to in the end have you simply say “God did it with a miracle”. Now I wouldn’t criticize your beliefs as long as those beliefs didn’t hurt other people and I believe you have a right to believe anything you want. And if you believe God created the earth or life or mankind then so be it, I have no argument with you. I have a strong belief in God and realize I can’t prove there is a God so I wouldn’t ask anyone else to prove their beliefs.I think you understand what I am trying to say. And the reason I’m saying that is that I may comment at times on something you might say but if I don’t reply to something you posted about something I posted, you’ll understand why. If we are discussing religion or morals or something like that in another section, then I’m all in favor of using different belief systems. But I’m sure you already know that science is the study of natural events. Once you bring the supernatural into the picture you change the entire equation. Not that God doesn’t exist or scientist don’t believe in a God, just that it ceases to be science when you use the supernatural to explain the physical.

Sorry Hank, I forgot to mention something you will probably find important. I believe that a sort of Pangea existed before the flood. I also believe that a meteor (or several meteors) struck the earth and this is what created the flood and the continents to break apart.Okay, now I will try to answer you in order: Research facilities do use bigger animals. Take for example those that use gorillas. These creatures need a huge amount of space to live in yet in a very spacious research facility one can be found existing in a 9’ x 9’ space. You are correct that if an unclean animal died it would illuminate its kind, but we would have to assume they all survived (by Devine Providence) which is unscientific. The only science I can offer you is that (monkey) research facilities are not in the habit of losing any of their animals since they are expensive to obtain. Wolves and foxes were not the same kind. Dogs however, were created by human domestication of one of these animals. Evolutionarily, cattle, oxen, sheep, and goats all came from the same descendant. However, I would allow for sheep and goats to be considered two kinds, but cattle and oxen are so close to each other (and since cow worship was very popular after the flood) I feel that they might have been very successful in breeding these.Now dinosaurs: once again, I believe they had access to humans (because of the single continent). In the geological column, we see various periods of mass extinctions. Evolutionists have come up with many explanations but none of them is sufficient in describing why only most and not all of the animals died. My theory is humans caused each mass extinction purposely or inadvertently. This would explain why not all the animals died. I have no doubt that the land bridge existed from Asia to North America. Because of this, I believe the animals were driven to South America (by God). I also believe that at least some of the Sunda shelf was above water and this is why the trip to Australia would not have been so difficult. I believe that after the flood in order to speed the drying process God put most of the water into the ice caps and these began melting which was the natural disaster (which wouldn’t have been recorded) that raised the sea level and cut off the Australian land bridge (at least). Just out of curiosity, how do you feel about the evolutionists’ theories on island inhabitation? I haven’t fallen back on those out of mere stubbornness, but if you really want scientific…(The “I said so” jibe was not targeted at you – it was targeted at the other person who keeps proclaiming to know science but usually responds with things that are wrong according to any science book.Questions are always logical, but proclaiming fiction as fact is not.)I hope I have given a little more logic to it all, but I welcome your questions. In my opinion, true proof is impossible to obtain until we get to heaven and ask God. But my beliefs are based on what I have observed and what I know of science. I am also not a scientist, but until a person has obtained his or her phD, I would never give them that title. I have know too many people with a Masters who had pursued the career simply because they became stuck in it and didn't care for it at all. You have to have a love to be a scientist.

Thank you. A person that can admit a mistake is usually secure in their beliefs.

Priscilla I was raised in the Baptist church and if we did nothing else, we studied the Bible. And I have heard that comparsion every since I was old enough to think. What I was pointing out was that the concept is not that difficult. The defining of the concept in detail is very difficult. That's why you just used a comparsion instead of a statement. I would bet if I talked to ten different Christians, I would get ten different answers to the question "Can you explain the trinity to me?"

Perhaps I can clear up the Trinity for you Hank (or further confuse you). We have water, ice and steam. All are of the same substance, but all have different properties. Each has a spciefic purpose in nature, but each is the same. When God wanted to talk to humans and he talked to them in His form (as God the Father), humans didn't like it. So God came down as Jesus (the son) in human form instead of in pure God form and although they were one and the same, Jesus and the Father were different in that they served different purposes. Then God wanted to provide a part of Himself that would live in his people. As both Jesus and God this was not possible, so He made Himself into another form that could live within humans (the Holy Spirit).

Robbie I am still researching this and having a very interesting time doing it. It seems there is a lot to know and a lot of research out there. But I will point out now that I’m pretty sure that two of the species do not interbreed and four of the species breed but do not produce fertile offspring. Non-fertile offspring is an evolutionary dead-end and once that bridge is crossed, you can not go back. Therefore the future of the two species would be forever separated.The definition of macro and micro evolution that evolutionist use is micro-evolution is within species and macro-evolution is above the level of species. You may not agree with that definition but I’m just passing on that that’s what they use as a definition.

I hope you realize that I wouldn't use that as a debate in this forum. That is why I specified that observation was unscientific. That is also why I said that research facilities don't have a high death rate (and the nature of their experiments on animals is more risky) to show it is possible to keep animals alive under lees than ideal conditions. However, I had to go back and read the verse again to make sure I had it right. There were seven pairs of clean animals and two pairs of unclean animals, so two animals of the same kind would have had to die. In order to provide the chance for maximum reproduction, I would assume they would have been young. I also assume that Noah had spent a good part of the 100 years collecting the animals and breeding them in a sort of zoo and he would have choosen only those he knew were young and healthy (That is what I would have done to assure their survival). I hope you finished reading the post, and I hope you continue to point out where I have made unscientific statements so I can either clarify or concede. Just understand that while I believe God did it because it says so, I would never use that as an argument, because it is illogical. Unfortunatley, I cannot say that others on this board will offer the same statement based on the other posts I have seen. However, you must understand that just as I see evolutionists origin theories as specualtion, I also see theories beyond what the Bible says as speculation. Since I do not have the funds to prove my Noah's Ark Theories (nor do I believe I will ever have them), and since I do believe in God, I assume the only way we could ever truly find out is by asking Him. So when you see that at the end of my statements, if you prefer you can read: We wouldn't know more certainly until further experimentation is available. Don't confuse my giving God the glory as my using Him as proof of Himself. If you can refute my observations scientifically, I welcome it. (As you did in your previous post on Noah's Ark). But don't just remain silent because you are afraid I will just use "God did it" as an answer.

Priscilla I like the way you think. It’s seems you are open to logical discussion of the subject. But I want to comment on something you said before spending too much time on this reply.What I want to say is that we could debate, or even just have a discussion, about a particular point on evolution or creationism and I could spend a lot of time and energy researching the subject only to in the end have you simply say “God did it with a miracle”. Now I wouldn’t criticize your beliefs as long as those beliefs didn’t hurt other people and I believe you have a right to believe anything you want. And if you believe God created the earth or life or mankind then so be it, I have no argument with you. I have a strong belief in God and realize I can’t prove there is a God so I wouldn’t ask anyone else to prove their beliefs.I think you understand what I am trying to say. And the reason I’m saying that is that I may comment at times on something you might say but if I don’t reply to something you posted about something I posted, you’ll understand why. If we are discussing religion or morals or something like that in another section, then I’m all in favor of using different belief systems. But I’m sure you already know that science is the study of natural events. Once you bring the supernatural into the picture you change the entire equation. Not that God doesn’t exist or scientist don’t believe in a God, just that it ceases to be science when you use the supernatural to explain the physical.

I never assumed you were raised outside of the church, I disagree with you though - The definition of the Trinity is three in one. The hard part isn't the defintion, but understanding how it works and that is why so many people have so many different ways of explaining it. The question you should ask is what is the Trinity? With speciation, the concept is different. We have different ways of looking at it because no one has figured out a way to explain it so all the different scientists involved are satisfied. With the Trinity, we have discovered ways of explaining it so people can grasp it: the clover, the triangle, water, ice and steam, but the actual definition of what it is does not change.

Priscilla I was raised in the Baptist church and if we did nothing else, we studied the Bible. And I have heard that comparsion every since I was old enough to think. What I was pointing out was that the concept is not that difficult. The defining of the concept in detail is very difficult. That's why you just used a comparsion instead of a statement. I would bet if I talked to ten different Christians, I would get ten different answers to the question "Can you explain the trinity to me?"

Maths is not a science, it is based on definition and deduction, not on experiment and observation. This is why some universities give BA's in Mathematics, and some offer choice of either a BA or BSc.Priscilla,The use of 'law' in science has no proper definition, nor do things categorised as laws have a higher truth value (Newton's laws of motion vs. Einstein's Theory of Relativity, for example). The use of the term 'law' is mostly found in earlier scientific studies, most working Scientists would consider using the term arrogant.In any case whether we call it a Theory, a law, or a piggeldy-widgitonimator makes utterly no difference to whether it is true or not. A rose by any other name and all that.

Sorry but I’m not going to debate that way. I’m not accusing you of this, but I know it is a tactic of creationist to only debate evolution because it is a complicated subject and the issues can easily be clouded. The reason I have some sympathy for scientist trying to debate evolution with creationist is because I’m in the same situation, except the subject does not raise emotional issues. I’ll give you a personal example. As a structural engineer, there are many times when my customers, contractors, interested parties, etc. will ask a question like “How much load will this structure take”. It seems like a simple question that a structural engineer should be able to answer, but I can’t. What I can do is tell you what load the structure will safely take which is what I am responsible for. The reasons any engineer or I can’t tell you exactly when a structure will fail are complicated and varied. For instance, steel has a minimum strength. Statistically, any individual steel will have about a 99% chance of being stronger than the minimum specified. It may even be a whole lot stronger. And that is just one of the reasons. Now I’m saying all of this to explain that science is complicated and there are often not simplistic answers that the lay public can easily grasp. And I know that is used by dishonest creationist to make their point. Again I’m not accusing you of that, but I believe there are those that honestly believe they are helping the cause of religion by defending creationism in any manner they can, even deception. In other words, they believe that the end justifies the means. Are their dishonest scientists? Of course there are. They are human just like everybody else. But scientific proposals and theories must be reviewed by their peers. And as an engineer who is similar to a scientist in lots of ways, I do not believe there is this vast conspiracy to deceive the public, just as I know there is no conspiracy in my field to deceive. Okay I’ve said my sermon. LOL You have presented question that I believe you think are valid question and have in no way been rude. I have tried to respond in kind. I perfectly understand the time issue and your resentment of others that argue against you being dishonest, and as you can imagine, I am often up against the same problem as I have done this a few times myself. I am pretty secure in my beliefs and think I can justify them with the evidence. I try to be completely honest with myself and others and have no problem admitting if I make a mistake. The subject is complicated and no one can know everything about it. Especially a lay person, as you have already seen that I rely on the experts for much of my material. But I do this for fun and to learn and I’m not interested in a one way debate where I don’t get to ask any questions. And I don’t think I am being unreasonable to ask you to define a similar concept after you have made a considerable issue of evolutionist not being able to tie down the exact definition of a species. As you yourself stated, it is unfair of you.Okay all that being said, I have enjoyed our short debate and hope we part friends. I look forward to debating you on other issues if we have the chance. And if you change your mind about this just let me know and we can continue.

Further to this, science uses words such as 'facts' and 'truths'. Look at talkorigins.org's FAQs:"Q: I thought evolution was just a theory. Why do you call it a fact?A: Biological evolution is a change in the genetic characteristics of a population over time. That this happens is a fact. Biological evolution also refers to the common descent of living organisms from shared ancestors. The evidence for historical evolution -- genetic, fossil, anatomical, etc. -- is so overwhelming that it is also considered a fact. The theory of evolution describes the mechanisms that cause evolution. So evolution is both a fact and a theory. See the Evolution is a Fact and a Theory FAQ, the Introduction to Evolutionary Biology FAQ and the Five Major Misconceptions about Evolution FAQ: Evolution is Only a theory"http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/faqs-qa.htmlThus it is more than just 'a theory'. It is a truth; dare I say 'a law'?But again this is part of the endemic problem of debating evolutionaries, they'll fight to the death to keep evolution, but can't actually tell you what it is; a truth? a theory? What?It's proven 'true' by 'evidences' but these same evidences can point to different pathways such as I showed with the several different schools of thought re: the ascent of man; even though these schools are using the same evidences; and coming to the same conclusion in so far as man evolved, they are in themselves mutually contradicting. Yet, bizarrely, it's all 'true'.Another poster wanted me to define 'kind' or to define 'trinity' this at best is suggesting that he's hoping that none of us can pin these things down; but I bet they don't teach evolution in schools as being equal to the Bible (even though his now suggesting that they're all equally befuddled).

Based on what my science professors have explained to me this is not true. However, this is not the thread I wanted to debate. My original statements were made to prove that science changes its theories over time (they are not constant). After making that statement someone decided to state that a theory was the highest you could achieve and that science had no laws. All the information I have found is trying to prove two points: Science has laws (which don't change- let me know if you have seen a scientist stating the laws of thermodynamics are false or possible false in some instances), and theories do change over time. I don't want to continue debating this unless someone can bring me a quote from a college level (science text) book stating specifically that science does not have laws or that theories never change over time.I have just contacted my college evolution professor, in hopefully what is the final word on this, he said, that yes science has laws, and they are still open to being disproven, but they have not changed over a long period of time. Theories on the other hand do change and have changed recently. He also stated that the burst theory of evolution is currently being debated by evolutionists. As a final note, he couldn't see what point we were trying to make arguing about such silly things as wording (my words not his), with which I completely agreed. In other words, there are scientists today who go back and forth with such things as whether a law or theory is more important, but if they can't come to an agreement, how could we?

As I said, the study "The Beak of the Finch" says that two cross-bred. The author described them as "star-crossed lovers" from "different sides of the tracks" but their offspring were some of the most successful finches he saw!See the thread "How does a new species come about?"I wrote there, at post 17"Let's look at the most widely known book at present - Jonathan Weiner's "The Beak of the Finch : A Story of Evolution in Our Time" (for which he won the Pulitzer Prize). (he's an evolutionist)"Back in 1983, for instance... a male cactus finch on Daphne Major (a Galapagos Island), a scandens, courted a female fortis. This was a pair of truly star crossed lovers. They were not just from opposite sides of the tracks, like the Prince and the Showgirl, or from two warring families, like Romeo and Juliet: they belonged to two different species. Yet during the chaos of the great flood, they mated and produced four chicks in one brood."It might be good to suggest that they were all infertile mutants, but the studies made by evolutionaries suggests otherwise.These two species don't seem to fit the rule of 'species'. Science has shown that they don't fit the bill. However none of the evolutionaries I've debated is willing to admit that schoolkids shoudn't be taught this as an example. How can it be an example of one thing (speciation) if it doesn't show it?

Robbie I am still researching this and having a very interesting time doing it. It seems there is a lot to know and a lot of research out there. But I will point out now that I’m pretty sure that two of the species do not interbreed and four of the species breed but do not produce fertile offspring. Non-fertile offspring is an evolutionary dead-end and once that bridge is crossed, you can not go back. Therefore the future of the two species would be forever separated.The definition of macro and micro evolution that evolutionist use is micro-evolution is within species and macro-evolution is above the level of species. You may not agree with that definition but I’m just passing on that that’s what they use as a definition.

I am an Orthodox Christian which in history and mode of worship is far removed from Baptists; yet I agree with your definition of three-in-one persons too.And what he's failed to grasp here is that science has made the statement "Darwin's Finch is an example of speciation" it's made it the textbook case. It's not a vague notion that they're putting forward, so an analogy that there's a vague notion in Christianity is poor, because it's no where near what science is claiming of this thing.Science says Darwin's Finch is proof of speciation in action.Science also examines the finches and shows some of the different species which science itself has categorised, to be acting in a manner not according with sciences statements.The analogy with the Trinity would only work if we said the Trinity is three-in-one persons, and then we add Mary to it and then also have the hide to still refer to it as a Trinity.And the funny thing is, taking Darwin's Finch out of the books won't disprove evolution. They'd be able to live without it. There might be some embarrassment at being wrong; but science has been before.The fact that people are still trying to argue that white is black, but still white is, I believe, at the very heart of the problem with many atheistic scientists; they bring their own personal baggage into the debate.*The Finch just doesn't fit the bill (or beak).:)*Herein is another thing, everyone brings their own personal histories into these things, we all have a priori beliefs. Only many scientists and their supporters seem to think that they've risen above such human norms. There is a dogged belief in their own convictions that is so close to dogma it's scary, and even here they don't believe their being dogmatic!

Hi RobbieI was able to find out that two of the finch species did not interbreed and four of the species produce infertile offspring. That makes them different species. That also makes it macro evolution if the definition of macro evolution is change above the species level.I read where a Great Dane was artificially inseminated with Chihuahua sperm and the offspring were aborted. If so, that makes them a different species since they can’t reproduce.
attacks
If I may say so, I'm glad to see such cordiality in this forum. I agree with montalban's saying that there are 12 species of finch rather than 1 or 2 because they are Darwin's finches. Maybe this is on purpose, more likely it is not. I want to point out that the speciation of the finches doesn't prove macro evolution, in the same way that the current difference between Chiuahuas and Great Danes don't prove it. As far as I know, the differences are due not to changes in information, but the elimination of information. That's how micro evolution works. (example - the peppered moth's went from mostly light color to dark because the light color genes were being eliminated) One particular group of finches grows bigger beaks because the genes for smaller beaks are being lost. (the genes that repress the growth of the beak) They aren't growing new beaks. So, as far as I know, its really a non issue in regards to proving or finding evidence for macro evolution.

That's fair enough. Like I said, I like the way you think and appear to be open-minded.

I hope you realize that I wouldn't use that as a debate in this forum. That is why I specified that observation was unscientific. That is also why I said that research facilities don't have a high death rate (and the nature of their experiments on animals is more risky) to show it is possible to keep animals alive under lees than ideal conditions. However, I had to go back and read the verse again to make sure I had it right. There were seven pairs of clean animals and two pairs of unclean animals, so two animals of the same kind would have had to die.

Hi PriscillaHave you thought about how much damage and turmoil would have been created if several meteors struck the earth. Or how much energy would have been released if a meteor hit the earth that was strong enough to break continents apart. I’d be surprised if anything survived that kind of disaster, much less a 75’ x 450’ ark. The first seismic wave would destroy the whole thing.Okay but research facilities are also in the habit of knowing a whole lot about the animals they keep. They also have modern medicine to treat sick animals. Do you think Noah would have know about every animal kind so that none would have died over the course of a year?Well dogs are mentioned in Exodus and foxes are mentioned in Judges in the Bible. From the flood to where foxes are talked about in Judges is about 1200 years. Are you saying there can be that much evolution in 1200 years?Moses talks of both horses and asses. That’s only about 800 years. Horses and asses are definitely different species.Why do we never find dinosaur and human fossils in the same layer? Dinosaur fossils are always found in older layers.That’s not exactly my question. There are a lot of animals that are only in South America. If 4200 years ago there was a flood that wiped out all life except the ark, and then say the South American sloth started the long trip to South America, why do we not find fossils of him along the way? I just used that on animal but I’m talking about all of them that a specific to different continents. I’m not sure what you are talking about but I’m interested if you will explain more.OkayMost of the PhD’s that work in the field say evolution is proven by the evidence.
attacks
Sorry Hank, I forgot to mention something you will probably find important. I believe that a sort of Pangea existed before the flood. I also believe that a meteor (or several meteors) struck the earth and this is what created the flood and the continents to break apart.Okay, now I will try to answer you in order: Research facilities do use bigger animals. Take for example those that use gorillas. These creatures need a huge amount of space to live in yet in a very spacious research facility one can be found existing in a 9’ x 9’ space. You are correct that if an unclean animal died it would illuminate its kind, but we would have to assume they all survived (by Devine Providence) which is unscientific. The only science I can offer you is that (monkey) research facilities are not in the habit of losing any of their animals since they are expensive to obtain. Wolves and foxes were not the same kind. Dogs however, were created by human domestication of one of these animals. Evolutionarily, cattle, oxen, sheep, and goats all came from the same descendant. However, I would allow for sheep and goats to be considered two kinds, but cattle and oxen are so close to each other (and since cow worship was very popular after the flood) I feel that they might have been very successful in breeding these.Now dinosaurs: once again, I believe they had access to humans (because of the single continent). In the geological column, we see various periods of mass extinctions. Evolutionists have come up with many explanations but none of them is sufficient in describing why only most and not all of the animals died. My theory is humans caused each mass extinction purposely or inadvertently. This would explain why not all the animals died. I have no doubt that the land bridge existed from Asia to North America. Because of this, I believe the animals were driven to South America (by God). I also believe that at least some of the Sunda shelf was above water and this is why the trip to Australia would not have been so difficult. I believe that after the flood in order to speed the drying process God put most of the water into the ice caps and these began melting which was the natural disaster (which wouldn’t have been recorded) that raised the sea level and cut off the Australian land bridge (at least). Just out of curiosity, how do you feel about the evolutionists’ theories on island inhabitation? I haven’t fallen back on those out of mere stubbornness, but if you really want scientific…(The “I said so” jibe was not targeted at you – it was targeted at the other person who keeps proclaiming to know science but usually responds with things that are wrong according to any science book.Questions are always logical, but proclaiming fiction as fact is not.)I hope I have given a little more logic to it all, but I welcome your questions. In my opinion, true proof is impossible to obtain until we get to heaven and ask God. But my beliefs are based on what I have observed and what I know of science. I am also not a scientist, but until a person has obtained his or her phD, I would never give them that title. I have know too many people with a Masters who had pursued the career simply because they became stuck in it and didn't care for it at all. You have to have a love to be a scientist.

The proposition that Maths is not a science was twofold, one was that it was not because it was simply a tool (and Maths can be studied by Arts students)This is patently silly. Otherwise English is ipso facto not an Arts subject but a tool, because even scientists use it as a tool!Secondly, your notion that it just must be observed is silly.SETI is a scientific search for ET. They have yet to observe him, but they're still looking. There's a whole field of speculative biology 'exobiology'.Go to http://www.science.uts.edu.au/maths/index.html which shows courses in "The Department of Mathematical Sciences is one of six Departments in the Faculty of Science"I do not dispute that maths is a tool used by science, anymore than English is a tool used by science too.When you studied this 'masters degree' did you do it as part of an Arts stream of studies?Because you're claiming there aren't any true definitions such as laws etc. But you saySo what about true definitions for things such as 'truth'? You seem to say that there's nothing now, but truths and untruths.

The Chihuahua can breed with other types of dogs which in turn can breed with the Great Dane.The difference between the Chihuahua and Great Dane aren't so great, because it's more of a physical size thing than anything else.Also, what's man's manipulation of dog types got to do with evolution?How is it 'natural selection' done with 'no purpose'?

Hi RobbieI was able to find out that two of the finch species did not interbreed and four of the species produce infertile offspring. That makes them different species. That also makes it macro evolution if the definition of macro evolution is change above the species level.I read where a Great Dane was artificially inseminated with Chihuahua sperm and the offspring were aborted. If so, that makes them a different species since they can’t reproduce.

Hey, Mr Jack. Welcome to the board. I see that you have met our resident small mind. So now Monty thinks that the definition of what is a science depends on the degree granted by some university with which he is familiar. And since most math majors earn B.S. degrees, that must mean that math is a science. But as you have pointed out, math is neither experimental nor empiracle. It is logical and "proof" is actually a meaningful word in mathematics. Math is, as you have said, a tool of science but it isn't science.You have probably noticed that monty is a bit slow. He seems to be a bit rigid and without any understanding of what science is or how it works. And, like any creationist, he misrepresents the data in order to support his opinion. Sadly, his opinion is based on ignorance and the conclusion that he wishes to reach.A case in point is his continuing discussion of Darwin's finches. You have probably noticed that he claims that "Darwin's finches" are able to interbreed and are therefore not good examples of speciation. But in fact, the claim that "Darwin's finches" are able to interbreed is deceptive. There are 13 or 14 distinguishable types of finches that have been called species by taxonomists. Monty claims that because some have been observed to interbreed, it is somehow a failure of evolutionary theory. He seems to be unable to grasp the idea that speciation is a gradual process that happens over thousands or hundreds of thousands of years. If a population is somehow separated into two sub-populations that are reproductively isolated, the process of divergence will begin. If unusual events rejoin these populations after insufficient time, they may be able to interbreed.Monty's big point is that two ground finches interbred. In our previous discussions I asked him several times if he had read "The Beak of the Finch." He failed to respond. Now he quotes the book. Is it possible that he is cutting and pasting my quotes of the book? Or is it possible that he read the book and quote mined it to support his conclusion. If he read the book he seems to have learned nothing.So Monty seems to have been impressed by the interbreeding of a Geospiza scandens (common cactus finch) with a G. fortis (medium ground finch). He says:Well, 'species' isn't a rule. It is a definition. A species is a population of interbreeding organisms. Except in one rare case, common cactus finches don't breed with medium ground finches. But is isn't a problem for evolutionary theory. In fact, it is expected. They are quite similar in appearance and DNA analysis has shown that they are genetically very close as well. Such incidents are to be expected of closely related species. In a time of stress that almost eradicated both species on this island, these two birds mated. Others of both species failed to do so for lack of a mate. They died without progeny. Did Monty really read the book?Of course not. It is a very clear example of speciation. Over time reproductively isolated populations diverge until they are no longer able to interbreed. However, if they should be rejoined before reproduction is impossible, they may produce viable offspring. What a beautiful example of the process of speciation.How can Monty insist on his ignorance? Darwin's finches are a beautiful example of speciation through natural selection. Closely related populations are still able to interbreed under unusual conditions, while more distantly related populations cannot interbreed.This has been explained to Monty before, but still he insists on showing his ignorance. Proof is for booze and mathematics. Darwin's finches are an example of speciation.Yet another example of Monty's intentional ignorance. It seems that Monty thinks that nature should somehow conform to "sciences [sic] statements." However, nature is what it is and our opinions can't change that. Science, i.e., naturalism, is only an attempt to describe nature. And that is what the definition of a species is. It isn't a rule.So for Monty, I'll detail Darwin's finches (or at least one version of the taxonomy) that he claims interbreed.Genus Geospiza........G. fulginosa - small ground finch........G. fortis - medium ground finch.......G. magnirostris - large ground finch......G. scandens - common cactus finch......G. conirostris - large cactus finch.....G. difficilis - sharp beaked finchGenus Camarhynchus.....C. parvulus - small tree finch.....C. psittacula - large tree finch....C. pauper - medium tree finchGenus Cactospiza...C. pallida - woodpecker finch..C. heliobates - mangrove finch (very rare - on a single island)Genus Platyspiza..P. crassirostris - vegetarian finchGenus Certhidea.C. olivacea - uplands warbler finch.C. fusca - lowlands warbler finchGenus Pinaroloxias.P. inornata - Coco's Island finchGenus TiarisT. obscura - dull colored grassquitIn fact, interbreeding has been observed only among some species of the genus Geospiza. The are very closely related and are distinguishable only by the size of their beak and their preferred food source. DNA analysis has confirmed the the observational classification of Geospize was correct. They are only recently diverged species.DNA analysis has shown that the genus Camarhynchus as well as the genus Cactospiza are much more closely related than the Geospize. And yet, no interbreeding of the 5 species in these genra has been observed.The only interbreeding that has been observed has been in the genus Geospize, which is not unexpected in evolutionary theory.Monty wants to make a word that attempts to describe a general observation into a "rule." It doesn't work that way.And Monty asks:Simple. It is called artificial selection. The difference is that artificial selection selects for propagation those charactaristics that are pleasing to mankind. Natural selection is the tendency for organisms that possess heritable characteristics that give an advantage to survive to reproduce a statistical advantage. It is sad that Monty doesn't see how man can be much more ruthless than nature is. The point is that creationists claim that dogs are a single kind. And yet, Great Danes and Chihuahuas are reproductively isolated. There has been a change in the alleles of these organisms that makes them separate species by you definition. They do not and cannot interbreed. Why are the not separate species? But Monty doesn't have a problem with a chihuahua breeding with a slightly larger dog, that breeds with a larger dog, and so on until it breeds with a Great Dane. And yet, he has a problem with similar, closely related birds that on rare occasion have been observed to interbreed. (it is called gene flow in evolutionary terms, by the way). An Monty claims that Darwin's finches interbreed, even though Camarhynchus pauper has never been observed to interbreed with Geospiza fortis. Even more telling is that attempts to interbreed Great Danes and Chihuahuas are aborted because they are not viable.Monty should pick a horse and ride it.

The Chihuahua can breed with other types of dogs which in turn can breed with the Great Dane.The difference between the Chihuahua and Great Dane aren't so great, because it's more of a physical size thing than anything else.Also, what's man's manipulation of dog types got to do with evolution?How is it 'natural selection' done with 'no purpose'?

Lurch obviously thinks that by saying it twice, it has more meaning. English is a tool too, but it is also a subject. They can be both. You are a tool.Lurch, you're one to talk, you've still not admitted you're massive mistake earlier when you didn't know the differences between nouns and adjectives. Welcome back Lurch. You also on another string made a pronouncement about the lack of Christian influence in modern American law-making; I've yet to see your response to me raising the issue of Torts Law as derived from the notion of 'love thy neighbour'. Now you leap forward from your darkened hole of ignorance.If I am slow, at least I'm not dishonest. And, I also understand what I am writing. You don't.viz...How many? 13 or 14? Earlier in another post you said possibly 8. Well done! You've proven the point. How can science make a declaration 'x' has happened when it can't even define it? Thank you for again showing your inability to understand the meaning of what you write.Of course it's not a problem. Science says 'x' should happen, and when it doesn't they say...Closely related species. This is another shift of the goal posts. When they teach speciation to kids they don't say that. They say that the Finches are a good example of speciation because they are clearly defined species. Now you're blurring it.First they are a prime example of distinct species, then they're not because they're so close that they can interbreed.What a joke. It is supposed to be science observing nature, then making up statements about nature. Now you're actually suggesting that science isn't doing that at all. That they're just making pronouncements and that nature doesn't seem to be fitting the idea. Before you said that they were a beautiful example of the idea of speciation. Now you're tacitly admitting the opposite, that they don't conform to science's description. Which is it?Tell me with regard to science and maths... have you ever heard of theoretical physics? You, the most dishonest of posters tries desperately to re-work definitions. You ignored speculative biology - exobiology. You ignored speculative science as used by SETI. For you all these can't be science. And regardless of how many people actually go and learn mathematical science, you just won't admit it. All these things are going on, but you don't believe it because it doesn't fit to your rule 'maths is not a science'.mathn : a science (or group of related sciences) dealing with the logic of quantity and shape and arrangement [syn: mathematics, maths]http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=mathPronunciation: "math-'ma-tiks, "ma-th&-Function: noun plural but usually singular in constructionDate: 15811 : the science of numbers and their operations, interrelations, combinations, generalizations, and abstractions and of space configurations and their structure, measurement, transformations, and generalizationshttp://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionar...va=mathematicsmathematics > noun (cognition) Meaning:A science (or group of related sciences) dealing with the logic of quantity and shape and arrangement.http://www.hyperdic.net/dic/m/mathematics.shtmlLurch: you're just not very good when it comes to the meanings of words.

Hey, Mr Jack. Welcome to the board. I see that you have met our resident small mind. So now Monty thinks that the definition of what is a science depends on the degree granted by some university with which he is familiar. And since most math majors earn B.S. degrees, that must mean that math is a science. But as you have pointed out, math is neither experimental nor empiracle. It is logical and "proof" is actually a meaningful word in mathematics. Math is, as you have said, a tool of science but it isn't science.You have probably noticed that monty is a bit slow. He seems to be a bit rigid and without any understanding of what science is or how it works. And, like any creationist, he misrepresents the data in order to support his opinion. Sadly, his opinion is based on ignorance and the conclusion that he wishes to reach.A case in point is his continuing discussion of Darwin's finches. You have probably noticed that he claims that "Darwin's finches" are able to interbreed and are therefore not good examples of speciation. But in fact, the claim that "Darwin's finches" are able to interbreed is deceptive. There are 13 or 14 distinguishable types of finches that have been called species by taxonomists. Monty claims that because some have been observed to interbreed, it is somehow a failure of evolutionary theory. He seems to be unable to grasp the idea that speciation is a gradual process that happens over thousands or hundreds of thousands of years. If a population is somehow separated into two sub-populations that are reproductively isolated, the process of divergence will begin. If unusual events rejoin these populations after insufficient time, they may be able to interbreed.Monty's big point is that two ground finches interbred. In our previous discussions I asked him several times if he had read "The Beak of the Finch." He failed to respond. Now he quotes the book. Is it possible that he is cutting and pasting my quotes of the book? Or is it possible that he read the book and quote mined it to support his conclusion. If he read the book he seems to have learned nothing.So Monty seems to have been impressed by the interbreeding of a Geospiza scandens (common cactus finch) with a G. fortis (medium ground finch). He says:Well, 'species' isn't a rule. It is a definition. A species is a population of interbreeding organisms. Except in one rare case, common cactus finches don't breed with medium ground finches. But is isn't a problem for evolutionary theory. In fact, it is expected. They are quite similar in appearance and DNA analysis has shown that they are genetically very close as well. Such incidents are to be expected of closely related species. In a time of stress that almost eradicated both species on this island, these two birds mated. Others of both species failed to do so for lack of a mate. They died without progeny. Did Monty really read the book?Of course not. It is a very clear example of speciation. Over time reproductively isolated populations diverge until they are no longer able to interbreed. However, if they should be rejoined before reproduction is impossible, they may produce viable offspring. What a beautiful example of the process of speciation.How can Monty insist on his ignorance? Darwin's finches are a beautiful example of speciation through natural selection. Closely related populations are still able to interbreed under unusual conditions, while more distantly related populations cannot interbreed.This has been explained to Monty before, but still he insists on showing his ignorance. Proof is for booze and mathematics. Darwin's finches are an example of speciation.Yet another example of Monty's intentional ignorance. It seems that Monty thinks that nature should somehow conform to "sciences [sic] statements." However, nature is what it is and our opinions can't change that. Science, i.e., naturalism, is only an attempt to describe nature. And that is what the definition of a species is. It isn't a rule.So for Monty, I'll detail Darwin's finches (or at least one version of the taxonomy) that he claims interbreed.Genus Geospiza........G. fulginosa - small ground finch........G. fortis - medium ground finch.......G. magnirostris - large ground finch......G. scandens - common cactus finch......G. conirostris - large cactus finch.....G. difficilis - sharp beaked finchGenus Camarhynchus.....C. parvulus - small tree finch.....C. psittacula - large tree finch....C. pauper - medium tree finchGenus Cactospiza...C. pallida - woodpecker finch..C. heliobates - mangrove finch (very rare - on a single island)Genus Platyspiza..P. crassirostris - vegetarian finchGenus Certhidea.C. olivacea - uplands warbler finch.C. fusca - lowlands warbler finchGenus Pinaroloxias.P. inornata - Coco's Island finchGenus TiarisT. obscura - dull colored grassquitIn fact, interbreeding has been observed only among some species of the genus Geospiza.

Neither of which are science. You are confusing 'scientific' and 'science'. You'll also note that your restatement of what I said is wrong, I said science is BASED on observation and experiment. There is NO observation OR experiment in mathematics.No, I did it as part of the maths department. I ended up with an MMath degree, i.e., a Master of Mathematics.Ah I see - you can't read. Go back, read what I actually wrote and try again. I didn't say there aren't any true definitions, I said that Law has no proper definition in Science.

The proposition that Maths is not a science was twofold, one was that it was not because it was simply a tool (and Maths can be studied by Arts students)This is patently silly. Otherwise English is ipso facto not an Arts subject but a tool, because even scientists use it as a tool!Secondly, your notion that it just must be observed is silly.SETI is a scientific search for ET. They have yet to observe him, but they're still looking. There's a whole field of speculative biology 'exobiology'.Go to http://www.science.uts.edu.au/maths/index.html which shows courses in "The Department of Mathematical Sciences is one of six Departments in the Faculty of Science"I do not dispute that maths is a tool used by science, anymore than English is a tool used by science too.When you studied this 'masters degree' did you do it as part of an Arts stream of studies?Because you're claiming there aren't any true definitions such as laws etc. But you saySo what about true definitions for things such as 'truth'? You seem to say that there's nothing now, but truths and untruths.

I can observe there is one orange.Maths is about experimentation, there are whole fields out there such as fractals etc."Welcome to  Experimental Mathematics , a journal devoted to  experimental aspects of mathematics research.

It is interesting that this has come up. On another baord, a creationist that has a BS in electronics engineering claimed that he is a "scientist" because he has a bachelor's of SCIENCE, and that therefore, his opinions on evolution should carry as much weight as any other (real) scientist.They do what they have to to convinve themselves (and others) that their opinions actually have merit.

If a population is somehow separated into two sub-populations that are reproductively isolated, the process of divergence will begin. If unusual events rejoin these populations after insufficient time, they may be able to interbreed.Monty's big point is that two ground finches interbred. In our previous discussions I asked him several times if he had read "The Beak of the Finch." He failed to respond. Now he quotes the book. Is it possible that he is cutting and pasting my quotes of the book? Or is it possible that he read the book and quote mined it to support his conclusion. If he read the book he seems to have learned nothing.So Monty seems to have been impressed by the interbreeding of a Geospiza scandens (common cactus finch) with a G. fortis (medium ground finch). He says:Well, 'species' isn't a rule. It is a definition. A species is a population of interbreeding organisms. Except in one rare case, common cactus finches don't breed with medium ground finches. But is isn't a problem for evolutionary theory. In fact, it is expected. They are quite similar in appearance and DNA analysis has shown that they are genetically very close as well. Such incidents are to be expected of closely related species. In a time of stress that almost eradicated both species on this island, these two birds mated. Others of both species failed to do so for lack of a mate. They died without progeny. Did Monty really read the book?Of course not. It is a very clear example of speciation. Over time reproductively isolated populations diverge until they are no longer able to interbreed. However, if they should be rejoined before reproduction is impossible, they may produce viable offspring. What a beautiful example of the process of speciation.How can Monty insist on his ignorance? Darwin's finches are a beautiful example of speciation through natural selection. Closely related populations are still able to interbreed under unusual conditions, while more distantly related populations cannot interbreed.This has been explained to Monty before, but still he insists on showing his ignorance. Proof is for booze and mathematics. Darwin's finches are an example of speciation.Yet another example of Monty's intentional ignorance. It seems that Monty thinks that nature should somehow conform to "sciences [sic] statements." However, nature is what it is and our opinions can't change that. Science, i.e., naturalism, is only an attempt to describe nature. And that is what the definition of a species is. It isn't a rule.So for Monty, I'll detail Darwin's finches (or at least one version of the taxonomy) that he claims interbreed.Genus Geospiza........G. fulginosa - small ground finch........G. fortis - medium ground finch.......G. magnirostris - large ground finch......G. scandens - common cactus finch......G. conirostris - large cactus finch.....G. difficilis - sharp beaked finchGenus Camarhynchus.....C. parvulus - small tree finch.....C. psittacula - large tree finch....C. pauper - medium tree finchGenus Cactospiza...C. pallida - woodpecker finch..C. heliobates - mangrove finch (very rare - on a single island)Genus Platyspiza..P. crassirostris - vegetarian finchGenus Certhidea.C. olivacea - uplands warbler finch.C. fusca - lowlands warbler finchGenus Pinaroloxias.P. inornata - Coco's Island finchGenus TiarisT. obscura - dull colored grassquitIn fact, interbreeding has been observed only among some species of the genus Geospiza. The are very closely related and are distinguishable only by the size of their beak and their preferred food source. DNA analysis has confirmed the the observational classification of Geospize was correct. They are only recently diverged species.DNA analysis has shown that the genus Camarhynchus as well as the genus Cactospiza are much more closely related than the Geospize. And yet, no interbreeding of the 5 species in these genra has been observed.The only interbreeding that has been observed has been in the genus Geospize, which is not unexpected in evolutionary theory.Monty wants to make a word that attempts to describe a general observation into a "rule." It doesn't work that way.And Monty asks:Simple. It is called artificial selection. The difference is that artificial selection selects for propagation those charactaristics that are pleasing to mankind. Natural selection is the tendency for organisms that possess heritable characteristics that give an advantage to survive to reproduce a statistical advantage. It is sad that Monty doesn't see how man can be much more ruthless than nature is. The point is that creationists claim that dogs are a single kind. And yet, Great Danes and Chihuahuas are reproductively isolated. There has been a change in the alleles of these organisms that makes them separate species by you definition. They do not and cannot interbreed. Why are the not separate species? But Monty doesn't have a problem with a chihuahua breeding with a slightly larger dog, that breeds with a larger dog, and so on until it breeds with a Great Dane. And yet, he has a problem with similar, closely related birds that on rare occasion have been observed to interbreed. (it is called gene flow in evolutionary terms, by the way). An Monty claims that Darwin's finches interbreed, even though Camarhynchus pauper has never been observed to interbreed with Geospiza fortis. Even more telling is that attempts to interbreed Great Danes and Chihuahuas are aborted because they are not viable.Monty should pick a horse and ride it.

Hello. That is interesting. My own perception of macro-evolution was basically increase in information (presumably from mutation although Rationalist's 'Roman Arch' mechanism could also be included at later stages) since you need that to account for progressive evolution from whatever the first replicating thing was. I suppose I'll have to call that something else now. Anyhow, the point is that, to my knowledge, what the finches, and more clearly - the Chihuahua and Great Dane are demonstrating is loss of information through change in gene frequency or elimantion of some genes. (ie - genes for smaller beaks, or genes for smaller dogs) Since this kind of evolution has indeed created new species of dog and finch according to the defintions I've seen, it could be said that macro-evolution was proved (if it is change above species level). However, showing that loss of information can create new species can't prove the progressive evolution from the first self-replicator, since that requires increase of information.

Hi RobbieI was able to find out that two of the finch species did not interbreed and four of the species produce infertile offspring. That makes them different species. That also makes it macro evolution if the definition of macro evolution is change above the species level.I read where a Great Dane was artificially inseminated with Chihuahua sperm and the offspring were aborted. If so, that makes them a different species since they can’t reproduce.

It is interesting that this has come up. On another baord, a creationist that has a BS in electronics engineering claimed that he is a "scientist" because he has a bachelor's of SCIENCE, and that therefore, his opinions on evolution should carry as much weight as any other (real) scientist.They do what they have to to convinve themselves (and others) that their opinions actually have merit.

A circle is not a sphere. The earth looks like a circle from where your standing, not a square. Pancakes are a circle. They're also flat.The Bible also says that God stopped the sun in the sky. It doesn't say he stopped the earth from rotating. That would have been the perfect opportunity to point out that the earth was a sphere. In fact that's one of the verses that the church used to prosecute Galelao.

Even now, I get the inkling that you still want to drag on with it, and I'm quite happy to oblige. More fool you.Sure, I'm happy to go over it again, as you're still so gutless as not to admit you're wrong. The mistake itself was not 'massive' but your inability to admit you were wrong, to argue heatedly for day after day after day, ignoring all evidence, was what made it massive. This coming from a person who criticised my very first post on this forum, because I didn't spell 'speciation' correctly. You can dish it out, but you can't take it; instead of admitting an error, you were prepared to argue and argue and argue that you were right, shall I re-list all of the web citations I used (and you used how many? A number less than one I recall).I said yes, it is an adjective, it is also a noun. It depends on where it is used in a sentence.

I believe you are correct about loss of information. But my understanding is that that applies to between species evolution. Once they become separate species, then there is increase in information, relative to other species. However I’m not a evolutionary scientist and I may not understand the process correctly. I’ll put the question to the experts and let you know what I find out. I’m interested also.

In part you are correct. A more accurate sentence would have been Most educated people (including those in the Church) believed that the earth was spherical."Russell says the flat earth mythology flourished most between 1870 and 1920, and had to do with the ideological setting created by struggles over evolution. He says the flat-earth myth was an ideal way to dismiss the ideas of a religious past in the name of modern science."http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c034.htmlMost educated people before the Reformation were in the Church, or had been educated by the Church.Thales of Miletus (http://www.phys.virginia.edu/classes...es/thales.html) is one educated person who, also being probably Greek (Miletus then a city linked to Greece) believed in a flat-earth.Thales of Miletus  (c. 585 BCE): Eclipses and Stellar Studies Our sources for all early Greek astronomy are scant, none more so than for Thales, supposedly the first of the philosophers. Various inventions and discoveries are attributed to him, most famous of which is his prediction of an eclipse of 585 (Hdt. 1.74). Modern scholars are fairly sure he was able to do this by consulting known Babylonian eclipse and lunar observations going back about 150 years, long enough to notice that eclipses recur after about 18 years[6]. His activities also seem to have included star-observations and trigonometry, which he is credited with having founded, but the details of his theories are either lost or obscured by later legends about this early thinker who left no written record. He seems to have  conceived of earth as flat and water-borne, and to have postulated that there must have been some first substance out of which the world arose, which he guesses is water (Aristot. Met. 983b 6)[7]. http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/GreekSc...Astronomy.htmlThe above site also lists:Anaximines of Miletus  (c. 525 BCE)Though these blokes were in a minority, I could use their mistakes to stigmatise all Greek science as you are trying to do with Christianity.And what about in the Christian era?"LactantiusThe earliest of these flat-Earth promoters was the African Lactantius (AD 245?325), a professional rhetorician who converted to Christianity mid-life.He rejected all the Greek philosophers, and in doing so also rejected a spherical Earth. His views were considered heresy by the Church Fathers and his work was ignored until the Renaissance (at which time some humanists revived his writings as a model of good Latin, and of course, his flat Earth view also was revived).http://www.christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c034.htmlMore importantly"In 1834, the anti-Christian Letronne falsely claimed that most of the Church Fathers, including Augustine, Ambrose and Basil, held to a flat Earth. His work has been repeatedly cited as "reputable" ever since." (Ibid)Obviously Lurch you have proved this point. Both this source, and the first one I cited suggest that the notion that the Church believed in a flat earth stems from the novel "Rip Van Winkle" hardly a reliable source for facts, but certainly a good source for fiction. That you would spout fiction as fact, traced back to this seminal work is very interesting. It seems you're prepared to even believe a work of fiction, so long as it attacks the Church.Although another site suggests that the moronic notion that the Church was pro-flat earth stems elsewhere..."The myth that Christians in the Middle Ages thought the world was flat was given a massive boost by Andrew Dickson White's weighty tome The Warfare of Science with Theology. This book has become something of a running joke among historians of science and it is dutifully mentioned as a prime example of misinformation in the preface of most modern works on science and religion. The flat Earth is discussed in chapter 2 and one can almost sense White's confusion that hardly any of the sources support his hypothesis that Christians widely believed in it. He finds himself grudgingly admitting that Clement, Origen, Ambrose, Augustine, Isodore, Albertus Magnus and Aquinas all accepted the Earth was a globe - in other words none of the great doctors of the church had considered the matter in doubt. Although an analysis of what White actually says suggests he was aware that the flat Earth was largely a myth, he certainly gives an impression of ignorant Christians suppressing rational knowledge of its real shape."http://www.bede.org.uk/flatearth.htmWhilst Jeffrey Burton Russell (quoted indirectly earlier) (at http://id-www.ucsb.edu/fscf/library/...FlatEarth.html) suggests other culprits might also be at fault.All are however united in saying that this myth of yours came about during the crisis caused by the rise of evolution. Evolutionaries were more than happy to portray the Church as being backward; and if a lie did this type of smear, then so be it.If you want, we can also discuss the same issue of Church/science knowledge, with focus on geocentric theories, or the order of creation or whatever, as for you Lurch, I have plenty of time.

Poking fun at someone's blind faith in the Church fathers is blasphemy? Do you worship God, or a bureaucracy?I have nothing more to add about Darwin's finches - everyone has already pretty much said everything possible. You just don't want to listen. Everyone has tried to explain why the finches are a great example of speciation in action. But you insist on playing games with definitions. You want "species" to be an "either/or" concept and try to shoe-horn reality into these igid definitions, but ignore the fact that there are varying degrees of "species-hood", and this is exactly what evolution would lead one to expect. Your debating tactics remind me of lawyers' arguments over semantics. This is acceptable in the law court, where it is legitimate to ask what the law actually says as well as what the facts of the case are, but in a scientific argument it just looks silly.I have no desire to debate Darwin's finches. My main purpose was to add some information on the Isaiah topic. But since you can't let it go, I will suggest you take the time to try to understand what it is that everyone else is trying to explain to you about this topic. You are not facing their actual arguments.Call me Dishonestus maritimus.I am a PhD student in mathematics. Circular and spherical are not the same thing. In plain English, circular refers to flat two dimensional shapes. Three dimensional shapes are referred to as spherical. I have never heard of a sphere refererred to as circular. The links I supplied would seem to show that the authors of Isaiah made a similar distinction.And mathematics is a science only in the sense that any specialized body of knowledge and skills can be called a science, like wood carving, plumbing, history, and the like. But mathematics in not a science in the same sense as physics, chemistry, or biology. It simply does not deal with the empirical world in any direct way - it is the applications of the natural scientists that make use of mathematics - and anything that is logically proven in mathematics is 100% true and will never, ever be considered to be false, unlike a scientific theory.It was not my intention to enter into the debate. I was merely supplying information for you and your opponents to use in the debate.Let me add that your tone in your posting surprises me. You didn't used to respond with such bitterness. Evidently my presence is making you unhappy - I said what I wanted to say and I will bow out.

I'm not even trying to get you to apologise (you probably don't feel the need to). But you are not showing any respect for other people's belief when you misuse the 'J' word.The fact that you don't even realise this is again an interesting point. I am concerned with what I say.No, you are not facing my argument. You are saying that Darwin's Finch is both a perfect example of one thing, and then immediately saying that you can't clearly define species to determine that Darwin's Finch is a perfect example of speciation.That simple proposition is what I am concerned with.That you are pointing out that I am working an argument on the definitions of words is in fact my specialty. I am an Arts grad. I have also done a PostGrad Cert in TESOL. I have done some legal studies, (admittedly I have not continued with them for the time being). I work in a legal environment and have done research for lawyers. I know the importance of meanings of words.For you to argue that there's evidence that proves something but the evidence is vague is a nonsense.

Poking fun at someone's blind faith in the Church fathers is blasphemy? Do you worship God, or a bureaucracy?I have nothing more to add about Darwin's finches - everyone has already pretty much said everything possible. You just don't want to listen. Everyone has tried to explain why the finches are a great example of speciation in action. But you insist on playing games with definitions. You want "species" to be an "either/or" concept and try to shoe-horn reality into these igid definitions, but ignore the fact that there are varying degrees of "species-hood", and this is exactly what evolution would lead one to expect. Your debating tactics remind me of lawyers' arguments over semantics. This is acceptable in the law court, where it is legitimate to ask what the law actually says as well as what the facts of the case are, but in a scientific argument it just looks silly.I have no desire to debate Darwin's finches. My main purpose was to add some information on the Isaiah topic. But since you can't let it go, I will suggest you take the time to try to understand what it is that everyone else is trying to explain to you about this topic. You are not facing their actual arguments.Call me Dishonestus maritimus.I am a PhD student in mathematics. Circular and spherical are not the same thing. In plain English, circular refers to flat two dimensional shapes. Three dimensional shapes are referred to as spherical. I have never heard of a sphere refererred to as circular. The links I supplied would seem to show that the authors of Isaiah made a similar distinction.And mathematics is a science only in the sense that any specialized body of knowledge and skills can be called a science, like wood carving, plumbing, history, and the like. But mathematics in not a science in the same sense as physics, chemistry, or biology. It simply does not deal with the empirical world in any direct way - it is the applications of the natural scientists that make use of mathematics - and anything that is logically proven in mathematics is 100% true and will never, ever be considered to be false, unlike a scientific theory.It was not my intention to enter into the debate. I was merely supplying information for you and your opponents to use in the debate.Let me add that your tone in your posting surprises me. You didn't used to respond with such bitterness. Evidently my presence is making you unhappy - I said what I wanted to say and I will bow out.

You're a bit slow, aren't you, monty. Way back at the beginning of the finch discussion I mentioned that some taxonomists had claimed that the Warbler finch (Certhidea olivacea) comprised between 2 and 8 species. Now for some reason it has become a claim that there are 8 species of Darwin's finches. And even though these taxanomists may have valid reasons for their clasifications (habitat or isolated to a particular island), DNA analysis doesn't support this view. All samples of Warbler finch subjected to DNA analysis are indistinguishable from each other by that means. However, Warbler finches are easily distinguished from the other finches by habitat, physiology and by DNA analysis. (that's one)The Vegetarian Finch (Platyspiza Crassirostris) is also distinguishable from all other finches by habitat, physiology and by DNA analysis. (that's two)These two species (which both also comprise a genus) are the closest to the ancestral stock that first inhabited the islands.The Coco's Island finch (Pinaroloxias inornata) is also the only species in that genus. It is reproductively isolated because it is not found on any of the Galapagos Islands, but rather on Coco's Island. While it more closely resembles the Warbler finch, DNA analysis places its diversification at the base of the diversification of the tree finches and ground finches. It is most closely related to the tree finches. (that's 3)The tree finches are commonly divided into 5 species on the basis of physiology and habitat. The genus Camarhynchus has two species, the Woodpecker finch (C. pallida) and the Mangrove finch (C. heliobates), which diverged early. The Mangrove finch is so rare that DNA analysis has never been done. But it is reproductively isolated by habitat and recognizable by morphology. (that's 4)The woodpecker finch has a unique nich, as is indicated by it's name. Again, morphology and habitat make it recognizable. (that's 5)To this point, none of these species of Darwin's finch has been observed to interbreed with any other as far as I know.The other Tree finches are all of the same genus. DNA analysis shows that they are more closely related to each other than are the next group, the ground finches. And yet, I don't know of any examples of interbreeding among the Tree finches. They are morphologically distinguishable only by size. They are the small (Camarhynchus parvulus), medium (C. pauper), and large (C. psittacula) finches. As I mentioned, DNA analysis indicates the Coco's Island finch diverged prior to the divergence of various tree finches. But in these two genra, the species are reproductively isolated. (that's 6, 7, and 8)And that brings us to the Ground finches. These are all grouped into a single genus (Geospiza) and as a group, seem to be less closely related than the tree finches, and yet, examples of hybridization, rare thought they are, occur most frequently between species in this genus. The various species are distinguished by size or habitat. They are the Sharp beaked finch (G. difficilis), the Common cactus finch (G. scandens), and the Large cactus finch (G. conirostris), the Large ground finch (G. magnirostris), Medium ground finch (G. fortis), and the Small ground finch (G. fuliginosa). These birds are distinguished by habitat as well as size. (that's 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14)These birds are an excellent example of diversification that results in speciation. The case is quite as is expected by evolutionary theory. I have asked before and not received an answer. But I'll ask again. How is it that occasional and unusual intertreeding of various species within a single, closely related genus somehow disproves evolutionary theory. This is not unexpected.And, of course, monty's claim that "Darwin's finches interbreed" is deceptive. I have explained it to him on more than one occasion. All observed interbreeding has occurred between two or three species of a single genus under very unusual circumstances.And, of course, there is the fact that the word "evolutionary" is an adjective, and no amount of insult or wishful thinking will change that. Even if "evolutionary" is used in the title of a book, it is still an adjective.It is sometimes difficult to deal with the semi-literate high school drop outs.

I am concerned with what I say.No, you are not facing my argument.

No. You are saying that incorrectly. But that is to be expected from someone who has difficulty understanding English as you see to have. A book title is a proper noun. That does not make the words in that title nouns. It what you claim is true, then "on", "the", and "of" are all nouns because they are words in the title of a book, "On the Origin of Species."But you are not using the word as a proper noun. You are merely using an adjective in a situation that requires a noun.And how is it not moronically intransient to insist that an adjective becomes a noun, a proper noun at that, because it is used in the title of a book. Really. Perhaps a little study of functional grammar might help you to comprehend your gross and stupid error."to" and "a" are not nouns. The words in a title do not become nouns by their use in that title. The whole title is the proper noun. You don't seem to understand what a proper noun is. Look into it. Evolutionary is an adjective as your little golden dictionary states. It is still an adjective even though Futuyma used it in the title of his book. It is the whole title, "Evolutionary Theory," that is the proper noun, not the whole title.No wonder you have such a hard time understanding English.And isn't if funny that you think that a group of related and only recently divergent birds, some of which are distinguishable by their morphology, habitat, and DNA analysis, and others that fall into groups among which rare examples of interbreeding between species within the group have been observed are not examples of the process of speciation. They are striking examples of speciation showing insipient species.

The name of a book, the title, is a name; therefore a noun.Just like "The Great Sandy Desert" or the "Grand Canyon". Grand by itself functions as an adjective. Grand in Grand Canyon is part of the name. Names of things are nouns!You are separating the components, when together they function as a noun. There's a king of England called Richard the Lion-heart. That is his name, one of them. Lion-heart also is a describer. We use these in surnames all the time.If you had a son, and I gave him a book called "The Little Red Car" about a little red car. And you asked me what was the name of the book I gave him... I wouldn't say the name of the book was "Car" as it is by itself a noun. The whole thing is the name "The Little Red Car" just like "Dances with Wolves" was the name of a character in a film. It might be about a little red car (in this case they are adjectives). It is easier to see it in this Lakota name because they gave names that reflected a description of the person. We have in the west lost that connexion with personal names, but each name of someone means something, such as Barry means spear-bearer. Therefore by your logic Barry is not a name, but an adjective, because it describes someone.Mary might mean 'full of grace' for all I know, but just because it is a describer, an adjective in it's root form, it has become a noun as its use as a name of someone. Or should we revert most Christian names to the status of adjectives?Your own user-name Lurch could be said to be an adjective. To 'lurch' forward. But hey, it's being used by you as a noun!

No. You are saying that incorrectly. But that is to be expected from someone who has difficulty understanding English as you see to have. A book title is a proper noun. That does not make the words in that title nouns. It what you claim is true, then "on", "the", and "of" are all nouns because they are words in the title of a book, "On the Origin of Species."But you are not using the word as a proper noun. You are merely using an adjective in a situation that requires a noun.And how is it not moronically intransient to insist that an adjective becomes a noun, a proper noun at that, because it is used in the title of a book. Really. Perhaps a little study of functional grammar might help you to comprehend your gross and stupid error."to" and "a" are not nouns. The words in a title do not become nouns by their use in that title. The whole title is the proper noun. You don't seem to understand what a proper noun is. Look into it. Evolutionary is an adjective as your little golden dictionary states. It is still an adjective even though Futuyma used it in the title of his book. It is the whole title, "Evolutionary Theory," that is the proper noun, not the whole title.No wonder you have such a hard time understanding English.And isn't if funny that you think that a group of related and only recently divergent birds, some of which are distinguishable by their morphology, habitat, and DNA analysis, and others that fall into groups among which rare examples of interbreeding between species within the group have been observed are not examples of the process of speciation. They are striking examples of speciation showing insipient species.

Monty, it is obvious that you wish to use words unconventionally but then blame others for not accepting your unconventional, grammatically incorrect use. I won't lose any sleep over it but don't shift blame to others who do not accept your idiosyncratic rules.You then try to rationalise your position by saying that you use "evolutionaries", not "evolutionary". Is "evolutionaries" one of those peculiar plurals which has no singular form? Otherwise one could quite reasonable assume that the singular form is "evolutionary".

The name of a book, the title, is a name; therefore a noun.Just like "The Great Sandy Desert" or the "Grand Canyon". Grand by itself functions as an adjective. Grand in Grand Canyon is part of the name. Names of things are nouns!You are separating the components, when together they function as a noun. There's a king of England called Richard the Lion-heart. That is his name, one of them. Lion-heart also is a describer. We use these in surnames all the time.If you had a son, and I gave him a book called "The Little Red Car" about a little red car. And you asked me what was the name of the book I gave him... I wouldn't say the name of the book was "Car" as it is by itself a noun. The whole thing is the name "The Little Red Car" just like "Dances with Wolves" was the name of a character in a film. It might be about a little red car (in this case they are adjectives). It is easier to see it in this Lakota name because they gave names that reflected a description of the person. We have in the west lost that connexion with personal names, but each name of someone means something, such as Barry means spear-bearer. Therefore by your logic Barry is not a name, but an adjective, because it describes someone.Mary might mean 'full of grace' for all I know, but just because it is a describer, an adjective in it's root form, it has become a noun as its use as a name of someone.

It's good of you to be dishonest about that too by not mentioning it. It's because you and Lurch et al were time wasting because Lurch made a serious mistake and hadn't the guts to admit it - viz the difference between a noun and an adjective.Did you pull him into line? No, of course you didn't.It's nice that you too are trying to pretend to be interested in serious debate, but your ommissions are glaring.And what of Hank. Hank makes attacks on Parcum and can't stand the same. Do you comment on that? No of course not.

Your selective account of things can only come unstuck.

Montalban,I will just comment on my post and your reply to it.If you consider the use of the word "jeez" to be blasphemous, then what can I say? You are just going to have to live with it. Although I feel that people should try to take into consideration the feelings of others, there is a limit to this. Most people, I would reckon even many Christians, would consider this to be too inconsequential.My comment on the use of certain Hebrew words in Isaiah was meant to add information to a conversation that was going on.I'm sorry if my crack about the Church fathers was taken amiss. You do seem to rely a lot on authority for your religious beliefs, and that was merely meant to be "teasing", not an outright attempt to anger you.Finally, I will apologize about the crack about you and Darwin's finches. That crack was wholly gratuitous, and for that I am sorry if you feel insulted by it. I will only offer, as a way of an excuse, that you, too, fall very easily into the "flame wars" that go on in your threads. Yes, I know sometimes other people attack without provacation, but when you so readily respond to insults with more insults people assume that you're enjoying this sort of exchange.

You've moved position again.Initially you were arguing about the word evolutionary when I was using the word evolutionaries.Then you said that its always acts as an adjective (even if in a title; see quote from you below re: post98). Now you're saying that it can be a noun if it's in a title. Which is what I was saying - context changes the word. You need to see how it functions in the context.How dishonest. This is the first time you’ve agreed on this point.You’ve said Post 303 on this thread So, even when it’s functioning as a title, you said its not a noun. But now you’re arguing that together with other words it can be.However, now you’ve changed your mind and concede, finally that as a book title it can be a noun. Thus, what if the book was just called “Evolutionary” it would be a noun! It would be the name of the book!Good, again. Then if the book title is “Evolutionary” than evolutionary can be a noun. I never claimed anything more than in the context it can be used as a noun. There’s a famous poem called “If” by Kippling. That in it’s context is a noun. End of story, you’d think.But hang-on that was never the reason you started this debate in the first place, now was it…I didn’t use ‘evolutionary’ improperly. I called you dudes ‘evolutionaries’. I said it was a collective noun, a name I had coined.[QUOTE=lurch]You made a mistake and you are unable to admit it. Please take some time to study English grammar if you are going to discuss it. You are quite confused about parts of speach.(sic)You are correct about lurch. It was a bad example. Show me where I misused evolutionary. You can’t. You haven’t so far.If you can show me where I misused the word evolutionary, which is the whole reason you brought up this debate you’d have a case. You’ve argued against me for months on this issue without presenting the evidence that I misused it.You argued that it could never act as a noun anyway. You argued that it was always an adjective, no matter where. Now you admit that as part of a book title it can be a noun.It’s apparent that you’re still not willing to put up with the evidence.Post80 ofHow does a new species come about? Was when you first raised this obejction.I had said You repeated it again post 85This despite the fact I was using the word evolutionaries.Where was I using it as a noun (even though I could have?).Post 95Post98No, it doesn’t modify the word Theory. Now you say it is a noun because it’s part of a book, but not then, you said it still acted as an adjective….modifying a noun.I repliedAnd it doesn’t, as part of the title, it’s part of the title.This is what you argued all along. That you would try to subtly modify it now is typically dishonest of you. You said that even as part of the title, it’s modifying the noun Theory, that it’s still acting as an adjective. It isn’t.

Montalban,I will just comment on my post and your reply to it.If you consider the use of the word "jeez" to be blasphemous, then what can I say? You are just going to have to live with it. Although I feel that people should try to take into consideration the feelings of others, there is a limit to this. Most people, I would reckon even many Christians, would consider this to be too inconsequential.My comment on the use of certain Hebrew words in Isaiah was meant to add information to a conversation that was going on.I'm sorry if my crack about the Church fathers was taken amiss. You do seem to rely a lot on authority for your religious beliefs, and that was merely meant to be "teasing", not an outright attempt to anger you.Finally, I will apologize about the crack about you and Darwin's finches. That crack was wholly gratuitous, and for that I am sorry if you feel insulted by it. I will only offer, as a way of an excuse, that you, too, fall very easily into the "flame wars" that go on in your threads. Yes, I know sometimes other people attack without provacation, but when you so readily respond to insults with more insults people assume that you're enjoying this sort of exchange. At any rate, I am sorry if that very last comment was insulting.

Montalban to try and get back on the subject, would you say this is a true statement?Although people disagree on the exact definition of a species, everyone agrees that if individuals can not interbreed, or if the result of breeding produces infertile offspring, then they are different species.If not, what would you change about that statement?

No I don't think I'm so important that you should have noticed. However, if you're going to comment that I've moved on entirely, then you should check to see that you have.That you won't even concede now that I said I was moving to other posts is astounding. Blabbering dishonesty on your part.

Maths is the same as math. It is the word we use in Australia, it is British English, it is used in Britain, Australia, New Zealand and other civil nations. I won't modify my form of English, which is just as valid as yours. Thus I will use words such as 'lift' instead of 'elevator''windscreen' instead of 'windshield'.You evolutionaries really want to go over every single word I use, rather than argue the issues.From Lurch and his mistaken interjection about evolutionary, to some twit saying that "Maths is not a science"A sphere is many things.

If they can interbreed but don’t then I would assume you and I couldn’t agree on whether it was a species or not since you seem to think only animals that can not interbreed are different species.

So I will ask again, if individuals can not interbreed, or if the result of breeding produces infertile offspring, then are they definitely different species?

Species is a construct where-by people, for terms of useful reference invented categories.My understanding of the situation is that species is usually defined either of two ways;Critters that are so far removed (in form) that they can no longer interbreed are different species.orCritters that are close in geographical sense but refrain from interbreeding, but are actually able to interbreed are different species.I have found more evidence for the first. Not being an expert on this subject, I would lean towards it.I am quite happy in being shown to be wrong in what my understanding of the word is; as I'm not the expert. But my main interest is trying to understand what scientists are saying when they use the word.It seems to me that they are trying to use it to fit to Darwins Finch, and that said finch is not a good match. It seems to me experts are using a word and the example doesn't match their definition.I actually thought you were through debating me as I got too mean.Meanings of words seem to dominate these debates, not just by me.

I hope that you're not going to begin a massive debate over definitions.

You asked me on another thread to debate you so I thought I would take one stab at it to see if we could have some intelligent dialog without it resorting to name calling. It’s not that you get mean it’s that you easily get upset.I have seen several explanations for species given here but every time one is given you just state that scientist can’t agree on a definition so there can’t use it on Darwin’s finches. Now I know scientist don’t agree on closely related animals as to where the dividing line is between a variety and a species but there is some difference that all scientist agree is definitely a different species. Like in America we have two deserts that are called pies and cakes. There are some deserts that are somewhere between the two so that some cooks will call it a pie and other cooks will call the same thing a cake. But there are definitely cakes that every cook will agree is a cake and some pies that every cook will agree is a pie. No question about it. I’m trying to find out what YOU will accept as definitely a species, regardless of what scientist say so that we can compare that to the finches and maybe come to some conclusion that both of us can agree on. I don't want to get into a debate over definitions but things have to be defined to discuss it. Therefore I am saying up front that I will accept your definition of species, but I have to know what it is or you're just going to critize my definition. Okay let me try this one more time and if I can’t get an answer I’ll give up and leave it alone. I’ll take a slightly different approach this time to try and get an answer. Would you consider asses and horses as definitely different species and if the answer is yes, what is it about the two that makes you think they are different species?

I'm arguing here that the example given is not a good example of speciation.I wonder what you think of Lurch's point that there are more than 14 species of it? I'm sure that you have an opinion, and it's part of the debate. One time he's saying categorically that there's 14 species, earlier, he accepts that sometimes there's more.Do you accept that any of the 'species' can cross-breed? If so, do you still think that they constitute separate species? If you don't know much about this particular bird, that's fine, what about a hypothetical bird then, that does the same thing?*The whole argument of what kind of word 'evolutionary' is was first raised by Lurch.The whole idea that maths is not a science was raised by your fellow evolutionaries.Same with the word 'maths' or 'math' recently raised by SLPSame with the word 'sphere'.And they hammer the poster whom they think has made such an error.

hello montalban, I don't usually post, just read what other people are saying. The reason for this is I feel I do not know enough about either subject (I am a programming nerd) to enter into a good debate. But I did have something I would like to bring up that I read and see if you have ideas about what it means. Let us just say for example that you are right and that a circle = sphere. Revelation 7:1 "And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not XXXX on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree."Isaiah 11:12 "And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth."A globe or sphere does not have four corners, for that matter neither does a circle unless you are talking about its plane, which in my opinion I think they are. It almost sounds like they are talking about the earth as a square or rectangle, again, unless they are talking about the plane of a circle. So how could they mean sphere when it actually says circle as well as having more support for it being a flat circle with those 2 passages above suggesting they meant circle? Just curious.

I was using horses and asses as something that I think both creationist and evolutionist could agree were different species. Evolutionist would say that because there are distinct physical differences and enough genetic difference to prevent fertile offspring. I think Creationist would say that because there is so much genetic difference that the amount of “evolution” that would be required to produce them if they were the same kind from off the ark, that it would be unacceptable. In other words if evolution worked that fast, we would be seeing much more change in a single lifetime than we now see. The problem for creationist of course is that with that closely related individuals being a kind, that puts too many animals on the ark to fit. But that’s a different debate.What I was trying to establish is that I think we can agree that individuals that produce infertile offspring are different species.I’m going to repeat what I have said before because I think it still applies.I think the following would be a logical progression of living organisms diverging into different species.1. Physical separation of groups of individuals that prevented interbreeding.2. Different environments that produce divergent physical characteristics over time.3. The changes result in some preference to mates based on those divergent physical characteristics.4. Further changes that result in so much preference that groups will not interbreed without definite restraints. For example a solitary pair than cannot find a partner of their group so they interbreed.5. Further changes that result in infertile offspring if restricted to mates.6. Further changes that result in aborted offspring if restricted to mates.7. Further changes that result in no interbreeding of any kind.In Darwin’s finches you can see ever phase listed above. If ANY two groups that are described as different species can be shown to not breed or produce infertile offspring, then at that point I think everyone would agree that they are different species. That is why it is a good example of speciation or the process of changing into different species. I thought Lurch did a good job in post 303 of outlining the 14 finch species as well as pointing out that some scientist divide some of the 14 species into even more species. I wasn’t able to find where he said there were more but I did not have time to do a comprehensive search. That being said, I really don’t care what Lurch said about the number of different species as I am not basing my argument on how many species of finch there are. I only need to show that there are at least two species to show that it is an example of speciation.I have tried to explain that I believe that individuals that can not cross-breed or that if they cross-breed they produce infertile offspring, then I believe they are different species. Beyond that I understand that scientists have different criteria for dividing different groups into species and that they disagree among themselves about what constitutes a separate species. However there is that point at which both evolutionist and creationist agree that different groups are different species.

And other references in the bible are consistent with the image of a flat, circular earth.The obvious explanation is that the writers' divine inspiration did not extend to scientific knowledge beyond that held by some nomadic iron age goatherders.

This won’t be much of a reply as I’m caught on the hop trying to discuss horses etc which I don’t know much about.People produce infertile offspring. I don’t understand the connection. Wouldn’t it be better that if they can’t breed at all they are different species?Actually I did stumble upon some info about 8 weeks ago about horses and evolution, but I mentioned it to someone in passing. My understanding was that some rare occasions horses and donkeys can produce fertile young, unless I am getting this example mixed up between tigers and lions.Actually, what I’ve read is that the Finchs are so close, that they can interbreed because they are in fact members of the same species, showing different traits, such as within the human species; white people, black people etc. That birds would choose partners similar to themselves is also a human trait, only highlighting certain characteristics. That they can interbreed, and do, seems to show this. They are producing fertile young too.Earlier he said that there were more. If you see my reply to that post you’ll see that I’ve quoted where he said it.But regardless, what you said re: two species of finch that itself would not show speciation, in the sense of evolution, any more than it would show that God had created two species of Finch. Speciation is, to my understanding, the process. All we have is end-result. How that result came about is a matter for debate.And, as I said, I am arguing that Darwin’s Finch is not a good example, because no one has come up with a definitive number of species. It seems highly illogical to call it a good example, when people can’t even decide how many examples constitute it.[QUOTE=Montalban]Do you accept that any of the 'species' can cross-breed? If so, do you still think that they constitute separate species? If you don't know much about this particular bird, that's fine, what about a hypothetical bird then, that does the same thing? This is not an answer, but a quote to get your opinion on it… as I don’t know anything much about horses, donkeys etc.“It is believed that the horses (horses, donkeys, and zebras) all are related because they can hybridize, and therefore they belong to a holobaramin. Additionally there is a “dog” holobaramin with monobaraminic branches for the wolves, another for the hyenas, another for the coyotes, for jackals, and more for the hundreds of pet-dog breeds. “Cats” constitute another holobaramin with monobaraminic branches for the lion and the tiger, for the pumas, another for the lynx, domestic cats, etc. (see O’Brien, 1997). A group of all the horses (equids), all the dogs (canids), and all the cats (felids) would be apobaraminic because no horse or dog or cat shares a genetic relationship with any organism which is not a horse, a dog, or a cat.”http://www.creationresearch.org/crsq...raminology.htmSay tell me, are you arguing just that evolution happened? (or a particular form of evoultion?) (I mean by this that some people believe that evolution happened, but it was started by God.).

The Hebrew language apparently had a word for ball which would have been sufficiently accurate to describe the world, but the authors of the old testament chose to desribe it as circular. And other references in the bible are consistent with the image of a flat, circular earth.The obvious explanation is that the writers' divine inspiration did not extend to scientific knowledge beyond that held by some nomadic iron age goatherders.

Why should this be a problem for you. You have discussed Darwin's finches without knowing much about them. You have discussed nouns, verbs and adjectives without knowing much about them. Go ahead and pontificate about horses as you have on so many other subjects. Not knowing has never held you back before.

I thought you'd gone

Hey Lurch, I'd thought you'd have the common decency to apologise, but obviously you never will. Which is your current grammatical theory this time? (You were the one to raise that objection and it backfired.)That you'd criticise me now for being honest when talking to Hank is probably because you don't respect or understand honesty. You criticise me for admitting I don't know much about a subject.Boo hoo.Your theories on Finches is like your theory on English, it changes all the time. One moment you're saying there's more than 14, next you're certain that there are 14 only. Which argument are you going to have this time round?Not knowing about something hasn't stopped you. Hey, why don't you debate me on the 10 Commandments in Public Areas? You posted some loser comments there. I've replied, and you may have missed it.I don't remember which of you evolutionaries made the comment but one of you was amazed that in a forum I quoted ideas from differing points of view - to encourage discussion. You wouldn't have dreamt of doing anything like that. Pontificating is all you know.But I've got heaps of time for you Lurch. Heaps of time.I have admitted when I have been wrong - most recently you yourself pointed out the bad example I used re: Lurch as a verb only. I am not trying to cover this up - the fact I've mentioned it again now should show this.But it comes from the fact we're arguing from different sets of thought. You criticise religion and religious people as being unthinking and moronic. You're dishonest and unthinking and moronic.I can't wait for you, or your little gang of ban-dogs;* Iamtheruth, SLP, WJA et al to make the next official statement of the Pontificate of Ignorance.*I'd have thought that they'd have; if they were honest, disowned your flaccid arguments. See, I was wrong again!

hello montalban, I don't usually post, just read what other people are saying. The reason for this is I feel I do not know enough about either subject (I am a programming nerd) to enter into a good debate. But I did have something I would like to bring up that I read and see if you have ideas about what it means. Let us just say for example that you are right and that a circle = sphere. Revelation 7:1 "And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not XXXX on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree."Isaiah 11:12 "And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth."A globe or sphere does not have four corners, for that matter neither does a circle unless you are talking about its plane, which in my opinion I think they are. It almost sounds like they are talking about the earth as a square or rectangle, again, unless they are talking about the plane of a circle. So how could they mean sphere when it actually says circle as well as having more support for it being a flat circle with those 2 passages above suggesting they meant circle? Just curious.

From memory someone posted an even more extensive list of Biblical quotes which seemed to support your case.I will endeavour to find them for you if you want...I already responded to them too :) but there were about eight or nine of them... mostly from Psalms.I think my main rebuttal was that Psalms are by their nature songs of joy, and are therefore full of literary tools

All species produce a small percentage of infertile offspring. That’s to be expected when you are dealing with something as complicated as reproduction. But when the breeding always produces infertile offspring, then it’s an evolutionary dead-end. If you are asking if two species are further apart in their genetic makeup when they don’t breed as compared to when they do breed under unusual circumstances and produce infertile offspring, then I would think that would be correct. But do you know of anyone, creationist or evolutionist, that believes that horses and donkeys or lions and tigers are the same species?I have never heard of a mule being fertile. If you have something I would be interested in seeing it.Some of them do interbreed and produce fertile offspring and I don’t think anyone is stating that they don’t.But I am asking you, if you saw the following in a group of related animals or plants, would you think that is a good example of speciation?1. Physical separation of groups of individuals that prevented interbreeding.2. Different environments that produce divergent physical characteristics over time.3. The changes result in some preference to mates based on those divergent physical characteristics.4. Further changes that result in so much preference that groups will not interbreed without definite restraints. For example a solitary pair than cannot find a partner of their group so they interbreed.5. Further changes that result in infertile offspring if restricted to mates.6. Further changes that result in aborted offspring if restricted to mates.7. Further changes that result in no interbreeding of any kind.You don’t seem to understand that I don’t care what Lurch said. I’m not arguing anything Lurch said.It appears to me that we have a lot more than end result if you have evidence of several different groups that show a gradual progression from being able to freely interbreed, all the way to not breeding at all. If you won’t accept that as evidence of speciation I don’t know what you would accept. So unless you can present something else that would convince you of speciation, I don’t think there is anything else to debate as you aren’t willing to accept anything as evidence of speciation.If it shows all the steps necessary for speciation, what does it matter whether it’s 14 species or 14,000 species?DNA analysis has shown quite convincingly that all life is related. It’s just a matter of which groups are more closely related. To say that horses, dogs and cats do not share a genetic relationship is in my view ludicrous.However that statement in general is somewhat amazing. It certainly implies that horses, donkeys, zebras and that type is a kind. Along with all cats and all dog types because they can hybridize. For those creationist that believe in Noah’s ark and the global flood, there is no way you could have that much diversity in such a short period of time.I am not arguing why evolution happened at all, just that the evidence shows that it did happen. However I believe that God set up the laws of science when he created the universe billions of years ago and evolution is a result of that. That he took billions of years to create mankind is to me an amazing and awesome concept.Are you good in math?

This won’t be much of a reply as I’m caught on the hop trying to discuss horses etc which I don’t know much about.People produce infertile offspring. I don’t understand the connection. Wouldn’t it be better that if they can’t breed at all they are different species?Actually I did stumble upon some info about 8 weeks ago about horses and evolution, but I mentioned it to someone in passing. My understanding was that some rare occasions horses and donkeys can produce fertile young, unless I am getting this example mixed up between tigers and lions.Actually, what I’ve read is that the Finchs are so close, that they can interbreed because they are in fact members of the same species, showing different traits, such as within the human species; white people, black people etc. That birds would choose partners similar to themselves is also a human trait, only highlighting certain characteristics. That they can interbreed, and do, seems to show this. They are producing fertile young too.Earlier he said that there were more. If you see my reply to that post you’ll see that I’ve quoted where he said it.But regardless, what you said re: two species of finch that itself would not show speciation, in the sense of evolution, any more than it would show that God had created two species of Finch. Speciation is, to my understanding, the process. All we have is end-result. How that result came about is a matter for debate.And, as I said, I am arguing that Darwin’s Finch is not a good example, because no one has come up with a definitive number of species. It seems highly illogical to call it a good example, when people can’t even decide how many examples constitute it.[QUOTE=Montalban]Do you accept that any of the 'species' can cross-breed? If so, do you still think that they constitute separate species? If you don't know much about this particular bird, that's fine, what about a hypothetical bird then, that does the same thing? This is not an answer, but a quote to get your opinion on it… as I don’t know anything much about horses, donkeys etc.“It is believed that the horses (horses, donkeys, and zebras) all are related because they can hybridize, and therefore they belong to a holobaramin. Additionally there is a “dog” holobaramin with monobaraminic branches for the wolves, another for the hyenas, another for the coyotes, for jackals, and more for the hundreds of pet-dog breeds. “Cats” constitute another holobaramin with monobaraminic branches for the lion and the tiger, for the pumas, another for the lynx, domestic cats, etc. (see O’Brien, 1997). A group of all the horses (equids), all the dogs (canids), and all the cats (felids) would be apobaraminic because no horse or dog or cat shares a genetic relationship with any organism which is not a horse, a dog, or a cat.”http://www.creationresearch.org/crsq...raminology.htmSay tell me, are you arguing just that evolution happened? (or a particular form of evoultion?) (I mean by this that some people believe that evolution happened, but it was started by God.).

Maths was my worst subject at school.History and English were my better ones, and at Uni I did History and Politics as a double major. My interests have never been science-based. I have an interest in Religion, History, Law, Politics.And as evolution has no laws, and is in principle anti-religious, that it is more a political movement (which I have debated on other posts in another forum), then I have by chance had some interest in it.Why do you ask?Also, you think that a finch can diverge into different finches, but would this mean that a finch might one day have gills?

Evolution like all of science is neutral on religion and the existence of God. At the risk of offending you which is not my intent, my experience has been that people who have trouble with math have trouble with logic. I’m trying to understand where you are coming from.With enough time and the right circumstances there is no logical or genetic reason that I know of why that could not happen.It’s 3:15 pm where I’m at.

Not so. The Orthodox Church has said that God has done certain things. Evolution says no that's not so. They are in conflict.There is nothing nuetral about it.It's like if you claim you painted a picture, but a book says, no, all the paint just dripped onto the canvas, you'd say that you are not being given the credit you deserve, you are the creator, this thing didn't come about by a natural process - even if it could be shown to have happened that way.I believe I explained that previously. I have added more here, that evolution is not neutral as you'd wish it.Many of the biggest names in it's pantheon have been anti-religious.Are you assuming that logic can't be developed through other means... such as making a legal argument etc.?What is enough time?This is illogical. Unless you're assuming that I'm constantly on-line. By the time I reply it will have been meaningless information.

You are assuming that the Orthodox Church is the only religion there is. Many religions believe the evidence shows that evolution is the way God created the different species. However science is neutral on religion because it doesn’t use the supernatural as evidence. It basically says there may be a supernatural but it’s not science so science doesn’t use it.Because some scientist may be anti-religious does not mean the science of evolution is anti-religious. There are many religious scientists.No I’m not assuming that. But math is almost pure logic. Individuals do learn math but each person is limited in how much they can grasp based on basic individual abilities. Therefore I think it is a very good indication of how logical a person tends to think. Millions of years.I wasn’t assuming anything. You had just posted to a thread so I knew you were online. But that wasn’t what I was thinking. As you can see, the time of each post is displayed. I could deduct the time of the post from the time you said it was and tell what the time difference was. That was what I was trying to determine. Therefore the only thing that is illogical is your assertion that the information is meaningless. LOL

You made this post on another thread.And I find it interesting that you made this post on this thread in response to my statement that science was neutral towards religion. You think it was wrong for someone to refer to ‘the Church’ as the Catholic Church but don’t have any trouble referring to ‘The Orthodox Church’ as a substitute for religion.Maybe that’s not what the book says but just what your church interprets it to say and that interpretation is incorrect. I’m not familiar with The Orthodox Church but at one time most Christian churches believed the book said the sun rotated around the earth. Come to find out, it was just their interpretation that was wrong. Many people, like myself, believe all the credit goes to the creator, but that he took a little longer than 6000 years to create because he did it by way of evolution.

Hank, thank you for quoting me out of context.Charchuk knows that I'm Orthodox.He keeps talking about what 'the Church' believes. He told me that 'the Church' has already accepted evolution.As he's replying to me I thought I'd remind him.He's also been at pains to tell me about what the Pope thinks, and how I obey the Pope etc.Either you don't know what the Orthodox Church is, like him, or you've just entered this debate half-informed.Thank you for dropping in half-way through though just to tell me I'm wrong.

Here is your bias again being displayed. You've singled me out to comment about me being insulting. And whining too. But you only seem to be against me on this point. I have been trying to explain to you that you're comments were not welcome in the context of the current debate, but you just add more. And then complain when I say you've called me out of context.You continually compare me to your 7 year old, but you're saying you're not being insulting.You are sarcastic, but then call me over-sensitive if I respond.Obviously I've just got to allow for you to be sarcastic, and I'm not allowed to react to it. You should state these rules at the beginning.Remember if you will Post 13You are the one who directly challenged my points about NFL - by being sarcastic. I hadn't been discussing it with you at all, because you'd not been on that forum for a while, I'd gone on to discuss this issue with others, such as Madhat... or was it Crim. You can go look I was talking to them. Yes I had before addressed you, but you'd gone and you wade back into it, criticise my comments about NFL, and said You also misrepresented me by only listing some of the reasons I don't like NFL THEN I responded to you saying why are you being sarcastic, (steel-trap mind quip) then why are you concentrating on my comments. You think I've no right to react other than positively if you're sarcastic.You're not interested in debate... because if I don't agree with you - you question my ability to think logically - because I don't agree with you (Logic is also studied by philosophers). You tried to widen a debate about Football to include non-Football sports such as pole-vaulting. But here if' I've tried to engage you, you say that I'm dodging the issue, or you won't debate me on anything else.You've made backhanded comments such as I'm wrong on issues, but I'm too sensitive for you to point out my mistakes. That's not being considerate, that's being gutless - making unsubstantiated comments and then chickening out. Slinging mud to see if it sticks.You've already told me that you'll only debate me if I answer your questions, but when I raise my own, you say you're not going to deal with these issues. I've tried to sound you out on things and then you say things like you're going to give up on me if I don't comply with your formula.As you said in post 26 of football You operate under different rules to what you'd expect me to.If you're so sick of me... then why don't you stop your whining and stop debating me! You keep telling me how wonderful you've been in talking to me, oh joy. I'm sorry that I've not conformed to your high expectations.And as to the evolutionaries I've been debatinga) I expect that sort of behaviour from them, and I have responded in kind ... I'm not whining, I'm stating a fact of what's been going on... putting things into context, I have on many occasions admitted I insult back. I'm not concerned about that... I just want to know where I stand with you.b) I don't expect you to just point out my 'faults' if you are genuine - because this is what you've been doing; you should be engaging other people in equal fashion.What I'm doing is being honest. I am stating it as I see it; I've admitted errors; I've admitted that I've responded to the evolutionaries in similar fashion. I'm not arguing any different to that.And yes I do expect an apology for people who accuse me of being wrong. These same parties would expect the same from me. You call that 'petty' but you're quite happy for people to say I'm wrong. You're just concerned if I want such a thing rectified. That's bizarre. I have apologised when I'm wrong. They have not. But you're unconcerned with this, only if I demand it.So, either I respond to you, as I have them, or not. You keep suggesting you want reasonable debate, and I took you for your word.Instead you keep slipping in these comments, like you just can't help yourself. I would prefer you didn't respond. I couldn't care less. But if you make a statement, then don't be surprised if I do respond. If you're sarcastic don't be so amazed I'd respond. If you put your foot in it, by quoting me out of context then equally, be prepared.Actually I'm mistaken, as you've got something against Parcum too, even when he apologised. It seems if one party apologises you single them out for special treatment.Perhaps your 7 year old can understand this; hypocrisy. You insult, but I'm whining if I complain. Putting LOL at the end doesn't magically mean I have to accept your XXXX.You insult, and I'm akin to your 7 year old if I bite back.If you can't stand the heat you get out of the kitchen!And the post was "True Football: Which is better?"Not "Which sport is better"

What’s suspect about that?You know montalban I have bent over backwards to try and explain to you that I only wanted to discuss the issues without the insults and derogatory remarks. But this is it for me. One of our famous sayings by a president is “If you can’t take the heat, get out of the kitchen”. So why don’t you quite whining about how everybody mistreats you and just debate.Yes you have. There seems to be no limit to how much you whine about it. I don’t let my 7-year-old do that much whining.And you have yet to address the issues I have raised in my post.

Good grief! What a waste of electrons. Can you point to any other person on this forum that complains about the way others treat them? I’m not going to waste my time responding to all this garbage but I’ll just hit a few high points.You don’t get to decide whether I respond to a post or not. So stating that comments are not welcome are immaterial. Respond all you want. But if you are going to whine about the way someone treats you instead of debating the issues, then I’m going to point it out.To my knowledge there is no time requirements on posting. I have a life besides posting here and sometimes get busy. And where’s my apology. You said I didn’t respond to WJA and that’s not true. I want my apology. LOLNow that was funny. You have no sense of humor.Yep you’re whining if you complain about how everyone treats you. No one else does that.No you’re definitely not akin to my 7-year-old. I don’t let her whine.Sounds like a good plan to me. LOL

Here is your bias again being displayed. You've singled me out to comment about me being insulting. And whining too. But you only seem to be against me on this point. I have been trying to explain to you that you're comments were not welcome in the context of the current debate, but you just add more. And then complain when I say you've called me out of context.You continually compare me to your 7 year old, but you're saying you're not being insulting.You are sarcastic, but then call me over-sensitive if I respond.Obviously I've just got to allow for you to be sarcastic, and I'm not allowed to react to it. You should state these rules at the beginning.Remember if you will Post 13You are the one who directly challenged my points about NFL - by being sarcastic. I hadn't been discussing it with you at all, because you'd not been on that forum for a while, I'd gone on to discuss this issue with others, such as Madhat... or was it Crim. You can go look I was talking to them. Yes I had before addressed you, but you'd gone and you wade back into it, criticise my comments about NFL, and said You also misrepresented me by only listing some of the reasons I don't like NFL THEN I responded to you saying why are you being sarcastic, (steel-trap mind quip) then why are you concentrating on my comments. You think I've no right to react other than positively if you're sarcastic.You're not interested in debate... because if I don't agree with you - you question my ability to think logically - because I don't agree with you (Logic is also studied by philosophers). You tried to widen a debate about Football to include non-Football sports such as pole-vaulting. But here if' I've tried to engage you, you say that I'm dodging the issue, or you won't debate me on anything else.You've made backhanded comments such as I'm wrong on issues, but I'm too sensitive for you to point out my mistakes. That's not being considerate, that's being gutless - making unsubstantiated comments and then chickening out. Slinging mud to see if it sticks.You've already told me that you'll only debate me if I answer your questions, but when I raise my own, you say you're not going to deal with these issues. I've tried to sound you out on things and then you say things like you're going to give up on me if I don't comply with your formula.As you said in post 26 of football You operate under different rules to what you'd expect me to.If you're so sick of me... then why don't you stop your whining and stop debating me! You keep telling me how wonderful you've been in talking to me, oh joy. I'm sorry that I've not conformed to your high expectations.And as to the evolutionaries I've been debatinga) I expect that sort of behaviour from them, and I have responded in kind ... I'm not whining, I'm stating a fact of what's been going on... putting things into context, I have on many occasions admitted I insult back. I'm not concerned about that... I just want to know where I stand with you.b) I don't expect you to just point out my 'faults' if you are genuine - because this is what you've been doing; you should be engaging other people in equal fashion.What I'm doing is being honest. I am stating it as I see it; I've admitted errors; I've admitted that I've responded to the evolutionaries in similar fashion. I'm not arguing any different to that.And yes I do expect an apology for people who accuse me of being wrong. These same parties would expect the same from me. You call that 'petty' but you're quite happy for people to say I'm wrong. You're just concerned if I want such a thing rectified. That's bizarre. I have apologised when I'm wrong. They have not. But you're unconcerned with this, only if I demand it.So, either I respond to you, as I have them, or not. You keep suggesting you want reasonable debate, and I took you for your word.Instead you keep slipping in these comments, like you just can't help yourself. I would prefer you didn't respond. I couldn't care less. But if you make a statement, then don't be surprised if I do respond. If you're sarcastic don't be so amazed I'd respond. If you put your foot in it, by quoting me out of context then equally, be prepared.Actually I'm mistaken, as you've got something against Parcum too, even when he apologised. It seems if one party apologises you single them out for special treatment.Perhaps your 7 year old can understand this; hypocrisy. You insult, but I'm whining if I complain. Putting LOL at the end doesn't magically mean I have to accept your XXXX.You insult, and I'm akin to your 7 year old if I bite back.If you can't stand the heat you get out of the kitchen!And the post was "True Football: Which is better?"Not "Which sport is better"

Waste of electrons? Then don't respond. I will. I've admitted I'm petty and will argue if I'm right.Now that I know that you're one of them, not a serious debater, I'll treat you accordingly.But you did anyway.Then neither do you so stop whinging that I don't answer your questions. This is why you're a hypocrite. You complain I've no right to do so, but you do - as I exampled already.Exactly, you think you've the only right to complain - that I'm over-sensitive, etc. That I can't take your sarcasm etc. You've seen that you are the sole arbiter of wisdom and you interfere without reading things.WJA's Post 335To you. I didn't find it funny. But hey, that's okay, as long as you're happy. I'm sorry that I've not been one to think you're some wit.No. I complain about how ignoramuses such as yourself act. You felt free to tell me I'm oversensitive, illogical, like your 7 year old etc. You've been quite liberal in your assessments before, but hey, that's all just LOL isn't it.I also came in on the way you treated Parcum. Well after he apologised you still wanted to put the boot in. But hey, he started it, didn't he... that's something you'd call 'immature' if someone else used it as an excuse, but again, one rule for you.I should think not. I'm sure you like having the final word with her.As I said, I recognise that I fight fire with fire. Only you seem to think I'm the only one complaining. What do you think you've been doing? No insight into how obnoxious you are.

There's some people here who are unsure of what kind of terminology to use in discussing evolution. One was 'speciation'. Species forming, but not really becoming separate. Another term "survival of the fittest' met this response...Post 227I explained...Post 232What is 'survival of the species'? It is another tautology used to sound convincing. It means, the animal that will survive, survives. This is the meat of evolutionist debate, using terms that at closer inspection they're not really sure what they mean.Suvival need not be up to the 'fittest' if this is the suggestion that the strongest survives. A weaker animal migh pass on its genes. A lucky animal might too.So, again evolutionaries are using terms that they're not really sure about. Like 'ancestral type'. Is this a term that means, an actual ancestor, or, is it more akin to archaic i.e. not directly on the evolutionary path of any extant species?

I know you don't.My argument was there was a tautology.Read what you said... Darwin never used the expression.I showed you several proofs that he did. Therefore you're wrong. You don't know who uses what expression.However, that it remains a tautology was my main point, and you didn't address it, you just tried to claim it was never used by Darwin.It is a tautology, and therefore meaningless.

Not breeding with each other or the offspring being infertile means different species.It might not be strongest. It might be fastest or smartest or something else that give it an edge in surviving. The fastest cheetah will have an advantage over a slower cheetah and will have a better chance of passing on its genes. One cheetah might be slower and get lucky enough to pass on its genes but over a large population, the fastest is going to pass on more of its genes than the slower. This is not rocket science and I don’t know why you can’t understand this simple concept.As I understand it, ‘ancestral type’ is either directly on the evolutionary path or closely related to a type that is directly on the evolutionary path. It doesn’t seem that difficult to understand to me.

It is good of you to explain your current theory on natural selection, is this the one Darwin didn't use, or the one he did?. But speed is not all that there is. From Post 110 "How does a new species come about? "Take for instance deer. (not dear, I'm not trying to patronise). Two big stags battle it out to see who gets the herd of females. Meanwhile a scraggly male mopes about because he's got no chance.The two deer come together and butt heads. Their antlers lock. They can't separate. They will eventually die. The lonely, cowardly, weak deer gets his chance. Survival of the cowardly and weak!Look at turtles. When dozens are born, they all scamper towards the sea. Birds walk up and down picking them off. It's not fitness, it's luck.Survival of the luckiest!Look at lions. The big pride might live in an area that is locally affected by drought. Again, survival of the luckiest.This is in fact a better representation of 'natural selection' it is meant to be totally 'blind' it's not even deciding which animals are best suited.People keep factoring in things based on their own a priori ideas of what is 'best' suited to survive. You'd think the biggest strongest male deer would be best suited to pass on its genes, so you assume that it will, and that only the biggest strongest one will produce more big strong deer.This is of course a nonsense. And when you think about this, it makes it apparent that natural selection would make it very hard for evolution to occur.Not just the chance of mutation has to be factored in.No, out of that, the chance of 'beneficial' mutation has to be considered...and then, the animal that has the beneficial genes, may not even get a chance to reproduce.A lion with some predisposition to survival in drought might not actually get to maturity to mate, to pass these genes on. It could be killed as a cub, or never be physically strong enough to compete with other rival males.Thus when a drought happens, the lions are wiped out.The chance of the right animal, having the right genes, passing the right genes on, makes evolution highly improbable.Many people, undereducated such as myself in the ways of science would read 'ancestral' to be an ancestor, to the point of being an actual progenitor. The real reason there is confusion about these terms is because evolutionaries themselves keep moving things around. When Archaeopteryx was first found, it was hailed as a direct 'link' now it is not seen as one. So, when you started calling it 'ancestral' that made sense in the actual meaning of the word, but now it is no longer part of a link, the term ancestral leads to natural confusion... and scientists themselves don't know where they're up to in retaliation to Archaeopteryx... you have so many competing theories.The Archaeopteryx is a great example of scientific 'newspeak'. It is both on the line, and off the line of descent. So it should please you as it matches all of your criteria for the word, but of course, that makes it a nonsense.An early fossil bird from the Jurassic, ca 150 mya: Archaeopteryx, Greek for "ancient wing," the link between birds and reptiles, looked like a small dinosaur with feathers preserved in fine-grained limestone." http://www.ummz.lsa.umich.edu/birds...s/evolhist.html Here the key word is 'link' which is a connection. Again this suggests movement, or transition, but again, when hard-pressed evolutionaries will retreat away from such a normative description and move into more vague terms such as those in..."Archaeopteryx :An Early Bird" http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/diapsi...haeopteryx.htmlCan I draw your attention to " It is actually intermediate between the birds that we see flying around in our backyards and the predatory dinosaurs like Deinonychus." 'Intermediate' is another vague notion that also suggests between (how else did it come to have bits of one and bits of the other?)Or "It has long been accepted that Archaeopteryx was a transitional form between birds and reptiles, and that it is the earliest known bird. Lately, scientists have realized that it bears even more resemblance to its ancestors, the Maniraptora, than to modern birds; providing a strong phylogenetic link between the two groups. It is one of the most important fossils ever discovered." No wonder so many people are confused... look at the wording around Figure 1 at http://www.erin.gov.au/water/wetlan...rds/evolve.html "Figure 1 Archaeopteryx an ancient ancestor of modern birds" Is it the 'ancestor' or is it 'ancestral'? This is more clearly a case of an evolutionary statement having gone to far, because this time the meaning is perfectly clear, Archaeopteryx lead to modern birds.This is a way that evolutionaries set up a system of language that suggests that they have solved problems, when in fact they haven't.http://anthro.palomar.edu/evolve/evolve_2.htm shows a figure* that suggests 'ancestral' is on the line of modern animals. There's no qualification at all...And here is my point proven. One group of evolutionaries using the same word to mean different things. You're all dead certain that evolution is a fact, but when you closely look at what you're talking about, you're not really sure.*The figure is not given a reference number. It sits just before the words "Darwin came to understand that any population consists of individuals that are all slightly different from one another.*"

Texas science, and not only its life science, rose to the occasion and opposed theDiscovery Institute’s (the Wedge’s) campaign. Here is an example of what the state’sscientists said and did. The Dallas-Fort Worth area (like others in Texas) is rich inbiological and medical talent. On September 22, 2003, seventeen local members of theNational Academy of Sciences and/or the Institute of Medicine, all of them biologicaland medical scientists, four of them, including Alfred Gilman, Nobel laureates, addressedthe school board and their fellow citizens. From Professor Gilman’s published letter:Some individuals and organizations have long opposed teaching onlyscientific bases for the appearance and evolution of life on earth. Theseopponents claim that scientific texts systematically misinform readers.Why? Because, according to the critics, the books in question don’texpound upon supposed weaknesses in the theory of evolution.These assertions have been refuted in great detail by scientists intestimony prepared for the state board and in analyses of the centralarguments raised by opponents of the texts…[emphasis added]We note that these supposedly scientific challenges are directedselectively at the theory of evolution. There are no similar campaignsbeing waged against textbooks that don’t discuss alleged weaknesses inother major scientific theories, such as gravitation or relativity. Clearly,the motivation for the current challenges lies not in science, and thescientific classroom is not the proper forum for such a debate.…The modern theory of evolution has undergone 140 years of testing. It isnow so well established that its veracity and robustness are accepted as factby the overwhelming majority of scientists in this country and around theworld. In the scientific community, the unanswered questions concern notthe fact of evolution but rather the mechanisms by which evolutionoperates…http://www.nas.org/publications/sci_...-5_letters.pdfWell there you have it, when we look closely at evolution it is the mechanism that scientists aren't sure of, not the fact that evolution is, well, a fact.Monty, you really should stop misrepresenting what others have to say about evolution, it seems to be a problem you have in many of your posts.So, Monty, do you have anything positive to say about creation yet? Any evidence? anything at all? Do you actually have a position? Your semi-literate attacks on evolution just get funnier by the minute.Lets talk about SN1987A.

It sits just before the words "Darwin came to understand that any population consists of individuals that are all slightly different from one another.*"

You asked me on another thread to debate you so I thought I would take one stab at it to see if we could have some intelligent dialog without it resorting to name calling. It’s not that you get mean it’s that you easily get upset.I have seen several explanations for species given here but every time one is given you just state that scientist can’t agree on a definition so there can’t use it on Darwin’s finches. Now I know scientist don’t agree on closely related animals as to where the dividing line is between a variety and a species but there is some difference that all scientist agree is definitely a different species. Like in America we have two deserts that are called pies and cakes. There are some deserts that are somewhere between the two so that some cooks will call it a pie and other cooks will call the same thing a cake. But there are definitely cakes that every cook will agree is a cake and some pies that every cook will agree is a pie. No question about it. I’m trying to find out what YOU will accept as definitely a species, regardless of what scientist say so that we can compare that to the finches and maybe come to some conclusion that both of us can agree on. I don't want to get into a debate over definitions but things have to be defined to discuss it. Therefore I am saying up front that I will accept your definition of species, but I have to know what it is or you're just going to critize my definition. Okay let me try this one more time and if I can’t get an answer I’ll give up and leave it alone. I’ll take a slightly different approach this time to try and get an answer. Would you consider asses and horses as definitely different species and if the answer is yes, what is it about the two that makes you think they are different species?

I agreeI believe God created life on earth, he just did via evolution.

1. Ah yes, the turmoil, the chaos, it would have been great. I do not think the ark would have been destroyed. The reason I believe a meteor would have had to have struck is because there was a mist that for whatever reason didn't turn into rain. In order to create a raindrop, some sort of pollution is needed as a sort of seed crystal. A meteor would have provided this. (Aside from the fact that we can see fossil evidence that meteors have struck). Now according to evolutionary theory, (well one of them) a meteor was the reason there were mass extinctions. Yet as I stated before in no mass extinction was every form of life wiped out (Too bad people here don't stop debating Darwin's finches and begin debating why in the world blue-green algea which is the evolutionary ancestor of all life has managed to survive throughout the fossil record virtually unchanged while all its more fit ancestors have had to undergo many rapid changes in order to survive.) Anyway, if the ark was placed in a spot far inthe center of say what we now call Africa or Asia and the meteors struck at the edge of the plates, and finally, there were underwater rivers flowing under these plates (based on a Biblical description), then I do not believe the force would have had to be quite as hard as you think. I also do not believe the plates were just shot immediately into their current positions. Throughout the year, they moved to where they are now and then slowed to their current rates of movement.2. Most modern medicine is derived from organic compounds - digitalis (foxglove) for the heart, asprin (willow) for almost everything. An herbalist actually told me the only difference between the natural plant medicine and the manufactured one is that modern medicine causes side effects the plant medicine didn't have (her words not mine). So yes, I believe that Noah could have treated the animals. Look at some of the wounds that "cave men" survived from.3. According to the Bible people didn't begin dying for the first 900 years on earth. I believe that in 900 years, man can cause the complete extinction of many species. With any of the species though, there needed to be a large number of them in order to make a fossil since fossilization doesn't occur easily. So even if humans had just knocked down the dinosaurs numbers dramatically, they would not have necessarily left anymore fossils behind. 4. Since fossilization does occur under only special circumstances, and migrations after the flood would have occurred (relatively) quickly, we would not find migrating fossils.5. Evolution has its own migrations theories (it has to or otherwise they would not be able to explain why the Hawaiian islands have plant and animal species on them). I will try to dig out some rather recent theories, but I know their experimentation on the mangrove islands is one of the experiments they use to back up their beliefs.6.You are right, most phD's do say that evolution is proven by evidence, but even they can be stumped as long as new questions are asked of them. Regardless of their beliefs, I still only consider them to be scientists (which is why I went to my evolution teacher to get clarification on the law question).

Hi PriscillaHave you thought about how much damage and turmoil would have been created if several meteors struck the earth. Or how much energy would have been released if a meteor hit the earth that was strong enough to break continents apart. I’d be surprised if anything survived that kind of disaster, much less a 75’ x 450’ ark. The first seismic wave would destroy the whole thing.Okay but research facilities are also in the habit of knowing a whole lot about the animals they keep. They also have modern medicine to treat sick animals. Do you think Noah would have know about every animal kind so that none would have died over the course of a year?Well dogs are mentioned in Exodus and foxes are mentioned in Judges in the Bible. From the flood to where foxes are talked about in Judges is about 1200 years. Are you saying there can be that much evolution in 1200 years?Moses talks of both horses and asses. That’s only about 800 years. Horses and asses are definitely different species.Why do we never find dinosaur and human fossils in the same layer? Dinosaur fossils are always found in older layers.That’s not exactly my question. There are a lot of animals that are only in South America. If 4200 years ago there was a flood that wiped out all life except the ark, and then say the South American sloth started the long trip to South America, why do we not find fossils of him along the way? I just used that on animal but I’m talking about all of them that a specific to different continents. I’m not sure what you are talking about but I’m interested if you will explain more.OkayMost of the PhD’s that work in the field say evolution is proven by the evidence.

As I have already stated, I would not consider someone to be a scientist unless they have a phD. However, I just went to a science museum on vaction two weeks ago and they had a whole room devoted to the science of engineering. I do not agree that because you can earn a B.S. in it it makes it a science. However, they fact that MrJack pointed out that some universites consider Math to be science and some don't shows that obviously there is also a debate over this and so neither side is right. In one final concluding mark I turn to my old faithful unabridged Webster's for a defintion of science: ( I am not writing it all, you will have to trust I didn't leave out anything that could prove your point or look it up yourself and counter quote me.)2.

A branch of study which is concerned with observation and classification of facts, esp. with the establishment (and, strictly, the quantitative formulation) of verifiable general laws, chiefly by induction(Well, there are eight, I will end there)So, although Webster is no scientist (or is he?) the point is it is kind of a pointless debate.

It is interesting that this has come up. On another baord, a creationist that has a BS in electronics engineering claimed that he is a "scientist" because he has a bachelor's of SCIENCE, and that therefore, his opinions on evolution should carry as much weight as any other (real) scientist.They do what they have to to convinve themselves (and others) that their opinions actually have merit.

Please don't misrepresent my position, I care little for your petty argument regarding the usage of words, nor do I care for your obsession with Darwins finches, you seem to think that this is somehow important and that it in some way disproves evolutionoary theory.

Evidence , my dear chap, provide some good old solid EMPIRICAL data and evidence to support your somewhat wobbly position.Here's an example; There mere existance of SN1987A proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that the bible is wrong, in particular Genesis. I/we/the scientific comunity, have evidence, where is yours to show us otherwise?

[QUOTE=Hank]I’m going to I think the following would be a logical progression of living organisms diverging into different species.1. Physical separation of groups of individuals that prevented interbreeding.2. Different environments that produce divergent physical characteristics over time.3. The changes result in some preference to mates based on those divergent physical characteristics.4. Further changes that result in so much preference that groups will not interbreed without definite restraints. For example a solitary pair than cannot find a partner of their group so they interbreed.5. Further changes that result in infertile offspring if restricted to mates.6. Further changes that result in aborted offspring if restricted to mates.7. Further changes that result in no interbreeding of any kind.In Darwin’s finches you can see ever phase listed above. [QUOTE]You realize this is not the way scientists see evolution? Their version is more like this:1. Mutations occur in an organisms DNA causing different characteristics.2. Environmental changes cause certain mutations to be eliminated because of their incompatability with the environment.Repeat steps 1 and 2 until certain mutations have been solidified and two or more of the mutations have developed selectively until they no longer interbreed with the other mutations. The environment doesn't cause the beneficial mutations it only selects which mutations will survive.

I was using horses and asses as something that I think both creationist and evolutionist could agree were different species. Evolutionist would say that because there are distinct physical differences and enough genetic difference to prevent fertile offspring. I think Creationist would say that because there is so much genetic difference that the amount of “evolution” that would be required to produce them if they were the same kind from off the ark, that it would be unacceptable. In other words if evolution worked that fast, we would be seeing much more change in a single lifetime than we now see. The problem for creationist of course is that with that closely related individuals being a kind, that puts too many animals on the ark to fit. But that’s a different debate.What I was trying to establish is that I think we can agree that individuals that produce infertile offspring are different species.I’m going to repeat what I have said before because I think it still applies.I think the following would be a logical progression of living organisms diverging into different species.1. Physical separation of groups of individuals that prevented interbreeding.2. Different environments that produce divergent physical characteristics over time.3. The changes result in some preference to mates based on those divergent physical characteristics.4. Further changes that result in so much preference that groups will not interbreed without definite restraints. For example a solitary pair than cannot find a partner of their group so they interbreed.5. Further changes that result in infertile offspring if restricted to mates.6. Further changes that result in aborted offspring if restricted to mates.7. Further changes that result in no interbreeding of any kind.In Darwin’s finches you can see ever phase listed above. If ANY two groups that are described as different species can be shown to not breed or produce infertile offspring, then at that point I think everyone would agree that they are different species. That is why it is a good example of speciation or the process of changing into different species. I thought Lurch did a good job in post 303 of outlining the 14 finch species as well as pointing out that some scientist divide some of the 14 species into even more species. I wasn’t able to find where he said there were more but I did not have time to do a comprehensive search. That being said, I really don’t care what Lurch said about the number of different species as I am not basing my argument on how many species of finch there are. I only need to show that there are at least two species to show that it is an example of speciation.I have tried to explain that I believe that individuals that can not cross-breed or that if they cross-breed they produce infertile offspring, then I believe they are different species. Beyond that I understand that scientists have different criteria for dividing different groups into species and that they disagree among themselves about what constitutes a separate species. However there is that point at which both evolutionist and creationist agree that different groups are different species.

I don't want to debate you since we are on the same side, but I did want to point out that the theory of evolution does use the laws of genetics to base itself on. I also want to point out again that science does not allow God into its theories and while Hank feels this gives it a neutral stance, I agree with you that this makes all science anti-God. But it is also my assertation that science has always been this way from its beginnings in philosophy.

Maths was my worst subject at school.History and English were my better ones, and at Uni I did History and Politics as a double major. My interests have never been science-based. I have an interest in Religion, History, Law, Politics.And as evolution has no laws, and is in principle anti-religious, that it is more a political movement (which I have debated on other posts in another forum), then I have by chance had some interest in it.Why do you ask?Also, you think that a finch can diverge into different finches, but would this mean that a finch might one day have gills?

My husband who is highly intellegent and even more logical than I am hates math with a passion. I have pursued math up to the calculus level and although I consider myself very logical (I enjoy doing logic problems and cryptology for fun) I am obviously very illogical at times (because he often points this out to me although since I am illogical, I don't always believe him;-). I believe that every human has the potential from birth to become highly intellegent and posses the abilities to do math and wnything else they want to.

(People who learn about all the things I have done often ask, is there anything you haven't done?)

"After the progenitor star (known as Sk -69 202; the Sk means Nick Sanduleak catalogued the star) exploded, astronomers measured the time it took for the energy to travel from the star to the primary ring that is around the star. (The ring is quite large, much larger than the "ring" that Neptune makes in its orbit around our own sun.) From this, astronomers determined the actual "height" of the ring from the star. Second, they already knew the angular size of the ring against the sky (as measured through telescopes, and measured most precisely with the Hubble Space Telescope)."Here is a page with a homework problem on SN1987A if you are interested in the details: http://cosmos.colorado.edu/astr1120/homework4/hwk4.html

Why did Jesus come to us?My understanding of theology is that Jesus came to save us, to redeem us for the guilt caused by Adam....So if you believe in a 'lucky ape' that evolved a soul or was granted a soul, or whatever... and you're not really answered the question... (what do you believe; just given a range of options)... when was the first sin committed? What happened for there to be a need for Jesus?

Well if your theology is wrong, he came to earth the same reason any of us did. He was born here. There may or may not be a God, but he didn’t send anyone to save anyone.But I’ll go along with your question. Maybe the Bible is right in a theological sense. Maybe God evolved us to a certain point where he basically said okay you’ve developed enough for a soul. Then he breathed a soul into ‘Adam” which could have represented a pair or a group of people.Or it could be as I believe, that we are to the point where we are evolving a soul/spirit as well as a body.I know there are other possibilities but those are the first three that popped into my mind.

I understand your question montalban but you don’t understand my answer. Let me see if I can make it clearer. I’m saying your understanding of theology is wrong in my view. Jesus wasn’t the son of God so he didn’t come for any reason. He was just a man with a great message that was way ahead of his time. But he didn’t save anybody from anything. There never was a first sin so there never was a need to be saved from anything. I understand that is not what YOU believe, but it is what I believe. That’s what I meant by maybe your theology is wrong. Does that explain what I am trying to say.

In reference to the original website you sent me to:I have now been to the website, which is a perfect example that anyone can put one up. That is why I prefer scientific journals and upper level science books for references. If you visit this website and try to click on the links, which he gives as proofs backing up his numbers, all of them are unavailable except one. This one is supposed to be a link to the research of some PhD on the subject when the researcher specifically states the math as proof, however instead it takes you to an assignment for astronomy students at the University of Colorado on surprisingly enough, SN1987A (the second website you sent me to). I find it funny that if you read the background information on the star by the university it does not really correspond to what the original website said. In fact, the original website poster apparently did not do his homework. The description he gives is for that of a right triangle, which the star forms with the earth. The homework page clearly states that this is not the case and the last I checked, you can not plug right triangle trigonometric relationships into a triangle that is clearly not a right triangle. Obviously, the original poster was along the same lines as those people who can use the dimensions of the pyramids to figure out every mathematical function we have ever come up with including the days in the year. However, the homework page does goes on using the same formula used to calculate every stars distance in order to calculate this one. So I suppose if you want to you could say that since we see any starlight that it proves the Bible is wrong. You ask why would god cause the light from stars to be a at different place and assume the only logical response is if He would do this that He would be lying about the age of the earth. I assert that if some one was going to create something that was to have a purpose, it seems to me He would be sure that purpose could be used. God created stars not so that scientists could eventually determine the age of the earth but so that there would be light at night, people could use navigation at night, and so that we could figure out the seasons. If my husband takes my chef's knife and uses it to cut drywall, and it doesn't cut the drywall does that mean the people who made the knife were being deceptive? He can verify that if he did this I would not be calling the company that designed the knife and yelling at them. SN1987A has little other to offer special except that it did not behave like a neutron star that the scientists had initially expected it to become based on the data they had gathered. And it seems to me that the particles reached the ring at a slower rate than what the university professors class had originally predicted it would. I would like to know a little more about how scientists came to their deductions for measuring the distances to stars and how we have measured what the exact speed of light is. Furthermore, I would like to know what slows down a nuclear reaction in a vacuum. (Why didn’t we feel a nuclear blast here on earth from this star going to supernova?) I do not want replies or direction to websites, but if anyone knows a good book that I can read on the subjects, I would appreciate it.

I already said it didn't disprove the bible just the narrow interpretation of a tiny minority of 'christians'. The majority of Christians realise that God's creation is his direct testimony which proves again and again the earth to be ancient, so who are you going to believe, God or a Dr Dino?.Why would God want to put the light closer to Earth apart from to give the false impression of age, if this is true then you are saying God is a liar. "After the progenitor star (known as Sk -69 202; the Sk means Nick Sanduleak catalogued the star) exploded, astronomers measured the time it took for the energy to travel from the star to the primary ring that is around the star. (The ring is quite large, much larger than the "ring" that Neptune makes in its orbit around our own sun.) From this, astronomers determined the actual "height" of the ring from the star. Second, they already knew the angular size of the ring against the sky (as measured through telescopes, and measured most precisely with the Hubble Space Telescope)."Here is a page with a homework problem on SN1987A if you are interested in the details: http://cosmos.colorado.edu/astr1120/homework4/hwk4.html

When God saw that one of his creatures had sufficient intelligence to comprehend various things including Himself, he talked to the guy. God gave the guy some rules. He broke one. Thus, the first sin.

How can you be amazed by that guy when if you follow the homework website your will see his math (as well as some of his claims) is wrong? When someone is given the correct answer, they can arrive at it in many different (often wrong ways). This is why I want a book on how they have determined that intensty can measure star distance. When I was doing the actual homework page, at one point I came up with a number equivalent to 8 +\-1 If I had a variation of that much, I personally would call it a rough estimate and not an exact amount.
attacks
I just started to post that although I believe the evidence of an old earth, we didn't have accurate enough instruments to measure that far. I was thinking of when we use the base of a triangle as the diameter of the earths circle around the sun and checked for parallax. Then I clicked on the link you posted.That was awesome!!! I’m always amazed at the ingenuity of people.

I find your view of God very depressing. "Hmmm you are smart enough now to be dictated by me - don't eat from that one tree."Man sees tree. Man is curious."How dare you disobey me! You are going to Hell!"If I didn't see God as loving and caring; a Being who set down rules for my protection and well-being as well as to give me freedom to choose; a God who like a Father may discipline me for my disoobedience, but will also offer mercy and love no matter what I do (which is how the Bible taken in its entirety portrays Him), I would be very depressed and probably even rebellous about following Him.

I like that you use Galileo as a reference to the sins of the "Church fathers". From your statement, it is obvious you have not really read more than a few sentences about him. The Church (referring specifically to the Catholic one here) did accept what he said. Unfortunately, the other scientists at the University did not like his ideas because he was going against their basic beliefs. Sadly, enough they went to the Church, which was also the law at the time, and they presented a case against Galileo. The Church listened and told Galileo to stop publishing works on the matter, he refused and was condemned for it. The Church goes down in history as being the bad guy and science gets all the credit. I will agree that when the Church bends to the ear of scientists (as it is currently doing with evolution) it tends to go very wrong.As to the whole circle matter, you seem to all think that inspired by God it the same as dictated word for word by God. What makes the Bible unique in it’s writing is that many different people wrote it in many different ways using different styles. Isaiah received his visions from God but after he saw them, he was the one who described what he saw. So did Joshua (or his scribe). (And in the case of Joshua, we do not know if God really did prevent the earth from rotating, or if He preformed the miracle by some other means - sorry I didn't take the course on how the miracles can be scientifically proven). God did not create computers that record whatever you put into them but instead created complex individuals. I am going to try to find out if the website quoted was giving the correct words in Hebrew and will post it later if I do (not that I really want to reopen the whole can of worms on circle, circular, sphere, and ball).
attacks
A circle is not a sphere. The earth looks like a circle from where your standing, not a square. Pancakes are a circle. They're also flat.The Bible also says that God stopped the sun in the sky. It doesn't say he stopped the earth from rotating. That would have been the perfect opportunity to point out that the earth was a sphere. In fact that's one of the verses that the church used to prosecute Galelao.

I am all for creationists forming their own branch of discovering things and not call it science. However, I also believe there are certain strong Christians who are able (and needed) to go to public universities and study the religion of science in an effort to keep up on its current theories and debates so that they can be refuted or at least so that a logical arguement can be presented for God. However, I have read the end of the book, and I know that I am fighting a losing battle.

Ok that theory seems ok until you realise that most stars visible to the nake eye are within 500 light years of earth within our local arm of our galaxy. SN1987A is in a different galaxy one that we could not see without the use of powerful telescopes. Thousands of galaxys containing billions of stars are only visible to the hubble space telescope, did god create them so our space telescopes would have something to look at?. Your explanation has no evidence to support it is completely illogical and is mearly an ad-hoc non-explanation which means you don't have to question your precious mythology.

Hi Priscilla and welcome back. Man you came back with a bang. You have posted several responses and I would like to debate each but it will take some time. But I’ll take them one at a time. For this one, I’m just going to hit the highlights.Where did all the water go? Why did the mist not burn up all life on the planet before the flood due to the greenhouse effect?Are you comparing medicine men with modern medicine? As little as 150 years ago limbs were usually amputated because there was not cure for gangrene. You are not understanding my question. I’m not talking about how long man lived, I’m talking about how much the animals must have changed in the short period of time after they left the ark. Dog kinds turning into foxes and dogs in a few hundred years.Fossils occur because of the circumstances surrounding the death of an animal, it has nothing to do with how fast a migration occurred.You brought up the point that you only considered PhD’s as scientist. I was just stating that the PhD’s say it’s true.
attacks
1. Ah yes, the turmoil, the chaos, it would have been great. I do not think the ark would have been destroyed. The reason I believe a meteor would have had to have struck is because there was a mist that for whatever reason didn't turn into rain. In order to create a raindrop, some sort of pollution is needed as a sort of seed crystal. A meteor would have provided this. (Aside from the fact that we can see fossil evidence that meteors have struck). Now according to evolutionary theory, (well one of them) a meteor was the reason there were mass extinctions. Yet as I stated before in no mass extinction was every form of life wiped out (Too bad people here don't stop debating Darwin's finches and begin debating why in the world blue-green algea which is the evolutionary ancestor of all life has managed to survive throughout the fossil record virtually unchanged while all its more fit ancestors have had to undergo many rapid changes in order to survive.) Anyway, if the ark was placed in a spot far inthe center of say what we now call Africa or Asia and the meteors struck at the edge of the plates, and finally, there were underwater rivers flowing under these plates (based on a Biblical description), then I do not believe the force would have had to be quite as hard as you think. I also do not believe the plates were just shot immediately into their current positions. Throughout the year, they moved to where they are now and then slowed to their current rates of movement.2. Most modern medicine is derived from organic compounds - digitalis (foxglove) for the heart, asprin (willow) for almost everything. An herbalist actually told me the only difference between the natural plant medicine and the manufactured one is that modern medicine causes side effects the plant medicine didn't have (her words not mine). So yes, I believe that Noah could have treated the animals. Look at some of the wounds that "cave men" survived from.3. According to the Bible people didn't begin dying for the first 900 years on earth. I believe that in 900 years, man can cause the complete extinction of many species. With any of the species though, there needed to be a large number of them in order to make a fossil since fossilization doesn't occur easily. So even if humans had just knocked down the dinosaurs numbers dramatically, they would not have necessarily left anymore fossils behind. 4. Since fossilization does occur under only special circumstances, and migrations after the flood would have occurred (relatively) quickly, we would not find migrating fossils.5. Evolution has its own migrations theories (it has to or otherwise they would not be able to explain why the Hawaiian islands have plant and animal species on them). I will try to dig out some rather recent theories, but I know their experimentation on the mangrove islands is one of the experiments they use to back up their beliefs.6.You are right, most phD's do say that evolution is proven by evidence, but even they can be stumped as long as new questions are asked of them. Regardless of their beliefs, I still only consider them to be scientists (which is why I went to my evolution teacher to get clarification on the law question).

I know that. I was talking about what you would expect to see if speciation was happening, not how scientist see evolution.

[QUOTE=Hank]I’m going to I think the following would be a logical progression of living organisms diverging into different species.1. Physical separation of groups of individuals that prevented interbreeding.2. Different environments that produce divergent physical characteristics over time.3. The changes result in some preference to mates based on those divergent physical characteristics.4. Further changes that result in so much preference that groups will not interbreed without definite restraints. For example a solitary pair than cannot find a partner of their group so they interbreed.5. Further changes that result in infertile offspring if restricted to mates.6. Further changes that result in aborted offspring if restricted to mates.7. Further changes that result in no interbreeding of any kind.In Darwin’s finches you can see ever phase listed above. [QUOTE]You realize this is not the way scientists see evolution? Their version is more like this:1. Mutations occur in an organisms DNA causing different characteristics.2. Environmental changes cause certain mutations to be eliminated because of their incompatability with the environment.Repeat steps 1 and 2 until certain mutations have been solidified and two or more of the mutations have developed selectively until they no longer interbreed with the other mutations. The environment doesn't cause the beneficial mutations it only selects which mutations will survive.

[QUOTE=Priscilla2]Very good point. When I did evolution (studied under the head Pre-history) out textbook (quoted earlier) had four competing theories for the ascent of man alone. Each was 'valid' because each involved evolution, all were based on evidences, and even though three were mutually exclusive, (two were similar), they were all taught! Evolutionaries can keep a straight face as they teach things which obviously conflict with each other - their point being, as long as evolution is involved - it's OK.

[QUOTE=iamthetruth]The modern theory of evolution has undergone 140 years of testing. It isnow so well established that its veracity and robustness are accepted as factby the overwhelming majority of scientists in this country and around theworld.

The modern theory of evolution has undergone 140 of changes. That is why it is called the modern theory of evolution, and in another 140 years it will be completely different from our modern theory of evolution. As soon as new evidence is presented that challenges it the theory changes.

SN1987A is a supernova, it's distance calculated by trigonometry means that it would take 168,000 years for light from the supernova to reach earth, therefore the age of the Earth as given by a literal interpretation of the bible cannot possibly be correct. Note this does not prove the whole bible incorrect just the narrow interpretation (rejected by the major churches) of a few people.http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Theb...f/SN1987A.html

Priscilla this shows your misunderstanding of evolution because evolution does not work towards increasing our life span. It works towards increasing the number of genes that are reproduced. Hence, once the reproductive years are past, evolution no longer works on the individual but may work in helping offspring survive. It’s a complicated subject which I am not very knowledgeable about but have just read a few articles on. However I believe there has been some research done in this area.Guilt is a result of our capacity for empathy with others. It could be that evolution developed other characteristics that increase our capacity of empathy during the development of our brain or it could be that it helps in survival of our offspring or it could be as I believe that God is working in our lives or a combination of all of the above.

But animals have no sense of right and wrong. No sense of guilt. What is the evolutionary benefit of guilt which has actually been proven to shorten our lifespan?

As I said, I was amazed by the ingenuity of man, not by that guy. I went through the calculations and got 150,000 years. Considering the amount of judgment that needed to be made on different parts of the solution, that seems pretty good to me. That’s within 12% of the 168,000 year answer which is about the same percentage as your 8 +-1. And I would call it a rough estimate also, but still obviously a whole lot more than 6000 years.I didn’t see where his math was wrong. Can you point it out?

How can you be amazed by that guy when if you follow the homework website your will see his math (as well as some of his claims) is wrong? When someone is given the correct answer, they can arrive at it in many different (often wrong ways). This is why I want a book on how they have determined that intensty can measure star distance. When I was doing the actual homework page, at one point I came up with a number equivalent to 8 +\-1 If I had a variation of that much, I personally would call it a rough estimate and not an exact amount.

If you believe in evolution then everything, every trait is a result.Thus empathy can be said to help us as a species.Whereas with some reptiles, abandoning their young (or lack of empathy) is said to help them survive.Bugs that are brown - survival - hiding from predatoursBugs that are bright orange - surival - tricking predatours into thinking they're poisonous.Evolution is all encompassing.

Priscilla this shows your misunderstanding of evolution because evolution does not work towards increasing our life span. It works towards increasing the number of genes that are reproduced. Hence, once the reproductive years are past, evolution no longer works on the individual but may work in helping offspring survive. It’s a complicated subject which I am not very knowledgeable about but have just read a few articles on. However I believe there has been some research done in this area.Guilt is a result of our capacity for empathy with others. It could be that evolution developed other characteristics that increase our capacity of empathy during the development of our brain or it could be that it helps in survival of our offspring or it could be as I believe that God is working in our lives or a combination of all of the above.

I have no clue as to what you are talking about. It appears that your response is based on what you wanted my post to say rather than what it actually did.

Unless you are so oversexed that people no longer interest you, I don't see how you can say that the diversity offered within the human race is boring. The Bible never says that genetic mutations do not occur, and that everyone should have brown hair and brown eyes and be 5'6" tall.

I could not get two of the links to work but all the rest did.If you are familiar with trigonometry then you must know that the angles of a triangle all add up to 180 degrees. When one of those angles are very small and the other two angles are equal, like in this case, then they will be extremely close to 90 degrees. The difference in the results between using radians, sin, or tan for extremely small angles is in the 4 or more decimal places. Therefore although he used a right triangle which is technically not correct as you stated, is practically correct and is used in many cases in real life. No it doesn’t. You can see that it uses a calculated distance and an angle for a geometric solution whereas brightness and spectral analysis is used in general.Look at the implications of what you are saying. It has been shown by geometry that the star is at least 150,000 light years from earth. According to your theory, it was created 6000 years ago, or something like that, placed 150,000 light years away from earth, then God created the light in between so we on earth could see it. But we saw the star explode. Therefore according to your theory, the star never existed. God just created the light that gives the illusion of a star 6000 light years away from us so that we would see what appears to be a star exploding today. According to this, God has created this elaborate ruse to deceive mankind into thinking the universe is very old according to the evidence. This is what would be prosecuted in our country as fraud. I realize I have no proof of this, but I always consider the God I believe in to be at least as moral as the creatures he created.SN1987A is an amazing observation that verifies vast distances via geometry.The reason we don’t feel a nuclear blast here on earth is the exact same reason you don’t feel a blast from a chemical plant explosion that happens 100 miles away from you. The amount of energy produced by the blast dissipates as the square of the distance from the blast so that by the time it has traveled 100 miles, it’s an insignificant amount of energy that you don’t feel.

In reference to the original website you sent me to:I have now been to the website, which is a perfect example that anyone can put one up. That is why I prefer scientific journals and upper level science books for references. If you visit this website and try to click on the links, which he gives as proofs backing up his numbers, all of them are unavailable except one. This one is supposed to be a link to the research of some PhD on the subject when the researcher specifically states the math as proof, however instead it takes you to an assignment for astronomy students at the University of Colorado on surprisingly enough, SN1987A (the second website you sent me to). I find it funny that if you read the background information on the star by the university it does not really correspond to what the original website said. In fact, the original website poster apparently did not do his homework. The description he gives is for that of a right triangle, which the star forms with the earth. The homework page clearly states that this is not the case and the last I checked, you can not plug right triangle trigonometric relationships into a triangle that is clearly not a right triangle. Obviously, the original poster was along the same lines as those people who can use the dimensions of the pyramids to figure out every mathematical function we have ever come up with including the days in the year. However, the homework page does goes on using the same formula used to calculate every stars distance in order to calculate this one. So I suppose if you want to you could say that since we see any starlight that it proves the Bible is wrong. You ask why would god cause the light from stars to be a at different place and assume the only logical response is if He would do this that He would be lying about the age of the earth. I assert that if some one was going to create something that was to have a purpose, it seems to me He would be sure that purpose could be used. God created stars not so that scientists could eventually determine the age of the earth but so that there would be light at night, people could use navigation at night, and so that we could figure out the seasons. If my husband takes my chef's knife and uses it to cut drywall, and it doesn't cut the drywall does that mean the people who made the knife were being deceptive? He can verify that if he did this I would not be calling the company that designed the knife and yelling at them. SN1987A has little other to offer special except that it did not behave like a neutron star that the scientists had initially expected it to become based on the data they had gathered. And it seems to me that the particles reached the ring at a slower rate than what the university professors class had originally predicted it would. I would like to know a little more about how scientists came to their deductions for measuring the distances to stars and how we have measured what the exact speed of light is. Furthermore, I would like to know what slows down a nuclear reaction in a vacuum. (Why didn’t we feel a nuclear blast here on earth from this star going to supernova?) I do not want replies or direction to websites, but if anyone knows a good book that I can read on the subjects, I would appreciate it.

I think that the first person who raised the issue of SN1987A said that it was conclusive proof that the Bible is wrong.You acknowledge that a possibility might exist - albeit from a deceptive God.Therefore it is not 'proof that the Bible is wrong'.That you should think God is deceptive is, as you say, not based on proof.Why is it a fraud? Logically the whole of nature that you conclude to be evolved is a 'fraud' because God created it in such a manner that people can interpret it to be evolved! God, according to you, should have created things in such a manner as there could be no doubt that they were created - perhaps if we all bore a little stamp "Made by God".

monty, you seem unable to apply logic to the topic.The measurements provided by SN1987A demonstrate that the event occurred about 160,000 years ago. A literal interpretation of the information provided in the bible, made famous by Bishop Ussher, gives an age of the universe of 6,000 years old. Do Orthodox authorities believe a different age of the earth? Therefore, one of these figures is wrong and the foundations underlying that figure are wrong. Creationists of course assume that conventional science is wrong and dream up all sorts of scenarios to try and fit an apparently 160,000 year old event into a 6,000 year old universe. These fantasies involve either changing the laws of physics (changing speed of light etc.) or claiming that their creator created the universe whith the appearance of age and light from the instantly created stars and galaxies. This becomes a theological problem for events such as SN1987A. This would involve the creator creating light in transit which describes a false history ie. the appearance of an event 154,000 years old at the beginning of the universe. Usually this is referred to as lying. As the bible is the inspired word of god, the liar would be...Now, what is the monty explanation for the SN1987A event?

Well you didn’t offend me. I have tried to explain before that I am not easily offended and consider sarcasm as a form of kidding around. I’m a kind of ‘sticks and stones’ philosophy type of guy. However if facetious is something you are more comfortable with, lets use facetious instead of sarcastic. I’m flexible. Okay but I’m not going to change the way I converse because you have a problem with it. I don’t understand why you keep asking me why God sent Jesus when I have clearly stated that I don’t believe God sent him.That’s not true. Most people are not even Christian and last survey I saw I believe only about 50% of Christians believed in the deity of Jesus. However I don’t believe his message was his deity, but how mankind should treat his fellow man. And I believe he conveyed that message just as others like him have conveyed the same message.I never said that. I said, quote:“At the risk of offending you which is not my intent, my experience has been that people who have trouble with math have trouble with logic. I’m trying to understand where you are coming from.”And I was careful to point out that it was my experience, not something that had been proved by any research.

I am not trying to be sarcastic; but you may have perceived that I was - so I'm sorry for that. And actually reading it again, I'd say it's more akin to being facetious than sarcastic; and I don't think sarcasm's a valid form of debate... unless you're friends with the other person and you know how they will take it.I also don't mean to be putting words into your mouth - so when I call him a 'dude' I am trying to ascertain what it is that you think Jesus was doing here....Also I don't think it's cultural. I am, as I said, highly pedantic. I try to say what I mean. Another poster on another thread has read into my posting of a question some kind of conspiracy or trap. I have said that it's not. And it's not.And you have what is to me a flippant approach.Why'd God send him - just as a messenger/guru?If so, then obviously as a messenger, He's failed, becuase most of us believe He's the Son of God sent here to end death.PSLogic is not the sole domain of science.

That has nothing to do with me.Anything is possible if you just say don't look at the evidence just take my word for it that that's the way God did it. But I don't believe God is deceptive.Never said it was. But it is proof that the interpretation that the earth is 6k years old is wrong. Unless you want to believe that God is deceptive.I do not believe that God is deceptive. What I said was that I DIDN’T believe that God was deceptive but I couldn’t prove that.Why is it a fraud? Well because if the earth is 6000 years old, then God gave evidence that it is a lot older. What’s so difficult about understanding that?I have no idea what you are talking about. I don’t even understand what you are saying.I believe we are made by God. But if you are talking about being poofed into existence, how about just simply having ‘kinds’ with completely different DNA that is not even remotely similar to other ‘kinds’ and that never changes.

The light from SN1987A included a component from the radioactive decay of a cobalt isotope which matched the present half-life for radioactive decay of the cobalt isotope.

By the way, WJA et al, I am just following your rules for debate.I posted some time ago my pet theory on the non-evolution of language. Always, you guys objected saying that I couldn't absolutely rule out that complex language might have evolved.Likewise, you can't possibly now begrudge me saying that the light from this star was created in transit, by God. You can't rule it out (unless you don't believe in God). Otherwise you're going to have to do the ol' prove a negative.

I don't think you are claiming that the information is false.It is just as valid for me to say that God created the light in transit, with those cobalt isotopes in place too.This is not 'false' information. It is information. You claim not to believe in God, but are prepared to gues that the motives of this God that you believe in were dark. This is, to me, a very strange standpoint. It's like me saying that 'Dragons never existed, but if they did, they must have flown around and cause great mischief'.This is a very interesting question. You are asking me if God told me something; the same God you don't believe exists. How could you ask me if I've been told something that is, by your own rationale, impossible?Which theory do you hold to for the rise of Man? (which school of thought?) Obviously the others must be false (or probably false). But they are accepted by evolutionaries.My ideas are not 'peculiar'. There are more Orthodox than all but one group of Christians. Millions of non-Christians don't believe in evolution (Muslims for instance). Peculiar is a loaded choice of word that reflects your philosophical view-point; that only your view-point is correct; that is black vs. white / right vs. wrong. Millions of Hindus, pagans etc, all have theistic views on the origins of life. What is 'peculiar' about that?Self-consistent? Is that the same as consistent? There's only one major thing consistent in evolution; lack of God - or, a naturalistic materialistic explanation for things. I've shown heaps of conflicting theories that are still 'good' evolution.There's theories of fast evolution, slow evolution and in between - punctuated evolution. All are evolution. Some have more support than others. All are backed by well-meaning and learned people.Which philosophical school do you adhere to?Your falsifying theory is based on the an issue that if you can find one well-meaning and learned interpretation of the Bible, found to be a mistake, then the whole thing must be called into question. Should I remind you here (or later :) ) about the various theories within evolution 'based on the evidences' that have come and gone?There are well-meaning and learned people everywhere.You are correct. I disagree with them. I am a well-meaning and learned person :) There are many on the other side.That's not what I'm arguing. The argument put forward was that the discovery of this star 'disproves' the Bible. It doesn't.I'm not arguing that the Bible says the world is 12 billion years either. I've addressed the issue that concerned me, someone's philosophical assumption that the Bible is wrong because of the discovery of this star.Do you believe that the discovery of this star has falsified the Bible?

My reference to math being related to logic has been brought up a few times so I would like to explain in more detail. My actual statement was in reply to montalban in which I said “At the risk of offending you which is not my intent, my experience has been that people who have trouble with math have trouble with logic.” I was careful to state that it was “my experience”. I have been in the engineering field for 30 years and during that time I have trained probably 15 young engineers. I also work with other engineers as well as managers, administrators and others in various fields. Engineers are required to take a lot of math since engineering is basically just applied mathematics. At some point, I began to see a pattern in how people from different fields tended to view logical subjects. Such as understanding a simple relation between the reactions of a structure to the loads applied to that structure. Because I’m basically the type of person that likes things to be structured, I started asking the math question and I found the correlation to be quite strong. If a manager had been good in math, he/she had no trouble with that type of concept. It not, then he/she had trouble. It was not related to intelligence as most of the people I have worked with have been intelligent. Some of those that had trouble with logical concepts were extremely intelligent. I think logic is more of a gift or talent. For instance I might write a novel, but I will never write a good novel because I don’t have that talent. That doesn’t mean I’m not intelligent, just that my talents lie in different areas. There are a few things that I do very well, but most things I’m average or below average. So I didn’t mean that as an insult or a reflection on someone’s intelligence, just as my observation on someone’s ability to understand logical concepts. I will add two more things. I have found that a high ratio of left-handed people relative to the general left-handed population, are good in the technical areas, especially women. The other thing is that I once tried to train an engineer who could not grasp logical concepts. He was a very good person, had an outstanding memory, and was the hardest working person I had ever worked with. I was stunned at his lack of understanding the concepts of mathematics. I worked with him for four years and he never made any progress. I came to finally understand that the only way he got through engineering school was that he was such a hard worker, that he would memorize every engineering problem he could find for a test. Then he would do fairly well. But if someone changed the concept of the problem, he was lost. It was a mind-boggling experence.You may be politically correct but that is just not true. Some people are born with very low IQ’s. Those people are not going to do math or most things well regardless of how much they are trained. The person I just referred to is never going to understand engineering principals. He has a lot of training, but it’s just not within his capacity. I am never going to write a best selling novel because I just don’t have that kind of imagination. I agree with you that sometimes someone does not do well in math because they have not be taught properly. But sometimes people do not do well in math because they don’t have talent in that area and no amount of training is going to make them good at math, although anyone can improve some. And I understand you saying that you think it is unfair for me to make the statement that math and logic are related, but that doesn’t mean it’s not true.

[QUOTE=Hank]I understand you don’t agree with me. I can’t help it if you’re poor in math, which is based on logic. What’s suspect about that?[QUOTE]You made an earlier statement along the lines of some people can only go so far in math. You also relate ones ability to do logic with math. These are stereotypes. My husband who is highly intellegent and even more logical than I am hates math with a passion. I have pursued math up to the calculus level and although I consider myself very logical (I enjoy doing logic problems and cryptology for fun) I am obviously very illogical at times (because he often points this out to me although since I am illogical, I don't always believe him;-). I believe that every human has the potential from birth to become highly intellegent and posses the abilities to do math and wnything else they want to. However, everyone needs to be taught differently. Athough I love math, I think very abstractly and also love abstract art, poetry, and music. (People who learn about all the things I have done often ask, is there anything you haven't done?) So although relating math to logic seems logical, I think it is unfair of you to make the statement that someone who has not done well in math does not think as logically as someone else. A better statement in my mind is that someone who has not done well in math (and enjoyed it) has not been taught properly.

Actually although I’m certainly not an expert on the life of Galileo, I have read a fair amount about this interesting event.Yes the Catholic church is the one that tried him, however Martin Luther also ridiculed Galileo for saying that the earth rotated around the sun and quoted the same bible verses to prove him wrong. I can provide quotes if you need me to.That is quite wrong. Galileo was not the first person to believe that the earth rotated around the sun. It was called the geocentric (Copernican) theory. And the official church dogma was that the earth was the center of the universe and immovable. Galileo not only stated that the Copernican theory was correct but pushed the issue. That started the confrontation that ended in him being turned over to the Inquisition that found him guilty of heretical teachings. It had nothing to do with ‘scientist’ convincing the church as the doctrine was established based on the interpretation of the Bible at the time and all ‘scientific’ thought had to agree with that interpretation, the main cause of what is called the dark ages. The first attacks against Galileo came from a Dominican friar and professor of history and the notion that it was the fault of ‘scientist’ influencing the church is a fairly recent distortion of the facts to try and excuse the behavior of the church. The Bible is an excellent recording of Jewish history for the time of it’s writing. It also conveys the evolution of the Jewish faith and their developing understanding of God. It is not a scientific book and trying to use it as such only degrades the real value of this important work.I thought you stated that you would not use miracles for explanations of physical events. Miracles can not be scientifically proven simply because they are supernatural with is outside the realm of science.

I like that you use Galileo as a reference to the sins of the "Church fathers". From your statement, it is obvious you have not really read more than a few sentences about him. The Church (referring specifically to the Catholic one here) did accept what he said. Unfortunately, the other scientists at the University did not like his ideas because he was going against their basic beliefs. Sadly, enough they went to the Church, which was also the law at the time, and they presented a case against Galileo. The Church listened and told Galileo to stop publishing works on the matter, he refused and was condemned for it. The Church goes down in history as being the bad guy and science gets all the credit. I will agree that when the Church bends to the ear of scientists (as it is currently doing with evolution) it tends to go very wrong.As to the whole circle matter, you seem to all think that inspired by God it the same as dictated word for word by God. What makes the Bible unique in it’s writing is that many different people wrote it in many different ways using different styles. Isaiah received his visions from God but after he saw them, he was the one who described what he saw. So did Joshua (or his scribe). (And in the case of Joshua, we do not know if God really did prevent the earth from rotating, or if He preformed the miracle by some other means - sorry I didn't take the course on how the miracles can be scientifically proven). God did not create computers that record whatever you put into them but instead created complex individuals. I am going to try to find out if the website quoted was giving the correct words in Hebrew and will post it later if I do (not that I really want to reopen the whole can of worms on circle, circular, sphere, and ball).

No I’m saying that interpreting the Bible as saying the earth is 6k years old is false.Whew! I think that catches me up.

There are two mistakes in my previous post.I meant to say "Many theistic evolutionaries DO believe in an old earth".AndI did not mean to misrepresent you. I misunderstood you. You seem to be saying that God is no a liar, but the Bible is... because it's giving a false representation of God's many yeared universe.

You have read only standard anti-religious tracts.Try...http://www.facingthechallenge.org/galileo1.htmGalileo was ordered not to teach. That was it. He wasn't ordered not to teach a particular thing.

Cool.That then should debunk the notion put forward earlier that the discovery of a particular star obilterates the Bible.I was wondering why this particular star's discovery is used as an example, anyway. Surely, all you'd need to find is a star 8,000 light years away - surely this would show that the world's not 7,000 years old. Why that particular author decided that only now they've discovered a star that disproves the Bible is quite odd.

For some reason you keep replying to my post with this concept. I continue to say that as far as my thinking goes, it only falsifies the 6k year old universe theory that some people attribute to the Bible.I thought you were following this thread. Okay up until this time, scientist only had subjective ways to check the distance to the stars. Although the evidence was very convincing, young earth creationist always argued that using spectral analysis and brightness was subject to interpretation. And because the stars were so far away, we only had instruments that would measure about 500 light years by using triangulation, which is a direct form of measurement. This star gave scientist a direct measurement that is difficult to argue against. Young earth creationist will really have to torture the evidence to explain not only the 168,000 light year distance but the fact that it shows an exploding star that happened 168,000 thousand years ago. It also verifies the spectral analysis and brightness procedure.

First, I personally never said the speed of light has changed over the years. I simply asked for a book that could explain to me how we can calculate the speed of something that moves 186,000 m/s. Especially since nothing else moves this fast. If no one can provide me with a book, I will look it up and figure it out myself. I have no doubt the scientists have some logical explaination.Second, it is easy for Biblical scholars to have different ages for the earth simply because years and dates are not recorded all throught the books of the Bble. Scholars guess based on undated geneologies (i.e.well that person couldn't have lived more than 160 years so...) The book of Judges, though, is completely undated and so are various other parts of the Bible. We don't even know really how many years were between Isaac and Joseph and that all lies in Genesis.

The light from SN1987A included a component from the radioactive decay of a cobalt isotope which matched the present half-life for radioactive decay of the cobalt isotope. The rate of decay is dependent on c, the speed of light. Therefore the speed of light has not changed over the last 160,000 years, whether by natural forces or act of god. Does that mean that you rely on your god creating light in transit bearing false information?Yes, I've noticed your willingness to believe in your god despite self-consistent evidence to support a naturalistic explanation. Did your god tell you that he represented falsehoods by creating the light in transit for a fictional event? Is a god creating falsehoods consistent with your version of god?No, it is argument between a self-consistent scientific explanation and your peculiar religious ideas. I'm sure that Bishop Ussher and co. were sincere in their endeavours to determine the age of the earth from the information in the bible. Does this mean that the bible cannot be reliably interpreted by knowledgeable, sincere believers? Surely creationists have analysed the same bible to redo the calculations. Do creationists hold an alternative age for the universe? It would seem to be the reading of many people.Your subsequent correction to the above is noted. But, do you believe theistic evolutionists are correct? I think not. You seem to follow a young earth creationist doctrine, so the point above is irrelevent to your position. Does monty have an interpretation of the bible which comes up with a universe about 12 billion years old?

1.I know you don't believe this, but just work with me a minute Hank and for one second believe the enitire Bible is true. If that is the case, then all the prophesies of the O.T. predicted the Messiah would come to save us from our sins. Jesus not only walked a blameless life to be the sacrifice for our sins, but He also did an uncountable amount of miracles to prove to those around Him that He was the Messiah and He was the Son of God. All those people had the same scriptures. They studied them and believed them without a doubt, yet even though they proved that Jesus was the one waited for, none of them could see even after He rose again. Even Paul couldn't see until Jesus finally appeared to Him. Now God gives us the Bible which basically answers the most important things about how we can better serve Him. Keep in mind that the Bible clearly states that God wants to save as much of His creation as possible, but scientists have figured out how old the earth should be in their eyes which is insignificant in Gods eyes since He already knows, and they say that God is wrong because their calculations do not add up to His. The Sanhedrin thought it had everything figured out too and that Jesus was not who He claimed to be. Scientists admit they can make errors and their theories change to reflect any errors they detect. Because even scientists spend many hours arguing over how many billions of years old things are, I find it as difficult to accept their ages based on whatever, as you and the others here find my method just as difficult to accept. 2. If I am remembering all my genetics correctly, all DNA has to be similar in some way shape or form. The nucleotides form just the right amount of base pairs to code for all the things our cells need. The furthest difference you can find in DNA is between the circular bacterial DNA and our own paired version. In my opinion (based on what I know of genetics) God could not have created DNA any differently because no other chemicals would have allowed it to work correctly.

That has nothing to do with me.Anything is possible if you just say don't look at the evidence just take my word for it that that's the way God did it. But I don't believe God is deceptive.Never said it was. But it is proof that the interpretation that the earth is 6k years old is wrong. Unless you want to believe that God is deceptive.I do not believe that God is deceptive. What I said was that I DIDN’T believe that God was deceptive but I couldn’t prove that.Why is it a fraud? Well because if the earth is 6000 years old, then God gave evidence that it is a lot older. What’s so difficult about understanding that?I have no idea what you are talking about. I don’t even understand what you are saying.I believe we are made by God. But if you are talking about being poofed into existence, how about just simply having ‘kinds’ with completely different DNA that is not even remotely similar to other ‘kinds’ and that never changes. And that’s only one simple thing. That would be a little stamp “Poofed by God”.

I believe that people with low IQ's can be taught to do well in math simply because of the work of Maria Montessori. She only worked with those who were in the low IQ range and since they all did well, that is where I get my statement about learning styles. I have also worked with children who have severe learning disablilites such as autism and very server developmental problems. While some could not physically meet up with learning demands, all of them showed a marked increase in development after the proper kind of therapy.As to the man you worked with, he seems to have gone his whole life not learning abstract thought (not logic). Their are six different levels of learning in Blooms taxonomy and within each of these is four subcatagories. There are quite a few steps of learning between remember and create and in order to get him up on the create level you would have had to start by teaching him the next step, but it is impossible for people to jump from step one to six without going in between. I am working with a girl right now who should be at a sixth grade level and so far had only learned how to remember. She also learns best through kinetic and auditory stimulus which makes things very difficult. However, I have manged thus far to get her from a third grade level to a fourth grade level and am working on getting her to think at higher levels. I will let you know if my experiment turns out a failure (if I still write here when I have finished with her).True you may never write a novel, but you dream at night, so I assume you have some sort of imagination. Do not sell yourself short, you may at least write a manual on training engineers someday:-).

The person I just referred to is never going to understand engineering principals. He has a lot of training, but it’s just not within his capacity. I am never going to write a best selling novel because I just don’t have that kind of imagination. I agree with you that sometimes someone does not do well in math because they have not be taught properly. But sometimes people do not do well in math because they don’t have talent in that area and no amount of training is going to make them good at math, although anyone can improve some. And I understand you saying that you think it is unfair for me to make the statement that math and logic are related, but that doesn’t mean it’s not true.

Once again I use Encarta, I am planning to read a book entitled Galileo in the future, but I haven't gotten to it yet. I know that he was not the first, however, the members at the university were the ones who didn't approve of the idea, and they went to the bishop. Perhaps Encarta has been corrupted by the Catholic church. I find it odd that Galileo recanted, yet Joan of Arc (in the end) did not. I never claim that the Bible is scientific, how ever I do say it is a historical document and the majority of the events within it can be proven to have happened through other sources.I do not use miracles for explanations of physical events. I merely stated that I did not take a class in it. At the state university which I attended, my developmental biology teacher considered herself to be a Christian who believed in evolution. Since I was the only student in the class who held to my beliefs not only was I laughed at, but she felt that she needed to take me under her wing and convince me differently. Nothing much came of our talks except that she at one point she informed me of this class which was offered that used science to prove the miracles of Jesus. It is not what you think, but more of a Jesus walked on a sand bar not the water/ God created the world in 6 theoretical days sort of thing. That is why it never interested me, but obviously some scientist had to sit down and figure out enough of it to fill a class, so I know there are scientific explainations for some of the miracles. HOwever, when you deal with creation and the age of the earth, if you are going to combat it with the way science dates the earth, I will use a way that both the Bible can be right and science can be right. This is why I see nothing wrong with believe that God can create starlight without stars simply for our enjoyment. Someone may ask, although they haven't yet, why didn't he just make them closer to the earth? For some reaon I personally would find this more logical than "if God did that He would be a liar". since God didn't say starlight has to be so old because you can calculate the speed of light in thus and such away, and then use that to figure out the age of the earth, I don't see Him as being a liar.

Actually although I’m certainly not an expert on the life of Galileo, I have read a fair amount about this interesting event.Yes the Catholic church is the one that tried him, however Martin Luther also ridiculed Galileo for saying that the earth rotated around the sun and quoted the same bible verses to prove him wrong. I can provide quotes if you need me to.That is quite wrong. Galileo was not the first person to believe that the earth rotated around the sun. It was called the geocentric (Copernican) theory. And the official church dogma was that the earth was the center of the universe and immovable. Galileo not only stated that the Copernican theory was correct but pushed the issue. That started the confrontation that ended in him being turned over to the Inquisition that found him guilty of heretical teachings. It had nothing to do with ‘scientist’ convincing the church as the doctrine was established based on the interpretation of the Bible at the time and all ‘scientific’ thought had to agree with that interpretation, the main cause of what is called the dark ages. The first attacks against Galileo came from a Dominican friar and professor of history and the notion that it was the fault of ‘scientist’ influencing the church is a fairly recent distortion of the facts to try and excuse the behavior of the church. The Bible is an excellent recording of Jewish history for the time of it’s writing. It also conveys the evolution of the Jewish faith and their developing understanding of God. It is not a scientific book and trying to use it as such only degrades the real value of this important work.I thought you stated that you would not use miracles for explanations of physical events. Miracles can not be scientifically proven simply because they are supernatural with is outside the realm of science.

The actual question is not whether or not the Catholics recorded the trial correctly. The question is who brought it to the attention of the church that this man needed to be warned about his manner of thinking. He was specifically warned by the Church not to publish anything. His guilt lie in that he published the Cop. Theo. after he was forbidden to by the church. No one is debating whether the church tried him and found him guilty. There reasons for finding him guilty were of course because he obviously did something against the Bible (they were the state church; they had to find a religious reason).

Well if you will take a look at when I brought it up, you will see. Are you beginning to see the rational behind my comment on math relating to logical analysis? It’s not your intelligence I question, it’s your ability to follow a logical thought process.Well if you want to present evidence that the church could not accurately chronicle their own trials then I’m open to reviewing that evidence. LOLIf even one interpretation of the Bible was false, all others are suspect.

No, in fact I believe that because Trpy existed, Achilles really did injure Aphrodite in human form during the battle, and that Zeus and Hera intervened as they saw fit.Of course there is 'history' in the bible - otherwise, it would be a totaL fabrication. However, as you have unwittingly admitted, simply because places exist/existed there is no reason nor rationale to conclude that the supernatural myths that arose around these places and peoples are true.
attacks
Sad how people who allude to being intellegent call everything the Bible says mythology, when PhD historians from state universities admit there is more history than "mythology" in the Bible. I suppose you still believe that Homer only wrote myths and Troy never existed also?

I understand this works:Cover a plate with marshmallows. Put it in your microwave, no turning kind, and cook until you see little burnt black marks on the tops of the marshmallows. Measure the distance between the black marks, which is the one half wave length. Multiply the wave length (twice the distance) times the operating frequency of your microwave and you will have a measurement of the speed of light since speed is equal to the wavelength times the frequency.One of the original ways was by using light that was reflected off spinning and stationary mirrors and checking the angle of the change in the light path against the geometry of the setup.
attacks
First, I personally never said the speed of light has changed over the years. I simply asked for a book that could explain to me how we can calculate the speed of something that moves 186,000 m/s. Especially since nothing else moves this fast. If no one can provide me with a book, I will look it up and figure it out myself. I have no doubt the scientists have some logical explaination.Second, it is easy for Biblical scholars to have different ages for the earth simply because years and dates are not recorded all throught the books of the Bble. Scholars guess based on undated geneologies (i.e.well that person couldn't have lived more than 160 years so...) The book of Judges, though, is completely undated and so are various other parts of the Bible. We don't even know really how many years were between Isaac and Joseph and that all lies in Genesis.

Don't be stupid. Of course I do. But my beliefs don't involve unseen planets or life on them. My beliefs don't involve global floods for which that is no evidence. And my beliefs aren't about two different creation stories from the mythology of bronze age nomadic herdsmen.Most of all, my beliefs don't involve subjects that I spent some years studying that are based on empirical observation. In all those years of study I didn't believe anything my teachers said.So what is your point? Why misrepresent what I have said? I never even hinted at what you asserted. Can't you actually address the issues?You seem to have degenerated into the "Oh yeah" mode of creationism spew.

Your statements seem to indicate that we now know a very detailed history of evolution. I was not aware of this, please give me some examples. I don't think it follows that because we can't create complex life, it must have been a greater creator, God. At one point man did not understand electricity, could not create electricity, therefore does it follow that the primitive people who attributed it to the gods were right because they couldn't create lightning bolts? This is a God of the Gaps arguement, if/when we can create complex cells and lifeforms, does this disprove creationism? As for a 'very detailed history of evolution' how detailed are you talking about? Take a look at the fossils for reptile to mammal evolution, or the evolution of the whale, or human evolution. I think examples such as these and hundreds more overwhelmingly support the theory of evolution. Incremental changes, selected for by the environment over generations can radically change organisms, complexity can dramatically increase. And while we can see many of the mechanisms of evolution at work, there is still no evidence of supernatural intervention.However, there would be no natural selection before there was any life at all, so the first life would have had to be perfectly random. Also, though natural selection could be non-random, it is certainly not creative or intelligent (unless you want to start speaking of it as Nature, as some evolutionists understadably do) so I hold that even a psuedo-random force is very unlikely to have caused the kind of complexity we see in life. Firstly sorry about the ignorant crack I made, I'm not here to insult. (And I even spelled it wrong, talk about 'igonorance'......)And the formation of life isn't part of the theory of evolution. Since we don't know the exact conditions when life first formed, we can't know how random it was. As for natural selection, no of course it isn't creative or intelligent. But for the myriad ecological niches, changing environments, I think it is the best explaination. The fact that evolution uses what works and doesn't somehow design the best systems and adaptations for any given environment, to me, is evidence that an unintelligent force has shaped the diversity of life on the planet, not a creative, omniscient creator.Creation has been observed, it is a fact. Neither statement makes a good arguement, do they? I have to disagree with you here. Evolution has been observed, mutations that cause the change, the environment that they express themselves in. We can point to it and study it. But I have yet to see a creationist point to a specific organism and say "See, this is an example of creation because...." and then give a plausible explaination.Again, I am not aware of all this evidence. Why would a random, or sortofnotrandom force explain the stunning diversity and beauty of our planet better than a superintelligent, creative God? Its not debating when you say you're right and I'm wrong. I think your ignorance of the Bible is showing. For one example, multiple times in the bible it says God stretched out the heavens, in the same sense as expanding a tent. It seems to me that these prophets knew about the Big Bang a long time before our scientists did. A non random force acting on an uncountable number of ecological niches that periodically change, sometimes dramatically, would produce a stunning array of diversity. As for evidence, look at the fossil record, we see a progression of change, we don't see static creatures that suddenly appear and show no signs of evolution. We don't see a mixture of older, more primitive organisms with modern organisms, the fossil record is in a temporal order that is predicted by the theory of evolution. Genetics shows organisms that we observe to be closely related are genetically more similar, just as the theory of evolution predicts.As for my ignorance of the Bible, well, I've read it more than few times.I still don't believe it is a book of science and I don't think the prophets had any idea of modern scientific theories. I think it takes a whole lot of rationalization say that a spreading tent describes the Big Bang.

Therein lies the problem, you have beliefs and 2000yrs of church tradition and I have knowledge based on science, fact and empirical data.Your church traditions are just that, traditions. It doesn't make them right. Just because you do something the same way over and over again doesn't make it right. "We always do it this way" is a common refrain. "why do you do it this way? I don't know it's just the way we do it" is not really a good explanation now is it and that Monty ,is really all you are doing, just following the crowd.Your bleatings and whinging about the minutae and details of evolution are pathetic.Facts Monty, where are they. Don't try to side step the issue by saying you offered them, you never did. Your church fathers are as ignorant about science and evolution as you are and it seems, want to be.Facts. where are they? I've got them, where are yours.

Another way to look at it might be - 2,000 years of tradition - why abandon it on whimsical ideas - such as evolution which has 'facts' different now to the ones it had 20 years ago, 100 years ago, 120 years ago. You've got facts, and in the future, you'll have others too. So what?It seems a bit silly to me if someone will attack my viewpoint and defend their own, and then in some years their viewpoint will be different."Oh, sure" you'll say, "We taught then that the world was 'x' years old, but now it's 'y'.""Oh, sure... we ridiculed you before for not believing in slow evolution, but now, we don't believe it either - it's punctuated evolution (and in a few decades it might be something different).Yes, don't let your facts get in the way.
