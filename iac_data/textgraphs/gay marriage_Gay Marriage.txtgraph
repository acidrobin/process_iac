Gay Marriage

First of all, we are supposed to be introducing ourselves, not starting up a topic. But let me kill two birds with one stone here.Hi everyone, I'm new here. And I love to debate. I got kicked out of one debate, because I won the debate on linguistics, and the girl got mad, because she lost, and banned me from the froum. Hopefully no one here is as immature as that. But anyway, thats my story, I'm glad to be here. And I'm ready to debate. And here is my first victim.I'm against gay marriages. Why?! Because in order to mantain a healthy environment for children.(which they always seem to want to adopt) there has to be a healthy relationship. Now a child grows up, and sees two men/women dating eachother. That can confuse the child as to whether they should also be gay. It is not only harmful to the family environment, but also to society. And don't hand me that," My uncle is gay." Stuff. I had(he passed away) a gay uncle, have three gay cousins, and a gay aunt. Not my whole family is not gay, but it seems like I have quite a few in my family. Now I don't support what they do. Even though I love them because they are my family, I would not support them if they were to marry.

Wow - you win debates? Do you always use fallacies like these?1 - People don't decide to be gay. They simply are. Its one of those uncontrollables. There are plenty straight kids who were raised by one or more gay parents (my friends partner even has straight kids and even biological grandchildren), and there are a plethera of gay people who were raised by straight parents. Or are you saying Dick Cheney is really gay?2 - Outside of the fallacy above you fail to explain how gay relationships are harmful. 3 - Not all marriages produce or adopt children. Not all children were produced by married couples. (The upshot of this being that marriage is one thing and parenting another.)And since we are whipping out fmaily ties. My son's father is gay - and I really don't think you want to go rounds with me on whether his influence has been positive, marvelous, miraculous and amazing or, to quote you, "destructive and confusing".

Yes I do win some. You want to try me?! I specified a specific debate that I won, if you wanna go head to head, then why not take me on in that linguistic debate challenge that I made. Since your so sure I don't win debates. If not, then lets not make assumsions on who can win a debate or not. Also, I'm in it because I love it. Not to win it, but on occation it dose happen.First of all I don't like politics, so talking to me about Dick Cheney is to no avail. I don't know anything about him.

If a child is not born being able to speak, how dose it know to look at anothr boys diaper?! Come on! Theres one flaw in your statement. Being gay is a learned behavior, and a prefference. Also, you are only quoting the people you know. They don't even make up 1% of the population of children that grow up with gay parents, or visa versa.I did so. I stated that it is harmful to rearing children. Read my posts carefully please. How can marriage be seperate from parenting?! Also polls have shown, that 95% of gay partners adopt children. They want to make their marriage complete by either, having a child, or adopting one.I think I hear a bell dinging!! Ding! Ding! Let the round begin. Your giving me the invite, and I'm willing to take it.Now I'm not going to make any comments on your ex, or whatever he is to you. Because I don't know him enough to assume anything about him. But I will make general statements on the effects of gay marriages on children.I have seen so many documents, on teens the are confused about their sexual orintation, because of living i the house with their gay parents. On girl wondered if she was gay because her mother was with another woman. She felt that was normal behavior. And started to concider being with girls herself. But was confused when she started to like men. She actually thought that liking men was abnormal. Until others told her it is normal to like men.A boy had almost the same experience, he did not know if he too should like men, because his father did. Often he would fight back desires for females, because he thought he needed to be with men. Not only that by he was ridculed by classmates because of his father being gay.Alot of children endure harassment because of living in a house made up of parents of the same sex. Just because it did not happen to your son, dose not mean that it dose not happen. And your experience is only a fraction of 1% of the experiences that children go through because of having gay parents. It is impossible to say that it dose not happen. If it dose not happen to a few, then thats fine. But the majority suffers, and that far outweighs the few that don't suffer because of having gay parents.

And what evidence do you have that having two gay parents would confuse a child about weahter they should be gay? Did you know that the same percentage of children that were brought up by gay couples turn out to be gay as children who are brought up by straight couples? I would say that destroys your conception that the kid would be confused.I know a number of people who were brought up by commited gay couples (admittedly not many), and not one of the ones I know turned out to be gay.

I asked you a question. Did you use fallacies in those that you won?His daughter is a lesbian. Yeah, the hundreds of gay people I have encountered who told me it wasn't a choice. Did you choose to be straight? I sure didn't. As pesky as they are - boys turn me on. Well - boys and Angelina Jolie.It's not really for sale. Anyway, how/why it happens - nature/nurture is a hotly debated and undertimed. What - did someone have to teach you how/when/where to be turned on? Who taught you to be straight? To look at boys?It's only a flaw if I agree with your conclusion. I do not.You ask me for studies and then offer no evidence yourself? Since we are all going on what we personally believe - I believe gay is not a choice because gay people told me so. Call me whacky, but I would assume they would know more about it than anti-gay heterosexuals. You didn't even do that - you just stated personal opinion. At least I did quote people know. Re-read my statement and note the bolded:Outside of the fallacy above you fail to explain how gay relationships are harmful. (Granted, you do touch on this in your second post - but you did not in your first.)Never met childless married couples? Single mothers? You need to get out more.Many people feel that having a child will help make their lives complete. My son makes my life complete. Is this some sort of character flaw?You really want to debate me about the affects of my personal experiences? My ex is not my son's father. My son's father is dear friend, spent many years as his mentor and adopted him in a second-parent adoption last spring. Just so you have the story right.links?If these tales are true (which I doubt) - sounds like they were raised by XXXXXX or kept in a box where they saw nothing of the world. Heterosexuality is hardly some big secret.My son (not just some kid) MY SON is a pre-teen boy who spends half his time with his dad and his dad's partner and is absolutely aware that boys and girls like each other, too. He also has no trouble crushing on Beyonce Knowles.Oh it has happened. But that is not a problem with my son, me or his father - it is a problem for the pathetic hate-mongers who carried out the acts of harrassment. Where are you getting these percentages from??? And its 'does', not 'dose'.But why take my word for anything? Since we are talking about children, lets take a look at what pediatricians (the American Academy of Pediatrics) say. http://aappolicy.aappublications.org...rics;109/2/339http://pediatrics.aappublications.or...full/109/2/341http://www.thechildrenshospital.org/...ews/27952.aspxHuh - they say your wrong - just like I do! By the way the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, and the American Psychiatric Association all say you are wrong, too.You should also check out the Colage websites.

No I do not use fallacies - but your initial post did. In it you claim that you are against gay marriage because it is an unhealthy environment for children. There are TWO fallacies here - one, that it is unhealthy for kids, 2 - that marriage and parenting are consistently tied. Many people parent without being or ever having been married. Stopping gay marriage will not stop gay people from becoming parents.Why is it a problem?You said that children raised by homosexuals get confused about their sexuality. Most gay people have straight parents, including Dick Cheney's lesbian daughter. The comment was a funny way to poke a hole in that assertation.No, there are not an equal amount who claim they chose to be gay. Frankly, I also don't believe your claim that any have told you that they did. Of, course I can't know that, but I though I would let you know that I don't believe it. Its not just that gays have told me, overwhelmingly the evidence supports that, we may know know what causes sexual orientation (although there are theories), it is not a concious choice. A simple search on google will find a lot of opinion sites about whether being gay is a choice or not. All those I encountered who said it was a choice were either straight folks or religious sites. Below are some links to what gays have to say and even one that is more of a scientific paper.http://www.logcabin.org/lef/choice_white_paper.htmlhttp://www.gfcbaltimore.org/GFC_Choice.htmhttp://rzero.com/diffangle/index.htmlA also found this - which is just funny.Reasons to choose to be gay:1) To become rejected by society.2) To have multiple groups against myself.3) To raise risks of being physically harmed.4) To raise risks of being mentally harmed.5) To have less rights in the states.6) To risk losing family support.7) To risk losing friends.8) To risk losing chances at good jobs.9) To get flamed for being a flamer.10) To be a large target for rude jokes.11) To be described as animals to others.12) To be talked about as things among the law.13) To raise my chance of being lead toward suicide.14) To lose my chance at a rightful marriage.15) To hide myself from everyone else.If you had to choose, talk yourself into finding men hot - you probably aren't straight.Obviously. But how much weight do you think an obviously anti-gay, straight girl's stand on what it is to be gay actually holds?Not me. I just noted one day that guys were cute and got me excited.Fine. But you claimed there was a flaw in my argument. Not agreeing with you is not a flaw on my part.I am almost 40, have known gay people since I was child, have talked to many hundred of them on the topic, have read their accounts in newspapers, magazines, forums like this, as well as other places on the internet. I have never encountered a single gay person claim it was choice. Not one. Never. I provided links to some examples. Go talk to the gay people in this forum. Try to find me an example that isn't tied to ministry. Just a regular, actively gay person. I dare you.I read it. It is a women's website based out of Canada that according to its own objectives strives to "promote, secure and defend legislation which upholds the Judeo-Christian understanding of marriage and family life". Its a religious site. Furthermore the article you provide lists all kinds of numbers and stats and vague names of where the data is from, but does not adequaltely cite its sources (name, author, year, etc.) so that the information can even be verified. I would be willing to bet most of it was pulled off of religious websites. My links were to/about valid medical and phsychologial organizations.If you are going to debate this with any kind validity you have to seperate the two institutions. Kids happen without marriage all the time. If anything it seems to me that you are debating whether gay people should be parents more than whether they should be married.You brought it up. It seemed you were implying that there was something wrong with this. If not, lets drop it.My personal experiences are part of the debate. My immediate family is impacted by this debate. My son's father is gay. No. My story falsifies your position. I will not shut up about or lie about it for your's (or anyone's) comfort factor.What channel? Google is marvelous. So are libraries.Mistress of the obvious.The reason I said "my son" is because your stories were around some "kids you saw (on on TV)" - strangers to you. I was emphasizing that my story is personal - that is all.I can't stand pop music at all. I do not know her character so I will also not judge her. My son is 12 - he is crushes because she is pretty. He has been harassed. I am saying that the flaw is not with his family, but rather, the harassers. Just wanted to make sure I was clear.What news channels?No. Generally typos don't bug me, but that one kept coming up so I thought I would point it out to you.No, it doesn't.I am going with the doctors and mental health professionals over a group of broads in Canada with a religious agenda.Why? Don't like having your opnion threatened by those who would actually know best? "My minds made up, don't confuse me with the facts?" Even, if ultimately, you stance actually causes harm to children in gay families?No, it's "colage". Below is the link to their main website - but local chapters have websites, too. There are stories, pictures, events, artwork, all kinds of neat stuff on the sites about and for gay families.http://www.colage.org/

First of all...let me congratulate Da King for getting a heated topic up and running in the Introduction forum...even though he never came back to it.For the record, it was never stated originally that children were involved with the gay marriage. If you want to debate where children are involved, there are probibly plenty of threads on gay people adopting or maybe lezbian couples having one of the women getting artifically insiminated or something like that. Now yes, those are legitimate debates that can get people mad enough to argue...but here, an argument is being based upon an assumption... i.e. "Which they always seem to want to adopt."My argument here is that there was never anything mentioned in the first place about children being involved. The statement was that DaKing is for gay marriage because his uncle is gay. So why is the argument based upon how children will be affected when there was nothing mentioned about children in the first place?
supports
I for one am all for gay marriage. I am not gay but my uncle is and I do not see anything wrong with that. People who are gay are not broken. They still put they're pants on one leg at a time. I for one think that the conservatives have the wrong idea about gay marriage

I'm sorry if it seems that I've lead the debate into an off-topic discussion. I only mentioned my view of why gay marriages are harmful. Because once they marry, the couples choose to adopt or have children. That in my view can be harmful. And a reason that I would oppose gay marriage. And thats aside from the gay couples who do not marry and yet have children. So since the parent issue is off-topic. I will no longer debate about it on this thread. Darn now I have to save my beautiful come back for another thread. Shoot!!

First of all...let me congratulate Da King for getting a heated topic up and running in the Introduction forum...even though he never came back to it.For the record, it was never stated originally that children were involved with the gay marriage. If you want to debate where children are involved, there are probibly plenty of threads on gay people adopting or maybe lezbian couples having one of the women getting artifically insiminated or something like that. Now yes, those are legitimate debates that can get people mad enough to argue...but here, an argument is being based upon an assumption... i.e. "Which they always seem to want to adopt."My argument here is that there was never anything mentioned in the first place about children being involved. The statement was that DaKing is for gay marriage because his uncle is gay. So why is the argument based upon how children will be affected when there was nothing mentioned about children in the first place?

Because of the standards I choose to live by. And that is my right. I'm not trying to change anyone else. If I see it as a problem, I can.Sorry I missed the humor. I'm sure it was a blast.Nope of course you can't. You can choos not to believe it. Fine with me. It just seems to me that you have a one diamentional mind. Now thats just sad. I don't find it amusing.Have you ever heard of a thing called sarcasim?! What I stated was mild sarcasim. Don't try to push that lifestyle on me. By making such statements. I'm not the one turned on by Angelina Jolie. I question how straight you are. Women never were and never will be attractive to me. I have breast, she has breast. Big deal. Show me something I don't see everyday.emoticonXRolleyes Bottomline is...*Drum roll please* Men!! They get my vote. Expecially chinese men!! Just because I'm straight does not mean that I can't voice my stand. Whether some agree I have a strong stand or not, dose not bother me in the least bit. Voicing my stand, is the only concern of mine.Same here. But with me I never had to notice one day. I had already known they were sexy. Find a gay person, and ask them questions?! You dare me?! OOOOH I'm shaking. I probably won't be able to sleep tonight because you dared me.Plus, you are 40, not 400. So I doubt that you talked to all of the gay people in the world. You made a bold statement about doubting that they said they chose the lifestyle. You have no right to assume that. Unless you personally talked to all of them, in order to find this information out.Names of professors, and such are not vague. I think I'll stick to agreeing with my link, and you can agree with yours. Since that is my right.No one told you to lie. I believe I said, I'm not intreasted in your experiences. About what role your sons father plays is not important to me. And thats all I'm saying. And if you believe it falsifies it, then fine. No skin off my back.You quoted somethings that were obvious yourself. Give me a break here. lolJust because they were not people I know. Dose not mean that they were not real experiences.Let him see her without her make-up. He will change his mind. lolEven though I don't approve of gay marriages, and parenting. I don't think that any family should be harassed. On any level. You made mention that my views cause harm. No they don't. It is only when you choose to act on them, is when it causes harm. And not before. I don't agree with the lifestyle, for alot of reasons. But I have never disrespected anyone who is gay. So maybe the problem dose lay with the people who harassed your son.

No I do not use fallacies - but your initial post did. In it you claim that you are against gay marriage because it is an unhealthy environment for children. There are TWO fallacies here - one, that it is unhealthy for kids, 2 - that marriage and parenting are consistently tied. Many people parent without being or ever having been married. Stopping gay marriage will not stop gay people from becoming parents.Why is it a problem?You said that children raised by homosexuals get confused about their sexuality. Most gay people have straight parents, including Dick Cheney's lesbian daughter. The comment was a funny way to poke a hole in that assertation.No, there are not an equal amount who claim they chose to be gay. Frankly, I also don't believe your claim that any have told you that they did. Of, course I can't know that, but I though I would let you know that I don't believe it. Its not just that gays have told me, overwhelmingly the evidence supports that, we may know know what causes sexual orientation (although there are theories), it is not a concious choice. A simple search on google will find a lot of opinion sites about whether being gay is a choice or not. All those I encountered who said it was a choice were either straight folks or religious sites. Below are some links to what gays have to say and even one that is more of a scientific paper.http://www.logcabin.org/lef/choice_white_paper.htmlhttp://www.gfcbaltimore.org/GFC_Choice.htmhttp://rzero.com/diffangle/index.htmlA also found this - which is just funny.Reasons to choose to be gay:1) To become rejected by society.2) To have multiple groups against myself.3) To raise risks of being physically harmed.4) To raise risks of being mentally harmed.5) To have less rights in the states.6) To risk losing family support.7) To risk losing friends.8) To risk losing chances at good jobs.9) To get flamed for being a flamer.10) To be a large target for rude jokes.11) To be described as animals to others.12) To be talked about as things among the law.13) To raise my chance of being lead toward suicide.14) To lose my chance at a rightful marriage.15) To hide myself from everyone else.If you had to choose, talk yourself into finding men hot - you probably aren't straight.Obviously. But how much weight do you think an obviously anti-gay, straight girl's stand on what it is to be gay actually holds?Not me. I just noted one day that guys were cute and got me excited.Fine. But you claimed there was a flaw in my argument. Not agreeing with you is not a flaw on my part.I am almost 40, have known gay people since I was child, have talked to many hundred of them on the topic, have read their accounts in newspapers, magazines, forums like this, as well as other places on the internet. I have never encountered a single gay person claim it was choice. Not one. Never. I provided links to some examples. Go talk to the gay people in this forum. Try to find me an example that isn't tied to ministry. Just a regular, actively gay person. I dare you.I read it. It is a women's website based out of Canada that according to its own objectives strives to "promote, secure and defend legislation which upholds the Judeo-Christian understanding of marriage and family life". Its a religious site. Furthermore the article you provide lists all kinds of numbers and stats and vague names of where the data is from, but does not adequaltely cite its sources (name, author, year, etc.) so that the information can even be verified. I would be willing to bet most of it was pulled off of religious websites. My links were to/about valid medical and phsychologial organizations.If you are going to debate this with any kind validity you have to seperate the two institutions. Kids happen without marriage all the time. If anything it seems to me that you are debating whether gay people should be parents more than whether they should be married.You brought it up. It seemed you were implying that there was something wrong with this. If not, lets drop it.My personal experiences are part of the debate. My immediate family is impacted by this debate. My son's father is gay. No. My story falsifies your position. I will not shut up about or lie about it for your's (or anyone's) comfort factor.What channel? Google is marvelous. So are libraries.Mistress of the obvious.The reason I said "my son" is because your stories were around some "kids you saw (on on TV)" - strangers to you. I was emphasizing that my story is personal - that is all.I can't stand pop music at all. I do not know her character so I will also not judge her. My son is 12 - he is crushes because she is pretty. He has been harassed. I am saying that the flaw is not with his family, but rather, the harassers. Just wanted to make sure I was clear.What news channels?No. Generally typos don't bug me, but that one kept coming up so I thought I would point it out to you.No, it doesn't.I am going with the doctors and mental health professionals over a group of broads in Canada with a religious agenda.Why? Don't like having your opnion threatened by those who would actually know best? "My minds made up, don't confuse me with the facts?" Even, if ultimately, you stance actually causes harm to children in gay families?No, it's "colage". Below is the link to their main website - but local chapters have websites, too. There are stories, pictures, events, artwork, all kinds of neat stuff on the sites about and for gay families.http://www.colage.org/

This is virtually pointless because gays cannot marry in the U.S. today, and they STILL adopt. They still raise kids.Between six million and 10 million children of lesbian, gay and bisexual parents currently live in the United States. 11 http://www.womedia.org/taf_statistics.htmMarriage is not a requirement for adoption. Ergo, your complaint is moot.It's like arguing against driving cars because of vehicular murder. The murder takes place with or without the car, and there is no indication that the rate of murder is increased by people's capability to drive cars.The "harm" has yet to really be shown.You quoted a lobbyist group web-site, which "quotes" studies and statements made by people but typically does an incredibly poor job of citing the source of what it claim.It offers one "study" claiming to refute dozens of other research studies, but having viewed such claims in the past it typically revolves around statements of how the study could have been improved. Not really invalidating the study at all. And I find extreme irony in the pretense that the opinion of one or two people analyzing a study should somehow overrule an ENTIRE PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION which has evaluated these studies and found them worthy of leading to a conclusion.It offers a statement of one psychologist's OPINION, but offers no counter studies of its own to demonstrate a harm to children. In fact, there is NO existing study which shows that being raised by gay parent(s) somehow harms kids. Plenty of opinion, but no actual proof.It takes a look at one study which gives statistics on gay relationship abuse, but then pulls the typical tactic I have seen DOZENS of times in not giving ANY SORT OF COMPARISON to the heterosexual situation. And some of the wording??? "one or more acts of verbal aggression from their intimate partners"??? Geez. Does getting loud and byatchy during a fight count as "verbal aggression"? Can't tell because (of course) this article gives NOWHERE NEAR enough information to reference the actual source it pretends to quote."Higher incidence of mental health problems"? Funny how the article leaves out the fact that professional medical organization after professional medical organization has concluded that the REASON for the higher incidence of mental health problems is the higher rate of PREJUDICE that gays experience.Sexual molestation by gay parents? This involves a variety of lies and misrepresentations, ignoring the actual facts on the matter.The biggest lie being that it assumes that just because a man molests a boy, that the man must be gay. So what do you call the man if he is married to a woman, and he is actually molesting his son?The truth of the matter is that research has proven that the vast majority of pedophiles who molest boys are actually straight in their adult sexual interactions. Pedophilia is typically about attraction towards the AGE of the victim, with the gender being often irrelevant.I know it's a radical idea to actually reference a PSYCHOLOGY web-site when talking about psychological issues instead of a lobbyist web-site, but this web-page refutes a LOT of the XXXX that the "real women" have thrown out there...http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/policy/parents.htmlSince gay marriage is not legal in this country (with only one state exception), what percentage of gay couples would you guess that would be?

Just as a thought...Referencing "documentaries" you claim to have seen makes an incredibly poor method of debate. Something that can be independently reviewed is much better, so that everybody involved can examine the "evidence" instead of just what you claim it is...And claims regarding homosexuality and choice, and gay people you claim to have met who have made such statements, carries incredibly little credibility because...a) There are numerous gay people on this message board, and I have yet to meet any that say it's a "choice".b) The experts unanimously acknowledge that it is not a choice.http://www.apa.org/topics/orientation.html#choicec) Not even the anti-gay 'expert' groups claim that being gay is a choice. And quite frankly, that's saying a lot...

I take amusement at your insistence that I should check something out, and then you tell me that you "think" something is the case...If you are talking about the state PERFORMING gay marriages, you are incorrect. Only Massachusetts.If you are talking about the state and gay UNIONS, that is a different matter and some states do recognize rights and benefits for gay couples under a different name than "marriage". But it is not marriage.Regarding Arizona, the state shot down an attempt to ban gay marriage, but that doesn't make gay marriage legal in the state. In fact, Arizona STILL HAS a state law on its books banning gay marriage.http://charlotte.bizjournals.com/pho...8/daily61.htmlIn which case, you are very wrong.Massachusetts is the only state that some people can get "gay married" in.And even then, your statement is missing some facts...March 30, 2006: The Supreme Judicial Court upheld a 1913 Massachusetts law that prohibits non-residents from marrying in Massachusetts if their marriage would be void in their home state. It ruled that same-sex couples domiciled in other states that expressly prohibit same-sex marriage cannot legally marry in Massachusetts, and remanded cases from New York and Rhode Island to the Superior Court to determine whether same-sex marriage is prohibited in those states.[19] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-se..._MassachusettsThere have been attempts at advances on this issue regarding the few states that do not expressly prohibit same-sex marriage, but I do not know their status off-hand.Seriously.Have you looked at anybody's links on this thread?Makes no difference. Others can review the links and see what I am talking about, even if you refuse to see where you are wrong.

Misinformed prejudice.Yep.Think you could?You sure can.It was funny to me. Actually, most of your ideas about gay people are pretty funny to me.I gave you reasons and links as to why I don't believe you and challenged you to show me evidence of all these gay folks who say they "just decided to be gay".Your missing the point.That's one hell of a jump. I tell I think Angelina is hot and you read it as me telling you to be a "XXXX"? A bit insecure are we?I don't.There are many women who I think are absolutely gorgeous. Doesn't mean I want to get in the sack with them. Its like this, Sunshine. If you want to know about brain surgery are you gonna ask an auto mechanic? I thought they were ucky unitil pubertyish. But you contradict yourself here. You say you CHOSE to find men attractive.Well - when you find these gay folks who just decided to be gay - you can have them come in here and chew me out for my assumptions.foundit covers this one pretty well already. No need to be redundant.Honey - I know it falsifies it. I have a child being rasied by a gay father. He is behind me right now playing with his basketball in the basement even though it drives me nuts. My experience here has everything to do with this and trashes your adamance that gays make bad parents. They don't. You are dead wrong. I am sure that is threatening - hence your not wanting to hear my story. Or read any links that refute your ideas. And to think you say I have a one dimensional mind. At least I read your link.The hell they don't. What do you think happens when Mr. Johnson tells Tommy that gay people are bad? Tommy threatens my son and shoves garbage down his throat.You cite and believe false, ugly information about gay people and gay parenting. You refuse to even review information to the contrary. You hurt my family and you can bet your XXX I hold you accountable for it.It should be easy enough to find your information and cite links then.Obviously not since you spell it wrong again in the next sentence.Not in your argument. You claim it as one of the two reasons you oppose gay marriage. You need to address it or it looks like you have no reason to oppose gay marriage.The other reason you stated is that it is harmful to society - but you did not say at all how.

First of all, we are supposed to be introducing ourselves, not starting up a topic. But let me kill two birds with one stone here.Hi everyone, I'm new here. And I love to debate. I got kicked out of one debate, because I won the debate on linguistics, and the girl got mad, because she lost, and banned me from the froum. Hopefully no one here is as immature as that. But anyway, thats my story, I'm glad to be here. And I'm ready to debate. And here is my first victim.I'm against gay marriages. Why?! Because in order to mantain a healthy environment for children.(which they always seem to want to adopt) there has to be a healthy relationship. Now a child grows up, and sees two men/women dating eachother. That can confuse the child as to whether they should also be gay. It is not only harmful to the family environment, but also to society. And don't hand me that," My uncle is gay." Stuff. I had(he passed away) a gay uncle, have three gay cousins, and a gay aunt. Not my whole family is not gay, but it seems like I have quite a few in my family. Now I don't support what they do. Even though I love them because they are my family, I would not support them if they were to marry.

I'm back!! Had to re-visit the real world. Anyway, how is it that you say I'm confused about my sexuality, because I don't approve of gay marriage?! That is weak! People always claim things like that when they have nothing else to say. I'm straight as hell, and you really don't know me engough to say diffrently. But you on the other hand must be confused.

Look, I didn't mean to offend you. I was just stating my case. I only said, that gay marriage is harmful to society because, its, like telling people that the original purpose for a man and a women joining together in union is a joke. And people tend to feel like its ok to go ahead and take marriage out of the range that it was intended. But that is my view. But I hold no negitive feeling towards you. In the end, people are people, with the same feelings, and hardships as anyone else.

Many of them were unsure of me at first, but they've gradually come around to the idea that I don't represent any sort of threat.Now that that's out of the way, I'd better go post a hello thread....emoticonXHoho

Jitobear- You're very wrong. My opinions do not harm anyone. You gave an example of a Mr. Johnson telling Tommy that gay people are bad, so Tommy stuffs garbage down your sons throat. I would think that is the fault of the Mr. Johnson who said those things, and letting tommy carry out the actions.Don't you dare say that you're holding me responsible for any hurt people put your family through because of a gay issue. That is not my problem. My opinions don't hurt, because I don't go around telling my 5 nephews that gay people are bad, and I don't allow them to make fun of gays or anyone else for that matter. So therefore my opinons don't hurt, because they are not put into action. So instead of you pointing a finger at me, you need to point it where its due. Because your blaming the wrong person. And if you let your family be hurt by my stand on gay marriage, then you need to hold yourself accountable, and no one else. I will not take the blame for what others have done, because I don't practice what they practice. But I will hold true to the stand I have made, without any sort of guilt, or confusion as to my sexuality. You have to come to terms with the fact that not everyone will agree to gay marriages, despite all the gay rights going on.BTW, you did not only say Jolie was hot, you said she turned you on, refer to your above posts. Its one thing to say another female is pretty. Its another to be turned on by it. Sorry but I couldn't let that one slide.emoticonXRolleyes

Look, I didn't mean to offend you. I was just stating my case. I only said, that gay marriage is harmful to society because, its, like telling people that the original purpose for a man and a women joining together in union is a joke. And people tend to feel like its ok to go ahead and take marriage out of the range that it was intended. But that is my view. But I hold no negitive feeling towards you. In the end, people are people, with the same feelings, and hardships as anyone else.

The Tommy story happened to my son - I just changed the names. I know "Tommy's" parents. They are like you, they would never openly make fun of gay people or condone Tommy's actions. They just politely disapprove. What do you think Tommy hears when those around him, or at church politely cut down gay couples and families - say it is against God, nature or bad for children or society? Everytime anyone speaks as such, they do my family damage. Everytime they even politely and academically tell us that gays are not worth of marriage or parenting or protection from discrimination in house/work (hate laws) you contribute to an environment that makes it justifiable to target gays, and even their children. You don't have to be Fred Phelps to be part of the problem. And don't you ever you ever tell me what to feel on a matter or whether I can voice it. I will not walk on eggshells for your prejudice and I will do far more than speak what I see, speak my experience, to protect my son.Nor do I appreciate the implication that it is somehow my fault because I would not protect my son from other people's (in your mind, justifiable) bigotry, by cutting people we love out of our lives. His father and our family deserve respect - your prejudicial opinions do not. I will never pander to them. Anti-gay rhetoric is 100% WRONG. It as bad as dirscrimation based on race, sex, faith, age, income. Hate is hate. And when people act hatefully it is not due to a fault with the victim. It is a fault with the cowards who practice hate.I wasn't asking you to let it slide, nor do I make excuses for it. Angelina is that hot - and she just might be able to convince to take a walk on the other side. I've heard gay men say the same about her. It's half in jest. The kind of comment those of us secure in our sexuality aren't threatened by. I can say/think she is that hot and still know I am straight and not even worry about whether you think I am or not. Hell go ahead and assume I am a raging XXXX, I'm not, but I am not offended by your thinking so. I find the possibility of you thinking me a lesbian about as offensive as I do you thinking I wear a size nine shoe vs. size ten.You on the other hand assumed my little comment about Angelina was me questioning YOUR sexuality. I am not the insecure one here.

Marriage never began as a religious institution. It started as a cultural matter millenia ago between man and woman. Religious blessing was merely reinforcing it

The concept of a gay family makes me a little uncomforatable, but I can't formulate any logical arguements to support marrige segregation. By default, I am a supporter of gay adoption. Any two loving people can bring up a family just fine.As for marrige, it began as a religious institution, but has been ingrained into American society as a cutural union. Gay people deserve the right to recognition in front of the world as a couple, as a partnership.Spicygirl is more uncomforatable with gay couples than i will ever be, and that will never change. i would bet money she hasn't figured out her sexuality just yet. That aside, there is NO logical argument to deny gays rights. if you have one, I would love to hear it.

And don't you ever tell me what I should feel in terms of whether I should accept gay marriage or not. The fact that you have a problem with people politely disagreeing is like saying we don't have the right to disagree. And if we do we are doing harm, and are hateful people. It is YOU, who seems to be prejudice, and YOU who seems to be hateful. You can't take it that there are people who just don't agree with gay marriage. WELL GET OVER IT!! I don't agree!! And I'm not about to sit here and take the blame for someone else doing, or saying hurtful things to gay people. I would rather have my opinions, and poliely disagree, then go around gay bashing, and insulting people. You feel you have the right to express your views, what the hell makes you think I don't have the right to express mine?! And I will not walk on eggshells because of your prejudice towards people who don't agree with that lifestyle. Plus, you only have your sons father who is gay. I have family members, who are gay. And I worried about people gay bashing my uncle all the time. Why would I be apart of something that would harm my family as well. YOUR family is not the only one who suffers. So YOU can cut the XXXX, about who is hurting YOUR family. I don't agree with gay marriage piont blank. If you think I'm hateful, then go right ahead!! I really don't give to shakes of a rats rusty backside!! I have the right to agree or disagree. The only time it hurts your family is if I was right there gay bashing, and on the news. I'm not taking any responsibility for anything that happens to your family because of gay issues. Plus I don't even know you. But it seems like you go overboard and think that everyone wants to attack YOUR family!! Goodness forbid that someone doesn't like the same ice cream flavor as you, all of a sudden they are harming your family because they don't like the same ice cream your family likes. Get a life honey and stop taking things so personaly that you feel everyone is out to get you just because they don't agree with you. You talk about hate, but you replaced the so-called hate that you fight against, with your own kind of hate. Hate towards those who don't agree with that lifestyle. So if I'm accountable for something, then so are you. You help hate circulate by harboring it in yourself, towards those whom you feel it is justified. Disagreeing is not hateful, but using hate to fufill what you beieve is right is. And hateful is also hating those who don't agree with you, by saying they are part of a problem. I see a problem when I read the anger you have towards people who disagree. That is part of a big problem that you ar accountable for. I rest my case, regardless of whether you like it or not. In life, things don't always go the way we want it to. You should know that being 40 years old. But still you whine when someone disagrees with you, another big problem.I'm not even going to dignify this with an answer. I'm done with you and this whole debate topic. You're too high strung and personal. It makes a debate very annoying in my book. So whatever you say from here on will fall on deaf ears, I'm not even coming back here to listen to you. How boring!*Sigh*

Whenever somebody tries to justify crazy statements like "gay marriage is harmful to society", it is just plain baffling.First of all, gay marriage EXISTS TODAY. It just isn't recognized by 49 out of 50 states. Is that "harmful" to society?Second, what you think that "tells people" is your own interpretation. Quite frankly, it makes no sense to me. Just because gay marriage is allowed doesn't mean anything about the "original purpose".People change. Societies change.That doesn't necessarily mean anything bad or good about previous situations.Third, what do you think the "original purpose" of marriage actually was?And how does the modern heterosexual observance of the "original purpose" stack up?We're talking about more than just "disagreeing" here.Two people can disagree without a value judgment being placed on a group of people. Nobody is saying that JUST disagreeing is harmful.What we're talking about SPECIFICALLY here is a negative value judgment being placed on gays.Continuing to ignore that is not debate. It's a strawman argument attempt.Weren't you the one who posted that web-site which made those hateful and inaccurate claims regarding gays?I find it difficult to comprehend how you try to absolve yourself of something when you DIRECTLY USE groups which are guilty of what we are talking about in your posts...Did you ever ask your uncle if he "chose" to be gay?

I'd like to add my voice to those disagreeing with SpicyGirl on the adoption issue. It seems to me the bottom line--regardless of how you feel about gay relationships--is that kids need a nurturing home. It's strange to me that there those out there who would rather see kids either out on the street or in orphanages rather than with a parent who happens to be gay. Put the kids first.

I'm curious as to where exactly you draw the line there. At what point, specifically, does disagreement about gay relations turn harmful? While I disagree with Spicy on the adoption issue, I can't go along with this idea of yours that mere disagreement to any extent on homosexality is harmful. This IS a national debate, and people are going to have to accept that there are opinions on both sides to be said. To not do so, and try to sweep one whole side under the rug by arbitrarily declaring the whole thing harmful with no regard for specifics or degree is going to get you nowhere. But here's the thing: even if it IS harmful to some unknown degree, I think it is safe to say that you have a lot worse opponents out there than someone who quietly, politely, and respectfully disagrees. So it seems odd to me that you put as much effort into the opposing the respectful voices rather than opposing those who CLEARLY hate gay people and do so vocally. Is it because you won't get as much virulent argument out of the more respectful ones that you target them with this unreasonable and unrealistic idea of yours? Using your logic, I could claim ANY position held by anyone on ANY issue is harmful. That's how wide-open your standard is here, to what constitutes harm. So again, where do you draw that line specifically to where it becomes harmful? Someone saying "God hates gays" as publically as they can? Someone who "has no problem with gays whatsoever other than a little homophobia?" Somewhere in-between? Because if you're going to keep this up nearly every single time someone argues with you respectfully on a homosexuality-related issue, you need to say.I'd also like to know what harm, specifically, comes from someone giving respectful disagreement in the debate. To what extent are you hurt by that? Because I suspect you can't really quantify it.

this post is about gay marriages and there was another post about gays adopting, and I would like to merge the two here with a comment.An individual should have a right to express his/herself freely where it doesn't affect another person. An individual should have the right to cohabitate with any other person or persons (adults) they so chose, and should be able to unite under the laws of the state without any discrimination.However, when it comes to adoption. There should be limits. Perhaps children of age 12 and above can be adopted by gay couples, but the child must have the ultimate say into the matter.Children brought into this world, are conceived by male and female and to take a infant child and place it in a biologically incorrect family could and may do more harm than good, and then again, the child may thrive and be a well-rounded citizen, but no one can predict at that stage. Each infant child is different and the physcological needs are different. The child's interest must be our main interest, and if we cannot guarantee a positive outcome, (which we cannot) then we must err on the side of natural caution.The key is respect. Respect to the laws of nature, respect to the laws of equality, and respect for one another.In this world, people want anything and everything their minds can conjure up even if its naturally impossible. Humans are so self-centered and greedy, if we could sue nature most of you would. I wouldn't, I have much respect for nature. I know my place in this world, I know my biological limits, psychological limits and my physical limits and when I cross those limits there are risks.Have we become a world of selfishness? What's next? Buy some land in the driest of deserts and demand it bring upon a harvest? Nature is such a bigot.

1. What, prithee tell, is a biologically incorrect family? You made up that term. From the context, I am assuming you mean a same-sex couple. Same-sex couples may be culturally atypical, but are the result of biological circumstances that are perfectly normal (if such a term is even appropriate to describe a naturally occuring biological phenomenon.)2. One can most assuredly predict what the outcome of such a family will be. 30 years of research has shown repeatedly that children of same-sex couples fare no worse nor better that opposite-sex couples. (Many will use the fact that, statistically speaking, one parent families do not fare as well as two parent families and that is conflated to the statement that says science has shown that kids do better with a mom and a dad. This is true when compared to a single mom or single dad, but not compared to a same-sex couple. I am not trying to make a negative statement about single parent households, but merely trying to refute the above inaccuracy.)

Once again (as I have asked in other topics where you spouted off like this), where is your proof? Please cite evidence to support your absurd claim. Oh wait, there is none. In fact, all the evidence supports just the opposite of your claim.

On the side of full equality and respect for all people regardless of race, national origin, sex, faith, appearance, economic background or sexual orientation. I stand on the side of the line where hate is always unnaceptable. Where I don't have to hear ugly untruths about people I love and where you don't believe it. I will not quietly sit back and even acknowledge that even "polite" disagreement is OK. I am pleased that you will not beat a gay person to death, but I will never say you aren't part of the problem. I want to see the day where discrimination against gays is considered as abhorrant as racism is today to people of consience. When homophobia is demonsrated to be the foul, ugly thing it is. Even the very idea that some people's level of humanity is open for debate is sickening.Let me make this analogy. Is there anyone in your life, whom you love, who is a blonde? What if violence was committed against them for being blond? Or maybe there were efforts to not allow them access to public schools, or roads, or marriage. Or maybe people just loudly or quietly preached or debated that blondes weren't natural, weren't loved by God, or were bad parents. Where would you draw the line? What of those actions against your loved ones would be acceptable?

Someone who "has no problem with gays whatsoever other than a little homophobia?" Somewhere in-between? Because if you're going to keep this up nearly every single time someone argues with you respectfully on a homosexuality-related issue, you need to say.I'd also like to know what harm, specifically, comes from someone giving respectful disagreement in the debate. To what extent are you hurt by that? Because I suspect you can't really quantify it.

No! If there were some instances in the world where blondes were being killed I would NOT blame anyone who happened to respectfully think blondes shouldn't get married for some reason;I'd blame the people that were doing the violence. It's that simple. In fact, I'd want to dialog with the people who felt that way about blondes and find out why they felt that way, and what their concerns were. The ONLY ones I'd blame for violence are those who are violent and commit violent acts. I just don't understand your mindset on this.Where I draw the line is this: people who do crimes are the ones blamed for the crimes. Not so-and-so in a completely different town/state/country who who just happens to share SOME degree of a view on an issue. If you want to stop violence, then stop violence and violent people--don't seek to shut down dialog and the marketplace of conversation just because a violent person happens to have a similar view on some issue to some degree as whomever you are conversing with. It's not only unfactual to blame non-violent people for violence, but it sells short the gay rights movement because it misplaces blame that should be going to the right place.

On the side of full equality and respect for all people regardless of race, national origin, sex, faith, appearance, economic background or sexual orientation. I stand on the side of the line where hate is always unnaceptable. Where I don't have to hear ugly untruths about people I love and where you don't believe it. I will not quietly sit back and even acknowledge that even "polite" disagreement is OK. I am pleased that you will not beat a gay person to death, but I will never say you aren't part of the problem. I want to see the day where discrimination against gays is considered as abhorrant as racism is today to people of consience. When homophobia is demonsrated to be the foul, ugly thing it is. Even the very idea that some people's level of humanity is open for debate is sickening.Let me make this analogy. Is there anyone in your life, whom you love, who is a blonde? What if violence was committed against them for being blond? Or maybe there were efforts to not allow them access to public schools, or roads, or marriage. Or maybe people just loudly or quietly preached or debated that blondes weren't natural, weren't loved by God, or were bad parents. Where would you draw the line? What of those actions against your loved ones would be acceptable?

I agree whole-heartedly with this, including situations where it's not a gay couple adopting.Why should a child have to go to a straight couple he doesn't feel comfortable with?I high-lighted what I thought was the key point there.MAY DO...As in you don't know...The problem is that other people HAVE researched this issue, and they DO know.http://aappolicy.aappublications.org...rics;109/2/341By this logic, we should forbid divorce between parents with a child younger than 12?And forbid all adoptions for single parents with a child younger than 12?There is an irony in respecting "laws of equality" by discriminating against gays...Tell me. Which is better for a child?Having ANY parent, gay or straight, who is dedicated to loving or caring for that child?Or leaving that child in the orphanage or foster home without the individual love of a parent...Seems to me that you're missing the forest for the trees.

this post is about gay marriages and there was another post about gays adopting, and I would like to merge the two here with a comment.An individual should have a right to express his/herself freely where it doesn't affect another person. An individual should have the right to cohabitate with any other person or persons (adults) they so chose, and should be able to unite under the laws of the state without any discrimination.However, when it comes to adoption. There should be limits. Perhaps children of age 12 and above can be adopted by gay couples, but the child must have the ultimate say into the matter.Children brought into this world, are conceived by male and female and to take a infant child and place it in a biologically incorrect family could and may do more harm than good, and then again, the child may thrive and be a well-rounded citizen, but no one can predict at that stage. Each infant child is different and the physcological needs are different. The child's interest must be our main interest, and if we cannot guarantee a positive outcome, (which we cannot) then we must err on the side of natural caution.The key is respect. Respect to the laws of nature, respect to the laws of equality, and respect for one another.In this world, people want anything and everything their minds can conjure up even if its naturally impossible. Humans are so self-centered and greedy, if we could sue nature most of you would. I wouldn't, I have much respect for nature. I know my place in this world, I know my biological limits, psychological limits and my physical limits and when I cross those limits there are risks.Have we become a world of selfishness? What's next? Buy some land in the driest of deserts and demand it bring upon a harvest? Nature is such a bigot.

The reason they wouldn't want blondes to share this institution of marriage, is their tradition of hatred towards blondes, as there is no logical reason to exclude the group. The hate is not at the same level as someone who would want to kill blondes. It's hate, and hate begets hate. Although, there are other issues a person has which would make him or her react in a certain way; the hate is the prominent one when he or she reacts that way towards someone identified with a group. Well, yes, the blame for the worst and most violent manifestations of racism, homophobia, etc., should go to the person doing those acts. However, where is the vacuum where he or she lives?

There is no question that those doing violence ought to be held accountable, and I even said I am pleased that you (and others) are not engaging in acts of violence. But there is more than an act to consider. There is intent. There is motivation. There is the reason why. If violence is committed because someone is gay - why is that? Where does the message come from that gays aren't OK? It isn't just those committing acts of violence. SpicyGirl helps send that message. So do you. That's what I mean when I say you are part of the problem.Do you mean to actually tell me that if your daughter/wife/best friend were blonde you would politely consider whether or not they should be granted the same legal access as brunettes? That you would seriously consider talk that said or implied they were dirty, unworthy, inferior? That you actually believe their level of humanity should be debatable issue for the brunettes to determine? This is how you love someone?

Again, that could be construed and said about any issue, from any position on the issue. It's just not a good way to approach debate to condemn a whole side of the debate by claiming it causes violence. Perhaps if you could prove that it always causes violence, you might have something. But you can't prove that. People are not autonomons; they make their own choices. There are a world of ideas out there and it's not about the ideas, but rather how we as human beings choose to act on them. Frankly, I find your way of thinking on this to be alarming, in the same way anyone trying to be some sort of thought-police would be alarming. It's the same sort of thing that people use against gay people sometime by not only standing against gays, but even the ideology that gays are ok.But you aren't limiting your condemnation here toward only people who say those things. No one here has said they were dirty or unworthy, or inferior. Or that their "level of humanity" should be debated. If someone came in saying that, then I'd agree with you. You're taking issue with people who simply have a different view about marriage. Or moral views that have nothing to do whatsoever with the worth or value of people.

Matthew, anyone should have the right to any opinion they want about anything. Opinions are the realm of thoughts and ideas, Matthew. Are you now trying to remove someone's right to think? Because that's just simply impossible. Let's get this squared away right now .... I am in a heterosexual marriage. You are welcome and completely within your rights to think anything you want about that. You are within your rights to have whatever opinion about my marriage you want, just as anyone is free to have any opinion. I'm curious, how exactly do you propose removing the right of having an opinion? Mind control experiments? Tell them that 'you better not have that thought, or you'll be punished!' How can you enforce thought?This has never been about right-to-an-opinion. It's about the law and how our system works. We punish criminals when they commit a crime. That's the only reasonable way to do it; The unreasonable way to do it is to blame people who haven't done any crime for the crimes of others.

No it can't. Only those issues where people are getting hurt due to an ideology that claims a superiroity to another group of people - PREJUDICE.You are missing my point. The violence is only PART of the problem. There is more at stake here - legal access and recognition of different types of families, discrimination in housing and employment, the idea that the gay experience ever has to be "kept quiet" (something you, yourself support, i.e., stories about gay penguins or gay families in school), and the very idea that whether these things should be granted to any law-abiding citizen should be up for debate by those who are not part of the impacted group - all of these things are part of the problem. So are the arguments used against gays, gay marriage, and preventing gay discrimination. You may not buy into all of these - but they exist none the less; "gays are sinful", "gay parents are bad/confusing for children", "gays are a threat to marriage, society, the American way, etc." Maybe you don't condone violence. Maybe you wouldn't choose it. But you make it easier for those who do to justify it. What does one do with a threat afterall?And by the way, you speak ugly untruths about people I love. You bet your XXX I condemn you for it. Really - take a long look at Phelps' website. Or even the stupid quasi religious clap trap that Spicy Girl has in one of her earlier posts. And frankly - every time you say gay behavoir is bad you are saying they, their sexuality and their need for love and intimacy is inferior, dirty and unworthy. Every time you argue they aren't worthy of marriage you say it as well.But you do debate it. Everyday people have to tell you stop telling them they aren't worth the same rights and privelges you have.The hell they don't. Why deny it to these people if you actually found them deserving?Quit act like you just wish to have an opinion. You want your opinion codified into law and you know it.

Look, I didn't mean to offend you. I was just stating my case. I only said, that gay marriage is harmful to society because, its, like telling people that the original purpose for a man and a women joining together in union is a joke. And people tend to feel like its ok to go ahead and take marriage out of the range that it was intended. But that is my view. But I hold no negitive feeling towards you. In the end, people are people, with the same feelings, and hardships as anyone else.

I hang out on a forum that had a couple of posters who were friends with each other who were completely anti-gay. After a couple of months of reading my posts, one of those people renounced his views and kind of told his buddy off for spouting propaganda. They're still friends, but now he is now a moderator on my forum. So yes, people can change, and yes, we DO recruit people--not to the homosexual lifestyle, but we do recruit people to the mindset that it's not harmful. Guilty as charged.

But that's just it--you have no idea 'if it's due to an ideology' or not. You claim it is because it just so happens that some people on your side of the issue has experienced violence. But to claim mere disagreement alone is a cause is just not reasonable. That's why I asked you earlier to tell me at hat point, specifically, ideology becomes harmful. At what point in the ideology does it become a catalyst for violence. I'm sure that at SOME point, ideology does do that. Naturally, if someone says "gays should be killed" then that's dangerous. But I think it's ridiculous to say that something like saying "gays shouldn't redefine marriage" is a catalyst for violence. Or even if someone says "I morally disagree that gay sex is ok." Those aren't people to blame for violence against gays, and the fact you basically have to jump through roundabout speculative hoops to make blame stick to such people says it all.But those are examples of statement directed at gay people, not at things like marriage and homosexuality relations. If you're only condemning statements of people that say that, then fine, because most people who oppose gay marriage or are on the other side of the fence on these issues don't say that. They don't say "gays are bad" they say "gay marriage is bad" or "gay relations is wrong", etc. Those are two VERY different concepts and the difference is VERY important. But even there, I don't see that you've proven how those views truly cause harm. It's when people act on those view and hurt people that it matters.Like I said, that could be said about any issue. I could just as justifiably claim that when someone says "America is bad" it makes it easier for terrorists to justify terrorist acts on Americans. But we don't tell people they can't say "America is bad." Opinions are opinions, and actions are actions. When people support legalized medical marajuana, it makes it easier for people to harm themselves with marajuana. We don't tell people they can't have an opinion that we should have legalized marajuana.Nope; I do not speak anything about anyone you love (or hate, or are otherwise connected with in some way).

Wrong, wrong, wrong. The key word in all the examples is "gay". Hurt doesn't always happen through physicial violence. Any minority who has experienced the pyschological sting of discrimination or bias knows this. I am sure I will be mocked by some here, who have no clue, for posting this and essentially be accused of whining. So be it, keep your head buried in the sand. None of it is good. Acts of violence as well do no occur in a vacuum, but as the result of thinking the targeted group is somehow less than others. This is in identity real or perceived and its expression. People who are just perceived to be gay are often targeted for violent hate crimes. Clearly that is not a disagreement with sex actions. I would not say those who say that gay relationships are morally wrong or inferior to correct straight ones, are directly responsible. It is seldom, if ever, left at that. People then have to invent reasons for the inferiority based on scapegoating, lies, misinformation, generalizations, suspicion and fear. They must try to convince others the group in question is a threat to society and to its valued and respected institutions.

I disagree, with you. Alot of times people do just disagree and leave it like that. If as many people who just silently disagree, turn around one day, and start to act like the ones commiting hate crimes. Then gays would really have something to worry about. But since some people would rather just disagree, there is only a small precentage of people who commit crimes, instead of what it could be.With me, I disagrre. But that does not mean it won't stay that way. That does not mean, in the long run I'm going to run up and hurt someone who is gay. So your statement is wrong!!

Relative patterns of psychiatric illness and wellness among lesbian and gay people as compared to heterosexuals have yet to be completely understood. Nevertheless, the effects of homophobia seem to fall disproportionately on lesbian and gay youth, who are more likely to attempt suicide than heterosexual youth (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1989). Same sex marriage would signal to these adolescents that emotionally fulfilling same sex relationships are not only possible, but validated by society. Lack of recognition of same sex relationship and their families can lead to a failure to provide appropriate mental health care. If same sex marriage were legal, then the partner would more likely be included in mental health treatment and planning. Finally, same sex legal union would foster better psychological integration of the identities of lesbians and gay men, thus facilitating same sex couples' ability to integrate into supportive social networks. http://www.thebody.com/apa/apafacts.html

Just know I will point it out for what it is when you voice it (stupid, mean, hateful, wrong, unjust, ugly, foul, you get the picture). Anyway - you are missing the point. We are well aware that most who disagrees with gay marriage, or even who all-out hate gays aren't likely to engage in acts of violence. We are saying however, that your quiet disagreement - although, yes, you are entitled to it - isn't harmless. It hurts. And it does help those who do engage in violence justify their actions.And, do get up. You just tripped over your ego, My thinking, wait, KNOWING you are dead wrong about gays, gay parents and gay marriage and saying so is not an indicator of my sanity.Well you said you weren't going to debate the topic anymore - I assumed you were conceding.And I label you a one eyed one one horned flying purple people eater.Once again your ego is in the way. I think you are wrong and will continue to tell you so and make no apologies for it. One does not have to agree with you to be rational. And you have no basis for calling me a bigot - unless you misunderstand the meaning of the word.I am happy to continue defending my opinion and those I care about. My head is fine. But if you can't take it, I understand.I am in a debate forum. I expect them disagree - hence my being here arguing my points and stuff.I do not. But anti-gay rhetoric is harmful to his father, his family, etc. I even gave you an example of how it has manifested harm in his life.He is living the debate, sunshine. I know nobody in here has attacked him. However there are people - LIKE YOU - in here who supprt ideas that do cause him harm. Hence my fighting said ideas. Really - this isn't rocket science.And I see a little girl with little to no life experience, minimal education and much more of a reactionary attitude to opposition than me.I can talk now. Any interruption will be on your part - not mine.

But today we are talking about marriage arrangements. And right now Jyoshu, is talking about how people who silently disagree, do not say things about gays being bad. We just disagree. She can prove it because I'm another one who does not say that. It's funny how the INSANE Jitobear, it trying to take away straight peoples right to have an opinion, while trying to defend her own. And you're just like her. I would suggest you all stop worrying about who silently disagrees with you, and start worrying about those who are violent. Because just like you won't stop having your views, I DAMN sure am not going to stop having mine.

Interesting how you jump in and try to deflect my point entirely, but not entirely unexpected...I underlined Jyoshu's statement which I was talking about.THAT is what I was talking about. THAT is what I was addressing.He stated: "...most people who oppose gay marriage or are on the other side of the fence on these issues don't say that."And as I pointed out, "most people who oppose gay marriage" are actually opposing gay marriage because they very much oppose gays in general.In fact, your claim that "I'm another one who does not say that" is ridiculously undermined by one of your first posts whereby you quoted a "woman's" group posting a clearly anti-gay article "about gays being bad".http://4forums.com/political/showpos...46&postcount=8Your response is not only a non-sequitur to what I actually said, it's a denial of reality!It's funny how I didn't say ANYTHING AT ALL about what Jitobear said, and you just blindly assume that I am like Jitobear.That reveals a lot about your willingness to blindly stereo-type and assume.Man. It's like you have NO CLUE about what has actually been said in this thread.They weren't talking about "silent disagreement".And I am not going to get side-tracked by somebody who jumps in without a clue as to what is REALLY being talked about...Yes.

Nope Arizona is not one of them. We did not pass the gay marriage amendment to ban gay marriages but it is still not one where it is legal.Huck

What are you talking about?! Gay marriage has been legalized in a couple of states already. You should have checked that out before replying here. I think its like 4 states, I think Arizonia is one of them. Ones who want to marry go to these states and marry. Thats what I'm talking about. And because it was stated that the child issuse is off-topic. I did not look at your link, and will not respond according to that topic.

That is the very reason I called you a bigot. Because you have a preconcieved idea, about people who hold a different opinion then yourself. So No, I'm clear about the definition. Hello!! It doesn't only go for color, it also goes for anything that someone is prejudice against. Disagreement does not justifiy violent actions. So it is you who seems to be misunderstanding something. I'm not going to go out and change the way I look at life, just because you feel it is harmful. There are people out there that think liking the number 13 is harmful. Is it?! No, but thats something conjured up only in thier mind. Kind of like you conjuring up silly things just to prove some obsurd point. Let me give you another example, since you used blonds, then lets take another look at it. There are alot of people who disagree with blond as a good hair color. I don't see people doing hate crimes on people with blond hair. Some just disagree with that hair color. So disagreeing is not harmful. And you are the one that brought that point up. You said that silent disagreeing is harmful. Well thats your opinion. I think that mindframes like yours is harmful. Get up from where?! I never fell. Maybe in your eyes, but not in mine.

I think you are the one misunderstanding something.YOU PERSONALLY see the "violent actions" as "unjustified".Jitobear sees the "violent actions" as "unjustified".I think you are in agreement on that.What Jitobear seems to be saying is that your "quiet disagreement" helps THOSE PEOPLE who commit "violent actions" to justify their violent actions TO THEMSELVES.Take World War II for example. Most Germans didn't know what was going on with the Jews and the holocaust. But even though they were ignorant, the anti-Semitic lies promulgated by the Germans helped others in power to move forward with the Holocaust.Talk about apples and oranges...Nobody is saying that blondes should have fewer rights.Nobody is saying that blondes are bad in this way or that.http://www.thebody.com/apa/apafacts.htmlRelative patterns of psychiatric illness and wellness among lesbian and gay people as compared to heterosexuals have yet to be completely understood. Nevertheless, the effects of homophobia seem to fall disproportionately on lesbian and gay youth, who are more likely to attempt suicide than heterosexual youth (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1989). Same sex marriage would signal to these adolescents that emotionally fulfilling same sex relationships are not only possible, but validated by society. Lack of recognition of same sex relationship and their families can lead to a failure to provide appropriate mental health care. If same sex marriage were legal, then the partner would more likely be included in mental health treatment and planning. Finally, same sex legal union would foster better psychological integration of the identities of lesbians and gay men, thus facilitating same sex couples' ability to integrate into supportive social networks.

I disagree, with you. Alot of times people do just disagree and leave it like that. If as many people who just silently disagree, turn around one day, and start to act like the ones commiting hate crimes. Then gays would really have something to worry about. But since some people would rather just disagree, there is only a small precentage of people who commit crimes, instead of what it could be.With me, I disagrre. But that does not mean it won't stay that way. That does not mean, in the long run I'm going to run up and hurt someone who is gay. So your statement is wrong!!

But we don't blame the rest of Germany for the holocaust. We blame the Nazis who did it, and were put on trial. If you'll go back and notice, the issue is whether others are to blame for such atrocities.Not to mention that there is not holocaust going on against gays ...

Second of all, can you find sources that back up your claim that people don't choose to be gay?! Because I'm not buying it. Its just like saying they were born gay. If a child is not born being able to speak, how dose it know to look at anothr boys diaper?! Come on! Theres one flaw in your statement. Being gay is a learned behavior, and a prefference. Also, you are only quoting the people you know. They don't even make up 1% of the population of children that grow up with gay parents, or visa versa.I did so. I stated that it is harmful to rearing children. Read my posts carefully please. How can marriage be seperate from parenting?! Also polls have shown, that 95% of gay partners adopt children. They want to make their marriage complete by either, having a child, or adopting one.I think I hear a bell dinging!! Ding! Ding! Let the round begin. Your giving me the invite, and I'm willing to take it.Now I'm not going to make any comments on your ex, or whatever he is to you. Because I don't know him enough to assume anything about him. But I will make general statements on the effects of gay marriages on children.I have seen so many documents, on teens the are confused about their sexual orintation, because of living i the house with their gay parents. On girl wondered if she was gay because her mother was with another woman. She felt that was normal behavior. And started to concider being with girls herself. But was confused when she started to like men. She actually thought that liking men was abnormal. Until others told her it is normal to like men.A boy had almost the same experience, he did not know if he too should like men, because his father did. Often he would fight back desires for females, because he thought he needed to be with men. Not only that by he was ridculed by classmates because of his father being gay.Alot of children endure harassment because of living in a house made up of parents of the same sex. Just because it did not happen to your son, dose not mean that it dose not happen. And your experience is only a fraction of 1% of the experiences that children go through because of having gay parents. It is impossible to say that it dose not happen. If it dose not happen to a few, then thats fine. But the majority suffers, and that far outweighs the few that don't suffer because of having gay parents.

Well, for reasons unknown to me, I have posted in this thread twice already today, and each time they disappeared.Here's the gist of what my thoughts are. I agree with some people here that the "silent" opponents do not do anything directly to gays. It is the INDIRECT that really matters. There are two phrases that come to mind here: "Action through inaction" and "Actions speak louder than words".

Hmm ... funny, I don't seem to remember you being too concerned about the subject mattier when I've made analogies in the past about the moral view of homosexual relations and people erroneously took it as an affront to gay people when that wasn't intended at all. But oh well ...That's because regardling silent disagreement, even respectful disagreement, I don't see any proof whatsoever that it's harmful, in ANY way. If you care to offer proof, then by all means do so.No, the issue isn't whether or not gays go through XXXX. No one ever said they didn't. The issue is whether or not respectful disagreement on the issue CAUSES the XXXX, and more importantly, the need of those who claim it to prove it.

Well I didn't mean to be such a bitch, because you weren't talking to me, but stating an opinion. I don't know if you realize how hearing that so much and so often can make a person feel. In my mind this is what I heard: "You are harming your kid and society at large by doing what feels right and natural to you. I still remember vividly having a violent, homophobic jerk for an upstairs neighbor a few years ago. He used to alternate between beating his girlfriend and (trying) to intimidate us. She used to holler hateful XXXX at us too, come to think of it. So anyway, I can be a bit sensitive at times, I admit. I apologize if I said you were personally dishing out XXXX at me.You didn't say they had any kids, so I'm going on the assumption (yeah I know) that they don't have any. So if your upstairs neighbors adopted a kid, or one of them had a kid from another marriage, you would think they were harming the child and society? Would you tell them that? Actually, I'm sort of curious. No one here in this community has ever said anything like that to us, but sometimes I wonder how they really feel.

Hey! No need to get nasty buddy. I wasn't dishing anything out at you. But if you think that voicing my opinion is dishing something out at you, then so be it.emoticonXRolleyesAlso, I live where a gay couple is downstairs from me. They are great guys, who have a wonderful personality. I talk to them everytime I get a chance, and still my opinion has not changed. So seeing your family won't change my mind.

If you could elaborate with an example, that would be helpful...I have TWICE now pointed to proof where discrimination harms gays.If a person supports discrimination against gays, even "silently", and that discrimination has an effect, then that support has had an impact.But you can keep ignoring it if you like.1) When the "other XXXX" is a direct result of discrimination that is supported by others, yeah. It is.2) The issue hasn't been whether or not gays are going through a "genocide" either. No one ever said they were...Remember?Asked and answered.You claimed that "most" fall into a category like yourself, and I disproved that.Predictably, no response.I posted an APA article about the effects of supported discrimination against gays and the harmful effect that has on gays.Again, predictably no response.And now you demand that we "prove" a "claim" when you have ignored some of the proof shown???Would you care to respond to the APA article this time around? Or should I expect more of the same?

Hmm ... funny, I don't seem to remember you being too concerned about the subject mattier when I've made analogies in the past about the moral view of homosexual relations and people erroneously took it as an affront to gay people when that wasn't intended at all. But oh well ...That's because regardling silent disagreement, even respectful disagreement, I don't see any proof whatsoever that it's harmful, in ANY way. If you care to offer proof, then by all means do so.No, the issue isn't whether or not gays go through XXXX. No one ever said they didn't. The issue is whether or not respectful disagreement on the issue CAUSES the XXXX, and more importantly, the need of those who claim it to prove it.

Discrimination may harm gays, but that doesn't mean that disagreement CAUSES discrimination. You've proven nothing to the point. There may, in fact, be some who disagree for which no impact is made. You have no idea who makes an impact, nor to what degree. Just because you CLAIM it has an impact does not constitute proof.No you didn't. You just disagreed.But we aren't necessarily talking about "supported discrimination". That's a term you brought to the table here. We're talking about any potential disagreement over issues related to homosexuality--the moral issue, for instance. And for that matter, the article shows the effects of discrimination, but does nothing to show how disagreement CAUSES discrimination. So you've not proven it at all. I already told you this was about CAUSE. But predictably, no response.

I didn't realize the obvious needed to be pointed out to you...If there was no disagreement, would the discrimination exist?In a society where we have a constitution that enforces equality, and a democracy that allows people to create and revoke laws, would the discrimination exist if nobody had "disagreement" over gay rights???Regarding "silent" disagreement where there is no discrimination law, I would agree.But note, the key-word is "silent"...And I'm not saying that to demand or ask for silence, but rather just to point out that it is the key-word.If the disagreement isn't "silent", and people make known their desire to discriminate against gays, that does have an impact.I have given the proof before, with again no comment from you.I showed that around 70% of the people who are against gay marriage are ALSO against any form of gay union recognition.We could do further math and demonstrate that those against gay marriage also have a majority (of that sub-group) against a variety of other gay equality issues.They're against gays.

Do you really think it's tha cut and dry? That everyone who disagrees is a cause of discrimination? I think that's a bit extreme. For one it doesn't take into account that the real cause would more likely be those who don't have a respectful opinion. Discrimination exists for probably many reasons, but I don't think it's reasonable to be able to just take anyone who respectfully disagrees and say "You're part of the cause!" And that's where you're logic goes. IMO, this is a ridiculous debate, because it shouldn't even be an issue. People shouldn't be castigated for disagreeing on something and made to feel like they are causing something awful just by having a respectful opinion. It does nothing good for a healthy debate, and it's treading on ground that is unprovable because no matter what you say here you'll never be able to take any ONE respectful person and prove that THEY were a cause of the "XXXX" that you mentioned (whether that's discrimination or whatever). And you know that.Impact or cause? You're using a lighter term. Since you aren't using the term "cause" can I assume you agree that attributing cause to someone wh respectfully disagrees is unreasonable?And for what it's worth, I think you're also just about as hard pressed to prove any one person has an impact.What does that have to do with people who respectfully disagreeing being a CAUSE for the "XXXX" that gays deal with?Oh come on. You know what I mean. it could be any number of issues--that gay relations are morally ok, for instance. Or disagreeing that gays should be able to redefine marriage (while still being for them getting couples' benefits). I shouldn't have to define for you what would be respectful disagreement. Now it's YOU who apparently needs to obvious pointed out to you.No, not necessarily. It's ust not that simple, and you know that. I also think it's interesting that you're talking in terms of the WHOLE SIDE rather than individuals, because it's individuals that we're talking about here. If you can't prove to me that any ONE respectful person is a cause, then you don't have a case. That's what you don't get--when you post some article or APA report that says supported discrimination hurts gays, that doesn't prove to me that MY opinions are harming gays. ME. Or any other ONE person. Not the mush of anti-gayism (with ALL it's degrees, respectul or NON-respectful) out there, or however you want to broadly refer to it. "Supported discrimination" is about the discrimination being harmful, NOT the people who respectfully disagree on some area that touches on homosexuality. You're dealing with something so gray an area, and something so non-concrete, it can't be quantified. But go ahead, think that you can quantify it, all the time unable to do so.

I know what a bigot is. I am just curious as to what you are basing your accusation of calling me one. I have an opinion about gay people, relationships, and parenting. You have an opinion about gay people, relationships, parenting. Our opinions are not the same. If I am bigot for disagreeing with your opinion than you must be a bigot, too.I would like to remind you that this started when you stated that gays raising children was bad for children and society. That wasn't preconception - its something you actually said. When it comes to gays and raising kids - one of us here has actual real life experience - and yet you hold steadfast to your opinion and accuse me of having preconceived ideas.Of course it doesn't. Nor do I believe that you think it does. What I am saying is that it helps those who would carry out violence carry justify it to themselves.No, I'm not. I am disagreeing with you on whether or not silent disagreement helps create a hostile environment for gays and gay families. Disagreeing with you does not denote a misunderstanding on my part.Would if it actually was proven to be harmful?That idea that discrimination is harmful is not an absurd point. OK - lets continue this example. Lets say we have a room full of brunettes. A couple of them think blondes are just fine. Most think blonde is not a good hair color. That blondes are bad for society. That blondes are bad parents. That blondes shouldn't get married. About half think that it should be OK to discriminate against blondes in housing and employment. Only one thinks that blondes should die. In walks a blonde and his/her child/family. Lets make it more personal. Lets take the same room - only its not blondes they have a problem with - its you. Is it a place you would feel safe? Is it a place you take your neices/nephews? And you are right - in general nobody is committing acts of hate violence against blondes. Nor are there really any groups questioning whether they are good for society, marriage, children, etc. Both are being done to gays. You do the math on what silent disagreement may do to a family.I bet.It was no more inane than your labeling me INSANE. By the way, did I mention I am a part-time mental health worker in Dakota County, MN?And you have been example of tolerance in those who disagree with you? Hell - not sharing your point of view makes one a bigot!I would support gay rights regarldess. I supported them before I was ever even pregnant. I just happen to have relevant life experiences that pokes holes in your opinions. And how about not making assumptions about who I am, can be, will be, was? You know my stance on a single issue. That hardly makes you an expert as to my character.Lighten up.And what do you suppose saying his family is bad for society does for his mental health?I have been through holy hell and back - I really don't need this lesson from you.Or I can continue to argue with those I believe to be wrong. And I can continue to dismantle false arguments used to justify your opinion. My options are much broader than put up or shut up.I was responsding to a comment you made about me. I am the expert on me. Somebody's insecurities showing again? Who said anything about gay lifestyle? First of all - what is a gay lifestyle? There is just life. Secondly - I said I believed you had limited life experience - it was meant to be a comment on the fact that I believe you to be very young.Its interesting that you claim having little or no interaction whith the "gay lifestyle" (those who are alive and gay???) and are even proud of that. You basically announce your ignorance on the matter and yet still feel qualified to make judgement calls about these people and their families? What were you saying about preconceptions?By the way - I'm not gay.

That is the very reason I called you a bigot. Because you have a preconcieved idea, about people who hold a different opinion then yourself. So No, I'm clear about the definition. Hello!! It doesn't only go for color, it also goes for anything that someone is prejudice against. Disagreement does not justifiy violent actions. So it is you who seems to be misunderstanding something. I'm not going to go out and change the way I look at life, just because you feel it is harmful. There are people out there that think liking the number 13 is harmful. Is it?! No, but thats something conjured up only in thier mind. Kind of like you conjuring up silly things just to prove some obsurd point. Let me give you another example, since you used blonds, then lets take another look at it. There are alot of people who disagree with blond as a good hair color. I don't see people doing hate crimes on people with blond hair. Some just disagree with that hair color. So disagreeing is not harmful. And you are the one that brought that point up. You said that silent disagreeing is harmful. Well thats your opinion. I think that mindframes like yours is harmful. Get up from where?! I never fell. Maybe in your eyes, but not in mine. And that is what counts. I feel no shame in what I believe, regardless of whether you like it or not. So maybe you need to either get up yourself, or stop seeing things.I said I'd stop commenting to your posts. But what the heck, I'm still doing it.Real cute! How intelligent. Thanks for the compliment.emoticonXRolleyesAnd I'm happy to defend mine. It is you who can't take someone disagreeing with you. I'm sick of the whole," You're hurting my family speech." But handling you is a walk in the park. But also very annoying. I'd bet you'd be nothing if you didn't have your son, and family to keep throwing into the pot. Stop hiding behind them and start doing the debate on your own. LOL!! And thats why you can't even take a silent disagreement.(and stuff?) LOLAnd I'm most sorry for that. But will not take responsibility for it. But I dislike anyone who is harming him physically, and mentally.First of all my username is not sunshine.emoticonXRolleyes Like I said, I'm not goning to feel guilty for holding my own opinion. And I'm not taking the responsability for any harm done to your son. I don't even know you or him, and before I started posting here, you did not know my views.So they were not harmful to you or your child. So like they say, what you don't know won't hurt you. But what does not kill you, makes you stronger. So you'll have to either be stronger because of people not agreeing to that lifestyle, or you can let it eat you up inside. But whatever course you take, or don't take. YOU and ONLY YOU!! Are responsiable for it. Blaming others for something that happns to you, is your fault. Not excluding the ones who commit hate crimes. But the fact that you don't like my stand, and how its affecting you. Is your problem not mine. And this from a 40 year old who can't take others point of view without saying it is harmful. And who ends her statements with," And stuff." Come on! Does that seem like a reliable source to you?! Let me answer that...NO!! Good try, but not good enough. And just because I don't have as much experience with gay lifestyles, does not mean I don't have life experience. Gay life, is not the only lifestyle out there. So yes, as far as that gose, I'm proud I don't! HUH?!

I am talking about people who argue over the existence of a discriminatory practice.It should be fairly obvious that if there was no disagreement, ergo people were ONLY for the removal of discrimination against gays, then the discrimination would be removed.When it comes to votes in favor of discrimination, or voices which enable discrimination to continue, the "respectfulness" of the voice is irrelevant.Are you telling me that you think that if every voice in opposition of gay equality on issues like adoption or gay civil unions were suddenly turned into "respectful opinions", that it would mean the discrimination would cease to exist?You have given no reason why that isn't the case.Moreover, just because MULTIPLE things may cause X to exist, doesn't mean that an individual component of the cause of X is somehow absolved of its part in causing X to exist.It's funny how you often castigate gays in their fight for equality, but when it comes to posting incidences where anti-gay people castigate gays and make gays to feel "like they are causing something awful" (regardless of "respect"), you are silent.Quite frankly, I don't agree with how far Jitobear has taken this.But on another level, I stand by my statements 100%.As far as "unprovable", the proof has been submitted.In the above statements, you have done little more than exaggerate my own statements to the absurd, or blindly stated the contrary with no example.[quote=jyoshu]Impact or cause? You're using a lighter term. Since you aren't using the term "cause" can I assume you agree that attributing cause to someone wh respectfully disagrees is unreasonable?[/quoet]No. You can't.So let me get this straight.You said "A".I replied to your statement of "A" with "B".And now you insist on asking me what "B" has to do with "C"?emoticonXDonno Of course, next time you try to say "A" again and I reply with "B", I expect you'll continue to insist I have given no proof...Along those lines, do you disagree with what I ACTUALLY said above?No. I don't know what you mean as it hasn't been explicitly defined before."redefining marriage"? That is supported discrimination."morally ok"? I personally could care less about. If that is truly a "silent" opinion, it's like a bear fart in the woods with nobody to hear it...It's funny how you did that.I was talking about just DISAGREEMENT and what issues the DISAGREEMENT revolves around.I said nothing about "respectful". I made no question regarding "respectful".And then you turn around and pretend I need the obvious regarding "respectful disagreement" pointed out.Maybe you can point out where I had any question or issue regarding what constituted RESPECTFUL disagreement, or acknowledge your allegation was a load of horse-manure?Or maybe ignore the whole thing entirely... emoticonXRolleyes I always have to chuckle when you try to argue that I "know" a position in agreement with you.I know. Why don't I just say that Jyoshu obviously "knows" there is no good secular argument against gay marriage, and that the majority of people against gay marriage have that position in conjunction with blatant prejudice towards gays...< end sarcasm >How do you differentiate a SIGNIFICANT difference between "whole side" and "individuals"?I have no idea why you think that would be a requirement.This is a mundane refusal to admit the obvious!If 100 people push a brick wall and force it to topple, then it's not just the "whole side" of the 100 people, but each individual person involved bears a responsibility for toppling that brick wall.It's funny how you want to talk about the effect of the "whole", but the COMPONENTS of the whole can be blameless of the effect?You're wrong.If the support for the discrimination didn't exist, then the discrimination wouldn't exist.You can't support an action and then pretend to be blameless because that action had an effect just because you were one of many who supported that action.

No, You're a bigot for classifying me. I never said your views were, ugly, stupid, hateful, etc. I just disagreed with them. Classifying something, or someone, is walking along the lines of being a bigot. At least in this instance. You classify people who don't agree with that lifestlye as hateful. That is prejudice. Expecially since I'm not a hateful person. I just disagree with that lifestyle. Meaning< I'm not going to practice it, and I'm not going to support it. If thats what they want to do, then fine. But I don't support it. If thats hateful, then you need to look up the word hateful again. Let me.....HATEFUL1. Arousing or worthy of hatred.deteastable.HATE1. An extreme feeling of dislike, animosity.I don't fit into any of these definitions. So before you keep calling me hateful, you better think about it first. You don't know me enough to say I'm hateful. And none of my statements here have shown that I'm hateful towards gays. If I was hateful towards them, I would condone gay bashing. I wouldn't be ready to entertain my gay cousin and his friends this weekend, when they come and visit. And I wouldn't be so kind to my gay neighbors downstairs from me. SO!! That is why I called you a bigot. You took a word and tried to push it on my, because you are prejudice against any who disagree with gay marriage. Whether it makes sense or not. Bigots do that. They don't think about it, they just lash out, at anyone who does not fit into their mindframe, color, etc. And thats what you did.Yup That is what I said. BUT, I'm talking about your continuing to call me hateful because I disagree. You have a preconcieved idea, about people who disagree with you. You set them all up in the same class as the ones, who outwardly oppose gays. That is a preconcieved idea. And a fallcey. And trending on the lines of saying people cannot have an opinion without being hateful.Again that problem lays with the ones who carry out the crimes. If they can't distinguish between, mere disagreement, and justification of their actions. Then they have the distorted view. They have the problem with brain patterns working correctly. The problem STILL does not rest with the ones who disagree, and do nothing more. To say that is a fallcey.Its a misunderstanding when you quote someone wrong, and misuse words against them it is. Me being part of a big problem, is a misunderstanding you choose to accept. Although I could care less.Then you be the one to prove it to be harmful. And don't quote articals that are based on people who are outwardly, claiming gays are bad. Find a source that shows, without a doubt, that disagreeing is what is helping people commit violent crimes. People who respectfully disagree, still help create gay violence. And lets not use any WHAT IF'S.No, but your assumptions are.If it was me. No I would not feel comfortable. And being black, I do get discriminated against. And people will choose lighter skin over darker when it comes to chossing someone for a job. But you know what?! I really don't care. Because I feel this way, ones who are activly discriminating against me, are the ones to blame. Ones who don't want to give me jobs because I'm black, and ones who want to harm me because of my color. They are the ones to blame. But the ones who silently disagree, then I could care less. As long as they are not getting in my way. They can have their opinion. And as long as they don't harm me physically, then feel what you want to feel. It won't stop me. If a person is self-confident as they say they are, they wouldn't worry about ones not doing them harm by disagreeing. They would only worry about those who, actively stand in their way. I don't stand in anyones way. I disagree, and as long as no one is trying to force me into what I don't like. Then I usually keep it to myself. But since this is a debate forum, here I go... I already did if you read my reply up top.I bet you do. You wanna keep playing the game of who bets?!emoticonXRolleyesNot saying that your really insane. But what does that prove. Plenty of shrinks/mental health workers have lost their license because off doing things that are mentally unfit. A postion in life proves nothing now-a-days. Its just a postion. Although I don't think you are really insane, just some of your statements.No, but crazy statements do.Not really. You still didn't settle that silent disagreeing argument. I never judged your character. I was refering to your statements, and what your argument was based on. Connect the dots here!!Only if you do.:)I'm sure your going to tell everyone. Anyway, having my opinion respectfully, is not harming him. He doesn't even know I exisist. Big part my views are playing in his life.emoticonXRolleyesIf you're on here talking to me you will, hear it. The only way you won't have to hear what I'm saying, is if you stop talking to me. Until then I will speak my mind, regardless of whether you think you want to hear it or not. Lesson 1.- If you speak to people, they usuallt talk back. And might even say things you don't want to hear, or already know.emoticonXRolleyesI never used a put up or shut-up attitude. So what are you talking about?! Unless you're telling me to put-up or shut-up. In that case it will be choice number three, and that is," Ring the alarm, baby!!" *Joke*I'm not claiming anything personal towards you. So I guess you would know yourself more, then a stranger would. No arguments there. But I know the stuff that I see written down, thats what I attack. Isn't it, gay lifestyle that we are discussing here?! Gay marriage etc.? So that is what I assumed you were alluding to. And judging from your comment at the bottom, that is what you are saying. So for which I'm saying, I'm not ashamed I don't have experience as far as knowing about that lifestyle. I know enough about it.Plus my age is not an issuse. I know what I'm talking about, and what my stand is. So being young has nothing to do with it.(That may sound hypocritical, since I made comments about yor age. Oh well your allowed one)I know poison kills, and never drank it. I know in china they speak chinese, and never been there. I know how a gun works and never held one. So your point is?! I know about gay life from, people around me. Just because I'm not in it, does not mean I'm ignorent to it.Didn't say you were.

Only one thinks that blondes should die. In walks a blonde and his/her child/family. Lets make it more personal. Lets take the same room - only its not blondes they have a problem with - its you. Is it a place you would feel safe? Is it a place you take your neices/nephews? And you are right - in general nobody is committing acts of hate violence against blondes. Nor are there really any groups questioning whether they are good for society, marriage, children, etc. Both are being done to gays. You do the math on what silent disagreement may do to a family.I bet.It was no more inane than your labeling me INSANE. By the way, did I mention I am a part-time mental health worker in Dakota County, MN?And you have been example of tolerance in those who disagree with you? Hell - not sharing your point of view makes one a bigot!I would support gay rights regarldess. I supported them before I was ever even pregnant. I just happen to have relevant life experiences that pokes holes in your opinions. And how about not making assumptions about who I am, can be, will be, was? You know my stance on a single issue. That hardly makes you an expert as to my character.Lighten up.And what do you suppose saying his family is bad for society does for his mental health?I have been through holy hell and back - I really don't need this lesson from you.Or I can continue to argue with those I believe to be wrong. And I can continue to dismantle false arguments used to justify your opinion. My options are much broader than put up or shut up.I was responsding to a comment you made about me. I am the expert on me. Somebody's insecurities showing again? Who said anything about gay lifestyle? First of all - what is a gay lifestyle? There is just life. Secondly - I said I believed you had limited life experience - it was meant to be a comment on the fact that I believe you to be very young.Its interesting that you claim having little or no interaction whith the "gay lifestyle" (those who are alive and gay???) and are even proud of that. You basically announce your ignorance on the matter and yet still feel qualified to make judgement calls about these people and their families? What were you saying about preconceptions?By the way - I'm not gay.

So given than that's specifically what you're talking about, should I assume that you don't think someone's moral disagreement over homosexuality causes harm? Because you only seem to want to talk about the discriminatory question.We also need to remember that what is discriminatory in this is very much a matter of opinion. As well as whether or not the discrimination is warranted.We aren't talking abot voting here. But if you're going to continue with these vague statements like "voices which enable", you need to quantify it and give examples. What constitutes a voice that doesn't enable discrimination to continue? I'm simply not going to let you get away with these vague statements if you insist on making them. Give some specifics and draw the lines.I don't know. That's the point, no one does. You working off an unfounded premise.It makes no sense that it WOULD be the case to begin with. It makes much MORE sense that the disrespectful and hateful voices would be fueling the "XXXX" gays deal with. ( as you put it)The key word is "MAY" cause, in the first part of your statement. It's funny how you jump to the automatic assumption that those individual components are the cause with a word like "may" in your premise. And then even expect someone to prove they aren't (a negative).Back it up. Where have I castigated gays? Or is that another unbacked claim?The little "logic" statement or what?Well, in your opinion. emoticonXGood Really? You could care less that some morally disapprove of homosexuality? Wow! That's quite a statement."respectful" has been a part of this from early on, before you even weighed in. We've been talking about opinions that weren't hateful and respectful, and the fact that there is a difference. Let me help you get back on track: Some people respectfully disagree on issues related to homosexuality. The issue is whenever someone does that, it causes harm. Remember now? Please try to keep up. It's very simple, and it's a very crucial difference. The "whole side" contains both people who are very hateful and obviously harmful, the Phelpsian types. It could be said that it contains people who also disagree on these issues without being hateful, and without being rooted in hate, and respectfully give their opinions. It IS a national debate, after all. I'd say that's a significant difference. Both may disagree that gays should have marriage, but may completely differ in the other details (such as that gays should STILL get couples' benefits). When you focus ONLY on the whole group the whole point of the debate is lost because you'v then added hateful dissenters to the equation, when it's about the non-hateful ones.Depends! Some of them might not even be pushing, but they may be on that side of the wall--that's the whole point!And for the record Jyoshu, don't think it has gone unnoticed how you suddenly have dropped the "silent disagreement" approach, replacing "silent" with "respectful".

I am talking about people who argue over the existence of a discriminatory practice.It should be fairly obvious that if there was no disagreement, ergo people were ONLY for the removal of discrimination against gays, then the discrimination would be removed.When it comes to votes in favor of discrimination, or voices which enable discrimination to continue, the "respectfulness" of the voice is irrelevant.Are you telling me that you think that if every voice in opposition of gay equality on issues like adoption or gay civil unions were suddenly turned into "respectful opinions", that it would mean the discrimination would cease to exist?You have given no reason why that isn't the case.Moreover, just because MULTIPLE things may cause X to exist, doesn't mean that an individual component of the cause of X is somehow absolved of its part in causing X to exist.It's funny how you often castigate gays in their fight for equality, but when it comes to posting incidences where anti-gay people castigate gays and make gays to feel "like they are causing something awful" (regardless of "respect"), you are silent.Quite frankly, I don't agree with how far Jitobear has taken this.But on another level, I stand by my statements 100%.As far as "unprovable", the proof has been submitted.In the above statements, you have done little more than exaggerate my own statements to the absurd, or blindly stated the contrary with no example.[quote=jyoshu]Impact or cause? You're using a lighter term. Since you aren't using the term "cause" can I assume you agree that attributing cause to someone wh respectfully disagrees is unreasonable?[/quoet]No. You can't.So let me get this straight.You said "A".I replied to your statement of "A" with "B".And now you insist on asking me what "B" has to do with "C"?emoticonXDonno Of course, next time you try to say "A" again and I reply with "B", I expect you'll continue to insist I have given no proof...Along those lines, do you disagree with what I ACTUALLY said above?No. I don't know what you mean as it hasn't been explicitly defined before."redefining marriage"? That is supported discrimination."morally ok"? I personally could care less about. If that is truly a "silent" opinion, it's like a bear fart in the woods with nobody to hear it...It's funny how you did that.I was talking about just DISAGREEMENT and what issues the DISAGREEMENT revolves around.I said nothing about "respectful". I made no question regarding "respectful".And then you turn around and pretend I need the obvious regarding "respectful disagreement" pointed out.Maybe you can point out where I had any question or issue regarding what constituted RESPECTFUL disagreement, or acknowledge your allegation was a load of horse-manure?Or maybe ignore the whole thing entirely... emoticonXRolleyes I always have to chuckle when you try to argue that I "know" a position in agreement with you.I know. Why don't I just say that Jyoshu obviously "knows" there is no good secular argument against gay marriage, and that the majority of people against gay marriage have that position in conjunction with blatant prejudice towards gays...< end sarcasm >How do you differentiate a SIGNIFICANT difference between "whole side" and "individuals"?I have no idea why you think that would be a requirement.This is a mundane refusal to admit the obvious!If 100 people push a brick wall and force it to topple, then it's not just the "whole side" of the 100 people, but each individual person involved bears a responsibility for toppling that brick wall.It's funny how you want to talk about the effect of the "whole", but the COMPONENTS of the whole can be blameless of the effect?You're wrong.If the support for the discrimination didn't exist, then the discrimination wouldn't exist.You can't support an action and then pretend to be blameless because that action had an effect just because you were one of many who supported that action.

Thats ok dude! We all have our, bite your head off moments.LOL :) That upstairs neighbor was a jerk. He couldn't even take care of a woman right. So he really shouldn't have been saying anything about someone else. And I don't know why she was talking! She had other things to worry about. Like not getting her head bashed in.emoticonXRolleyes They were both just fools.A guy here bothers the two guys downstairs form me. He even peed on their welcome mat. He also broke into their car and messed it up really bad. And then shot at the door of the car. They had to get a new one. And not only that, he threated their life. They are thinking about moving. I think that is taking an opinion too far. That is just nasty!! They have a daughter. And no, I don't agree with it. I think that a child should grow up in a home with a mother and a father. A mother is nurturing, and has a special bond with a child. While a father is more of a protector. I just believe in the balance of a mother and father. I don't think its healthy, from my standpoint to have two people, of the same sex raising a child. To me there is no balance. I know some will disagree. But that my unwavering stand on it. I don't know how they feel. But no, I would not tell them that. Its not my place to tell them that. That is not my business to go up to them and say nasty things. Like I've been saying all along. I don't agree, but I'm not going to harass, those who do pactice it. I just won't practice it, or support it. I'll just live my life according to the standards that I go by. And treat all humans with respect. Anything else?! I'll answer more questions.lol

Well I didn't mean to be such a bitch, because you weren't talking to me, but stating an opinion. I don't know if you realize how hearing that so much and so often can make a person feel. In my mind this is what I heard: "You are harming your kid and society at large by doing what feels right and natural to you. I still remember vividly having a violent, homophobic jerk for an upstairs neighbor a few years ago. He used to alternate between beating his girlfriend and (trying) to intimidate us. She used to holler hateful XXXX at us too, come to think of it. So anyway, I can be a bit sensitive at times, I admit. I apologize if I said you were personally dishing out XXXX at me.You didn't say they had any kids, so I'm going on the assumption (yeah I know) that they don't have any. So if your upstairs neighbors adopted a kid, or one of them had a kid from another marriage, you would think they were harming the child and society? Would you tell them that? Actually, I'm sort of curious. No one here in this community has ever said anything like that to us, but sometimes I wonder how they really feel.

Do you have any sort of evidence to support your views? Or are they just that: your views?

It can cause harm, depending upon the importance a person places upon a need for moral "agreement" or approval.Your moral agreement means nothing to me.But if a father were to morally disagree with who his son or daughter is, that could have deep and long-lasting repercussions.Whether or not discrimination is warranted is obviously a debatable issue involving value judgments.Whether or not something is "discriminatory" being a "matter of opinion"???emoticonXDonno discriminate: To make distinctions on the basis of class or category without regard to individual merit; show preference or prejudice: was accused of discriminating against women; discriminated in favor of his cronies.http://www.answers.com/topic/discriminateIt's a word with a definition. Something either fits, or it doesn't.To pretend it's a "matter of opinion" is just plain wrong.If somebody says that somebody is disqualified because they are gay, that is DISCRIMINATION.Jyoshu? Can you give me an example of something you think is debatable with regards to whether or not it is discrimination?A voice which fights against it.Take the gay marriage / gay civil union issue.Those people who don't voice an opinion in favor of gay civil unions are enabling the discrimination between heterosexual and homosexual couples to continue.Gee. Can I count on the same from you? emoticonXAngel You don't know because you revel in a position of "not knowing", or assuming the best when it comes to the anti-gay side.Yes. We do know.If every voice out there against gay marriage "respectfully" said that gays should not be able to marry, it wouldn't change the situation at all. Discrimination would still continue.Why do you insist on "not knowing" what is obvious?Mind-BOGGLINGLY missing the point.Yes. Gays DO put up with "XXXX" from the "disrespectful and hateful voices".But the RESPECTFUL voices which advocate discrimination ALSO cause us problems.I really don't know how else to explain it beyond the obvious already stated.Suppose 55 people out of 100 said "no" to gay marriage, with 45 people of the 55 saying "%@#$ you gays".If those 45 suddenly just said "no" and not demonstrating the disrespect, would that suddenly mean that the problems gays face by not having gay marriage recognition suddenly disappear?Continue to obfuscate the issue and you'll only be confusing yourself...The "may" was an oversight which I will now correct. If you want to argue why the "may" needs to be there, then I recommend you do so...Moreover, just because MULTIPLE things cause X to exist, doesn't mean that an individual component of the cause of X is somehow absolved of its part in causing X to exist.I have NO unbacked claims, unlike you...For starters, I'll define "castigate" because it boggles my mind that you would even pose such an obviously answerable challenge.castigate: to subject to severe punishment, reproof, or criticismSecondly? An example?How about your criticism of gays for the whole "Easter" thing at the White House and the gays making a "political statement" wearing matching accessories?ROFLMAO!I requote it DIRECTLY ABOVE, reposting what you were talking about, and still you insist on the confused response...For the THIRD time...I have given the proof before, with again no comment from you. I showed that around 70% of the people who are against gay marriage are ALSO against any form of gay union recognition.We could do further math and demonstrate that those against gay marriage also have a majority (of that sub-group) against a variety of other gay equality issues.They're against gays. Not JUST gay marriage.I'll ask again:Do you disagree with the indented statements directly above?I'm really curious how you think it isn't supported discrimination.Please. Explain that one...1) Stay in context.2) Why should it be?Some people think Christians aren't that bright for believing some of the stuff they do. Does that keep you up at night?People morally disapprove of blacks, jews, christians, whites, etc, etc, etc...Why waste the energy on being concerned with a situation that I'll never be able to change, and in most cases has no real effect on me?Now, change that from "some" to a SPECIFIC group of people, and it is a whole different ball-game...Change that to having an actual effect on me, like denied equal rights, and it's a whole different ball-game...And note, I am talking about MY personal perspective...You mentioned "respect" ONCE in this thread, referring to Jitobear, a couple days ago.And then, when you start talking to me, the whole "silent" thing disappears, and it's ONLY about "respect"...http://4forums.com/political/search.php?searchid=112603I have been talking about the "silent disagreement", referencing other people who have talked about "silent disagreement".And now suddenly, talk about the "silent disagreement" disappears in favor of pushing the "respectful" disagreement.Next time, try not to get so pompous when the message board has a pretty good search feature...You've got this habit of trying to throw in "differences" which exist, and derive significances to the differences where the significances don't exist. Or, in this case, the significance doesn't negate that BOTH sides of the "difference" have a similar effect to varying degrees.One voice, whether it be hateful or respectful, against gay equality counts just the same at the toll booth. One voice, saying that you can't do "X" because you're gay, has an impact. The voice being hateful may cause extra hurt, but that doesn't mean the "respectful" voice doesn't cause hurt.Man. Dogs chasing their tails make more progress...If a person's disagreement is SILENT, which would include "not even pushing", then it's a bear fart in the woods.You took my analogy about 100 people PUSHING on a wall, and then turned around and said that some of the people may not be pushing...Yeah. So OBVIOUSLY when I was talking about the people PUSHING on the wall, I must have been lumping in those that weren't doing any pushing at all...emoticonXDonno Yet another question for you to avoid.Does ANY of that last part of my reply contain any new information from me???Or is it just me repeating the same stuff I already said?

While I haven't stated it before (and haven't really been involved in this discussion until recently), I'll do so now.I also don't "blame" those who JUST "silently disagree" for violence against gays.< snort >In some ways, there is a very real effort to eliminate gays. Primarily consensually via the "ex-gay" movement. To some degree, involving parents who insist that their gay teens go to these camps against their will.And then of course, we have some parents who throw their gay kids out of their home.But as far as an actual "holocaust" with death camps goes, I guess we should be thankful that we don't have one. That way, it allows some people to focus on how gays aren't being killed so that they can ignore the other XXXX that gays go through...That, and ignoring psychiatrists who DO TALK about REAL PSYCHOLOGICAL HARM done to gay people via homophobia, discrimination, etc, etc,...

I must respond to how you put this, considering what has been discussed on this thread. You say he took an opinion too far. What is the opinion and is there any instance where the opinion that caused him to be so horrible, would be a worthwhile thing? The fact that something does not find expression in the greatest atrocities imaginable, does not make it good.

No. They can't. They are not synonyms. They have distinct and separate meanings, regarding distinct and separate attributes.silent: a : making no utterance : MUTE, SPEECHLESS b : indisposed to speak : not loquaciousrespectful: a : high or special regard : ESTEEM b : the quality or state of being esteemed c plural : expressions of respect or deference <paid our respects>If a person is in "silent disagreement", they are disagreeing without saying they disagree. SPEECHLESS.If a person is in "respectful disagreement", they are holding the opposition with high regard, but they CAN TALK about their opinion. They can be silent and respectful, or not silent but still respectful.And of course, neither silent nor respectful is another option.Pick up a dictionary and read.No "change".Just not based on this absurd notion that "silent" and "respectful" are the same.The examples I gave were NOT SILENT, nor did I ever claim they were.The examples I gave were often not specific to "respectful", and could be used as either entirely "respectful", disrespectful, or both.They sure as heck aren't silent. I will agree there.As for "respectful", in part it depends upon what you mean by speaking "against anyone". This whole discussion on GAY MARRIAGE regarding "respectful" is centered around the notion that the "speaking publicly" is NOT against GAYS, but rather gay MARRIAGE.I will admit that is sometimes a rarety. Despite your claims, YOU have linked to anti-gay web-sites which have slurred gays.Ergo, while your posting itself ruled you as not "silent", your content in that post demonstrated disrespect.See the difference?If I had an opinion about God not existing, and don't say anything about it, that is silent.If I had an opinion about God not existing, and said that was my opinion, I wouldn't be silent. But I could still be respectful to others who had different beliefs when I explained my personal belief.Not silent, but still respectful.How the heck can other people "argue" that my views/opinions on gay marriage are harmful?Don't get me wrong. I know some people have tried to make that claim, but invariably in attempting to ARGUE the issue, they fall incredibly short of debating the point as they have the opening salvo, but then absolutely nothing to demonstrate harm.I have explicitly explained WHY and WHEN a "opinion" against gay marriage can be harmful.If you READ and COMPREHEND what I am saying, and stop with this silly notion that "silent" and "respectful" mean the same thing, maybe you can come back with some constructive comments for discussion...

You say you are black. What if I told you my quite, respectful opinion is that blacks are ugly, lazy, illiterate, gang-banger crooks who are bad for society? Where would you place my views on the scale of love and hate?(For the record, I in no way, shape or form believe these things. I am speaking hypothetically)The arguments used to back up that opinion are false, prejudicial, religiously fueled misinformation. Hate led to the arguments (that you believe) that led to your disgreement. The reasons you "disagree" aren't valid. That's why I fight them.It is not prejudice to find your opinions wrong or hateful. And I do. You are out of your mind if you think I wouldn't take a comment that directly insults my family with my fists in my pocket. Would you? You don't strike me as the kind of person who would.I lashed out because you said that gay parents are bad for children and society. That is a direct insult to my son, my family and my choices as a parent. Furthermore - it is NOT TRUE. Once again - you know my mind on one issue. Leave your comments within that realm please.No I have not. I specifically stated otherwise. I recognize the difference between a peaceful objector and a gay basher. I am saying the peaceful objectors make it easier for the gay bashers. They aren't intentionally doing so - but it does none the less.Anyone can have an opinion. Doesn't mean that there aren't opinions that are harmful and hateful.It would be a lot harder for a gay basher to bash if the environment he was in embraced his victim. It should be obvious. An environment that is hostile or apethetic towards an individual or group will make that environment less safe for that group. In the earlier part of this century black Americans were frequently the targets of horrible violence by racists. The number of people carrying out the violence was limited - but the apathetic, quiet agreement and fear from everyone else was also part of the problem.It is not OK to quietly sick back and allow harmful misinformation about our gay brothers and sisters be propogated. It is not OK to be apathetic when they are done harm. And even telling me that "gay parents are bad for children and society" is propogating harmful information about gay people. No, you aren't a gay basher. I am sure you aren't even hateful. But that kind of talk about gay people is wrong. It hurts. Its not OK. How do you suppose your gay neighbors and little girl would feel about it if they were to hear it?You should. I do.Sure - but they aren't prevented from working in the field just due to mental health issues. Mental health problems usually are as managable as an other health problem.But there are a miriad of people like you. And you all contribute to the environments you live in.Well remember that the next time you tell me to come back and post after I "get some help".No - you were implying I needed to "put up or shut up" when it came to opinions like yours. I am just saying I don't have to. I suspect you don't know too much since you believe stuff that isn't true and from what I could tell from your posts you were unwilling to examine posted evidence/links that counters what you believe.Age does bring wisdom. Or should anyway. When I am 80 I am sure I will know all the ways I was stupid at 40, like I now know all the ways I was stupid at 20.Then tell me - how is gay life different than yours? - they have jobs, interests, bills, hobbies, and desire love and families. Some are lazy, petty, irresponsible, mean. They are pretty much like anyone else. What the hell is it about their lifestyle that you find objectionable? That fact that they, like you, love?

No, You're a bigot for classifying me. I never said your views were, ugly, stupid, hateful, etc. I just disagreed with them. Classifying something, or someone, is walking along the lines of being a bigot. At least in this instance. You classify people who don't agree with that lifestlye as hateful. That is prejudice. Expecially since I'm not a hateful person. I just disagree with that lifestyle. Meaning< I'm not going to practice it, and I'm not going to support it. If thats what they want to do, then fine. But I don't support it. If thats hateful, then you need to look up the word hateful again. Let me.....HATEFUL1. Arousing or worthy of hatred.deteastable.HATE1. An extreme feeling of dislike, animosity.I don't fit into any of these definitions. So before you keep calling me hateful, you better think about it first. You don't know me enough to say I'm hateful. And none of my statements here have shown that I'm hateful towards gays. If I was hateful towards them, I would condone gay bashing. I wouldn't be ready to entertain my gay cousin and his friends this weekend, when they come and visit. And I wouldn't be so kind to my gay neighbors downstairs from me. SO!! That is why I called you a bigot. You took a word and tried to push it on my, because you are prejudice against any who disagree with gay marriage. Whether it makes sense or not. Bigots do that. They don't think about it, they just lash out, at anyone who does not fit into their mindframe, color, etc. And thats what you did.Yup That is what I said. BUT, I'm talking about your continuing to call me hateful because I disagree. You have a preconcieved idea, about people who disagree with you. You set them all up in the same class as the ones, who outwardly oppose gays. That is a preconcieved idea. And a fallcey. And trending on the lines of saying people cannot have an opinion without being hateful.Again that problem lays with the ones who carry out the crimes. If they can't distinguish between, mere disagreement, and justification of their actions. Then they have the distorted view. They have the problem with brain patterns working correctly. The problem STILL does not rest with the ones who disagree, and do nothing more. To say that is a fallcey.Its a misunderstanding when you quote someone wrong, and misuse words against them it is. Me being part of a big problem, is a misunderstanding you choose to accept. Although I could care less.Then you be the one to prove it to be harmful. And don't quote articals that are based on people who are outwardly, claiming gays are bad. Find a source that shows, without a doubt, that disagreeing is what is helping people commit violent crimes. People who respectfully disagree, still help create gay violence. And lets not use any WHAT IF'S.No, but your assumptions are.If it was me. No I would not feel comfortable. And being black, I do get discriminated against. And people will choose lighter skin over darker when it comes to chossing someone for a job. But you know what?! I really don't care. Because I feel this way, ones who are activly discriminating against me, are the ones to blame. Ones who don't want to give me jobs because I'm black, and ones who want to harm me because of my color. They are the ones to blame. But the ones who silently disagree, then I could care less. As long as they are not getting in my way. They can have their opinion. And as long as they don't harm me physically, then feel what you want to feel. It won't stop me. If a person is self-confident as they say they are, they wouldn't worry about ones not doing them harm by disagreeing. They would only worry about those who, actively stand in their way. I don't stand in anyones way. I disagree, and as long as no one is trying to force me into what I don't like. Then I usually keep it to myself. But since this is a debate forum, here I go...

You claim "you know what you're talking about..."???1) You didn't know how many states had legalized gay marriage. You thought it was four, while in fact it is just one.(I'm not going to itemize all the other smaller factual errors you made in that discussion, but I can if you need me to.)2) You think homosexuality is a "choice". (In my own personal evaluation, anybody who claims that automatically indicates they haven't a clue. Not even the "reparative therapy" crowd try to pretend it's a choice. People studying this issue on BOTH sides of the aisle acknowledge it's not a choice.)Quite frankly, I'll leave it at that for now, because I doubt if any of this will be addressed.No. SpicyGirl, you do not know what you are talking about.You have opinions on this issue, but there are simple fundamental facts which you have shown you don't know.

Disagreeing that gays should redefine marriage while still maintaining that they should get couples' benefits. Could possibly be separate-but-equal issue, but debatable in terms of discriminatory. For that matter, I did say "debatebale." Anything is debateable.Logistically, I simply don't have the time to deal with a debate where every little sentence is nitpicked to death here, so I'm going to respond the rest in a more general way.Your question about whether discrimination would disappear if a large % of people started respectfully disagreeing is an invalid question because the problems would already have been caused and be in place before they started that. Respectfully disagreeing doesn't necessarily mean opposing the discrimination. But it doesn't necessarily mean CAUSING it either. It's too vague of a situation.Correcting your "may" oversight is all too convenient. The "may" is more accurate because it's an unproven premise to begin with; your freudian slip was noted. Since you're focusing on the "criticism" def of "castigate" then I'll accept that and your example, with the understanding that with that def, gay rights people castigate others all the time as well. emoticonXAngel And finally, the issue (for me) IS respectful disagreement. That's what I consider to be the main problem with your view, esp. given that you've allowed for "silent" disagreement already.

It can cause harm, depending upon the importance a person places upon a need for moral "agreement" or approval.Your moral agreement means nothing to me.But if a father were to morally disagree with who his son or daughter is, that could have deep and long-lasting repercussions.Whether or not discrimination is warranted is obviously a debatable issue involving value judgments.Whether or not something is "discriminatory" being a "matter of opinion"???emoticonXDonno discriminate: To make distinctions on the basis of class or category without regard to individual merit; show preference or prejudice: was accused of discriminating against women; discriminated in favor of his cronies.http://www.answers.com/topic/discriminateIt's a word with a definition. Something either fits, or it doesn't.To pretend it's a "matter of opinion" is just plain wrong.If somebody says that somebody is disqualified because they are gay, that is DISCRIMINATION.Jyoshu? Can you give me an example of something you think is debatable with regards to whether or not it is discrimination?A voice which fights against it.Take the gay marriage / gay civil union issue.Those people who don't voice an opinion in favor of gay civil unions are enabling the discrimination between heterosexual and homosexual couples to continue.Gee. Can I count on the same from you? emoticonXAngel You don't know because you revel in a position of "not knowing", or assuming the best when it comes to the anti-gay side.Yes. We do know.If every voice out there against gay marriage "respectfully" said that gays should not be able to marry, it wouldn't change the situation at all. Discrimination would still continue.Why do you insist on "not knowing" what is obvious?Mind-BOGGLINGLY missing the point.Yes. Gays DO put up with "XXXX" from the "disrespectful and hateful voices".But the RESPECTFUL voices which advocate discrimination ALSO cause us problems.I really don't know how else to explain it beyond the obvious already stated.Suppose 55 people out of 100 said "no" to gay marriage, with 45 people of the 55 saying "%@#$ you gays".If those 45 suddenly just said "no" and not demonstrating the disrespect, would that suddenly mean that the problems gays face by not having gay marriage recognition suddenly disappear?Continue to obfuscate the issue and you'll only be confusing yourself...The "may" was an oversight which I will now correct. If you want to argue why the "may" needs to be there, then I recommend you do so...Moreover, just because MULTIPLE things cause X to exist, doesn't mean that an individual component of the cause of X is somehow absolved of its part in causing X to exist.I have NO unbacked claims, unlike you...For starters, I'll define "castigate" because it boggles my mind that you would even pose such an obviously answerable challenge.castigate: to subject to severe punishment, reproof, or criticismSecondly? An example?How about your criticism of gays for the whole "Easter" thing at the White House and the gays making a "political statement" wearing matching accessories?ROFLMAO!I requote it DIRECTLY ABOVE, reposting what you were talking about, and still you insist on the confused response...For the THIRD time...I have given the proof before, with again no comment from you. I showed that around 70% of the people who are against gay marriage are ALSO against any form of gay union recognition.We could do further math and demonstrate that those against gay marriage also have a majority (of that sub-group) against a variety of other gay equality issues.They're against gays. Not JUST gay marriage.I'll ask again:Do you disagree with the indented statements directly above?I'm really curious how you think it isn't supported discrimination.Please. Explain that one...1) Stay in context.2) Why should it be?Some people think Christians aren't that bright for believing some of the stuff they do. Does that keep you up at night?People morally disapprove of blacks, jews, christians, whites, etc, etc, etc...Why waste the energy on being concerned with a situation that I'll never be able to change, and in most cases has no real effect on me?Now, change that from "some" to a SPECIFIC group of people, and it is a whole different ball-game...Change that to having an actual effect on me, like denied equal rights, and it's a whole different ball-game...And note, I am talking about MY personal perspective...You mentioned "respect" ONCE in this thread, referring to Jitobear, a couple days ago.And then, when you start talking to me, the whole "silent" thing disappears, and it's ONLY about "respect"...http://4forums.com/political/search.php?searchid=112603I have been talking about the "silent disagreement", referencing other people who have talked about "silent disagreement".And now suddenly, talk about the "silent disagreement" disappears in favor of pushing the "respectful" disagreement.Next time, try not to get so pompous when the message board has a pretty good search feature...You've got this habit of trying to throw in "differences" which exist, and derive significances to the differences where the significances don't exist. Or, in this case, the significance doesn't negate that BOTH sides of the "difference" have a similar effect to varying degrees.One voice, whether it be hateful or respectful, against gay equality counts just the same at the toll booth. One voice, saying that you can't do "X" because you're gay, has an impact. The voice being hateful may cause extra hurt, but that doesn't mean the "respectful" voice doesn't cause hurt.Man. Dogs chasing their tails make more progress...If a person's disagreement is SILENT, which would include "not even pushing", then it's a bear fart in the woods.You took my analogy about 100 people PUSHING on a wall, and then turned around and said that some of the people may not be pushing...Yeah. So OBVIOUSLY when I was talking about the people PUSHING on the wall, I must have been lumping in those that weren't doing any pushing at all...emoticonXDonno Yet another question for you to avoid.Does ANY of that last part of my reply contain any new information from me???Or is it just me repeating the same stuff I already said?

I'm going to have to agree with Jyoshu, every sentence does get picked to death here. And this debate can go on for months, and nothing will change. Because some people think that no one should be able to say, or think in a way that is contrary to how they think you should feel when it comes to gay marriage. And I'm just not feeling that.

If people who support gay marriage can speak about it, why is it they we can't lend our opinion RESPECTFULLY, without being judged?! I think it is hypocritical, to feel you can speak out, and judge others who say their opinions respectfully. Why should anyone have the right to judge others because of what opinions they hold.It was brought out that what if people thought blacks were ghetto, gang bangers, and some other stupid XXXX. How would I feel?! Well they already do, and I really don't give a damn. Like I said before, as long as they don't get in my way, so be it. Let them say what they want.

I respect every and anyone, while holding my own opinion. That is all I can offer. If anyone is not happy with that, then they can have my disrespect as opposed to my respect.

No, you answered all I asked, and honestly. Thank you.:)

Let me answer this before running off to play in another thread.:) When I said OPINION, I meant that it is obvious that he did not like to see gays around. Ok, fine, keep that XXXX to yourself. Is how I feel. But when you take, whatever you feel, out on someone else. That is going too far. That is taking what was an opinion, and making it into a crime, and something that is hurtful, and hateful. Now that is where you can use the term, HATEFUL. That is why I said what I said, and like I said it. You can have an opinion, but you don't have to act in a way that is hurtful to others. Get it?!

I must respond to how you put this, considering what has been discussed on this thread. You say he took an opinion too far. What is the opinion and is there any instance where the opinion that caused him to be so horrible, would be a worthwhile thing? The fact that something does not find expression in the greatest atrocities imaginable, does not make it good.

Don't play the game if you can't deal with the rules. That's not how it is working here. What people are doing are examining your arguments and pointing out the flaws. Simply because you don't like that doesn't mean you're being judged. Jyoshu gets his/her arguments shreaded from time to time and you don't see Jyoshu b*tching. That is the great thing about a opinion. You are free to voice it and others are free to shread it if it is based on poor reasoning or lack of facts. Your arguments being refuted =/= you being judged. Get that through your head. Again you seem to be confusing refutation of opinions as judgement of a person. However, I will admit that poor arguments often come from people with low amounts of knowledge or little educations, or simply a lack of examiniation of their own beliefs. This is why we go to debate: to ensure that our beliefs are valid and true. If you don't want to to this, don't enter into a debate. That's perfectly fine. Many people do not want to examine their beliefs and simply live their lives. Ignorance truly is bliss for them. Others however, do not wish to do this and seek knowledge. It was a hypothical comparsion using a argument that takes the logic of a opponent and concludes it as absurd, therefore making the argument absurd. This is used on a regular basis. If you don't like that, don't make a argument. Like I said before, if you can't handle the rules, don't play the game.Not wanting to change your beliefs isn't bad. Refusing to examine them is and you seem unable to do just that. Some advice: Perhaps you should lurk before posting and get to understand how arguments are made. There is no such thing as a simple opinion on most subjects here. If you make a claim, be ready to back it up with a rational argument. Crying foul when there is none does no one any good and makes you look quite bad.

What I see coming from gay opponents is a denial of reality. When one group presupposes a different group is inferior, bad or wrong, without a logical and thoughtful reasoning process; it can't help but cause suspicion, fear and negative bias towards the group that's different. Without rational reasons, irrational reasons must be created as to why the group in question is wrong. It stops us from asking thoughtful questions and gaining knowledge about others. The effect is negative to humanity. We are talking about the degree of that irrational negativity. The notion that people can keep their opinions to themselves I find also is not reality. We are social creatures, not individual islands closed off from one another. An idea or opinion one human has means nothing, until another person is there with whom to communicate and confirm and give value and meaning to the idea or opinion.

Refusing to examine them is and you seem unable to do just that. Some advice: Perhaps you should lurk before posting and get to understand how arguments are made. There is no such thing as a simple opinion on most subjects here. If you make a claim, be ready to back it up with a rational argument. Crying foul when there is none does no one any good and makes you look quite bad.

You're missing the HUGE road-block here.Equal DOES NOT EXIST.THAT is one of the huge problems that existed with the "separate but equal" black schools and white schools.

Disagreeing that gays should redefine marriage while still maintaining that they should get couples' benefits. Could possibly be separate-but-equal issue, but debatable in terms of discriminatory. For that matter, I did say "debatebale." Anything is debateable.Logistically, I simply don't have the time to deal with a debate where every little sentence is nitpicked to death here, so I'm going to respond the rest in a more general way.Your question about whether discrimination would disappear if a large % of people started respectfully disagreeing is an invalid question because the problems would already have been caused and be in place before they started that. Respectfully disagreeing doesn't necessarily mean opposing the discrimination. But it doesn't necessarily mean CAUSING it either. It's too vague of a situation.Correcting your "may" oversight is all too convenient. The "may" is more accurate because it's an unproven premise to begin with; your freudian slip was noted. Since you're focusing on the "criticism" def of "castigate" then I'll accept that and your example, with the understanding that with that def, gay rights people castigate others all the time as well. emoticonXAngel And finally, the issue (for me) IS respectful disagreement. That's what I consider to be the main problem with your view, esp. given that you've allowed for "silent" disagreement already.

This presents a puzzle to me. The "separate but equal" school analogy does not compute in your argument to redefine 'marriage'. I wonder why you keep pursuing that claim. A single set of laws governing gay unions and marriages is equivalent to a single school system serving black and white students. To say that all gay unions must be called marriages for that system to work is like saying all black students must be called white students for the school thing to work.Hogwash!Additionally, you argue that separate but equal schools don't work yet you have been DENIED efforts in a lot of states to start your own separate schools. Which is it that you want?

Then why oppose a 'separate-but-equal' argument on the basis that there is separatism if that's not what it is? Why even call it that? The "BUT EQUAL" would not be accurate if waht you say is the case, but that's not the basis of your argument against it (or at least it hasn't been up to this point).Then that's an issue where there was a lack of equality, NOT separate-but-equal. Why would you call it separate-but-equal if that's not what you think it was?You keep shifting back and forth here where it's convenient .... MY position is for gays to HAVE the school (the benefits), but not calling it marriage.So telling me "separate but equal" when I'm looking at multiple states that forbid the "equal" portion of that sounds pretty darn shallow.Oh please. In your dreams. Last time I checked, gay marriage happens to be one of the biggest debates going on in society right now--I don't know anywhere that the earth's shape is being debated. And it's not like you've been able to show how giving gays couples' benefits would be discriminatory! But you're ignoring the 800 lb gorilla--group C--that opposes gays in a hateful and non-respectful fashion. THAT'S the group that's the real problem, not the respectful one. That's why it wouldn't matter if group B suddenly disappeared. Get it? Group C would still continue being the prevention to the equality you want because they would still be there.No you haven't! You've only shown that discrimination itself can be harmful; you haven't proven anything in terms of whether those who respectfully disagree with you are perpetuating or causing it. Those are TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.Furthermore, you're ignoring an important aspect here--that those who respectfully disagree often are also in favor you NOT being discriminated against, but just meeting that goal in other ways than redefining marriage. So your whole idea that respectful disagreement is prepetuating discrimination is unfounded to begin with. Er, becase it's not true. emoticonXAngel You're leaving out a major part of the equation (group C).The same definition you used.

I find it hilarious how the anti-gay marriage crowd constantly says that it "does not compute", and yet they show no reason that it does not apply. I wonder why you keep pursuing that claim. My personal thoughts are that anything that would support gays automatically does not compute in your minds.Once again, you are making a really messed up extension of the analogy. Look at it like this: gay unions = black schools, marriage= white schools. We are not saying black students (gays) should be called white (hetero), merely that both be called schools (one institution). It is really quite simple but you seem unable or unwilling to grasp it (I'd bet it is the latter).

To the contrary, I have explained why several times in the Pope thread. I explained why in my previous post in this thread.

It is because they were impossible to equalize. They were impossible to equalize because they were two separate entities run by inherently unequal staffs. I do not deny that separate facilities will not work. What I do deny is that it is necessary to change names to allow equal access to a single system such as a set of laws to govern all unions, gay and straight.You appeared to be arguing for and against separate-but-equal, saying gays have been FORBIDDEN in some states to have their own schools. In one case you argue that separate schools cannot be equal while in another you argue that you were DENIED the right to start your own schools. Which is it that you prefer?This is exactly what you are doing now...insisting on an option that does not exist.There still doesn't have to be any separation. One set of laws can cover all unions.

After integration, there were no black students and no white students, they were all students. When it comes to equal marriage, there are no gay unions nor any straight marriages, there are marriages. We may also remember there was a time when student was a term used to refer to whites only. It's two sets of laws for two separate institutions, one is a union the other is a marriage. They will either be all unions or all marriages for there to not be separation.

It's "silly" because you fail to comprehend.Say we had Candidate X who was ahead in the polls 60% to 40% against candidate Y.Candidate X loses some points in the polls and slips from 55% to 45%.Now, Candidate X is still in the lead, but as I stated, he has LOST SOME POINTS. And if that trend continues, he won't have that lead for long.With that said, in gay marriage you still have a majority against gay marriage. But it's a smaller majority, and the majority is shrinking.Jyoshu, if you opened your eyes and actually READ what I was saying I have been saying this all along.If gays were GIVEN civil unions with full equality in benefits and rights, I wouldn't have a problem with it.I would accept it with no further fuss. End of Story.I have said that on MULTIPLE occasions.Maybe YOU should start out by actually finding some "history" where I supposedly said I wouldn't be open to it.

PROVE that I have a "history" that isn't open to alternatives...The only reason I reject this as an alternative is because the anti-gay marriage side has done their damndest to ensure that it is NOT an alternative, including passing legislation and amendments which explicitly forbid it from being an alternative.

Indeed they are not the same as a "scientific" poll (in the sense they are conduct much differently), but in fact the ballot initiative carries MORE weight in that it helps determine legislation. And people can vote in a way that opposes ballot initiatives that ban gay marriage, so it's in fact NOT only for those motivated to vote on a specific issue.

My "substitutions"???Jim?I WROTE the analogy. It's MY analogy.You TOOK MY analogy and altered it.Now, if you have done something previous in the thread, I can't help that. Quite frankly, I haven't read all your posts.If you can point me to the posts I would need to discuss your version of the analogy, that would be helpful.That's just it.This part has an analogous portion but not in the way you hope for...Historically, the black schools were KEPT INFERIOR. Likewise, the gay civil unions are KEPT INFERIOR. So much so that in some states, blacks are FORBIDDEN FROM GOING TO SCHOOL.Ergo, how "equal" is that?And here is where your "analogy" falls to pieces.How does the "single school" work out with regards to what ACTUALLY HAPPENED with blacks and whites, which were integrated???And WHY did it work out that way?You want to focus on how no redefinition is used, but the rest of your analogy falls apart in the wash. It makes no sense.1) You DID ignore what I said, as you didn't actually comment on what I said.I still have seen no comment on the fact that gay civil unions are EXPRESSLY ILLEGAL in some states.2) I wrote the analogy on the 2nd of February.You responded after the 2nd of February, rewriting it.Actually, this is a false statement with regards solely to the phrase "impossible to equalize".They COULD HAVE BEEN equalized.There was nothing "impossible" about the capability to equalize, unless you're talking about "equality" to the millionth decimal place, whereby if the janitor in the black school was lazier and only cleaned once a week, that would constitute "inequality".It would overlook the main purpose of the whole discussion in favor of squabbling over minutia.The point is that black schools were KEPT inferior all the way around. KEPT inferior.Just like gay civil unions are being kept inferior today, except with the gays there is the whole legislative issue with laws against civil unions...And on another note, utilizing your usage of the words, how "impossible" is it to equalize straight marriage and gay civil unions when some states EXPLICITLY FORBID gay civil unions from being created or recognized in their state?If EQUAL gay civil unions ACTUALLY EXISTED, it wouldn't be "necessary".That is part of my point that I don't think you appreciate.Again you try to pretend a contradiction by bumbling what I am actually saying...1) WHERE did I argue that "separate schools cannot be equal"?My point is that they WERE not equal, and they were KEPT INFERIOR.I don't recall saying "cannot" as in denying a possibility that they could have been "equal".2) By analogy, the law has MANDATED them to be kept inferior by the "black schools" being forbidden from existing. I am talking in analogy here, referring to the analogy of how gay civil unions are legislative forbidden in some states. That is a fact, irrelevant of opinion.And gay civil unions do exist in states where they are expressly forbidden from legislation?Right now, in a lot of states the "set of laws" that governs gay civil unions expressly forbids them from existing.

To the contrary, I have explained why several times in the Pope thread. I explained why in my previous post in this thread. Your substitutions in the comparison of the school systems to the civil union/marriage question are not valid. The two are analogous if the following substitutions are used:single school = laws governing all civil unions (marriages and gay unions)black students = gay unionswhite students = marriagesJust as there is no need to call black students white students in order for them to be treated equally under the single school roof, there is no need to call gay unions marriages to treat them equally under the single set of laws required to do so.I didn't ignore what you said and I didn't blindly rewrite anything....and that's a good thing.This is true. It is because they were impossible to equalize. They were impossible to equalize because they were two separate entities run by inherently unequal staffs. I do not deny that separate facilities will not work. What I do deny is that it is necessary to change names to allow equal access to a single system such as a set of laws to govern all unions, gay and straight.You appeared to be arguing for and against separate-but-equal, saying gays have been FORBIDDEN in some states to have their own schools. In one case you argue that separate schools cannot be equal while in another you argue that you were DENIED the right to start your own schools. Which is it that you prefer?This is exactly what you are doing now...insisting on an option that does not exist.There still doesn't have to be any separation. One set of laws can cover all unions. The government can recognize marriages and gay unions and have them all comply with a single set of laws to enjoy the benefits....

My "substitutions"???Jim?I WROTE the analogy. It's MY analogy.You TOOK MY analogy and altered it.Now, if you have done something previous in the thread, I can't help that. Quite frankly, I haven't read all your posts.If you can point me to the posts I would need to discuss your version of the analogy, that would be helpful.That's just it.This part has an analogous portion but not in the way you hope for...Historically, the black schools were KEPT INFERIOR. Likewise, the gay civil unions are KEPT INFERIOR. So much so that in some states, blacks are FORBIDDEN FROM GOING TO SCHOOL.Ergo, how "equal" is that?And here is where your "analogy" falls to pieces.How does the "single school" work out with regards to what ACTUALLY HAPPENED with blacks and whites, which were integrated???And WHY did it work out that way?You want to focus on how no redefinition is used, but the rest of your analogy falls apart in the wash. It makes no sense.1) You DID ignore what I said, as you didn't actually comment on what I said.I still have seen no comment on the fact that gay civil unions are EXPRESSLY ILLEGAL in some states.2) I wrote the analogy on the 2nd of February.You responded after the 2nd of February, rewriting it.Actually, this is a false statement with regards solely to the phrase "impossible to equalize".They COULD HAVE BEEN equalized.There was nothing "impossible" about the capability to equalize, unless you're talking about "equality" to the millionth decimal place, whereby if the janitor in the black school was lazier and only cleaned once a week, that would constitute "inequality".It would overlook the main purpose of the whole discussion in favor of squabbling over minutia.The point is that black schools were KEPT inferior all the way around.

Sorry, but I have to make 2 observations.Jitobear, it's grammar (not grammer). Sorry, just being picky. Other than that, I think your pretty much spot on.Secondly, this idea that anal sex causes aids is just silly. As Coyote pointed out, you have to have aids to transmit it.I realise that this has not been specifically mentioned in this thread, but . . .If 'aids' is some sort of punishment for gay people, how come it is pretty much negligable (at least relatively speaking) amongst the lesbian community. The incidence amongst the heterosexual population is far greater.Sorry, no links for evidence, but I'm pretty sure it's true.Sorry again.SmileyPS sorry.

Thank you for providing me the material. Now read it and comprehend it.I might point out that all those infectious diseases are shared among heterosexuals. There are probably worse risks for men to have anal sex with women because of the possibility of vaginal infections.And "associated with" means there is no proven causality. There may be other factors that are as yet undetermined. A look at scientific history shows that every time we think we have it all figured out, something comes up that we overlooked before that changes everything.Than I'd advise you to follow your Bible and don't do it. Keep your nose out of my bedroom and my rectum, please.Thank you.

WOW! I just popped back in here and saw some of Blackwodin's quoted posts. What a mess!! And people here gave me a hard time just because I respectfully disagreed. Like I said before, there are worse people out there then those who respectfuly disagree. Blackwodin proves that very well.Blackwodin, why are you insulting people?! I know you don't agree, I also don't agree with gay marriage. But is being nasty and mean to people really necessary?! What is your problem?! People here can say that ones who are stressed out because of their hatred can cause health problems. It is a known fact that when you are stressed you are more prone to heartattacks. So if others are going to get sick, so will you. Because you have too much hostility inside of you. Just chill out!

Matthew, anyone should have the right to any opinion they want about anything. Opinions are the realm of thoughts and ideas, Matthew. Are you now trying to remove someone's right to think? Because that's just simply impossible. Let's get this squared away right now .... I am in a heterosexual marriage. You are welcome and completely within your rights to think anything you want about that. You are within your rights to have whatever opinion about my marriage you want, just as anyone is free to have any opinion. I'm curious, how exactly do you propose removing the right of having an opinion? Mind control experiments? Tell them that 'you better not have that thought, or you'll be punished!' How can you enforce thought?This has never been about right-to-an-opinion. It's about the law and how our system works. We punish criminals when they commit a crime. That's the only reasonable way to do it; The unreasonable way to do it is to blame people who haven't done any crime for the crimes of others.

That's not just expressing an opinion. It's being disrespectful. There's a difference. No one is disagreeing with you that people should be respectful in the way they express opinion. The issue though, is that they still should be able to express opinion.That example doesn't belong with the others, because it's not just expressing opinion, but trying to enact change. But regardless, I could care less if you started a petition drive to target me and my marriage. Go for it; and see how far you get. emoticonXGood

I think it depends on their motivations. People aren't necessarily out to deny benefits, but simply to abide by their religious beliefs and avoid abandoning them. And when I say respectful, I mean in the sense that they voice their opinions in a respectful way. And I'd be careful if I were you with the tactic of trying to make the very opinion itself out to be disrespectful by even giving an opinion because, with that logic, your opponents can also make the argument that the gay marriage stance is disrespectful toward religion! So you see, that tactic can go both ways. The best thing to do is to abide by the good 'ole respectful standard that everyone is entitled to their opinion and let the debate carry on. If your position is truly sound and correct, you shouldn't need to worry about the debate and have to resort to tricks like that.

You are fully free to work toward seeing your views be enacted. Just as they are free to work toward their views being enacted. That's the beauty of the system we live in. And that's what scares me about your position: that it seems to want to subvert democracy.I told you, you can make whatever stance you want. You are completely free to make a stance against anyone's marriage. I wouldn't vote to take away your rights, but at the same time, the right for a society to decide what is important is crucial; otherwise we run the risk of monarchy or oligarchy. You task is to convince society of your views, not to remove society's ability to set up whatever laws it deems important.

Actually, I'd say that the MAJORITY of people against gay civil rights ARE out "to deny benefits", and it has little to do with ACTUAL "religious beliefs".The bible can be interpreted as telling CHRISTIANS to not engage in sodomy, but nowhere does it say that they should prevent others from engaging in sodomy.The bible doesn't tell people to fight against gay employment discrimination legislation.The bible doesn't tell people that gays shouldn't be able to adopt.And it never explains why the "gay" issue should get so much more religious "focus" than other issues of sin. The most popular position I have heard establishes that NO sin is more important than another. In other words, adultery and unwarranted divorce are just as sinful as the whole "gay" thing.Yet IN THEIR OWN CHURCHES, we don't see such a struggle to "abide by their religious beliefs" on issues like divorce or adultery.Even in the "gay marriage" issue, the bible establishes a standard for Christians. Nowhere does it say that Christians need to enforce these beliefs upon others. It doesn't say that Christians need to prevent others from having gay sex. It doesn't say that Christians need to prevent gay marriage.Quite frankly, the Bible is a book of standards for Christians. And when Christians insist on establishing those beliefs upon others for the sake of their religion, they are stepping beyond the bounds of their religion...Oh yeah.Cause if Jane hurt John when Jane punched John, then obviously Jane can argue that John hurt Jane when Jane punched John.Makes PERFECT sense!!! emoticonXBanghead The only "disrespect" would be if we told them that they COULD NOT practice their religious beliefs in THEIR lives.Because they ARE telling us that we cannot get married.But what is ACTUALLY happening is that they are telling us that our lives should be limited by the law.We aren't telling them that THEIR lives should be limited by the law.See the difference?And to reiterate the fact, telling another group that they should have inferior rights because they are immoral is INHERENTLY disrespectful.If we told the Jews that they should have fewer rights, wouldn't that be inherently disrespectful?If we told the blacks that they should have fewer rights, wouldn't that be inherently disrespectful?I know if somebody were telling CHRISTIANS that they should have fewer rights than other religions, I would see that as disrespectful.

You miss the point. The point is that they THINK they are doing what God wants, regardless of what other interpretations there are out there. THEY believe they are following their religion, so for all intents and purposes, they are. The issue isn't whether Christianity, in actuality, calls on them to do so. The issue is that THEIR religion (which in fact isn't Christian so much at all) is apparently to carry out social activism the way they do.Foundit, I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about giving one's opinion in a respecful way. One can state their views in a way that is civil. Whether or not the opinion given itself is respectful is not the issue I'm talking about. What you're talking about is whether or not the opinion is offensive. That has to be evaluated on the merits of the opinion ITSELF, not the way it was presented. Surely you understand the difference.

If Mark killed Janey, and his claimed motive in his heart was "saving" his wife, should a jury not deliberate on the rationality of Mark's motive regarding his actions?How about if Mark collected a sizable life insurance settlement out of Janey's death. Should we not consider that as well?I'm not "missing the point".I am making a point that should be addressed. The RATIONALITY of their claim. The REAL MOTIVE behind their actions.Unless all we're going to do is debate the "motives"...Actually, you WERE talking about "that".Your first sentence established discussion on "giving one's opinion in a respectful way".Your SECOND sentence was the one which didn't, and made commentary regarding the other person's statements.THAT is where you were talking about "that". When you commented on ShadowPikachu's statement, you WERE talking about "that".Didn't you ask as to whether or not the converse claim could be made based off of the original?I pointed out why your statement was false.And now you say you are "not talking about that".Jyoshu, I'm not talking about that.I am saying that the "civil" nature in which they STATE their views can be significantly different from the NATURE of the ACTUAL MESSAGE itself.I can calmly and politely call Jeff a lazy, insolent, slacker who isn't worth the water in his body.The KKK can calmly and politely denigrate blacks with degrading words.The MESSAGE being uncivil completely overrules the tone that I deliver the message with, does it not?I understand the difference.The question is why should we just concentrate on the one without acknowledging the other.People talk about a "silver tongued devil". Does the fact that he speaks with a "silver tongue" detract from the fact that the actual words make him the devil?

You miss the point. The point is that they THINK they are doing what God wants, regardless of what other interpretations there are out there. THEY believe they are following their religion, so for all intents and purposes, they are. The issue isn't whether Christianity, in actuality, calls on them to do so. The issue is that THEIR religion (which in fact isn't Christian so much at all) is apparently to carry out social activism the way they do.Foundit, I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about giving one's opinion in a respecful way. One can state their views in a way that is civil. Whether or not the opinion given itself is respectful is not the issue I'm talking about. What you're talking about is whether or not the opinion is offensive. That has to be evaluated on the merits of the opinion ITSELF, not the way it was presented. Surely you understand the difference.

You miss the point also. Is it just for them to impose upon me their religious views and beliefs? I ask you again; Is their religious freedom more important then mine? The way you are answering is that you believe that it is.

A good analogy to apply to gay-haters/gay marrige opponents, would be to create a hypothetical situation that everything was reversed. What if there was another religion that was the majority, and what if they said "well, its against my religion for you to worship your Christian God, so we're going to make a law against it" or "well, its against our religion for you to be black, so we're going to restrict your civil rights because you're black (you can also use any other race here)". How would you feel? Deep down, you know its wrong, but you can't do anything about it because that religion is the majority, and they are all calling you a "sinner" for something you can't help. How would you feel?

By making voting on someone elses marriage off limits. It is the expression of that opinion that I am objecting too. So if I came to your house to protest your marriage, your childs wedding to protest their marriage, or started a petition drive to target you and your marriage, would you still feel the same way?

i am not aginst gays getting married. but geting married under a religion that says that 2 same sex partners is a sin, is abusing some ones religion. so why cant everyone just get married with out religion involved so that no one can get offended. and another thing to think about.... its not always good to be completely con, or completely pro about everything. some times there can be diffrent situations that make the basic act "right or wrong." example: lieing to a judge about killing some one, even though u did kill them/ or lieing to a person on line about your real name so they cant find and hurt you. you see lieing to the judge is wrong because u did kill some one for no reson, but lieing to the "online preditor" to protect your self from potential harm, is right.so please before u make a disition think about "why?"

I for one am all for gay marriage. I am not gay but my uncle is and I do not see anything wrong with that. People who are gay are not broken. They still put they're pants on one leg at a time. I for one think that the conservatives have the wrong idea about gay marriage

The debate about same-sex marriage invokes extremely passionate responses from both sides; those supporting the idea say that homosexuals should be given all the same rights and privileges given to heterosexual couples thus, being a civil rights issue . At the same time many opposed to same-sex marriage argue that marriage is in fact a religious institution that is recognized by the state. By redefining marriage, you would in fact not only be changing something that millions consider sacred, but it would be tantamount to the state establishing a religion, by defining the validly or a religious ceremony. Both arguments have merit, and I propose a third alternative that I believe shows proper respect to the religious institutions as well as providing true equal rights to all as guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. While people on both sides of the same-sex marriage issue have valid points, a new system that defines a legal status of domestic partnership while leaving the term, “Marriage” in the hands of the Church is a realistic solution. My proposal is simple, the state would disband the practice of endorsing or recognizing marriage at all, and the state would offer a simple domestic partnership document that can be completed by ANY group of consenting adults allowing for legal spousal documentation. The Church would have total domain over the concept of marriage and if a couple (or more in a polygamist relationship) wanted to have a religious ceremony the church can do whatever it feels is right in accordance with its spiritual laws. I believe that while this idea is somewhat radical, it is the only possible solution that takes into consideration the valid concerns of both sides of the issue.

Religious institutions are now able to define marriage as they wish. For example, they need not recognize divorce or inter-faith couples, or even couples deemed to be incompatible by the religious official for any reason. The same is true of there not being a requirement to marry same-sex couples. Polygamy is a different topic, because it is not just unrecognized legally, polygamy is illegal.Couples who married at city hall, before a JP, because they are non-religious, and it was important to them to not have a religious ceremony, will no longer be able to use the term. Why is there a desire to get rid of state-recognized marriage now, at the possible prospect of the state recognizing a same-sex couple in marriage?

You have to remember that those christians believe that the laws of God superceed those of man. That thier allegiance is to God and his laws above those of the constitution. They also believe that all should be subject to Gods by force if nesesary.

No, actually they used the Bible as a basis for their morality. They then applied that morality to the design of a system of government that they wanted to create. Maybe the majority of Americans are comfortable with the status quo WRT their morals. Who are you to tell them that they have to change for you?

There are those here who seem positively enraptured by slinging the B-word about. They hurl it with great abandon like a gibbon casting his own effluence at passers-by. Unfortunately the marksmanship of these folks has been about as effective as the proverbial effluence flinging monkey: no targets have been hit, and none of the missiles appear to be sticking to anything. Moreover, like the monkey missiles, the word itself says less about the target and more about the hurler. Granted, watching monkeys hurl their own processed food about can be entertaining, particularly for those of similar reasoning powers as the hurler, but it does get tiresome to those capable of higher endeavors. Most participants seem to engage in their hurling to impress their fellow hurlers with no real regard to the negative effects of the action. After all, a monkey is not liable to change your viewpoint about primates based on the volume of excrement he hurls your way, but he may impress his fellow monkeys with the distance he can throw. Some of you are displaying a dazzling talent for distance excrement throwing but in the end, you are still dabbling in a rather unpleasant medium.Respectfully submitted to the primates on both sides of the cage.

My answer is to kill the enemy who has not only vowed to destroy the USA but has actually attacked us many times over the past 30 Years. Why ? Because we are at War. Our Governments main purpose for being formed wasn't to create social programs and welfare but to defend the populace from foreign invaders and aggressors who wish to destroy us militarily. Why must liberals lie with false examples like this that have no basis in fact at all when the Right supports adoption ? And Matt, if you don't want me refering to as the sodomite, then stop refering to me as the Christian like it's a swear.Had we not developed the Oil Fields of the Middle East with our Technology then Europe and the Soviet Union would have anyway, and that would have changed the balance of economic power that allowed us to become the Superpower we have become. It's economics 101 really. As to pursuing Energy Independance 70 years ago, blame your liberal environmentalists. After the Oil Embargo of the 70s, which I experienced personally, the Government assured us it would seek independance. But everytime the issue was debated, the environmental lobby fought new Oil Exploration on US Territory like it would cause the end of the World. So don't blame the Right or Bush for that.Another lie and rewrite of history. If Oil is the goal why haven't we been taking a percentage of free oil in exchange for defending them ? Even though Iraqi Oil is being sold on the International Market, the US is paying for it just like everyone else.Do you even know what Imperialism means ? Have we forced Iraq to become a State or Satelite of the USA ? Do we force them to pay tribute or taxes to us ? Are we even charging them for our defending them against the Terrorists who are trying to prevent a Free Democratic Iraq from being permanently established ? And why is debating with you a constant defense against lies and attacks while you NEVER EVER ACTUALLY ANSWER ONE QUESTION ASKED OF YOU ?So I repeat my question asked above, why condemn the Coalition forces when the Terrorists are the ones killing the innocents each and every day in Iraq. And to say we make them do what they do wont hold water either because they have clearly said they wont stop untill they destroy this free democracy and return the innocent Iraqi's into bondage to fundamentalist Islamic and Sharia Law controled by religious Mullahs. If you love the innocents as you claim, why would you sacrifice 24 MILLION PEOPLE to such an existance of hopeless desperation ? Is that your definition of Love ? And let me ask you this ? Under what circumstances would you see fit to actually go to War with a Country ? If it isn't to fight to free millions of people from oppression, or to unseat a dictator who supports terrorism and attacks on you, then what would it take for you to actually defend and protect not only yourself but the World you live in from blatant and unchecked EVIL ?

If it isn't to fight to free millions of people from oppression, or to unseat a dictator who supports terrorism and attacks on you, then what would it take for you to actually defend and protect not only yourself but the World you live in from blatant and unchecked EVIL ?

I am reminding you Christian that you claim to be christian or are you just pretending? Follow the teachings of Jesus. Could you point to anywhere in the teachings of Jesus where He says invade another country to remove a dictator and kill the population children with bombs. You as a christian should be opposing this war.

My answer is to kill the enemy who has not only vowed to destroy the USA but has actually attacked us many times over the past 30 Years. Why ? Because we are at War. Our Governments main purpose for being formed wasn't to create social programs and welfare but to defend the populace from foreign invaders and aggressors who wish to destroy us militarily. Why must liberals lie with false examples like this that have no basis in fact at all when the Right supports adoption ? And Matt, if you don't want me refering to as the sodomite, then stop refering to me as the Christian like it's a swear.Had we not developed the Oil Fields of the Middle East with our Technology then Europe and the Soviet Union would have anyway, and that would have changed the balance of economic power that allowed us to become the Superpower we have become. It's economics 101 really. As to pursuing Energy Independance 70 years ago, blame your liberal environmentalists. After the Oil Embargo of the 70s, which I experienced personally, the Government assured us it would seek independance. But everytime the issue was debated, the environmental lobby fought new Oil Exploration on US Territory like it would cause the end of the World. So don't blame the Right or Bush for that.Another lie and rewrite of history. If Oil is the goal why haven't we been taking a percentage of free oil in exchange for defending them ? Even though Iraqi Oil is being sold on the International Market, the US is paying for it just like everyone else.Do you even know what Imperialism means ? Have we forced Iraq to become a State or Satelite of the USA ? Do we force them to pay tribute or taxes to us ? Are we even charging them for our defending them against the Terrorists who are trying to prevent a Free Democratic Iraq from being permanently established ? And why is debating with you a constant defense against lies and attacks while you NEVER EVER ACTUALLY ANSWER ONE QUESTION ASKED OF YOU ?So I repeat my question asked above, why condemn the Coalition forces when the Terrorists are the ones killing the innocents each and every day in Iraq. And to say we make them do what they do wont hold water either because they have clearly said they wont stop untill they destroy this free democracy and return the innocent Iraqi's into bondage to fundamentalist Islamic and Sharia Law controled by religious Mullahs. If you love the innocents as you claim, why would you sacrifice 24 MILLION PEOPLE to such an existance of hopeless desperation ? Is that your definition of Love ? And let me ask you this ? Under what circumstances would you see fit to actually go to War with a Country ? If it isn't to fight to free millions of people from oppression, or to unseat a dictator who supports terrorism and attacks on you, then what would it take for you to actually defend and protect not only yourself but the World you live in from blatant and unchecked EVIL ?

When did it become the responsibilty to free "millions of people" from ruthless dictators? Never. Again, it is not our business. Trying to force the Iraqi people to live within the framework of government that works for us is imperialism, because what we want out of it is to control their oil. It is greed. It is what the Bush administration is all about. Greed.

No, actually they used the Bible as a basis for their morality. They then applied that morality to the design of a system of government that they wanted to create. Maybe the majority of Americans are comfortable with the status quo WRT their morals. Who are you to tell them that they have to change for you?

My my, count the labels in this post: self righteous, neocon, fascists, stupid. And that's just in the first sentence. What an effective way to begin an argument. Let's hear it for the compassion of the left. Perhaps a review of the facts would be instructive at this point: "Now, I believe the facts that have brought us to this fateful vote are not in doubt. Saddam Hussein is a tyrant who has tortured and killed his own people, even his own family members, to maintain his iron grip on power. He used chemical weapons on Iraqi Kurds and on Iranians, killing over 20 thousand people. Unfortunately, during the 1980's, while he engaged in such horrific activity, he enjoyed the support of the American government, because he had oil and was seen as a counterweight to the Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran. In 1991, Saddam Hussein invaded and occupied Kuwait, losing the support of the United States. The first President Bush assembled a global coalition, including many Arab states, and threw Saddam out after forty-three days of bombing and a hundred hours of ground operations. The U.S.-led coalition then withdrew, leaving the Kurds and the Shiites, who had risen against Saddam Hussein at our urging, to Saddam's revenge. As a condition for ending the conflict, the United Nations imposed a number of requirements on Iraq, among them disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction, stocks used to make such weapons, and laboratories necessary to do the work. Saddam Hussein agreed, and an inspection system was set up to ensure compliance. And though he repeatedly lied, delayed, and obstructed the inspections work, the inspectors found and destroyed far more weapons of mass destruction capability than were destroyed in the Gulf War, including thousands of chemical weapons, large volumes of chemical and biological stocks, a number of missiles and warheads, a major lab equipped to produce anthrax and other bio-weapons, as well as substantial nuclear facilities. In 1998, Saddam Hussein pressured the United Nations to lift the sanctions by threatening to stop all cooperation with the inspectors. In an attempt to resolve the situation, the UN, unwisely in my view, agreed to put limits on inspections of designated "sovereign sites" including the so-called presidential palaces, which in reality were huge compounds well suited to hold weapons labs, stocks, and records which Saddam Hussein was required by UN resolution to turn over. When Saddam blocked the inspection process, the inspectors left. As a result, President Clinton, with the British and others, ordered an intensive four-day air assault, Operation Desert Fox, on known and suspected weapons of mass destruction sites and other military targets. In 1998, the United States also changed its underlying policy toward Iraq from containment to regime change and began to examine options to effect such a change, including support for Iraqi opposition leaders within the country and abroad. In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including Al Qaeda members, though there is apparently no evidence of his involvement in the terrible events of September 11, 2001. It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons. Should he succeed in that endeavor, he could alter the political and security landscape of the Middle East, which as we know all too well affects American security."The above speech was made by the self-righteous neocon fascist Junior Senator from New York Hillary Clinton.Now this presents a problem for ye. If Bush is indeed stupid he was at least clever enough to convince a democratic presidential front runner of the danger. That susceptibility to persuasion would say something about that junior senator's faculties would it not? It also gives one pause to consider that the left blames Bush for the high price of gasoline on the one hand while dismissing the war as one about oil. The left also opposes any and all attempts to explore domestic energy by opposing nuclear power, development of ANWR and off-shore drilling. Thanks to democratic opposition not one new refinery faciity has been constructed during my lifetime. Not one. Now, Speaker Pelosi would slap the oil companies with an "excessive profits tax". Way to encourage domestic energy Frau Nancy!Oh, and do try to be a little bit more civil. Your propensity to call your opponents "losers" says far more about your insecurities than it does about your opponents. Let's try to keep things above the 100 IQ mark shall we?

What I hate about self-righteous neocon christian fascists is their absolutely stupid view of the world. If the west had left the middle east only following WWI we would not be in the position we are today. If the west had pursued energy independence 70 years ago, we'd not be where we are today.Bush's immoral and illegal war is all about OIL. Once the Iraqi government passes the law that makes the OIL assessible to the international oil companies that Bush and his crime family are part of, then the war will be won in their minds.Why rightwing fascists like Archie can't see beyond the length of their nose is part of the problem in America today. Iraq was not a threat to America before 2003. But because of Bush's arrogance and stupidity, there are today thousands more who wish death to America. Imperalism is not a system that can win. Sorry, loser.

You still have yet to answer the question of where Christ taught that you should invade another counry, remove the leader of said country, execute said dictator, and then remain there and let your troops be target practice for those who never wanted you there in the first place, while at the same time allowing the deaths of the civilians of the country. All of this, I might add, while operating under false pretenses (an absolute lie, as a matter of fact - the whole WMD garbage).

Yes bandgeek, I am unashamedly saying that the lifestyle of "homosexuality" is that the morals and values they practice are unnatural and blatantly sinful. But don't forget that I say the same thing about straights who fornicate or otherwise sin against God. How can you deny the correctness of that position ? It has been upheld for the entire history of the human race until the onset of this so called enlightened generation which is in fact depraved to its very core. But again, I'm speaking of morals and values, something that is foreign to this reprobate generation of feel good pseudo intellectuals.

So your answer christian is to kill more people? Where is love thy neighbor and 7x70.

Why christain are some of the loudest anti abortionists also the first to cut social programs that would help a woman be able to keepp her baby. Answer me this christian why are some of the most anti same sex marriage opponents not anti divorce and have two or more marriages. Why christian why?

Why would a secular government like ours possibly have to justify defending ourselves from a foreign enemy based on Jesus ministry which dealt with how we are to deal with each other as individuals in this life. And are you arguing that the US is a Nation Founded on Christianity ? Because I surely am NOT. So why must we justify defending ourselves scripturally ? But be sure that it is Governments responsibility to protect its citizens by going to war according to the bible. And utterly destroying the enemy would be the scriptural way of dealing with an agressor who seeks to destroy us.Besides, what's your opinion about Germany ? We invaded them, carpet bombed their cities killing literally millions of civillians before we stopped. More than 3000 allied troops were killed in any 24 hour period during that War. Should we have pulled out and surrendered to Hitler ? And speaking of Hitler, at least he had the good taste of killing himself. But why do you say we executed Saddam ? Is your memory so short ? His own Countryman tried, convicted and executed him. Do you think he was unfairly or wrongly convicted SP ? Are the mass graves insufficient proof of the monster he was ? And SP, we're still in Germany. 35,000 strong on an American built and supported Base, and in Japan also. 50 plus years after the end of the War and we are still there. Why aren't you concerned about those occupations ? And does it matter to you that the 24 million peace loving Iraqi people want us there ? Only the 10,000 or so Radical fundamentalist Terrorists who want to destroy a free Iraq want us out of Iraq. But you think we should submit to the Terrorists and abandon the 24 million good people huh. Dont you. And I'm the cold blooded killer and the heartless murderer huh ? If you had even a semblance of a sense of justice you could never feel as you do SP, but we both know you're not going to start caring about the defensless victims of this War, you're too happy condemning America for the sacrifice we're making for these people. I truly feel sorry for you.

The bible is a perfectly balanced guide for humanity Matt. But you wouldn't know that because rather than seek to understand it from God's perspective, you choose to interpret it according to your limited understanding. I have no qualms what so ever spiritually speaking about the rightness of the US defending the innocent and the weak. We are doing the righteous thing in Iraq and Afghanistan and if we were in 1945 with Terroristic sneak attacks taking place on every Continent on Earth by members of the same religion, the west would again unite and determine to wipe this cancer from the face of the Earth once and for all time.So to answer your question directly, no I don't ignore His Word when it's inconvenient. And if you knew me personally you would know I am a peacemaker in my personal life. But if I were President, I too would have no doubts about destroying Radical Islam before it destroyed my Country. None what so ever. And your ignorant perspective which is shared by the Liberal Elitists is precisely why America is doomed if one of your pacifist Liberal gets into the Whitehouse in 08. Just watch the Terrorist attacks come home to roost in America because the Radicals know the Left will crumble just like the Socialists in Europe did before Bush built the coalition. They will appease the Radicals so fast your head will spin and after that, we will be forced to convert or die. I of course would choose death to submission but you I'm sure will cling to life, even if it must be lived in bondage and oppression to heartless thugs who murder infidels for pleasure. Maybe then you'll understand what I was saying way back when I said we should fight them over there rather than let them bring their War here.

I do not understand where you get the Idea that, just because I am against invading a country that had nothing to do with 911, I am pro terrorist? I see the war this way. Saddam Hussein was a threat to the Saudis and he had to be taken out. Bush being who he, in league and busisness, with the Saudis decided to find a way to end this threat to the kingdom. Wolfowitz had the Iraqi invasion plans before 911 and just needed an excuse to implement them. I do not buy your argument that we needed to take out a dictator to free the people if that is our mission then why are we not invading Saudia Arabia? The Saudi royal family make Saddam Hussein look like Ben Franklin. The Saudi royal family oppress their people. So why not take them out too? Then their are the numerous little wars in africa where millions of people are being slaughtered by repressive regimes. Why are we not doing anything about them? Then there are the terrorists. Why are we not invading palistine, lebenon, syria, jordan, iran, egypt, pakistan, somlia, sudan, inodnisia,and other countries that harbor and support terrorists?Then you understand my perspective as a gay man. I will choose death when the fundies and the cithgaps come to put my people in camps to either cure or kill us. I will fight for the freedoms that should have been my birthright against any group that seeks to oppress me and my people. I will not live in bondage to christian fundamentalists.

Well said, Mathew. This war only grows worse. Over 600 Iraquis killed last week, and 80 US soldiers died in March.

When I became a man I gave up childish things.If Bush and his neocons hadn't unleashed the evil that is in Iraq today, those 80 US soldiers who died last month would be still living today, for they wouldn't be sitting in harm's way. I don't care what your truth is; I know what is my truth and that's the only one that matters to me, Archie.

And yet like a child you want to pick up all your marbles and go home as soon as the going gets tough. That's a real adult attitude when dealing with an enemy who has vowed to NEVER STOP THEIR COWARDLY ATTACKS ON CIVILIANS UNTIL THEY HAVE UTTERLY AND TOTALLY DESTROYED US.I REPEAT, COURTESY OF E MUTZIn 1991, Saddam Hussein invaded and occupied Kuwait, losing the support of the United States. The first President Bush assembled a global coalition, including many Arab states, and threw Saddam out after forty-three days of bombing and a hundred hours of ground operations. The U.S.-led coalition then withdrew, leaving the Kurds and the Shiites, who had risen against Saddam Hussein at our urging, to Saddam's revenge. As a condition for ending the conflict, the United Nations imposed a number of requirements on Iraq, among them disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction, stocks used to make such weapons, and laboratories necessary to do the work. Saddam Hussein agreed, and an inspection system was set up to ensure compliance. And though he repeatedly lied, delayed, and obstructed the inspections work, the inspectors found and destroyed far more weapons of mass destruction capability than were destroyed in the Gulf War, including thousands of chemical weapons, large volumes of chemical and biological stocks, a number of missiles and warheads, a major lab equipped to produce anthrax and other bio-weapons, as well as substantial nuclear facilities. In 1998, Saddam Hussein pressured the United Nations to lift the sanctions by threatening to stop all cooperation with the inspectors. In an attempt to resolve the situation, the UN, unwisely in my view, agreed to put limits on inspections of designated "sovereign sites" including the so-called presidential palaces, which in reality were huge compounds well suited to hold weapons labs, stocks, and records which Saddam Hussein was required by UN resolution to turn over. When Saddam blocked the inspection process, the inspectors left. As a result, President Clinton, with the British and others, ordered an intensive four-day air assault, Operation Desert Fox, on known and suspected weapons of mass destruction sites and other military targets. In 1998, the United States also changed its underlying policy toward Iraq from containment to regime change and began to examine options to effect such a change, including support for Iraqi opposition leaders within the country and abroad. In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including Al Qaeda members, though there is apparently no evidence of his involvement in the terrible events of September 11, 2001. It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons. Should he succeed in that endeavor, he could alter the political and security landscape of the Middle East, which as we know all too well affects American security."The above speech was made by the self-righteous neocon fascist Junior Senator from New York Hillary Clinton.My truth used to be universally accepted until the Socialist Left decided to once again rewrite history and use this War for Political gain as a campaign issue. Only you are accepting the rewritten propaganda as your truth. Even Hillary doesn't really believe as you do. She's just saying it to get your vote.You just can't help it can you matt.

I'm sick of it.Every single person in the Iraqi theater freely joined to serve in the military. None were drafted against their will. So I guess they all chose to throw their lives away huh ? Or did they choose to defend their country, something selfish cowards like you just can't identify with or relate to. And when it comes to suicide bombers who seek to kill innocent people through acts of terror, better to kill them before they strap the bomb on and take an innocent group of bystanders with them. Or is it beyond your ability to see that rationale ?

Yes that is exactly what they mean by destroying marriage. If they have to accept gay marriage as equal to heterosexual marriage they feel that something will be taken from them. Their marriages will be lessened and their marriages will no longer have any meaning. So they are content and happy do deny happiness and marriage to gay people while at the same time demanding that we be happy for them when they announce their marriages.I will give you an example. Think of the last hetero that announced to you that they were getting married. What did they expect your responce to be? They expect you to be happy for them and joyously congradulate them. Now what would their reaction be if you, knowing their stance on gay marriage, if you said you couldn't support their marriage because of their stance on gay marriage. They would be offended with anything less then congratulations Trust me I have called many of those who have announced their marriages in the paper. The reaction is allways the same.

this post is about gay marriages and there was another post about gays adopting, and I would like to merge the two here with a comment.An individual should have a right to express his/herself freely where it doesn't affect another person. An individual should have the right to cohabitate with any other person or persons (adults) they so chose, and should be able to unite under the laws of the state without any discrimination.However, when it comes to adoption. There should be limits. Perhaps children of age 12 and above can be adopted by gay couples, but the child must have the ultimate say into the matter.Children brought into this world, are conceived by male and female and to take a infant child and place it in a biologically incorrect family could and may do more harm than good, and then again, the child may thrive and be a well-rounded citizen, but no one can predict at that stage. Each infant child is different and the physcological needs are different. The child's interest must be our main interest, and if we cannot guarantee a positive outcome, (which we cannot) then we must err on the side of natural caution.The key is respect. Respect to the laws of nature, respect to the laws of equality, and respect for one another.In this world, people want anything and everything their minds can conjure up even if its naturally impossible. Humans are so self-centered and greedy, if we could sue nature most of you would. I wouldn't, I have much respect for nature. I know my place in this world, I know my biological limits, psychological limits and my physical limits and when I cross those limits there are risks.Have we become a world of selfishness? What's next? Buy some land in the driest of deserts and demand it bring upon a harvest? Nature is such a bigot.

There is a difference not all couples marry to have children. Many heterosexuals past breeding age marry. Marriage is not always about children. If they want to make marriage about children, I have no problem with that, but those who can not have children or those past breeding age must not be allowed to marry either.

Yes bandgeek, I am unashamedly saying that the lifestyle of "homosexuality" is that the morals and values they practice are unnatural and blatantly sinful. But don't forget that I say the same thing about straights who fornicate or otherwise sin against God. How can you deny the correctness of that position ? It has been upheld for the entire history of the human race until the onset of this so called enlightened generation which is in fact depraved to its very core. But again, I'm speaking of morals and values, something that is foreign to this reprobate generation of feel good pseudo intellectuals.

Please provide an example of where Archangel has said that he hates gay people or that he thinks they are evil. Your statements here are not based on fact, but rather your apparent hatred of christians. Please review his posts. He has declared what he believes to be true about the lifestyle but no where does he claim judgement on the person. It is an objective stance. he is separating the behavior from the person. In fact, as I understand him, he is stating that the behavior is harmful to the person and therefore not good. Now, you may have a very different viewpoint on whether or not it is harmful to the person. If that is the case then provide an argument as to why it is not harmful instead of attacking someone else. Archangel posted no attack on you. He did make some comments about saminh which were intended comment on Saminh's views and not on saminh personally. Archangel's OPINION about the VIEWS is that they are "twisted" meaning that they are not supportive of what is observable in reality. You may have an OPINION that they are not "twisted" and are perfectly logical in view of reality. If so, post an argument supporting that.You have essentially posted a non argument based on your own emotional response rather than looking at what has been objectively posted.Huck.

Please provide an example of where Archangel has said that he hates gay people or that he thinks they are evil. Your statements here are not based on fact, but rather your apparent hatred of christians. Please review his posts. He has declared what he believes to be true about the lifestyle but no where does he claim judgement on the person. It is an objective stance. he is separating the behavior from the person. In fact, as I understand him, he is stating that the behavior is harmful to the person and therefore not good. Now, you may have a very different viewpoint on whether or not it is harmful to the person. If that is the case then provide an argument as to why it is not harmful instead of attacking someone else. Archangel posted no attack on you. He did make some comments about saminh which were intended comment on Saminh's views and not on saminh personally. Archangel's OPINION about the VIEWS is that they are "twisted" meaning that they are not supportive of what is observable in reality. You may have an OPINION that they are not "twisted" and are perfectly logical in view of reality. If so, post an argument supporting that.You have essentially posted a non argument based on your own emotional response rather than looking at what has been objectively posted.Huck.

So you are for free speech only for those that believe like you do?YIPES!

In the US prosthelytizing is indeed the same as free speech as is many forms of speech considered offensive by many. One could easily say that evolutionary speech is offensive to christians.To speak to someone about God, is within the rights of the individual. It is certainly within your rights to ignore it. You can leave the room, ignore the posts on the board, etc. It is protected speech. I am not sure where you got the opposite idea. 'The US constitution says "CONGRESS shall make no law...." It does not say that people cannot talk about God.Huck

I have to agree with Huck on this one. Despite how offensive it may seem to some, these "christians" do have the right to prosthelytize. However, huck, I would change one of your statments to: "One could easily say that evolutionary speech is offensive to certain groups of christians", because the majority of Christians accept evolution (Catholic Church for one). ;)

It's amazing that someone in this generation could grow to adulthood and be so ignorant as to believe that a single man that had such a profound affect on humanity and literally changed the World accomplished all that with a hoax. It's incredible really. From 12 contemporary disciples who didn't even actually walk and follow Him according to you, because as you say, Jesus never even existed, right ? then they convinced the uncounted masses of other contemporaries who all accepted Jesus as their Savior, accepted that He died on the Cross when He never even lived at all, saw Him after He resurrected from the dead and ascended on High 40 days later, but He never existed so within 43 days of his nonexistent crucifixion the 5000 who accepted him on the day of Pentecost (the day He ascended on High) when the Holy Spirit descended on the crowd, all this happened because of a nonexistent guy named Jesus who never even lived and was evidently created by these fishermen who, what, just dreamed Him up ?And you honestly believe this is true ? That Jesus the Christ never even existed as an historical figure ? May He have mercy on your soul when you finally meet Him. Cuz I've got news for you kid, He's alive and well and coming back very soon. Call me delusional if you like. But don't ever say you never knew the truth, or were never told to expect Him. You've been told so the rest is up to you.

You do know that you are stating that you DO have the truth don't you?:) It is fine to believe what you want to believe. It is also perfectly fine for Archangel to post here provided he/she does not violate the board rules. As far as I can tell there is no violation. In fact, on a "debate" website opposing controversial opinions are more than welcome.ShadowPikachu: Thank you for your support and your alteration is agreed to. It is only certain groups. I was only posing an exampleSamiinh: I would suggest you ratchet down your disgust and learn to accept all people regardless of their religion. You will find your discussions far more fruitfull. Indeed if you are correct, then by arguing logically and reasonably without the ire you show in this post, then you will more likely firm up your own beliefs rather than lose them. And if you do lose your own beliefs then likely as not the new beliefs you come to will have a far greater chance of being correct.Debate has been a long standing method for testing ones own mettle.Huck

He may not have said those words directly, but you give him far more credit for benevolence than he deserves. He most certainly woefully misunderstands gay people and is a highly insulting poster. He has hurled ugly and false accusation about gays destroying the family, American society, etc. He claims that they are all miserable and feel guilty about their sexuality. He called them reprbate. He accused me of having no moral center and being like an animal for not sharing his faith. Many of these posts were offensive enough to warrant deletion.Personally I am tired of the "its my religion" mantra. Its a cop-out. Say and believe what you will, but know that the opposition against gays and gay families is hurtful and harmful - regardless of the excuse.

We have good discussions thus far so I hope you will trust me a bit and enter into a hypothetical with me. What if my belief was that the behavior was harmful to you? What kind of behavior would you WANT to see from me? It is easy to declare that someone is doing something that is hurtful. And perhaps Archangel was, I do not actually know if the posts were deleted. It is another thing though to say how you would actually like to be treated.

I find Archie dogmatism offensive and in your face. It is insulting and condescending and I'd appreciate it if he'd find another way to communicate with people. I see him do this in many of the forums. It is arrogant, rude, obnoxious and unnecessary, IMHO. Sometimes I find you, Huck, to be a little too bossy, like you think you own this space.__________________Religion is the invention of frightened men.

Thanks for considering my scenario.Ok - but I would like to clarify that I am straight. I am passionate about this issue as my son's father is gay - as are many other marvelous people in my life. The claims Archangel are personal and false.I would except the him to substantiate his claims with real measurable facts. I would like him to ask me about what my experience is, rather than tell me. I would prefer not to have my character judged based on my faith or lack of it. (I have many freinds of many faiths who do manage it.) They certainly stand a better chance than the Wolves.

And yet it's totally acceptable and honest discourse for you to say outright that my personal relationship with the Living God is a delusional fairy tale on par with the Easter Bunny or the Tooth Fairy as you said below. You are reasonable to insult me but I am condescending and arrogant to give it right back to you, on a debate board no less. Especially since you haven't experienced what I have so there is no way you can relate to my personal experience. But I can relate to you because I was spiritually dead and blind to Gods truth once, so I know what being born again means and feels like and let me assure you, it's very real indeed. Well you've got the wrong idea about believers in Christ, or at least this one. So if you can't handle it, find a forum with no opposition to challenge you.Jitobear, read what you said to me and then you'll see that I responded to the claims you made. You like to interpret my words as hatred for gays but that is a total lie and misinterpretation of what I said. I expressed sincere concern for the homosexual and tried to explain that the lifestyle will only lead to death and depravity. And I don't apologize for that belief at all. I also believe that the moral depravity that is inundating the American culture, both straight and gay will lead to our utter destruction and downfall as a Civilization. Does that mean I also hate straights or could it be I am objectively judging the blatant justification of sin that is so Socially acceptable today due to the reprobate values of this last days generation ?You secular humanists cry foul when I speak my mind but I'm supposed to sit idly by as you mock and make condescending insults about how ignorant I am to say things that are so foreign to you. Well I've got a secret for you, You can't relate to my personal and supernatural relationship with the Living God because you don't know Him personally as I do. Rather than mock me, get down on your knees and sincerely as God to reveal Himself to you, and I promise you He will. Now if you do as I suggest and meet Him, you will then understand that of all the people you have ever met in your lifetime, I gave you the most precious gift of any person in your complete lifetime. And asked nothing in return for the gift that was also freely given to me. So hate me if you like, but everything I have said to Matt and about the homosexual lifestyle I have said in sincere love for the eternal soul that lives forever. Not to massage the ego with shallow platitudes here that leads to death in the end.

Then don't - but I know it to be insulting, misinformed and ugly and will make no apologies for believing so either.Frankly I don't know or care what you think about straights either.First of all - don't label me. Second - Stop. Please. I was raised Christian. Tried many churches. Have even read the entire Bible - cover to cover. I know all about the faith you embrace.

while samiinh may find me "bossy" I do think this whole thing is way beyond what is necessary on both sides of the aisle. (or Isle depending on your point of viewemoticonXAngel ).Jito:You may take offense at what is said, but Archangel is using a vernacular that has specific meanings. There is no intent to insult. Archangel, I see your legitimate concern for the living souls as eternal and therefore your intent is to save that which is eternal regardless of that which is temporal. I see that pretty clearly. However, I would sugget that you consider that HOW you say things is as important as WHAT you say. After all, Jesus died so that man would actually have a CHOICE. You desparately desire those (including me) who don't know him to know him. However, remember that words such as "reprobate" etc, contain a great deal of emotional value. I know the specific meanings and origins of such words so I take no offense at them, however, most are not as knowlegable as to delve into word origins regularly ( I am not so much smart as fortunate in my upbringing in this respect, many others here as well do know, but many do not). The woman at the well was a sinner of the tried and true variety. Only have Jesus showed her compassion and interacted with her when no one else would, did he choose to address her sin. He made sure she knew she was accepted first. That tack will take you much further.Samiinh: I suspect you think I am bossy because I do not accept illegitimate argument and will tell you to post a legitimate one. That is simply the nature of a debate. It is a way of calling attention to poor arguments. It is nothing personal. It highlights things. Occasionally, I might interject an emotional word intentionally to get the emotional reaction for the sake of the debate. It is a little manipulative but it is a highly effective tactic when used reasonably sparingly. If used too often then a person loses all credibility. I also apologize when I am wrong. It helps. Sometimes the tactic backfires. Then I would say I am in a mess.Thanks to you all. I do hope you take my comments in the vein intended.

I wouldn't read that liberal rag and neither would I purposely engage the types of people who would be drawn to their forum, on purpose anyway. You followed me here, I didn't follow you.

Did you ever particapate on the NY Times webforum? We used to have a poster named Archangel on that one once. Could you be the same one?I can't know your life experience, nor can you know mine. I do not suggest, though that you must change your life, as you do to me and others. That is offensive and unnecessary, my friend. I did express my empathy to you on the abortion forum, but you apparently didn't read it or you just ignored it.I once was a member of the Christian religion, but I am no longer, because of my life experience. I do not believe in supernatural. That you do is your right. But throwing it in our face on a daily basis is offensive and uncalled for Archie. You need to lighten up. It is not your responsiblity to change other people. emoticonXGood

Faith is an entirely subjective experience. If I don't feel faith toward a particular doctrine or figure, then there is no way that I can be made to feel that faith. The strongest demonstration of this reality was the Protestant Reformation. Luther, Calvin, John Knox, John Wesley, and the others showed by all their activities that they could not be made to share the subjective experience of Catholic faith as described by the Church. When I am asked to respect other people's faith, I actually cannot do that, because I can have no idea of what they are talking about--it is their experience, not mine. The closest I can come to respecting their faith is to respect whatever they say or demonstrate that their faith is, as well as respectng their right to have that subjective experience. Nevertheless, faith, like love or obsession, is a very powerful feeling that sometimes impels people who are having it to attempt to impose it on others by, for example, "witnessing" or "testifying". To witness or testify is to enter into a social interaction. In most cases, both parties to a social interaction, such as a conversation, agree to it. With social interactions based on faith, though, there can be an element of coercion. Someone who constantly witnesses to his or her subjective experience of faith is like a stalker in that he or she is imposing his or her emotions on others. This is why I am so suspicious of Evangelicals--first, they want you to share (supposedly for your benefit) their subjective state of mind (an impossibility), and then they want you to give them money--to enter into the religion part of the faith/religion duo.This pretty much states my position on the subject.

So you're saying that in every one of my posts I insist that you must accept jesus and believe as I do ? Can you post where I have insisted that one "must get saved" more than maybe one time ? And please point out not only which denomination I told you is the only right one, but which denomination I attend if you would please, because if I'm proselytizing then I must also be driving members to my Church right ? And then, please post the times I asked for money and suggested that giving money had anything to do with being saved by Grace ?What is laughable is how hung up on stereotypes you are. You wouldn't have an original thought in your head if you were alone on a desert Island. :) But thanks for your position on the subject, it speaks volumes about how your twisted mind works.

he called my views twisted and he called my statements ignorant. how is that different from my emotional views?
attacks
Please provide an example of where Archangel has said that he hates gay people or that he thinks they are evil. Your statements here are not based on fact, but rather your apparent hatred of christians. Please review his posts. He has declared what he believes to be true about the lifestyle but no where does he claim judgement on the person. It is an objective stance. he is separating the behavior from the person. In fact, as I understand him, he is stating that the behavior is harmful to the person and therefore not good. Now, you may have a very different viewpoint on whether or not it is harmful to the person. If that is the case then provide an argument as to why it is not harmful instead of attacking someone else. Archangel posted no attack on you. He did make some comments about saminh which were intended comment on Saminh's views and not on saminh personally. Archangel's OPINION about the VIEWS is that they are "twisted" meaning that they are not supportive of what is observable in reality. You may have an OPINION that they are not "twisted" and are perfectly logical in view of reality. If so, post an argument supporting that.You have essentially posted a non argument based on your own emotional response rather than looking at what has been objectively posted.Huck.

True, but such laws do not follow us to the grave. What Arch's religious belief system seems to be based on is fear of what may happen, rather then the truth of his religion. That's a terrible foundation for religious beliefs. When he runs into someone who disagress with his religious beliefs, he invariably threatens them with what may happen. People have stated Christanity is a religion of fear for years. It's not much of a guess why.

Radiowaves cannot be "seen" by our eyes. Our eyes detect electromagnetic radiation only within a certain range of wavelength. We can, however, very easily perceive a radio wave by other means; hence, we believe that radio waves exist.

Perhaps. But the use of religion as a control without actual threat of physical force doesn't necessarily work as you can see with many people rejecting Arch's believe-or-burn stance. Furthermore, I recall there are no passages where Jesus uses threats of force to get people to do anything. IMO, Christanity barely resembles what Jesus taught.

I never said you did. What I commented upon previously in a prior post was your reliance upon the threat of Hell as a reason why you are right or at least why others should abandon their positions you disagree with. That proves without a doubt that your basis for belief is not in the truth of Christanity, but in your fear, which by some accounts is greed. My comment to samiinh was on religion as a means of controlling the masses, not on your behavior. It wasn't directed at you. If you could please reply to the post I directed you instead of assuming everything is about you, it would be apperciated. Considering I did nothing of the sort, you're making a false accuation. I expect a apology soon. But then again, you could simply refuse and add to the ever growing pile of evidence you do not actually follow Christanity.

When we as gay people live the gay lifestyle, we give expression to our basic human sexuality. Your analogy to the fornicating straight, is poor, because the person can express his/her straight orientation another way. It would be like telling straight people not to give expression to being straight. I understand you believe in your God, as you've indicated many times, but how precisely and logically is being gay destructive or harmful? Are you just here to try to convert people to your religion? I guess I'm not interested, which is why I haven't responded much on this thread. Oh well, go to it, as is your freedom. Personally I don't find the selling points either thought-provoking or appealing. Yours is essentially a mundane, "Jesus Christ is Lord", type of argument.

And don't forget the fear factor. Fear of dying and going to hell. Why else should you believe? Has nothing to do with being a caring and loving human being. The infamous "gay lifestyle". Let me describe mine. I get up in the morning, have a cup of coffee, watch the news, eat breakfast, take the pets outside, shower and get ready for work. Arrive at work at 7:30 and work until 5:00. After work, I drive home, take the pets outside, fix dinner, watch the news on TV, followed by some entertainment shows. Before going to sleep, I try to read for an hour of so, and then it's off to lala land. When I was married heterosexually, my life was much the same. :)

Your analogy to the fornicating straight, is poor, because the person can express his/her straight orientation another way. It would be like telling straight people not to give expression to being straight. I understand you believe in your God, as you've indicated many times, but how precisely and logically is being gay destructive or harmful? Are you just here to try to convert people to your religion? I guess I'm not interested, which is why I haven't responded much on this thread. Oh well, go to it, as is your freedom. Personally I don't find the selling points either thought-provoking or appealing. Yours is essentially a mundane, "Jesus Christ is Lord", type of argument.

Gaetano:Despite the lies and misconceptions about gays by the majority, Jitobear has had the opportunity to find the truth. That they are, first and foremost, HUMAN BEINGS. In the case of her son's father, an exceptional human being.Earthbound characteristics like a person's sexual orientation are not good or bad, they just are. That said the spiritual facet of a person cannot be limited or negated by said characteristics. A person's spiritual condition cannot be decided based on your god. Spirituality is not about your god or anyone elses god for that matter, it is about how you treat others.

That isn't my version of civility, it's my version of debating blind and ignorant people who have no clue about what they are really saying. Thanks for the example of blind ignorance.I wasn't attempting to empathize with you when i said those things, I was being honest with you about your spiritual condition. Learn to tell the difference and I wont have to repeat myself.

Very well said. Thank you.

The problem with this argument is that you do not know anything about my "lifestyle." You make assumptions about gay people's "lifestyles," but our "lifestyles" are all different, just as the "lifestyles" of heterosexuals are all different. FYI, I can tell you that my lifestyle is not "unhealthy." I am a mother raising a 5-year-old child. I am a college professor. I am working on exercising more and eating healthy foods. We attend church every Sunday, and I am the chair of the Social Justice Committee at our church. I take my daughter to Daisy Girl Scouts and to swimming lessons and to music class. I am not yet a soccer mom, but that is probably coming. My daughter has expressed interest in playing soccer. The only thing "unhealthy" about my "lifestyle" is that I am probably overworked. But summer is coming, and we are going to Disney World!My life hardly resembles that of a "straight fornicator who cheats on his wife and participates in orgies." Instead, I am like other moms who organize kid birthday parties and participate in kid play dates.

Sorry you feel that way prof. I can assure you that i have no feelings of hate for you at all. I do stand by my statements though regarding the gay agenda and the gay LIFESTYLE. This isn't to condemn the gay person as they are as intertwined in an unhealthy lifestyle as is the straight fornicator who cheats on his wife and participates in orgies. A righteous and Holy God sees no difference in either lifestyle. Both are self destructive and hurt those who practice them. See, here you go again child. Where have I used threats of force in any way in this debate ? Why must your mantra be lie at all cost, and if called on the lie then lie again ? Debating with the likes of you disgusts me to my core as you wouldn't know the truth if you were buried in it.

But don't you understand that Archangel is expressing his Christian love when he compares you to a fornicator? I am constantly amazed by the Christian who cannot follow the teachings of Christ.

Hmm, my lifestyle is not quite this consistent, because it depends on whether I am teaching on a particular day or not, what meetings are scheduled, and what activities my daughter is to attend that day. Here is my lifestyle on most Mondays during this semester. I get up in the morning, make coffee, feed the cats, do some work, usually grading, get clothes laid out. I prepare my daughter's breakfast, then wake her up. I take a shower while she watches the Noggin channel or PBS Kids. We all brush our teeth, and I make sure she washes her face. We get dressed, gather our things, and head out the door. I drop her at pre-school and go to work. Between 5 and 5:30 I pick her up. We eat dinner and discuss our day. Then we go to Daisy Girl Scouts for an hour or so. We go home, brush teeth, and read together before bed. Tuesdays are a little different because we go to Kindermusik after daycare. Mommy lifestyles, whether we are heterosexual or gay, involve a lot of taking kids to various kid activities. It's fun. It's now time to take my daughter to daycare. We like to play, "I spy with my little eye" during the drive. Ciao for now.

And don't forget the fear factor. Fear of dying and going to hell. Why else should you believe? Has nothing to do with being a caring and loving human being. The infamous "gay lifestyle". Let me describe mine. I get up in the morning, have a cup of coffee, watch the news, eat breakfast, take the pets outside, shower and get ready for work. Arrive at work at 7:30 and work until 5:00. After work, I drive home, take the pets outside, fix dinner, watch the news on TV, followed by some entertainment shows. Before going to sleep, I try to read for an hour of so, and then it's off to lala land. When I was married heterosexually, my life was much the same. :)

I agree with you here and realize we all make generalizations about each other in this life. Just as I must constantly defend myself against the generalizations made by many here that all Christians are violent haters who wish to impose our lifestyle on everyone else when in the course of answering specific questions raised in these debates, we dare to give our opinions as to how we wish things were. The leap is constantly made that our motivation is fear and oppression. And I also realize that all gay people aren't involved in promoting the radical gay agenda. It isn't my desire to lump you all in the same mold. But unfortunately because you all are seeking the same end result regarding gay marriage, we remain on opposing sides of that issue. I would fight to protect your civil and human rights. But the radical gay groups work 24/7 trying to nullify the morals and values that we believe have made America the greatest Country on Earth, not perfect mind you, but the greatest none the less.You must admit that assumptions are made on both sides of this debate and as one of the few conservatives here I am defending the views of my side. My motivation isn't to condemn or insult anyone here, but I have been responding to offensive personal attacks too and have taking aim at the radical gay agenda in my critiques. If what I have said doesn't apply to you, then please don't take it personally. When someone here attacks the motives of radical islam, I'm not offended even though I'm an arab because I know I'm not a radical moslem. When Conservative Christians are portrayed as violent haters I do respond because I know that isn't who believers are either. So allow me some leeway for being the minority here against a majority who oppose my views.

Who are the radical gay groups that are supposedly working 24/7 to nullify the morals and values that have made America great? Please tell me who they are. I know of no such groups. I do support the agenda of full equality under the law for gay people, and for everyone else. If that is the "radical gay agenda," then I support it. I do not know what other "radical gay agenda" you refer to here. To paraphrase you, when gay rights activists are portrayed as radicals who seek to destroy our morals and values, I do respond because I know that isn't who gay rights activists are. I do take personally attacks against our movement for equality, because I am part of that movement. I have been part of that movement for more than 30 years. Just as you might take personally attacks on Christians who are socially active, I take personally attacks on gay people who are socially active, since I am one of them. I am also socially active through my church on a range of other issues, such as fighting hunger, ending the war, ending torture, ending the death penalty. I understand that most Christians do not promote hate and oppression. Some do....the Ku Klux Klan comes to mind. Some of the extremist anti-gay Christian groups clearly promote hate and oppression. But most Christians do not. Some may not know much about gay people, and that's what we are trying to change just by talking with folks. Many gay people are Christians. I am Unitarian Universalist, which is not Christian exactly, but we have Christian roots, and we work in coalition with Christians from other churches on issues like peacemaking, ending the death penalty, combating hunger and homelessness. It's true that you are probably in the minority in a gay rights forum. I'm not sure if you are in the minority in the wider society; you are in the majority as a Christian, but you may be in the minority on specific issues. The last Gallup poll I read indicated that a majority of Americans now view "homosexuality" as "an acceptable alternative lifestyle." I personally object to the phrasing of that question, as being gay is not a "lifestyle." It's a characteristic of some people. But apparently a majority of Americans now accept people being gay. A minority of Americans support same-sex marriage, but the percentage has risen steadily over time. Anyhow, I won't attack you personally. If I do inadvertently, please alert me to that, and I will apologize and remove my post. I will disagree with you on some specific issues, and I may agree with you on others. That's what these forums are for, after all.

My observation is that religious people who oppose gay rights (to varying degrees) can be categorized into 3 basic groups ...* Religion-justified hate groups (e.g. KKK, Phelps)* Groups that oppose some degree of gay rights and cultural acceptance because of genuine religious belief and not because of hate (and do not lash out or attack gays)* Groups that only marginally oppose gay rights and cultural acceptance of gays and would eliminate any opposition upon hearing your message ('just by talking with folks')I believe your post doesn't take into account the second category, and my opinion is that by-far most people who do not give full acceptance and claim religion as the reason fall under the second category. Because these people place such importance on religious belief and doctrine, I think it is unlikely you will do much to change their mind. The only way you can do it is to somehow convince then that homosexual relationships are compatible with their religious texts/beliefs. And then you're really doing little more than giving an unconventional interpretation.

In Chris Hedges new book on the Christian Right, he describes a group called Dimionists whose goal is to make America into a Christian theocracy and then dominate the world. People like Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell, and James Dobson, Antony Scalia, are in this group. They are to be feared and they need to be defeated. The Southern Baptists are also part of this conspiracy, according to Hedges. I wonder if Baptists in TN are part of this group.emoticonXConfused

That's an interesting categorization. There may also be people who oppose gay equality because that's how they were raised, and when pressed to explain why or to justify their opposition, they then turn to scripture for the justification. The source of their opposition may in fact be simply or primarily what they were taught about gay people since childhood....a set of unexamined assumptions, not necessarily a deep commitment to a particular interpretation of scripture. This may be a fourth category. These folks may harbor deep anti-gay sentiment, but its roots may be more cultural than religious, with religion as the later justification. Of course there is a long history of people debating the true meaning of scripture and its implications for public policy. There were passionate debates in the antebellum period over whether the Bible condoned slavery or condemned slavery. Today this is not an issue, because we have settled the question of slavery in the United States. In the early 19th century, the abolitionist interpretation of the Bible was the one that probably seemed to most people "an unconventional interpretation," and yet that interpretation won out over time. People can read the Bible many different ways, and conventional interpretations do change, of course. I think that people's interpretations of the Bible usually reflect their experiences in society and the beliefs they were taught coupled with their reading of scripture. We do not read scripture with neutral eyes. We read with the assumptions that we have been taught and in the context of the society in which we live. To the extent that Christians hear only that "homosexuality" is a sin and that gay people are condemned if they do not repent of their sin, these Christians are likely to believe that this is what scripture says. If and when alternate viewpoints are presented, these assumptions about gay people that many Christians bring to their reading of scripture are challenged. That will not necessarily lead people to change their thinking, but over time it may. And certainly NOT challenging people's assumptions about gay people simply leaves the assumptions intact.I think we have no choice but to challenge people's myths and stereotypes and assumptions about us gay people. I think this will prompt some anti-gay Christians, but not all, to rethink how they interpret scripture. This is why I think the Equality Rides are so powerful and why several conservative Christian colleges have barred the Equality Riders from their campuses and have had them arrested. The Equality Riders are young people, mostly Christians, who are bringing a message to young Christian conservatives that gay people are not as the myths and stereotypes suggest and that Christians should rethink how they interpret scripture when it comes to gay people. The Equality Riders thus challenge the assumptions that many people hold about gay people, assumptions that I think prompt many Christians to embrace an anti-gay interpretation of scripture.

First, in order to be fair, let's post my whole passage as quoting just the part you did changes the meaning of what i actually said.We not only export products and technology from the USA, but possibly our largest export is our Pop Culture. As a small but very vocal segment of our population is calling for the legalization of gay marriage and the acceptance and normalization of the radical gay culture; and don't say it isn't happening because they are the most vocal and activist among you. You fail to acknowledge or concern yourselves with a whole Word surrounding us that still deems homosexuality as either a criminal offense, a disease, or a sin worthy of death.Look at China, the largest single population on Earth. I dare you to go to Beijing and proudly declare you are gay on a street corner. Or India and Pakistan which also have populations in excess of a billion people. Go to Malaysia or North Korea and be outwardly flamboyant and see what happens to your freedom of choice. Now let's hop over to virtually any Middle Eastern or Islamic Country you want to deal with. The out of the closet gay would be beheaded at noon in the market square as an infidel. We have just covered more than two thirds of the Worlds population who must hide their gayness in order to simply remain free of persecution or death. And there are more I haven't touched on. Now I'm not sanctioning the injustices that exist elsewhere but I'm pointing out how fair this Country has been in spite of the universally accepted unnaturalness and criminality the Homosexual act is viewed with.Personally speaking I believe that "Don't ask, Don't tell" is a bad joke on our Society and gays should be able to proudly serve in our military without being expected to hide their true identities. I would inject myself in a situation if I walked upon a gay or any minority being abused in any way by a bigot or a racist, and I did when I lived in the South and it happened. But my question to you all is why aren't your pro equal rights organizations fighting the powers that be around the World who hold down your brothers and sisters who must live in fear of being found out for who they really are, My questions are, why don't you worry about the homosexuals in the rest of the World and the abuses they suffer ? Their murders and torture. Their imprisonment in retraining camps that drives the effeminate mannerisms out of them in the more merciful Countries that don't just kill them as defectives ? rather than attempt to force the 95% of your fellow Americans who have supported all the laws to protect your 5% from civil and human rights abuses, who support fair employment and equal opportunity, to also accept gay marriage as normal when it defies our original definition of marriage because two gays have no hope of being able to reproduce naturally. We believe it will lead to the destruction of the traditional family and will completely tear down the core values that once existed in America. And based on the loss of respect to America by the rest of the World who condemns our current culture and lifestyle, it seems to be hurting us in ways we refuse to consider as of late. You all will say you love America and yet all you can see is what you want with no consideration at all for the effect it is and will have on the Country and culture you claim to love so much. I'm sure you've heard that with freedom comes responsibility. I believe that if we continue to shirk our responsibility as the most ethical Nation on Earth with the most enlightened Bill of Rights and Constitution known to man, then we will surely lose the freedoms outlined in those documents that have made us the Greatest Superpower that has ever existed.So please don't think my fight is based on some shallow hate filled desire to oppress others who disagree with my world view, my concern is for the survival of my Country which I believe has been blessed by God because of what we have stood for in spite of the sins of our youth as a Nation. He blessed us because of the inherent good in those documents that led us to right the wrongs that most other Nations still suffer under. I could go on but I've said enough for now.

Personally, I don't believe any god had anything to do with America's greatness. America is a great nation because of the hard work and ingenuity of its people. There are places in Amercia still where people can be fired for being gay or be denied housing for being gay. I guess before we challenge the rest of the world, we need to correct these things at home. DADT is another issue, and I agree it should be rescinded.

First, most of us DO care about what happens to gay people in other parts of the world. I will turn the question back to you. You support human rights; why aren't YOU fighting for fair and equal treatment for gay people all around the world? There is not exactly an easy way to fight for the rights of these folks, but I agree that we can and should all be fighting for them. However, to put the burden of doing this entirely on gay people is not exactly fair, is it? Second, 95% of the population of the United States has NOT supported gay people in our struggle for fair and equal treatment. Many of our victories have been court victories, opposed by a majority of voters in particular states. We are still widely reviled by many people here in the United States, and we are still subject to hate crimes that have left and continue to leave gay people dead. I myself was beaten up years ago when I walked out of a lesbian bar. It also was only a few years ago that gay people could be and were arrested for having intimate relationships with our partners.....here in the United States. That only changed with the Supreme Court ruling in Lawrence v. Texas in 2003. And many gay people still live in fear here in the United States. Gay people live in fear of being physically attacked, of losing our jobs, of losing our children. In most states, we can still be fired for being gay, and it does happen. I don't want to suggest that most Americans are mean-spirited or that they would beat gay people up. That's certainly not true, and we have gained the support of significant heterosexual allies in our struggle for equal rights. We would not be where we are without the support of good people who are heterosexual allies. However, winning that support has been a long, uphill struggle. I remember when that support was largely absent; it was not long ago. We have had to fight to change things, and for years, mostly we fought alone, with few heterosexual allies willing to support us. That we have allies now is the result of our long, mostly lonely struggle. For you to suggest that we are somehow remiss because we haven't overcome the repression of gay people everywhere in the world shows how little you understand the struggle we have gone through here, and the struggle we are still engaged in. You say that we are fighting for the right to marry with no consideration of the impact this will have. Of course we are considering the impact it will have. Our winning the right to marry will provide greater protections for our children and for our families. That's the impact it will have. Our having the right to marry will help our children. And our children matter just as much as the children of heterosexuals matter. I have a small daughter. I want her to have the same protections that heterosexual parents can provide for their children through legal marriage. Some people argue that we should be satisfied with civil unions, that everyone supports civil unions now, so why can't we be satisfied with that? It was just a few years ago that people went ballistic in Vermont over our winning the right to civil unions. Opponents of gay rights were outraged that we should get any state recognition at all for our relationships, and they threatened to vote the legislators who supported civil unions out of office. Now people say similar things about marriage. How dare we presume to argue that we should have the right to marry? The idea offends good heterosexual Christians! Well, too bad if heterosexual Christians are offended. My daughter matters more than whether someone else feels offended about my marriage. Our children and our families matter more than whether someone feels offended because they don't want us to be treated as equals. That's what this boils down to. The opponents of same-sex marriage refuse to allow gay people to be treated as equals. I am sick and tired of listening to the whining of anti-gay heterosexuals over how terrible it will somehow be for them or for the society if we get married. When asked what will be so terrible, they can't come up with anything. All they can say is that our marriages are against their religion. Well, fine. People don't have to like our marriages. They can ignore them. I do not care if my marriage is against someone else's religion. It's not against my religion, and I don't adhere to someone else's religion. We do not live in a theocracy. Someone's religion should not dictate civil law. Someone else's religion should not dictate whether I can get married to protect my child.

First, in order to be fair, let's post my whole passage as quoting just the part you did changes the meaning of what i actually said.We not only export products and technology from the USA, but possibly our largest export is our Pop Culture. As a small but very vocal segment of our population is calling for the legalization of gay marriage and the acceptance and normalization of the radical gay culture; and don't say it isn't happening because they are the most vocal and activist among you. You fail to acknowledge or concern yourselves with a whole Word surrounding us that still deems homosexuality as either a criminal offense, a disease, or a sin worthy of death.Look at China, the largest single population on Earth. I dare you to go to Beijing and proudly declare you are gay on a street corner. Or India and Pakistan which also have populations in excess of a billion people. Go to Malaysia or North Korea and be outwardly flamboyant and see what happens to your freedom of choice. Now let's hop over to virtually any Middle Eastern or Islamic Country you want to deal with. The out of the closet gay would be beheaded at noon in the market square as an infidel. We have just covered more than two thirds of the Worlds population who must hide their gayness in order to simply remain free of persecution or death. And there are more I haven't touched on. Now I'm not sanctioning the injustices that exist elsewhere but I'm pointing out how fair this Country has been in spite of the universally accepted unnaturalness and criminality the Homosexual act is viewed with.Personally speaking I believe that "Don't ask, Don't tell" is a bad joke on our Society and gays should be able to proudly serve in our military without being expected to hide their true identities. I would inject myself in a situation if I walked upon a gay or any minority being abused in any way by a bigot or a racist, and I did when I lived in the South and it happened. But my question to you all is why aren't your pro equal rights organizations fighting the powers that be around the World who hold down your brothers and sisters who must live in fear of being found out for who they really are, My questions are, why don't you worry about the homosexuals in the rest of the World and the abuses they suffer ? Their murders and torture. Their imprisonment in retraining camps that drives the effeminate mannerisms out of them in the more merciful Countries that don't just kill them as defectives ? rather than attempt to force the 95% of your fellow Americans who have supported all the laws to protect your 5% from civil and human rights abuses, who support fair employment and equal opportunity, to also accept gay marriage as normal when it defies our original definition of marriage because two gays have no hope of being able to reproduce naturally. We believe it will lead to the destruction of the traditional family and will completely tear down the core values that once existed in America. And based on the loss of respect to America by the rest of the World who condemns our current culture and lifestyle, it seems to be hurting us in ways we refuse to consider as of late. You all will say you love America and yet all you can see is what you want with no consideration at all for the effect it is and will have on the Country and culture you claim to love so much. I'm sure you've heard that with freedom comes responsibility. I believe that if we continue to shirk our responsibility as the most ethical Nation on Earth with the most enlightened Bill of Rights and Constitution known to man, then we will surely lose the freedoms outlined in those documents that have made us the Greatest Superpower that has ever existed.So please don't think my fight is based on some shallow hate filled desire to oppress others who disagree with my world view, my concern is for the survival of my Country which I believe has been blessed by God because of what we have stood for in spite of the sins of our youth as a Nation. He blessed us because of the inherent good in those documents that led us to right the wrongs that most other Nations still suffer under. I could go on but I've said enough for now.

I know this is going back a few posts. The sad part is that I have not found christianity to be a religion of fear but one that communicates a lot of hope. It is not for fear of punishment that the christians I know have turned to God but rather they seem genuinely in love with Jesus. In fact, those that I know that are actually afraid of punishment in the afterlife will have nothing to do with christianity. Huck

True, but such laws do not follow us to the grave. What Arch's religious belief system seems to be based on is fear of what may happen, rather then the truth of his religion. That's a terrible foundation for religious beliefs. When he runs into someone who disagress with his religious beliefs, he invariably threatens them with what may happen. People have stated Christanity is a religion of fear for years. It's not much of a guess why.

I have known many Christians, as have most of us in the United States. I have known Christians inspired by hope and by the love and example of Jesus. I have known Christians who devote their lives to making the world better, by working against hunger and supporting those in great need and by working for peace and justice. I have also known Christians who do seem motivated more by fear than by love, or more by prejudice than by love. I think Christianity can and should be a powerful force for making the world better for everyone. Many Christians have made a commitment to doing that. But I have known some, sadly, who do just the opposite. I guess that is just the human condition.

Then we have had very different experiences for the most part. I will admit though non-denomination Christians tend to focus on the hope, while the denominational based christians I have met tend to focus on fear. And many Christians I know believe because of fear.Then why do some christians rely heavily upon "believe or burn" arguments as Arch does? Is that not a sign that their belief system is heavily based upon fear?

Ah, and what WOULD be your "original definition of marriage" exactly? I've seen numerous "original definitions of marriage" throughout history, so it ain't all that "original", now is it?I also laugh hysterically at your bringing up the old "gays cannot reproduce naturally" fallacy. First off, gay men can adopt as well as donate sperm that can be used to make more children, and gay women can go through AI to have kids. Second off - to keep to your "original" emoticonXRolleyes definition of marriage, all marriages should be immediately ended when the woman hits menopause, and every single couple should be tested for fertility, if one is found to be infertile they should be denied any sort of marriage license. Couples should also be required to take an oath and sign a legal document binding them to a promise to have kids - if they break that oath, their license goes bye-bye and they have to return any benifits they recieved as a married couple. Then, no woman will be allowed to get her tubes tied, and no man will be able to get his tied, at least if they want a chance at being married. That is where your "logic" would get us - sounds purdy don't it? emoticonXRolleyesYour fellow "christians" have used this fearmongering argument before every time gay marriage has been allowed in a country (even in a state of the US) - and whaddaya know- every time it has turned out to be a load of emoticonXCensored . But then again, we already knew the predictive skills of "Christians" tend to be sub-par.

Building on my previous post, one person who has argued that he has evidence of same-sex marriage undermining opposite-sex marriage in conservative pundit Stanley Kurtz. Kurtz has argued that same-sex marriage has led to the decline of opposite-sex marriage in Scandinavia. This is from Kurtz's 2994 article on this issue:http://www.weeklystandard.com/Conten...3/660zypwj.asp“MARRIAGE IS SLOWLY DYING IN SCANDINAVIA. A majority of children in Sweden and Norway are born out of wedlock. Sixty percent of first-born children in Denmark have unmarried parents. Not coincidentally, these countries have had something close to full gay marriage for a decade or more. Same-sex marriage has locked in and reinforced an existing Scandinavian trend toward the separation of marriage and parenthood. The Nordic family pattern--including gay marriage--is spreading across Europe. And by looking closely at it we can answer the key empirical question underlying the gay marriage debate. Will same-sex marriage undermine the institution of marriage? It already has.”Kurtz's arguments are easily refuted. First, same-sex marriage is not legal in the countries Kurtz singled out. Gay couples in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark instead can commit to registered partnerships, which are essentially civil unions, not legal marriage. Belgium and the Netherlands have legalized same-sex marriage. Second, Kurtz argues that the legalization of same-sex marriage has caused a decline in opposite-sex marriage, which is quite clearly not true. He appears intentionally to confound correlation with causation, and he knows better, given his credentials. But even a correlation argument falls apart, because the data do not support Kurtz's assertion that heterosexual marriage is in decline in Scandinavia. The following is from an article by M.V.Lee Badgett:http://www.slate.com/id/2100884/“Despite what Kurtz might say, the apocalypse has not yet arrived. In fact, the numbers show that heterosexual marriage looks pretty healthy in Scandinavia, where same-sex couples have had rights the longest. In Denmark, for example, the marriage rate had been declining for a half-century but turned around in the early 1980s. After the 1989 passage of the registered-partner law, the marriage rate continued to climb; Danish heterosexual marriage rates are now the highest they've been since the early 1970's. And the most recent marriage rates in Sweden, Norway, and Iceland are all higher than the rates for the years before the partner laws were passed. Furthermore, in the 1990s, divorce rates in Scandinavia remained basically unchanged.” Kurtz also claims that in Scandinavia, the numbers of unmarried heterosexual cohabiting couples have increased dramatically, as have births to unwed mothers, and for this he blames the legalization of same-sex marriage. But as Badgett points out, the increase in co-habitation between unmarried couples went up before the legalization of same-sex marriage, not afterward. And, according to Badgett, most co-habiting opposite-sex Scandinavian couples do marry after they have a child. He reports that 70% of co-habiting opposite-sex couples in Sweden marry after they have their first child. Badgett also reports that in the Netherlands, where same-sex marriage is legal, 90% of heterosexual couples with children are married. Kurtz's arguments are repeated ad nauseum in conservative publications to provide supposed "evidence" that same-sex marriage has led to the decline of heterosexual marriage. But examination of Kurtz's arguments quickly shows how absurd his claims are, and how he falsifies "evidence." I think he falsifies evidence deliberately. Kurtz knows better than to put forward such falsehoods as he does.

The argument that quite a few opponents of same-sex marriage make is that it will somehow destroy opposite-sex marriage, or erode opposite-sex marriage. See my post about Stanley Kurtz. As for how people "see" marriage, for the first 140 years or so of the American republic, women were not "seen" as voters, and for most of that time the idea of women voting was widely regarded as contrary to the natural order and, indeed, as shocking. For much of American history, people were deeply offended by the idea that women could be voters. Opponents argued that allowing women to vote would "unsex" them and turn the relationships between men and women upside down. Many predicted dire consequences for the society if women were granted the vote. Those dire consequences never materialized, of course, and today everyone accepts women as voters and even as serious Presidential candidates. What used to be shocking and apparently contrary to the natural order can become accepted and the norm, without undermining the society. Tell me how accepting gay couples as married couples will do anything to harm society? Tell me how accepting gay couples as married couples will produce any negative consequences for anyone?

You can argue history and tradition and family values and the end of all that is good about marriage all you want.

The argument that quite a few opponents of same-sex marriage make is that it will somehow destroy opposite-sex marriage, or erode opposite-sex marriage. See my post about Stanley Kurtz. As for how people "see" marriage, for the first 140 years or so of the American republic, women were not "seen" as voters, and for most of that time the idea of women voting was widely regarded as contrary to the natural order and, indeed, as shocking. For much of American history, people were deeply offended by the idea that women could be voters. Opponents argued that allowing women to vote would "unsex" them and turn the relationships between men and women upside down. Many predicted dire consequences for the society if women were granted the vote. Those dire consequences never materialized, of course, and today everyone accepts women as voters and even as serious Presidential candidates. What used to be shocking and apparently contrary to the natural order can become accepted and the norm, without undermining the society. Tell me how accepting gay couples as married couples will do anything to harm society? Tell me how accepting gay couples as married couples will produce any negative consequences for anyone?

Do your own homework, buddy.

So what you're saying is that you can't produce one objective, independent site or source that is by the Dominionists themselves as evidence that they are an actual existing group or organization. If you could, you would have. This is just one more example of the diabolical agenda of the Radical Left to make people fear Christianity based on more lies and deception. Thanks for revealing who the real paranoid fearmongers are. emoticonXAngel

Afraid same-sex marriage will harm opposite-sex marriage?Guess what? It's been legal in Massachussets for some time now. Show me the "harm." There isn't any. No churches have been forced to perform same-sex marriages--but plenty have, voluntarily, without the wrath of God having descended upon them. And the divorce rate's the lowest in the country. So much for that argument.Afraid legalizing same-sex marriage will "change the definition" of marriage?Guess what? It already has, in a growing number of on-line and print dictionaries: definitions have been added to include the joining of "two persons," rather than just a man and a woman. Sorry, that ship has sailed. I must have missed the cataclysm that was supposed to result... just like I missed the one that happened when they changed the definition of "mouse" to mean a computer pointing device.

Dominionism is a trend in Protestant Christian evangelicalism and fundamentalism, primarily, though not exclusively, in the United States, that seeks to establish specific political policies based on religious beliefs.It is most often used to describe politically active conservative Christians with a specific agenda. The term is rarely used as a self-description; many feel it is a loaded or pejorative term, and use of the term is primarily limited to critics of the Christian Right.The term emerged in relation to the Christian Right in the mid-1990s, but became more widely known due in large part to the U.S. presidential election, 2004 where the media attributed Republican wins to Evangelical voters in Red states who voted for moral values.[1] A number of authors, among them Andrew Sullivan, use the terms Christianism or Christianist in place of Dominionism in an attempt to "take back the word Christian (from) the religious right."[2

The First Prince of the Theocratic States of AmericaIt happened quietly, with barely a mention in the media. Only the Washington Post dutifully reported it.[1] And only Kevin Phillips saw its significance in his new book, American Dynasty.[2] On December 24, 2001, Pat Robertson resigned his position as President of the Christian Coalition.Behind the scenes religious conservatives were abuzz with excitement. They believed Robertson had stepped down to allow the ascendance of the President of the United States of America to take his rightful place as the head of the true American Holy Christian Church.Robertson’s act was symbolic, but it carried a secret and solemn revelation to the faithful. It was the signal that the Bush administration was a government under God that was led by an anointed President who would be the first regent in a dynasty of regents awaiting the return of Jesus to earth. The President would now be the minister through whom God would execute His will in the nation. George W. Bush accepted his scepter and his sword with humility, grace and a sense of exultation.As Antonin Scalia, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court explained a few months later, the Bible teaches and Christians believe “… that government …derives its moral authority from God. Government is the ‘minister of God’ with powers to ‘revenge,’ to ‘execute wrath,’ including even wrath by the sword…”[3]George W. Bush began to wield the sword of God’s revenge with relish from the beginning of his administration, but most of us missed the sword play. I have taken the liberty to paraphrase an illustration from Leo Strauss, the father of the neo-conservative movement, which gives us a clue of how the hiding is done:“One ought not to say to those whom one wants to kill, ‘Give me your votes, because your votes will enable me to kill you and I want to kill you,’ but merely, ‘Give me your votes,’ for once you have the power of the votes in your hand, you can satisfy your desire.”[4]Notwithstanding the advice, the President’s foreign policy revealed a flair for saber rattling. He warned the world that “nations are either with us or they’re against us!” His speeches, often containing allusions to biblical passages, were spoken with the certainty of a man who holds the authority of God’s wrath on earth, for he not only challenged the evil nations of the world, singling out Iraq, Syria, Iran, and North Korea as the “axis of evil,” but he wielded the sword of punishment and the sword of revenge against his own people: the American poor and the middle class who according to the religious right have earned God’s wrath by their licentiousness and undisciplined lives.To the middle class he said, “I’m going to give you clear skies clean air and clean water,” then he gutted the environmental controls that were designed to provide clean air and water. The estimated number of premature deaths that will result: 100,000.[5] He said to the poor and to the middle class: “I’m going to give you a prescription drug program, one that you truly deserve.” Then he gave the drug industry an estimated $139 billion dollars in increased profits from the Medicare funds and arranged for the poorest of seniors to be eliminated from coverage, while most elderly will pay more for drugs than they paid before his drug benefit bill passed.[6] After that he arranged for the dismantling of the Medicare program entirely, based on the method outlined by his religious mentors.[7] He said to the people of America, “I’m going to build a future for you and your children,” then he gutted their future with tax breaks to the rich and a pre-emptive war against Iraq, and the largest spending deficit in history.[8]

You are saying gays should just be grateful we are not being put in concentration camps. I would have a few other words to say to that, but I'd likely be banned. Simply because it's not genocide, does not mean it isn't discrimination or exclusion, it doesn't mean it isn't wrong. You are not doing us some great favour simply because you are not killing us. We have the same human rights as anyone else.We are. "Vocal Activists" in these countries are fighting against those worst abuses, despite the risks. If your argument is gays are wrong because we are a minority, it shouldn't matter if we are being killed in some areas. We are wrong in your view, and the majority is right. The original definition of marriage is not for reproduction only.Where do you come up with this ####? You simply want to blame gays for everything. What a bunch of nationalistic, patriotic drivel. What about the freedoms of gay citizens, which is the issue here. Is there not a responsibility for America to protect the human rights and freedoms of its gay citizens?It's all about God and country. Shut up, don't ask question and march in line, right or wrong. Indeed, that's enough pedestrian ranting and drivel for now. You've finally said something I agree with.

Why does it have to be mutually exclusive? Why can't it be "and" instead of "or"?How many people do you know personally who would divorce his or her spouse and become gay if same sex marriages were legal?All my friends are straight. Seriously. I really only know one other gay person (besides my partner), and he moved away. Not a single one of them would suddenly become XXXXX if it became legal.You have nothing to worry about either about what kind of message it sends to our kids. Every single one of us is bombarded with expectations and images of heterosexuality from the moment we're born. An occasional married, same sex couple isn't going to change that. The 90-96% (or whatever) of heterosexual people are going to go on being heterosexual. What it might do is make the 2-10% of us who don't and never fit into that mold grow up without some of that self-loathing imposed on us by the hatred and disgust of our culture and our peers.

OK fine, this link doesn't specifically mention gays but it deals with the secularization of our Society and relies on the same arguments you use ad infinitum and shows how your precise reasoning is leading to our demise as the family unit is destroyed. And it isn't from a religious site. Here's an excerpt that outlines the damage done by secularism.America’s Schizophrenic CultureAmerica has developed a schizophrenic culture. On the one hand, we have attained unprecedented heights of material success and prosperity On the other hand, we have been unable to maintain a solid moral character, family stability, safe communities, and a harmonious and happy society. This contradiction is manifest in individual lives. We instill in our youth a strong desire for material success and prosperity yet we fail to teach the values that are necessary to build good character, strong families, and a harmonious society.A Vicious CycleThe moral compass of our society, the conscience, has been corrupted and a vicious cycle is being generated. Children born and raised in dysfunctional families in which they do not receive the love of parents necessary to instill the sense of value, empathy for others, self-discipline, and good character necessary for a healthy society are less likely to form lasting intimate relationships which develop into committed marriages and stable families. As this cycle expands, society’s problems multiply. If we are to renew American society, it is imperative that we break the cycle of family breakdown. In order to do this however, it is necessary to understand more about the cultural climate of 20th century America and to identify certain ideas which have suborned and weakened the power of the conscience in today’s society.Ideas Have ConsequencesIdeas have consequences. People act the way that they do because they think in certain ways, because they hold certain beliefs. This is true for individuals and it is also true for a society or culture. In the modern world, certain institutions - the universities, schools, the media and the entertainment industry - have a major influence in shaping our understanding of ourselves and the world. The ideas and images which are communicated not only influence the actions of individuals; they have a profound influence on public policy which in turn further affects our life and our decisions.Secular "Modern" IdeasTruth is truth. Ideally truth discovered by science and reason should be in agreement with truth revealed by religion and work in harmony to help create a healthy society in a prosperous and productive environment. In practice, however, this has not often been the case. A later lecture will contain a more full discussion of the development and relationship between secular thought, tracing it’s antecedents back to the Greek Hellenism, and sacred thought, which in our tradition have been based primarily upon the Bible.In this short presentation, there is not time to explore the tremendous social changes that have occurred in the past several hundred years and the complex interplay of secular and religious thought. For our purposes, I will simply say that building on the thought of the Enlightenment and inspired by the rapid development of science, many thinkers in the 19th century rejected the authenticity of divine revelation and called into question basic principles of Judeo-Christian culture. Based upon 19th century conceptions of science, a number of thinkers with a secular bias sought to develop a modern scientific conception of man and the universe. In the process of this development, several ideas were expounded which have contributed to modern man’s separation from God, and confused our comprehension of basic moral truths. As these ideas have been propagated, people’s consciences have been weakened, and this has helped to create a climate in which the breakdown of the family has been occurring. I would like to pinpoint a number of these ideas and trace their development through some of our major institutions.The following ideas in combination have been particularly harmful:God, religion, and questions of morality are matters of personal opinion which have little or no relevance to social problems.Man is a highly evolved animal.There are no absolute standards; values are relative.The nuclear family is a product of social evolution and is just one of a number of possible forms of social organization.Societies problems can be solved by technology and the social sciences with a particular emphasis on the role of the state in social engineering.Traditional Religious BeliefsThis is in contrast to Judeo-Christian beliefs as well as other traditional cultures which have asserted that:There is a GodMan is a spiritual being who depends upon a relationship with the divine to discover and fulfill his purpose in lifeThere are universal and absolute moral principlesThe nuclear family is not only the central foundation for the transmission of social values but is a sacred institution protected by very clear standards of sexual morality.Erroneous Notions of ModernismIn the following remarks, I look at several thinkers who have had a profound influence on the 20th century. Let me clarify that I am not attacking them personally, I am not pretending to give a systematic presentation of their philosophy, and I am not saying that they that they were evil or totally wrong in all of their views. What I would like to do is look at the impact that some of their ideas had - how those ideas have been popularly received by the culture - and how they contributed to and gave currency to the notions mentioned above.A. God, religion, and questions of morality are matters of personal opinion which have little or no relevance to social problems.Auguste Comte who lived in France from 1798 to 1857 was the father of Positivism and the founder of the Sociology. Positivism maintains that the only way that verifiable truth can be ascertained is through the empirical methods of science. Because statements of a religious, moral or metaphysical nature can not be verified, they are not objective truths. Though they may have emotional value, they are opinion rather than scientific truth. Comte proposed that scientific methods should be used to study society and human behavior and for this purpose he founded sociology. The founding of sociology was followed by the establishment of several other disciplines of social science such as anthropology, psychology, political science, and the development of social statistics. The principles of positivism also influenced the study of history, law, and philosophy. In fact, the social sciences played a major role in the development of the 20th century university. As the university became the central institution for training the leadership of modern America, the social sciences with their positivistic bias became the wellspring of the progressive movement and the modern liberal state. The army of bureaucrats who man numerous administrative agencies of the modern state are evidence of the legacy of positivism. For you legislators, the next time a representative of a government agency testifies before your committee with a barrage of social statistics, say a little thank you to Auguste.B. Man as Animal: Evolution as a Result of Random MutationsThe publication of Charles Darwin’s Origin of Species in 1859 was a second milestone in the development of the modernist viewpoint. Darwin’s theory that evolution takes place through a process of natural selection based upon random genetic mutations not only suggested that man is merely a physical animal. His emphasis on the random nature of genetic mutation implies that there is no inherent order to the universe and no creative design. If evolution is determined by chance, then some other form of life could just as easily have developed to a position of ascendancy. Science can explain the ascent of man better than religion. There is no need for belief in God to explain man’s existence. Indeed, God, morality, and religion each can be viewed as mere creations of the human mind. As man’s brain evolved to the point that he developed intelligence and the capability of abstract thought, man created religion in his attempt to explain natural phenomena. God didn’t create man; man created God.C. Relative ValuesIn Thus Spoke Zarathustra, written by Friedrich Nietzsche between 1883 and 1885, Zarathustra proclaimsBefore God! But now this god has died. You higher men, this god was your greatest danger. It is only since he lies in his tomb that you have been resurrected. Only now the great noon comes; only now the higher man becomes lord.Have you understood this word. O my brothers? You are startled? Do your hearts become giddy? Does the abyss yawn before you? Does the hellhound howl at you? Well then you higher men! Only now is the mountain of man’s future in labor. God died: now we want the overman to live. (translation by Walter Kaufman)Nietzsche was announcing the demise of traditional values and moral restraints of Christian society and the potential for powerful creative individuals to create their own values freed from the restraints of "the morality of the herd." As Alan Bloom states in his book Closing the American Mind:Values are not discovered by reason, and it is useless to seek them, to find the truth or the good life. The quest begun by Odysseus and continued for over three thousand millennia has come to an end with the observation that there is nothing to seek. This alleged fact was announced by Nietzsche just over a century ago when he said, "God is dead." Good and evil now appear for the first time as values, of which there have been a thousand and one, none rationally or objectively preferable to one another. (p. 143)Once man is deprived man of a standard of value based on faith in divine revelation, reason itself is incapable of defining any absolute standard of value. Bloom describes in his book how the concept of relative values became extremely influential in American universities after World War II.D. The Nature and Role of Human SexualityIn his clinical work with women suffering from hysteria, Sigmund Freud discovered that sexual frustration seemed to be the common cause of their neuroses. In time, Freud developed a theory of personality emphasizing the determining power of unconscious sexual drives. The central principle of the personality is the pleasure principle. The unconscious id or libido is the dominant factor in the human psyche and its strongest impulse is the desire for sexual gratification. The ego, or consciousness is the rational faculty which seeks to adapt the needs of the id to its environment. The superego, which we would generally identify as the conscience, is the composite of parental taboos and rewards which are imbedded in our in our formative years. In the case of Western civilization, the monogamous family as a social institution is a culturally derived attempt of a patriarchal society to control sexuality. Strict monogamy can cause sexual repression and thus give rise to individual and social neuroses. Religion itself is a creation of the unconscious mind, an "illusion", similar to a neuroses, which is generated by the unconscious to reinforce the predominant social mores. In other words, a patriarchal society creates a Father God to replace the father figure of childhood and maintain the control of the superego.Here is a representative quote form one of Freud’s later and most widely read works:The tendency on the part of civilization to restrict sexual life is no less clear than its tendency to expand the cultural unit. Its first, totemic, phase already brings with it the prohibition against an incestuous choice of object, and this is perhaps the most drastic mutilation which man’s erotic life has in all time experienced. Taboos, laws, customs impose further restrictions, which affect both men and women. Not all civilizations go equally far in this; and the economic structure of the society also influences the amount of sexual freedom that remains…. A high-water mark has been reached in our Western Civilization…. As regards the sexually mature individual, the choice of an object is restricted to the opposite sex, and most extra-genital satisfactions are forbidden as perversions. The requirement, demonstrated in these prohibitions, that there be a single kind of sex life for everyone, disregards the dissimilarities, whether innate or acquired, in the sexual constitution of human beings. It cuts off a fair number of them from sexual enjoyment, and so becomes a source of serious injustice. (Freud, Civilization and Its Discontents, 1930)As Freud’s ideas gained popularity they gave rise to the notion that sexual repression is unhealthy and that morality is artificial. Such notions are at the root of the sexual revolution of the 1960’s, the sexual liberation movements as well as many of the ideas which determine the bias of sex education and school policy to this day. In a more general sense the pervasive influence of the popular concepts of Freud created a general climate in which it is easy for anyone to rationalize the immorality and infidelity which lead to teen pregnancy, and family breakdown.The Institutionalization of Secular Relativistic IdeasNow I would like to take a brief look at how these "modern" ideas have influenced the major institutions of 20th century America and have helped to create a moral and cultural climate which has contributed to the breakdown of the family in the last three decades of this century.A. The UniversityThe university has come to play a central role in 20th century America. Our teachers, our journalists, our policy makers, our lawyers, our writers, and our bureaucrats are all university educated. As emphasized earlier, the 20th century university has emphasized a scientific, empirical approach not only in the hard sciences but in the social sciences as well. University education has embraced the secular ideas of modernism. Whereas, in the 18th and 19th century our most important universities were founded initially as seminaries and theology was seen as the queen of the sciences, gradually the situation changed and the sciences and the social sciences became dominant with government funding for social and scientific research. University students learned to view the universe through a modernist viewpoint emphasizing relative values and man’s secular nature. Needless to say such ideas influenced their personal morality. Moreover, graduates have carried these ideas with them into their work in education, media, and public policy.B. The Public Education SystemJohn Dewey had a long career extending from the last decade of the 19th century through the first half of the 20th. According to John Westbrook, author of John Dewey and American Democracy:The consensus of opinion, including that of those critical of Dewey’s social philosophy, is that he was a major influence on the ideology of modern liberalism and that Deweyan pragmatism is the most articulate expression of the philosophical foundation of this ideology, an ideology that has dominated political and social intercourse in twentieth-century America.Dewey was especially influential in the field of education. As chairman of the department of philosophy, psychology and education at the University of Chicago from 1894 to 1904, he helped to found the famous Dewey School, a laboratory school designed to test and develop his psychological and educational theories. In 1904 he went to Columbia University where remained until his retirement in 1930. The Columbia Teachers College trained teachers for the United States and schools around the world and Dewey’s philosophy had a major impact on education. Expressing his pedagogic creed in 1897, Dewey declared: "I believe… the teacher is engaged, not simply in the training of individuals, but in the formation of the proper social life… that he is a social servant set apart for the maintenance of proper social order and the securing of the right social growth."Says Westbrook:Dewey’s conviction … reflected his belief that "education is the fundamental method of social progress and reform." There is a certain logic to this belief. Insofar as schools played an important part in the shaping of the character of a society’s children, they could if they were designed to do so, fundamentally transform the society. The school provided a relatively controlled environment in which the conditions of self-development could effectively shape its course. Indeed, if teachers did their job well, there would hardly be need of any other sort of reform. (John Dewey and American Democracy, p. 109)Inspired and guided by this mission, American public education in the 20th century became the vehicle for implementing and testing the latest social theories out of the secular academic world.http://www.tparents.org/Library/Unif...in/secular.htm

For our purposes, I will simply say that building on the thought of the Enlightenment and inspired by the rapid development of science, many thinkers in the 19th century rejected the authenticity of divine revelation and called into question basic principles of Judeo-Christian culture. Based upon 19th century conceptions of science, a number of thinkers with a secular bias sought to develop a modern scientific conception of man and the universe. In the process of this development, several ideas were expounded which have contributed to modern man’s separation from God, and confused our comprehension of basic moral truths. As these ideas have been propagated, people’s consciences have been weakened, and this has helped to create a climate in which the breakdown of the family has been occurring. I would like to pinpoint a number of these ideas and trace their development through some of our major institutions.The following ideas in combination have been particularly harmful:God, religion, and questions of morality are matters of personal opinion which have little or no relevance to social problems.Man is a highly evolved animal.There are no absolute standards; values are relative.The nuclear family is a product of social evolution and is just one of a number of possible forms of social organization.Societies problems can be solved by technology and the social sciences with a particular emphasis on the role of the state in social engineering.Traditional Religious BeliefsThis is in contrast to Judeo-Christian beliefs as well as other traditional cultures which have asserted that:There is a GodMan is a spiritual being who depends upon a relationship with the divine to discover and fulfill his purpose in lifeThere are universal and absolute moral principlesThe nuclear family is not only the central foundation for the transmission of social values but is a sacred institution protected by very clear standards of sexual morality.Erroneous Notions of ModernismIn the following remarks, I look at several thinkers who have had a profound influence on the 20th century. Let me clarify that I am not attacking them personally, I am not pretending to give a systematic presentation of their philosophy, and I am not saying that they that they were evil or totally wrong in all of their views. What I would like to do is look at the impact that some of their ideas had - how those ideas have been popularly received by the culture - and how they contributed to and gave currency to the notions mentioned above.A. God, religion, and questions of morality are matters of personal opinion which have little or no relevance to social problems.Auguste Comte who lived in France from 1798 to 1857 was the father of Positivism and the founder of the Sociology. Positivism maintains that the only way that verifiable truth can be ascertained is through the empirical methods of science. Because statements of a religious, moral or metaphysical nature can not be verified, they are not objective truths. Though they may have emotional value, they are opinion rather than scientific truth. Comte proposed that scientific methods should be used to study society and human behavior and for this purpose he founded sociology. The founding of sociology was followed by the establishment of several other disciplines of social science such as anthropology, psychology, political science, and the development of social statistics. The principles of positivism also influenced the study of history, law, and philosophy. In fact, the social sciences played a major role in the development of the 20th century university. As the university became the central institution for training the leadership of modern America, the social sciences with their positivistic bias became the wellspring of the progressive movement and the modern liberal state. The army of bureaucrats who man numerous administrative agencies of the modern state are evidence of the legacy of positivism. For you legislators, the next time a representative of a government agency testifies before your committee with a barrage of social statistics, say a little thank you to Auguste.B. Man as Animal: Evolution as a Result of Random MutationsThe publication of Charles Darwin’s Origin of Species in 1859 was a second milestone in the development of the modernist viewpoint. Darwin’s theory that evolution takes place through a process of natural selection based upon random genetic mutations not only suggested that man is merely a physical animal. His emphasis on the random nature of genetic mutation implies that there is no inherent order to the universe and no creative design. If evolution is determined by chance, then some other form of life could just as easily have developed to a position of ascendancy. Science can explain the ascent of man better than religion. There is no need for belief in God to explain man’s existence. Indeed, God, morality, and religion each can be viewed as mere creations of the human mind. As man’s brain evolved to the point that he developed intelligence and the capability of abstract thought, man created religion in his attempt to explain natural phenomena. God didn’t create man; man created God.C. Relative ValuesIn Thus Spoke Zarathustra, written by Friedrich Nietzsche between 1883 and 1885, Zarathustra proclaimsBefore God! But now this god has died. You higher men, this god was your greatest danger. It is only since he lies in his tomb that you have been resurrected. Only now the great noon comes; only now the higher man becomes lord.Have you understood this word. O my brothers? You are startled? Do your hearts become giddy? Does the abyss yawn before you? Does the hellhound howl at you? Well then you higher men! Only now is the mountain of man’s future in labor. God died: now we want the overman to live. (translation by Walter Kaufman)Nietzsche was announcing the demise of traditional values and moral restraints of Christian society and the potential for powerful creative individuals to create their own values freed from the restraints of "the morality of the herd." As Alan Bloom states in his book Closing the American Mind:Values are not discovered by reason, and it is useless to seek them, to find the truth or the good life. The quest begun by Odysseus and continued for over three thousand millennia has come to an end with the observation that there is nothing to seek. This alleged fact was announced by Nietzsche just over a century ago when he said, "God is dead." Good and evil now appear for the first time as values, of which there have been a thousand and one, none rationally or objectively preferable to one another. (p. 143)Once man is deprived man of a standard of value based on faith in divine revelation, reason itself is incapable of defining any absolute standard of value. Bloom describes in his book how the concept of relative values became extremely influential in American universities after World War II.D. The Nature and Role of Human SexualityIn his clinical work with women suffering from hysteria, Sigmund Freud discovered that sexual frustration seemed to be the common cause of their neuroses. In time, Freud developed a theory of personality emphasizing the determining power of unconscious sexual drives. The central principle of the personality is the pleasure principle. The unconscious id or libido is the dominant factor in the human psyche and its strongest impulse is the desire for sexual gratification. The ego, or consciousness is the rational faculty which seeks to adapt the needs of the id to its environment. The superego, which we would generally identify as the conscience, is the composite of parental taboos and rewards which are imbedded in our in our formative years. In the case of Western civilization, the monogamous family as a social institution is a culturally derived attempt of a patriarchal society to control sexuality. Strict monogamy can cause sexual repression and thus give rise to individual and social neuroses. Religion itself is a creation of the unconscious mind, an "illusion", similar to a neuroses, which is generated by the unconscious to reinforce the predominant social mores. In other words, a patriarchal society creates a Father God to replace the father figure of childhood and maintain the control of the superego.Here is a representative quote form one of Freud’s later and most widely read works:The tendency on the part of civilization to restrict sexual life is no less clear than its tendency to expand the cultural unit. Its first, totemic, phase already brings with it the prohibition against an incestuous choice of object, and this is perhaps the most drastic mutilation which man’s erotic life has in all time experienced. Taboos, laws, customs impose further restrictions, which affect both men and women. Not all civilizations go equally far in this; and the economic structure of the society also influences the amount of sexual freedom that remains…. A high-water mark has been reached in our Western Civilization…. As regards the sexually mature individual, the choice of an object is restricted to the opposite sex, and most extra-genital satisfactions are forbidden as perversions. The requirement, demonstrated in these prohibitions, that there be a single kind of sex life for everyone, disregards the dissimilarities, whether innate or acquired, in the sexual constitution of human beings. It cuts off a fair number of them from sexual enjoyment, and so becomes a source of serious injustice. (Freud, Civilization and Its Discontents, 1930)As Freud’s ideas gained popularity they gave rise to the notion that sexual repression is unhealthy and that morality is artificial. Such notions are at the root of the sexual revolution of the 1960’s, the sexual liberation movements as well as many of the ideas which determine the bias of sex education and school policy to this day. In a more general sense the pervasive influence of the popular concepts of Freud created a general climate in which it is easy for anyone to rationalize the immorality and infidelity which lead to teen pregnancy, and family breakdown.The Institutionalization of Secular Relativistic IdeasNow I would like to take a brief look at how these "modern" ideas have influenced the major institutions of 20th century America and have helped to create a moral and cultural climate which has contributed to the breakdown of the family in the last three decades of this century.A. The UniversityThe university has come to play a central role in 20th century America. Our teachers, our journalists, our policy makers, our lawyers, our writers, and our bureaucrats are all university educated. As emphasized earlier, the 20th century university has emphasized a scientific, empirical approach not only in the hard sciences but in the social sciences as well. University education has embraced the secular ideas of modernism. Whereas, in the 18th and 19th century our most important universities were founded initially as seminaries and theology was seen as the queen of the sciences, gradually the situation changed and the sciences and the social sciences became dominant with government funding for social and scientific research. University students learned to view the universe through a modernist viewpoint emphasizing relative values and man’s secular nature. Needless to say such ideas influenced their personal morality. Moreover, graduates have carried these ideas with them into their work in education, media, and public policy.B. The Public Education SystemJohn Dewey had a long career extending from the last decade of the 19th century through the first half of the 20th. According to John Westbrook, author of John Dewey and American Democracy:The consensus of opinion, including that of those critical of Dewey’s social philosophy, is that he was a major influence on the ideology of modern liberalism and that Deweyan pragmatism is the most articulate expression of the philosophical foundation of this ideology, an ideology that has dominated political and social intercourse in twentieth-century America.Dewey was especially influential in the field of education. As chairman of the department of philosophy, psychology and education at the University of Chicago from 1894 to 1904, he helped to found the famous Dewey School, a laboratory school designed to test and develop his psychological and educational theories. In 1904 he went to Columbia University where remained until his retirement in 1930. The Columbia Teachers College trained teachers for the United States and schools around the world and Dewey’s philosophy had a major impact on education. Expressing his pedagogic creed in 1897, Dewey declared: "I believe… the teacher is engaged, not simply in the training of individuals, but in the formation of the proper social life… that he is a social servant set apart for the maintenance of proper social order and the securing of the right social growth."Says Westbrook:Dewey’s conviction … reflected his belief that "education is the fundamental method of social progress and reform." There is a certain logic to this belief. Insofar as schools played an important part in the shaping of the character of a society’s children, they could if they were designed to do so, fundamentally transform the society. The school provided a relatively controlled environment in which the conditions of self-development could effectively shape its course. Indeed, if teachers did their job well, there would hardly be need of any other sort of reform. (John Dewey and American Democracy, p. 109)Inspired and guided by this mission, American public education in the 20th century became the vehicle for implementing and testing the latest social theories out of the secular academic world.http://www.tparents.org/Library/Unif...in/secular.htm

Here's the Christian perspective:This item is available on the Apologetics Press website at: http://www.apologeticspress.org/articles/3105AP Content :: In the NewsDestruction of Marriage Equals Destruction of Americaby Dave Miller, Ph.D.Since the God of the Bible exists (a fact that can be proven—see Flew and Warren, 1977), then the foundational building block of human civilization is the family as God designed it. He created one man for one woman for life (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:3-12; 1 Corinthians 7:1ff.). All deviations from that fundamental norm (e.g., polygamy, bigamy, and homosexuality) contribute to the breakdown of the ethical fabric of society. On the Day of Judgment, homosexuality and same-sex marriage surely will be pinpointed as one of the foremost culprits responsible for the dissolution of moral cohesion at this moment in American history. The militancy, arrogance, and unmitigated defiance that homosexual activists continue to manifest is astounding—and only underscores the absolute essentiality of those who embrace traditional American (i.e., Christian) values to rise up and oppose their efforts.Instances of the insane and suicidal determination to destroy society’s moral underpinnings are occurring with increasing frequency. One recent example involves a lesbian couple from Rhode Island. Though the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage in 2004, a law remains on the books there that prevents issuance of a license to out-of-state couples if their home state would refuse to recognize their marriage. The Rhode Island couple filed suit in Massachusetts in an effort to gain recognition of their “marriage” in Massachusetts which, in turn, they hope will enable them to gain recognition in their home state. The superior court has now ruled in favor of the couple (Cote-Whitacre v..., 2006).Similar pressure to conform to the politically correct agenda is seen in the widespread capitulation of America’s corporate community to threats, coercion, and intimidation by gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender activists. Though corporations have been targeted for many years, homosexual forces are stepping up their efforts to force corporations to include “sexual orientation” in their non-discrimination policies. To be “gay friendly” is defined as supporting transgender workers, offering “inclusive” health insurance and other benefits, requiring diversity training for employees, and spending advertising money with GLBT organizations (Unruh, 2006). In other words, force everyone to endorse (not merely tolerate) the homosexual lifestyle. Bully employees into silence by stifling all free speech that questions the morality of homosexuality.The success of the gay rights community along this line is alarming and heart-breaking. The Human Rights Campaign (HRC), the largest national homosexual political organization, reports an unprecedented 138 major U.S. corporations as having earned a top rating of 100% in their accommodation of alternative sexual lifestyles (“America’s Pro-Homosexual Giants...,” 2006). Some corporations quietly acquiesce. Others seem to jump on board the homosexual bandwagon with vigorous militancy. For example, Wal-Mart, the largest retailer in the world, has asserted its enthusiastic support of the gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender movement by initiating permission to join the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce, as well as sponsoring the LGBT Diversity Week at a state university (“Wal-Mart Asks for...,” 2006; “Boise State...,” 2006). Likewise, Ford Motor Company is pursuing the same flagrant conduct (“Boycott...,” 2006). So are Walgreens (Sharp, 2005), Starbucks (Kleppinger, 2005), and many others. With the intense pressure to submit to political correctness, it is surprising that some major corporations are thus far resisting the intimidation by remaining unwilling to sign onto the homosexual agenda, including Reebok, Northwest Airlines, The Men’s Wearhouse, J.C. Penney, Nissan, Gallup, Kroger, Cooper Tire, Circuit City, Radio Shack, and Toys “R” Us (Unruh, 2006).What is the ultimate outcome of this surrealistic inundation of America by outright paganism and moral depravity? What inevitably must happen to any country or society that enshrines morally deviant behavior by undermining the biblical definition of marriage? The social stability of that nation is placed in dire jeopardy. Its demise is inevitable (see Miller, 2005). Indeed, in 1848, the Supreme Court of South Carolina articulated the sentiment of the Founders and early Americans regarding what would happen to America if a sizeable portion of its citizenry ever abandoned Christian morality:What constitutes the standard of good morals? Is it not Christianity? There certainly is none other. Say that cannot be appealed to and...what would be good morals? The day of moral virtue in which we live would, in an instant, if that standard were abolished, lapse into the dark and murky night of pagan immorality (City Council of Charleston..., emp. added).The nation is headed swiftly in that direction. The destruction of marriage will inevitably result in the destruction of the nation.REFERENCES“America’s Pro-Homosexual Giants: 2006” (2006), WorldNetDaily, September 20, [On-line], URL: http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=52052.“Boise State University Recognizes LGBT Diversity Week with Series of Events” (2006), Boise State Office of Communications and Marketing News Release, September 25, [On-line], URL: http://news.boisestate.edu/newsrelea...iversity.shtml.“BoycottFord.com” (2006), American Family Association, [On-line], URL: http://www.boycottford.com/.City Council of Charleston v.

OK fine, this link doesn't specifically mention gays but it deals with the secularization of our Society and relies on the same arguments you use ad infinitum and shows how your precise reasoning is leading to our demise as the family unit is destroyed. And it isn't from a religious site. Here's an excerpt that outlines the damage done by secularism.America’s Schizophrenic CultureAmerica has developed a schizophrenic culture. On the one hand, we have attained unprecedented heights of material success and prosperity On the other hand, we have been unable to maintain a solid moral character, family stability, safe communities, and a harmonious and happy society. This contradiction is manifest in individual lives. We instill in our youth a strong desire for material success and prosperity yet we fail to teach the values that are necessary to build good character, strong families, and a harmonious society.A Vicious CycleThe moral compass of our society, the conscience, has been corrupted and a vicious cycle is being generated. Children born and raised in dysfunctional families in which they do not receive the love of parents necessary to instill the sense of value, empathy for others, self-discipline, and good character necessary for a healthy society are less likely to form lasting intimate relationships which develop into committed marriages and stable families. As this cycle expands, society’s problems multiply. If we are to renew American society, it is imperative that we break the cycle of family breakdown. In order to do this however, it is necessary to understand more about the cultural climate of 20th century America and to identify certain ideas which have suborned and weakened the power of the conscience in today’s society.Ideas Have ConsequencesIdeas have consequences. People act the way that they do because they think in certain ways, because they hold certain beliefs. This is true for individuals and it is also true for a society or culture. In the modern world, certain institutions - the universities, schools, the media and the entertainment industry - have a major influence in shaping our understanding of ourselves and the world. The ideas and images which are communicated not only influence the actions of individuals; they have a profound influence on public policy which in turn further affects our life and our decisions.Secular "Modern" IdeasTruth is truth. Ideally truth discovered by science and reason should be in agreement with truth revealed by religion and work in harmony to help create a healthy society in a prosperous and productive environment. In practice, however, this has not often been the case. A later lecture will contain a more full discussion of the development and relationship between secular thought, tracing it’s antecedents back to the Greek Hellenism, and sacred thought, which in our tradition have been based primarily upon the Bible.In this short presentation, there is not time to explore the tremendous social changes that have occurred in the past several hundred years and the complex interplay of secular and religious thought.

As these ideas have been propagated, people’s consciences have been weakened, and this has helped to create a climate in which the breakdown of the family has been occurring. I would like to pinpoint a number of these ideas and trace their development through some of our major institutions.The following ideas in combination have been particularly harmful:God, religion, and questions of morality are matters of personal opinion which have little or no relevance to social problems.Man is a highly evolved animal.There are no absolute standards; values are relative.The nuclear family is a product of social evolution and is just one of a number of possible forms of social organization.Societies problems can be solved by technology and the social sciences with a particular emphasis on the role of the state in social engineering.Traditional Religious BeliefsThis is in contrast to Judeo-Christian beliefs as well as other traditional cultures which have asserted that:There is a GodMan is a spiritual being who depends upon a relationship with the divine to discover and fulfill his purpose in lifeThere are universal and absolute moral principlesThe nuclear family is not only the central foundation for the transmission of social values but is a sacred institution protected by very clear standards of sexual morality.Erroneous Notions of ModernismIn the following remarks, I look at several thinkers who have had a profound influence on the 20th century.

The Columbia Teachers College trained teachers for the United States and schools around the world and Dewey’s philosophy had a major impact on education. Expressing his pedagogic creed in 1897, Dewey declared: "I believe… the teacher is engaged, not simply in the training of individuals, but in the formation of the proper social life… that he is a social servant set apart for the maintenance of proper social order and the securing of the right social growth."Says Westbrook:Dewey’s conviction … reflected his belief that "education is the fundamental method of social progress and reform." There is a certain logic to this belief. Insofar as schools played an important part in the shaping of the character of a society’s children, they could if they were designed to do so, fundamentally transform the society. The school provided a relatively controlled environment in which the conditions of self-development could effectively shape its course. Indeed, if teachers did their job well, there would hardly be need of any other sort of reform. (John Dewey and American Democracy, p. 109)Inspired and guided by this mission, American public education in the 20th century became the vehicle for implementing and testing the latest social theories out of the secular academic world.http://www.tparents.org/Library/Unif...in/secular.htm

And yet, that whole rant about states and corporations and various other businesses accepting gays as normal says absolutely not one emoticonXCensored thing to provide tangible evidence to prove your claim that : ("Gays) destroying the nuclear family, the American family, marriage, etc. " It doesn't even address anything, just moans and complains that places like Walmart and other stores are actually making policies that accept gays.

Here's the Christian perspective:This item is available on the Apologetics Press website at: http://www.apologeticspress.org/articles/3105AP Content :: In the NewsDestruction of Marriage Equals Destruction of Americaby Dave Miller, Ph.D.Since the God of the Bible exists (a fact that can be proven—see Flew and Warren, 1977), then the foundational building block of human civilization is the family as God designed it. He created one man for one woman for life (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:3-12; 1 Corinthians 7:1ff.). All deviations from that fundamental norm (e.g., polygamy, bigamy, and homosexuality) contribute to the breakdown of the ethical fabric of society. On the Day of Judgment, homosexuality and same-sex marriage surely will be pinpointed as one of the foremost culprits responsible for the dissolution of moral cohesion at this moment in American history. The militancy, arrogance, and unmitigated defiance that homosexual activists continue to manifest is astounding—and only underscores the absolute essentiality of those who embrace traditional American (i.e., Christian) values to rise up and oppose their efforts.Instances of the insane and suicidal determination to destroy society’s moral underpinnings are occurring with increasing frequency. One recent example involves a lesbian couple from Rhode Island. Though the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage in 2004, a law remains on the books there that prevents issuance of a license to out-of-state couples if their home state would refuse to recognize their marriage. The Rhode Island couple filed suit in Massachusetts in an effort to gain recognition of their “marriage” in Massachusetts which, in turn, they hope will enable them to gain recognition in their home state. The superior court has now ruled in favor of the couple (Cote-Whitacre v..., 2006).Similar pressure to conform to the politically correct agenda is seen in the widespread capitulation of America’s corporate community to threats, coercion, and intimidation by gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender activists. Though corporations have been targeted for many years, homosexual forces are stepping up their efforts to force corporations to include “sexual orientation” in their non-discrimination policies. To be “gay friendly” is defined as supporting transgender workers, offering “inclusive” health insurance and other benefits, requiring diversity training for employees, and spending advertising money with GLBT organizations (Unruh, 2006). In other words, force everyone to endorse (not merely tolerate) the homosexual lifestyle. Bully employees into silence by stifling all free speech that questions the morality of homosexuality.The success of the gay rights community along this line is alarming and heart-breaking. The Human Rights Campaign (HRC), the largest national homosexual political organization, reports an unprecedented 138 major U.S. corporations as having earned a top rating of 100% in their accommodation of alternative sexual lifestyles (“America’s Pro-Homosexual Giants...,” 2006). Some corporations quietly acquiesce. Others seem to jump on board the homosexual bandwagon with vigorous militancy. For example, Wal-Mart, the largest retailer in the world, has asserted its enthusiastic support of the gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender movement by initiating permission to join the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce, as well as sponsoring the LGBT Diversity Week at a state university (“Wal-Mart Asks for...,” 2006; “Boise State...,” 2006). Likewise, Ford Motor Company is pursuing the same flagrant conduct (“Boycott...,” 2006). So are Walgreens (Sharp, 2005), Starbucks (Kleppinger, 2005), and many others. With the intense pressure to submit to political correctness, it is surprising that some major corporations are thus far resisting the intimidation by remaining unwilling to sign onto the homosexual agenda, including Reebok, Northwest Airlines, The Men’s Wearhouse, J.C. Penney, Nissan, Gallup, Kroger, Cooper Tire, Circuit City, Radio Shack, and Toys “R” Us (Unruh, 2006).What is the ultimate outcome of this surrealistic inundation of America by outright paganism and moral depravity? What inevitably must happen to any country or society that enshrines morally deviant behavior by undermining the biblical definition of marriage? The social stability of that nation is placed in dire jeopardy. Its demise is inevitable (see Miller, 2005). Indeed, in 1848, the Supreme Court of South Carolina articulated the sentiment of the Founders and early Americans regarding what would happen to America if a sizeable portion of its citizenry ever abandoned Christian morality:What constitutes the standard of good morals? Is it not Christianity? There certainly is none other. Say that cannot be appealed to and...what would be good morals? The day of moral virtue in which we live would, in an instant, if that standard were abolished, lapse into the dark and murky night of pagan immorality (City Council of Charleston..., emp. added).The nation is headed swiftly in that direction. The destruction of marriage will inevitably result in the destruction of the nation.REFERENCES“America’s Pro-Homosexual Giants: 2006” (2006), WorldNetDaily, September 20, [On-line], URL: http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=52052.“Boise State University Recognizes LGBT Diversity Week with Series of Events” (2006), Boise State Office of Communications and Marketing News Release, September 25, [On-line], URL: http://news.boisestate.edu/newsrelea...iversity.shtml.“BoycottFord.com” (2006), American Family Association, [On-line], URL: http://www.boycottford.com/.City Council of Charleston v.

I've actually brought that up numerous times in the past, and the anti-gay "christians" tend to just ignore that. I will consider anti-gay "christians" to be absolute hypocrites until I see them begin to support constitutional amendments and laws that stop divorce, and prevent divorcees from remarrying. After all, divorce is actually something that Jesus talked about (he didn't even give a single mention to gays).

I agree that, all things considered, the idea that heterosexual marriage would be somehow damaged is a pretty poor and unfounded reason to oppose gay marriage. Even with the Kurtz article that Ohioprof brought up earlier, it's nothing more than circumstantial evidence.

Thank you Mr. Write for these two excellent statements.

The 3 sects of evangelical dominionismThere are three predominant sects (or movements) that propagate dominion theology which hold considerable influence over evangelicaldom.1. SPIRITUAL WARFARE PRAYER movement: The Kingdom of God must be advanced on Earth through hyper-spiritual “warfare” activities against the devil. A veritable supermarket of verbal and physical prayer techniques such as chanting, walks, and marches are employed in this effort. Believers are told their prayer power creates spiritual “canopies” over regions, preparing the way for “revival.” In this sense, prayer warfare is seen as preparatory work so that the other two movements can build the kingdom. Recently the contemplative prayer movement – which includes meditation, fasting, and labyrinths – has been brought into the spiritual warfare prayer “arsenal.” Prayer serves as a convenient decoy for covert operations. All three sects are utilizing massive statistical databanking resources (e.g., the World Prayer Center in Colorado Springs) and sophisticated psycho-social group manipulations to forge kingdom “transformation.” One key leader of this sect is Cindy Jacobs, who is closely associated with C. Peter Wagner (see below). Her website http://www.generals.org epitomizes the militant doctrines and practices of the spiritual warfare sect.Prayer before fightingOur calling is to be worshippers, warriors, and workers. We must first offer our lives as a living sacrifice in worship to God. From our worship will flow our intercession and warfare as we fight with weapons of righteousness in our right hand and in our left. Only after we have worshipped our God and fought the fight in the Spirit will we proceed to work in the harvest fields, advancing the Kingdom of God.8 [emphasis added]Promoting these prayer warfare activities are hyper-charismatics from the “signs and wonders” movement, which include self-anointed, self-appointed “apostles” and “prophets” who are preparing to govern the world through their “New Apostolic Reformation.” This dominionist sect is a direct offshoot of the Latter Rain cult (also known as Joel’s Army or Manifest Sons of God).9 Chief architect of this movement for the past two decades is C. Peter Wagner, President of Global Harvest Ministries and Chancellor of the Wagner Leadership Institute. His spiritual warfare teachings have been widely disseminated through mission networks such as AD 2000, which was closely associated with the Lausanne Movement. A prominent individual connected to this sect is Ted Haggard, current head of the National Association of Evangelicals.10The New Apostolic ReformationSince 2001, the body of Christ has been in the Second Apostolic Age. The apostolic/prophetic government of the church is now in place. . . . [W]e began to build our base by locating and identifying with the intercessory prayer movements. This time, however, we feel that God wants us to start governmentally, connecting with the apostles of the region. God has already raised up for us a key apostle in one of the strategic nations of the Middle East, and other apostles are already coming on board. Once we have the apostles in place, we will then bring the intercessors and the prophets into the inner circle, and we will end up with the spiritual core we need to move ahead for retaking the dominion that is rightfully ours.11 [emphasis added]C. Peter Wagner2. MISSION AS TRANSFORMATION movement: The words “revival,” “reformation” and “transformation” now carry embedded dominionist connotations. “Fulfilling the Great Commission” (Matthew 28:18-20) no longer means spreading the Gospel message by speaking the Word of salvation from the Bible. The dominionist focus is placed upon the phrase making disciples, with an incorrect exegesis that is disconcertingly compulsory. Traditional mission evangelism, done one-on-one using the Bible, is being replaced with a slew of “kingdom building” corporate activities for cities, regions and nations. The disingenuous phrase “bless the nations” is often used to conceal dominionism. Dr. Bill Bright of Campus Crusade for Christ International and Ralph Winter, founder of the U.S. Center for World Mission and editor of the Perspectives on the World Christian Movement curriculum (which has taught dominionism to an entire generation of missionaries), have been among the chief architects of this movement.12Dominionism supplants biblical evangelism“The Church must grow past the ‘Gospel of Salvation’ message and understand that it is only when we begin to implement the principles of the ‘Gospel of the kingdom’ that we will really begin to see change in lives and cities and nations. The Church has no understanding of this realm. . . The Church must grow up. . . . 13 [emphasis added]Dale Neill, president of ICCCBeyond Salvation“. . . God's concern goes beyond the salvation of individual people. His redemptive plan encompasses the healing and transformation of entire nations . . . . Nations are discipled as the church makes the invisible Kingdom visible by faithful obedience to God's Word throughout culture--in every area of life, and every realm of society including the family, the community, the arts, sciences, media, law, government, schools, or business. . . .”14 [emphasis added]Disciple the Nations3. PATRIOTIC AMERICAN movement: Patriotic dominionists, most of whom are not Reconstructionists, teach that political action will advance the kingdom of God in America. Using the vehicle of Christian media, they have taught evangelicals for the past three decades that America is a Christian nation and needs to return to its roots. Almost every evangelical in the pew has been influenced in one way or another by this sect. Patriotic dominionist leaders and their organizations have been closely interlocked financially and politically with the conservatives from the political Right. The secular conservatives purport to uphold morality, which appeals to evangelicals. The combined force of conservatives and evangelicals flexes its political muscles in Washington. One of its most powerful leaders is James Dobson of Focus on the Family. Patriotic dominionism was widely disseminated through the activities of Jay Grimstead, founder of Coalition on Revival (COR). From its earliest inception COR managed to successfully bring together key leaders from all three dominionist sects, including the Reconstructionists, to promote the most ruthless doctrines of dominionism.15Grimstead’s COR Steering Council letter, dated May 19931. The Kingdom of God was inaugurated and the King was installed and seated in the First Century A.D. and we need not wait for the King's second coming to get the Kingdom started here on earth.4. At this moment of history, all humans on earth, whether Jew or Gentile, believer or unbeliever, private person or public official, are obligated to bow their knees to this King Jesus, confess Him as Lord of the universe with their tongues, and submit to His lordship over every aspect of their lives in thought, word and deed.5. Biblical evangelism according to the Great Commission of Matt. 28:18-20 is not truly accomplished unless that message of Christ's lordship from point #4 above is given to the person being evangelized so that they know that an attempt at personal neutrality before King Jesus is sin and treason in this universe.16 [emphases added]

Or how about how the adoption of marriage by Christianity destroyed the original idea of marriage? You also have to remember that aside from the financials, the anti-gay marriage arguments are pretty not thought out. Who does more damage to marriage?

Gaetano:You feel that your fight against gay marriage is for the survival of the country, I see. And gay marriage is the sacrificial lamb that YOU have decided to offer the god which YOU feel has blessed us. Does this blessing include your right to discriminate against your fellow law abiding, tax paying citizens? I am convinced that the survival of this country would be complete and total adherance to those great documents you speak of. That would include gay people enjoying the same rights as straight people.

First, in order to be fair, let's post my whole passage as quoting just the part you did changes the meaning of what i actually said.We not only export products and technology from the USA, but possibly our largest export is our Pop Culture. As a small but very vocal segment of our population is calling for the legalization of gay marriage and the acceptance and normalization of the radical gay culture; and don't say it isn't happening because they are the most vocal and activist among you. You fail to acknowledge or concern yourselves with a whole Word surrounding us that still deems homosexuality as either a criminal offense, a disease, or a sin worthy of death.Look at China, the largest single population on Earth. I dare you to go to Beijing and proudly declare you are gay on a street corner. Or India and Pakistan which also have populations in excess of a billion people. Go to Malaysia or North Korea and be outwardly flamboyant and see what happens to your freedom of choice. Now let's hop over to virtually any Middle Eastern or Islamic Country you want to deal with. The out of the closet gay would be beheaded at noon in the market square as an infidel. We have just covered more than two thirds of the Worlds population who must hide their gayness in order to simply remain free of persecution or death. And there are more I haven't touched on. Now I'm not sanctioning the injustices that exist elsewhere but I'm pointing out how fair this Country has been in spite of the universally accepted unnaturalness and criminality the Homosexual act is viewed with.Personally speaking I believe that "Don't ask, Don't tell" is a bad joke on our Society and gays should be able to proudly serve in our military without being expected to hide their true identities. I would inject myself in a situation if I walked upon a gay or any minority being abused in any way by a bigot or a racist, and I did when I lived in the South and it happened. But my question to you all is why aren't your pro equal rights organizations fighting the powers that be around the World who hold down your brothers and sisters who must live in fear of being found out for who they really are, My questions are, why don't you worry about the homosexuals in the rest of the World and the abuses they suffer ? Their murders and torture. Their imprisonment in retraining camps that drives the effeminate mannerisms out of them in the more merciful Countries that don't just kill them as defectives ? rather than attempt to force the 95% of your fellow Americans who have supported all the laws to protect your 5% from civil and human rights abuses, who support fair employment and equal opportunity, to also accept gay marriage as normal when it defies our original definition of marriage because two gays have no hope of being able to reproduce naturally. We believe it will lead to the destruction of the traditional family and will completely tear down the core values that once existed in America. And based on the loss of respect to America by the rest of the World who condemns our current culture and lifestyle, it seems to be hurting us in ways we refuse to consider as of late. You all will say you love America and yet all you can see is what you want with no consideration at all for the effect it is and will have on the Country and culture you claim to love so much. I'm sure you've heard that with freedom comes responsibility. I believe that if we continue to shirk our responsibility as the most ethical Nation on Earth with the most enlightened Bill of Rights and Constitution known to man, then we will surely lose the freedoms outlined in those documents that have made us the Greatest Superpower that has ever existed.So please don't think my fight is based on some shallow hate filled desire to oppress others who disagree with my world view, my concern is for the survival of my Country which I believe has been blessed by God because of what we have stood for in spite of the sins of our youth as a Nation. He blessed us because of the inherent good in those documents that led us to right the wrongs that most other Nations still suffer under. I could go on but I've said enough for now.

The fact that someone is vocal means nothing. It does not make the person right or wrong. That's what I was saying. It's possible gay people have a reason to be vocal, because this is about our rights. I am sick of the argument about gays being "vocal" or "militant". Are we to be seen and not heard the way women or minorities were at one time regarded before they had rights and were fully included as equals in society? I don't think so.

NOt meaning to put to fine a point on things but this is a bit ridiculous. It is along the lines of "says you".I did not even read the rest of your post. Everyone, can we just stick to the issues? Stop all the personal bull?

You present A Christian perspective, not THE Christian perspective. Many Christians do not agree with you about many issues you raise, and specially about equal and fair treatment for gay people. Many Christians believe that supporting equality is not moral depravity; it is the right and Christian thing to do. When I read your posts, I see how differently I view the world around me from the way you view the world. I do not see the world in decline, particularly. I do not see families collapsing. I see a world filled with social problems, but it has long been filled with social problems. There was no golden age from which we are falling. Some people have always made declension arguments, claiming that morals have collapsed and our society is therefore falling apart. I was just reading a pamphlet from the early 19th century by a Christian reformer named Thomas Branagan who warned that morals had collapsed and society was falling apart. He blamed the failure to provide moral instruction to children for what he insisted was a broader social decline. Conservative Christian leaders in the antebellum period decried women giving anti-slavery speeches to mixed-sex audiences. They claimed that with their "promiscuous speeking," such women were destroying the family and undermining morality. But here we are nearly 180 years later, and we still have families, and society is still intact.I see the broad social changes that have taken place over the past century as mostly good. Women have more opportunities now than we did 100 years ago. African Americans and other minorities are no longer subject to repressive segregation laws or denial of their right to vote. Economic prosperity and access to higher education are available to a greater percentage of the population than they were 100 years ago. As for families, I do not see a decline. I see changes, specifically in the number of divorced parents and in the numbers of women with children working outside the home. Divorce is not a good thing, but religion does not appear to prevent it, as the rate of divorce is reportedly higher among conservative evangelical Christians than among atheists and more mainstream Christians. Blaming divorce on the "secularization" of the society makes little sense, because being Christian does not appear to innoculate couples from getting divorced. Whether women with children working is a good or a bad thing depends, I think, on the circumstances of the families we are considering. Perhaps it would be better for one parent to stay home with children when they are very small, but many parents simply cannot afford to do that. The problem for them is not "morals" or the "secularization" of the society; it's economic. Wages in many jobs are simply too low to support a family, and so both parents are forced to work to make ends meet. You make a leap, from your assumption that society's morals are in decline, which I think they are not, to blaming "secularization" of society for this supposed decline, and then to linking the movement for equality for gay people to the supposed moral decline and to secularization. I see no credible evidence that "secularization" has produced moral decline, and indeed, I do not see evidence for moral decline. I think we are no more in moral decline today than we were in the early 19th century or at any other time in our history. I see the movement for gay equality as an expression of what is good and moral about our society. It is a moral act to work for the full inclusion of all in the society and to treat everyone as equals. It is the moral position to support legal marriage for all of our families, for the protection of all children, not just the children of heterosexuals. To legalize same-sex marriage is a move to strengthen families, not to weaken them. The moral position is the position in favor of same-sex marriage. By legalizing same-sex marriage, we do not decline. Rather, we continue to improve, by extending justice and fairness to all.

Here's the Christian perspective:This item is available on the Apologetics Press website at: http://www.apologeticspress.org/articles/3105AP Content :: In the NewsDestruction of Marriage Equals Destruction of Americaby Dave Miller, Ph.D.Since the God of the Bible exists (a fact that can be proven—see Flew and Warren, 1977), then the foundational building block of human civilization is the family as God designed it. He created one man for one woman for life (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:3-12; 1 Corinthians 7:1ff.). All deviations from that fundamental norm (e.g., polygamy, bigamy, and homosexuality) contribute to the breakdown of the ethical fabric of society. On the Day of Judgment, homosexuality and same-sex marriage surely will be pinpointed as one of the foremost culprits responsible for the dissolution of moral cohesion at this moment in American history. The militancy, arrogance, and unmitigated defiance that homosexual activists continue to manifest is astounding—and only underscores the absolute essentiality of those who embrace traditional American (i.e., Christian) values to rise up and oppose their efforts.Instances of the insane and suicidal determination to destroy society’s moral underpinnings are occurring with increasing frequency. One recent example involves a lesbian couple from Rhode Island. Though the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage in 2004, a law remains on the books there that prevents issuance of a license to out-of-state couples if their home state would refuse to recognize their marriage. The Rhode Island couple filed suit in Massachusetts in an effort to gain recognition of their “marriage” in Massachusetts which, in turn, they hope will enable them to gain recognition in their home state. The superior court has now ruled in favor of the couple (Cote-Whitacre v..., 2006).Similar pressure to conform to the politically correct agenda is seen in the widespread capitulation of America’s corporate community to threats, coercion, and intimidation by gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender activists. Though corporations have been targeted for many years, homosexual forces are stepping up their efforts to force corporations to include “sexual orientation” in their non-discrimination policies. To be “gay friendly” is defined as supporting transgender workers, offering “inclusive” health insurance and other benefits, requiring diversity training for employees, and spending advertising money with GLBT organizations (Unruh, 2006). In other words, force everyone to endorse (not merely tolerate) the homosexual lifestyle. Bully employees into silence by stifling all free speech that questions the morality of homosexuality.The success of the gay rights community along this line is alarming and heart-breaking. The Human Rights Campaign (HRC), the largest national homosexual political organization, reports an unprecedented 138 major U.S. corporations as having earned a top rating of 100% in their accommodation of alternative sexual lifestyles (“America’s Pro-Homosexual Giants...,” 2006). Some corporations quietly acquiesce. Others seem to jump on board the homosexual bandwagon with vigorous militancy. For example, Wal-Mart, the largest retailer in the world, has asserted its enthusiastic support of the gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender movement by initiating permission to join the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce, as well as sponsoring the LGBT Diversity Week at a state university (“Wal-Mart Asks for...,” 2006; “Boise State...,” 2006). Likewise, Ford Motor Company is pursuing the same flagrant conduct (“Boycott...,” 2006). So are Walgreens (Sharp, 2005), Starbucks (Kleppinger, 2005), and many others. With the intense pressure to submit to political correctness, it is surprising that some major corporations are thus far resisting the intimidation by remaining unwilling to sign onto the homosexual agenda, including Reebok, Northwest Airlines, The Men’s Wearhouse, J.C. Penney, Nissan, Gallup, Kroger, Cooper Tire, Circuit City, Radio Shack, and Toys “R” Us (Unruh, 2006).What is the ultimate outcome of this surrealistic inundation of America by outright paganism and moral depravity? What inevitably must happen to any country or society that enshrines morally deviant behavior by undermining the biblical definition of marriage? The social stability of that nation is placed in dire jeopardy. Its demise is inevitable (see Miller, 2005). Indeed, in 1848, the Supreme Court of South Carolina articulated the sentiment of the Founders and early Americans regarding what would happen to America if a sizeable portion of its citizenry ever abandoned Christian morality:What constitutes the standard of good morals? Is it not Christianity? There certainly is none other. Say that cannot be appealed to and...what would be good morals? The day of moral virtue in which we live would, in an instant, if that standard were abolished, lapse into the dark and murky night of pagan immorality (City Council of Charleston..., emp. added).The nation is headed swiftly in that direction. The destruction of marriage will inevitably result in the destruction of the nation.REFERENCES“America’s Pro-Homosexual Giants: 2006” (2006), WorldNetDaily, September 20, [On-line], URL: http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=52052.“Boise State University Recognizes LGBT Diversity Week with Series of Events” (2006), Boise State Office of Communications and Marketing News Release, September 25, [On-line], URL: http://news.boisestate.edu/newsrelea...iversity.shtml.“BoycottFord.com” (2006), American Family Association, [On-line], URL: http://www.boycottford.com/.City Council of Charleston v.

@OhioprofGood post.It amazes me that some people want to turn the clock back to some Golden Age, but for one they can not identify this Golden Age. I would not trade this time we live in for any other age, we have mass employment, people live longer, Women and minorities have their right protected under the law and we have amazing technology. Of course I am talking about the Western World, the majority of the World still live in grinding poverty.For all Archangel's rants about Secularization he doesn't realize how lucky he is that he lives in a Secular Country. His right to practices his religion is protected under the Law, he is not forced to convert to the majority religion or the official state religion. I wonder what the other option he would advocate other than a Secular Society ? A Theocracy ?

The 3 sects of evangelical dominionismThere are three predominant sects (or movements) that propagate dominion theology which hold considerable influence over evangelicaldom.1. SPIRITUAL WARFARE PRAYER movement: The Kingdom of God must be advanced on Earth through hyper-spiritual “warfare” activities against the devil. A veritable supermarket of verbal and physical prayer techniques such as chanting, walks, and marches are employed in this effort. Believers are told their prayer power creates spiritual “canopies” over regions, preparing the way for “revival.” In this sense, prayer warfare is seen as preparatory work so that the other two movements can build the kingdom. Recently the contemplative prayer movement – which includes meditation, fasting, and labyrinths – has been brought into the spiritual warfare prayer “arsenal.” Prayer serves as a convenient decoy for covert operations. All three sects are utilizing massive statistical databanking resources (e.g., the World Prayer Center in Colorado Springs) and sophisticated psycho-social group manipulations to forge kingdom “transformation.” One key leader of this sect is Cindy Jacobs, who is closely associated with C. Peter Wagner (see below). Her website http://www.generals.org epitomizes the militant doctrines and practices of the spiritual warfare sect.Prayer before fightingOur calling is to be worshippers, warriors, and workers. We must first offer our lives as a living sacrifice in worship to God. From our worship will flow our intercession and warfare as we fight with weapons of righteousness in our right hand and in our left. Only after we have worshipped our God and fought the fight in the Spirit will we proceed to work in the harvest fields, advancing the Kingdom of God.8 [emphasis added]Promoting these prayer warfare activities are hyper-charismatics from the “signs and wonders” movement, which include self-anointed, self-appointed “apostles” and “prophets” who are preparing to govern the world through their “New Apostolic Reformation.” This dominionist sect is a direct offshoot of the Latter Rain cult (also known as Joel’s Army or Manifest Sons of God).9 Chief architect of this movement for the past two decades is C. Peter Wagner, President of Global Harvest Ministries and Chancellor of the Wagner Leadership Institute. His spiritual warfare teachings have been widely disseminated through mission networks such as AD 2000, which was closely associated with the Lausanne Movement. A prominent individual connected to this sect is Ted Haggard, current head of the National Association of Evangelicals.10The New Apostolic ReformationSince 2001, the body of Christ has been in the Second Apostolic Age. The apostolic/prophetic government of the church is now in place. . . . [W]e began to build our base by locating and identifying with the intercessory prayer movements. This time, however, we feel that God wants us to start governmentally, connecting with the apostles of the region. God has already raised up for us a key apostle in one of the strategic nations of the Middle East, and other apostles are already coming on board. Once we have the apostles in place, we will then bring the intercessors and the prophets into the inner circle, and we will end up with the spiritual core we need to move ahead for retaking the dominion that is rightfully ours.11 [emphasis added]C. Peter Wagner2. MISSION AS TRANSFORMATION movement: The words “revival,” “reformation” and “transformation” now carry embedded dominionist connotations. “Fulfilling the Great Commission” (Matthew 28:18-20) no longer means spreading the Gospel message by speaking the Word of salvation from the Bible. The dominionist focus is placed upon the phrase making disciples, with an incorrect exegesis that is disconcertingly compulsory. Traditional mission evangelism, done one-on-one using the Bible, is being replaced with a slew of “kingdom building” corporate activities for cities, regions and nations. The disingenuous phrase “bless the nations” is often used to conceal dominionism. Dr. Bill Bright of Campus Crusade for Christ International and Ralph Winter, founder of the U.S. Center for World Mission and editor of the Perspectives on the World Christian Movement curriculum (which has taught dominionism to an entire generation of missionaries), have been among the chief architects of this movement.12Dominionism supplants biblical evangelism“The Church must grow past the ‘Gospel of Salvation’ message and understand that it is only when we begin to implement the principles of the ‘Gospel of the kingdom’ that we will really begin to see change in lives and cities and nations. The Church has no understanding of this realm. . . The Church must grow up. . . . 13 [emphasis added]Dale Neill, president of ICCCBeyond Salvation“. . . God's concern goes beyond the salvation of individual people. His redemptive plan encompasses the healing and transformation of entire nations . . . . Nations are discipled as the church makes the invisible Kingdom visible by faithful obedience to God's Word throughout culture--in every area of life, and every realm of society including the family, the community, the arts, sciences, media, law, government, schools, or business. . . .”14 [emphasis added]Disciple the Nations3. PATRIOTIC AMERICAN movement: Patriotic dominionists, most of whom are not Reconstructionists, teach that political action will advance the kingdom of God in America. Using the vehicle of Christian media, they have taught evangelicals for the past three decades that America is a Christian nation and needs to return to its roots. Almost every evangelical in the pew has been influenced in one way or another by this sect. Patriotic dominionist leaders and their organizations have been closely interlocked financially and politically with the conservatives from the political Right. The secular conservatives purport to uphold morality, which appeals to evangelicals. The combined force of conservatives and evangelicals flexes its political muscles in Washington. One of its most powerful leaders is James Dobson of Focus on the Family. Patriotic dominionism was widely disseminated through the activities of Jay Grimstead, founder of Coalition on Revival (COR). From its earliest inception COR managed to successfully bring together key leaders from all three dominionist sects, including the Reconstructionists, to promote the most ruthless doctrines of dominionism.15Grimstead’s COR Steering Council letter, dated May 19931. The Kingdom of God was inaugurated and the King was installed and seated in the First Century A.D. and we need not wait for the King's second coming to get the Kingdom started here on earth.4. At this moment of history, all humans on earth, whether Jew or Gentile, believer or unbeliever, private person or public official, are obligated to bow their knees to this King Jesus, confess Him as Lord of the universe with their tongues, and submit to His lordship over every aspect of their lives in thought, word and deed.5. Biblical evangelism according to the Great Commission of Matt. 28:18-20 is not truly accomplished unless that message of Christ's lordship from point #4 above is given to the person being evangelized so that they know that an attempt at personal neutrality before King Jesus is sin and treason in this universe.16 [emphases added]

Secularism is the response to the many Evils that have been committed by man in the name of religion. For once you're right about me being a 'Leftist' but this is not about my political persuasion, Secularism is supported by a lot more people than just Left wingers, there are plenty of Right Wingers, Conservatives and Christians that support Secularism.

I always find it astounding that anyone looks up to Patrick Henry as an example of liberty and Christian good will. This is a man who kept his ailing wife a prisoner in her own home (she was thought to have become 'hysterical' after the birth of her umpteenth child - this is a term that applied to any and all women who displayed a sense of independence). During this time, it is believed that one of his slaves ran the house. After her death, he removed all traces of her, forbid anyone to speak of her, and married his daughter's best friend. A true shining example of colonial Christianity!

OK fine, this link doesn't specifically mention gays but it deals with the secularization of our Society and relies on the same arguments you use ad infinitum and shows how your precise reasoning is leading to our demise as the family unit is destroyed. And it isn't from a religious site. Here's an excerpt that outlines the damage done by secularism.America’s Schizophrenic CultureAmerica has developed a schizophrenic culture. On the one hand, we have attained unprecedented heights of material success and prosperity On the other hand, we have been unable to maintain a solid moral character, family stability, safe communities, and a harmonious and happy society. This contradiction is manifest in individual lives. We instill in our youth a strong desire for material success and prosperity yet we fail to teach the values that are necessary to build good character, strong families, and a harmonious society.A Vicious CycleThe moral compass of our society, the conscience, has been corrupted and a vicious cycle is being generated. Children born and raised in dysfunctional families in which they do not receive the love of parents necessary to instill the sense of value, empathy for others, self-discipline, and good character necessary for a healthy society are less likely to form lasting intimate relationships which develop into committed marriages and stable families. As this cycle expands, society’s problems multiply. If we are to renew American society, it is imperative that we break the cycle of family breakdown. In order to do this however, it is necessary to understand more about the cultural climate of 20th century America and to identify certain ideas which have suborned and weakened the power of the conscience in today’s society.Ideas Have ConsequencesIdeas have consequences. People act the way that they do because they think in certain ways, because they hold certain beliefs. This is true for individuals and it is also true for a society or culture. In the modern world, certain institutions - the universities, schools, the media and the entertainment industry - have a major influence in shaping our understanding of ourselves and the world. The ideas and images which are communicated not only influence the actions of individuals; they have a profound influence on public policy which in turn further affects our life and our decisions.Secular "Modern" IdeasTruth is truth. Ideally truth discovered by science and reason should be in agreement with truth revealed by religion and work in harmony to help create a healthy society in a prosperous and productive environment. In practice, however, this has not often been the case. A later lecture will contain a more full discussion of the development and relationship between secular thought, tracing it’s antecedents back to the Greek Hellenism, and sacred thought, which in our tradition have been based primarily upon the Bible.In this short presentation, there is not time to explore the tremendous social changes that have occurred in the past several hundred years and the complex interplay of secular and religious thought. For our purposes, I will simply say that building on the thought of the Enlightenment and inspired by the rapid development of science, many thinkers in the 19th century rejected the authenticity of divine revelation and called into question basic principles of Judeo-Christian culture. Based upon 19th century conceptions of science, a number of thinkers with a secular bias sought to develop a modern scientific conception of man and the universe. In the process of this development, several ideas were expounded which have contributed to modern man’s separation from God, and confused our comprehension of basic moral truths. As these ideas have been propagated, people’s consciences have been weakened, and this has helped to create a climate in which the breakdown of the family has been occurring. I would like to pinpoint a number of these ideas and trace their development through some of our major institutions.The following ideas in combination have been particularly harmful:God, religion, and questions of morality are matters of personal opinion which have little or no relevance to social problems.Man is a highly evolved animal.There are no absolute standards; values are relative.The nuclear family is a product of social evolution and is just one of a number of possible forms of social organization.Societies problems can be solved by technology and the social sciences with a particular emphasis on the role of the state in social engineering.Traditional Religious BeliefsThis is in contrast to Judeo-Christian beliefs as well as other traditional cultures which have asserted that:There is a GodMan is a spiritual being who depends upon a relationship with the divine to discover and fulfill his purpose in lifeThere are universal and absolute moral principlesThe nuclear family is not only the central foundation for the transmission of social values but is a sacred institution protected by very clear standards of sexual morality.Erroneous Notions of ModernismIn the following remarks, I look at several thinkers who have had a profound influence on the 20th century. Let me clarify that I am not attacking them personally, I am not pretending to give a systematic presentation of their philosophy, and I am not saying that they that they were evil or totally wrong in all of their views. What I would like to do is look at the impact that some of their ideas had - how those ideas have been popularly received by the culture - and how they contributed to and gave currency to the notions mentioned above.A. God, religion, and questions of morality are matters of personal opinion which have little or no relevance to social problems.Auguste Comte who lived in France from 1798 to 1857 was the father of Positivism and the founder of the Sociology. Positivism maintains that the only way that verifiable truth can be ascertained is through the empirical methods of science. Because statements of a religious, moral or metaphysical nature can not be verified, they are not objective truths. Though they may have emotional value, they are opinion rather than scientific truth. Comte proposed that scientific methods should be used to study society and human behavior and for this purpose he founded sociology. The founding of sociology was followed by the establishment of several other disciplines of social science such as anthropology, psychology, political science, and the development of social statistics. The principles of positivism also influenced the study of history, law, and philosophy. In fact, the social sciences played a major role in the development of the 20th century university. As the university became the central institution for training the leadership of modern America, the social sciences with their positivistic bias became the wellspring of the progressive movement and the modern liberal state. The army of bureaucrats who man numerous administrative agencies of the modern state are evidence of the legacy of positivism. For you legislators, the next time a representative of a government agency testifies before your committee with a barrage of social statistics, say a little thank you to Auguste.B. Man as Animal: Evolution as a Result of Random MutationsThe publication of Charles Darwin’s Origin of Species in 1859 was a second milestone in the development of the modernist viewpoint. Darwin’s theory that evolution takes place through a process of natural selection based upon random genetic mutations not only suggested that man is merely a physical animal. His emphasis on the random nature of genetic mutation implies that there is no inherent order to the universe and no creative design. If evolution is determined by chance, then some other form of life could just as easily have developed to a position of ascendancy. Science can explain the ascent of man better than religion. There is no need for belief in God to explain man’s existence. Indeed, God, morality, and religion each can be viewed as mere creations of the human mind. As man’s brain evolved to the point that he developed intelligence and the capability of abstract thought, man created religion in his attempt to explain natural phenomena. God didn’t create man; man created God.C. Relative ValuesIn Thus Spoke Zarathustra, written by Friedrich Nietzsche between 1883 and 1885, Zarathustra proclaimsBefore God! But now this god has died. You higher men, this god was your greatest danger. It is only since he lies in his tomb that you have been resurrected. Only now the great noon comes; only now the higher man becomes lord.Have you understood this word. O my brothers? You are startled? Do your hearts become giddy? Does the abyss yawn before you? Does the hellhound howl at you? Well then you higher men! Only now is the mountain of man’s future in labor. God died: now we want the overman to live. (translation by Walter Kaufman)Nietzsche was announcing the demise of traditional values and moral restraints of Christian society and the potential for powerful creative individuals to create their own values freed from the restraints of "the morality of the herd." As Alan Bloom states in his book Closing the American Mind:Values are not discovered by reason, and it is useless to seek them, to find the truth or the good life. The quest begun by Odysseus and continued for over three thousand millennia has come to an end with the observation that there is nothing to seek. This alleged fact was announced by Nietzsche just over a century ago when he said, "God is dead." Good and evil now appear for the first time as values, of which there have been a thousand and one, none rationally or objectively preferable to one another. (p. 143)Once man is deprived man of a standard of value based on faith in divine revelation, reason itself is incapable of defining any absolute standard of value. Bloom describes in his book how the concept of relative values became extremely influential in American universities after World War II.D. The Nature and Role of Human SexualityIn his clinical work with women suffering from hysteria, Sigmund Freud discovered that sexual frustration seemed to be the common cause of their neuroses. In time, Freud developed a theory of personality emphasizing the determining power of unconscious sexual drives. The central principle of the personality is the pleasure principle. The unconscious id or libido is the dominant factor in the human psyche and its strongest impulse is the desire for sexual gratification. The ego, or consciousness is the rational faculty which seeks to adapt the needs of the id to its environment. The superego, which we would generally identify as the conscience, is the composite of parental taboos and rewards which are imbedded in our in our formative years. In the case of Western civilization, the monogamous family as a social institution is a culturally derived attempt of a patriarchal society to control sexuality. Strict monogamy can cause sexual repression and thus give rise to individual and social neuroses. Religion itself is a creation of the unconscious mind, an "illusion", similar to a neuroses, which is generated by the unconscious to reinforce the predominant social mores. In other words, a patriarchal society creates a Father God to replace the father figure of childhood and maintain the control of the superego.Here is a representative quote form one of Freud’s later and most widely read works:The tendency on the part of civilization to restrict sexual life is no less clear than its tendency to expand the cultural unit. Its first, totemic, phase already brings with it the prohibition against an incestuous choice of object, and this is perhaps the most drastic mutilation which man’s erotic life has in all time experienced. Taboos, laws, customs impose further restrictions, which affect both men and women. Not all civilizations go equally far in this; and the economic structure of the society also influences the amount of sexual freedom that remains…. A high-water mark has been reached in our Western Civilization…. As regards the sexually mature individual, the choice of an object is restricted to the opposite sex, and most extra-genital satisfactions are forbidden as perversions. The requirement, demonstrated in these prohibitions, that there be a single kind of sex life for everyone, disregards the dissimilarities, whether innate or acquired, in the sexual constitution of human beings. It cuts off a fair number of them from sexual enjoyment, and so becomes a source of serious injustice. (Freud, Civilization and Its Discontents, 1930)As Freud’s ideas gained popularity they gave rise to the notion that sexual repression is unhealthy and that morality is artificial. Such notions are at the root of the sexual revolution of the 1960’s, the sexual liberation movements as well as many of the ideas which determine the bias of sex education and school policy to this day. In a more general sense the pervasive influence of the popular concepts of Freud created a general climate in which it is easy for anyone to rationalize the immorality and infidelity which lead to teen pregnancy, and family breakdown.The Institutionalization of Secular Relativistic IdeasNow I would like to take a brief look at how these "modern" ideas have influenced the major institutions of 20th century America and have helped to create a moral and cultural climate which has contributed to the breakdown of the family in the last three decades of this century.A. The UniversityThe university has come to play a central role in 20th century America. Our teachers, our journalists, our policy makers, our lawyers, our writers, and our bureaucrats are all university educated. As emphasized earlier, the 20th century university has emphasized a scientific, empirical approach not only in the hard sciences but in the social sciences as well. University education has embraced the secular ideas of modernism. Whereas, in the 18th and 19th century our most important universities were founded initially as seminaries and theology was seen as the queen of the sciences, gradually the situation changed and the sciences and the social sciences became dominant with government funding for social and scientific research. University students learned to view the universe through a modernist viewpoint emphasizing relative values and man’s secular nature. Needless to say such ideas influenced their personal morality. Moreover, graduates have carried these ideas with them into their work in education, media, and public policy.B. The Public Education SystemJohn Dewey had a long career extending from the last decade of the 19th century through the first half of the 20th. According to John Westbrook, author of John Dewey and American Democracy:The consensus of opinion, including that of those critical of Dewey’s social philosophy, is that he was a major influence on the ideology of modern liberalism and that Deweyan pragmatism is the most articulate expression of the philosophical foundation of this ideology, an ideology that has dominated political and social intercourse in twentieth-century America.Dewey was especially influential in the field of education. As chairman of the department of philosophy, psychology and education at the University of Chicago from 1894 to 1904, he helped to found the famous Dewey School, a laboratory school designed to test and develop his psychological and educational theories. In 1904 he went to Columbia University where remained until his retirement in 1930. The Columbia Teachers College trained teachers for the United States and schools around the world and Dewey’s philosophy had a major impact on education. Expressing his pedagogic creed in 1897, Dewey declared: "I believe… the teacher is engaged, not simply in the training of individuals, but in the formation of the proper social life… that he is a social servant set apart for the maintenance of proper social order and the securing of the right social growth."Says Westbrook:Dewey’s conviction … reflected his belief that "education is the fundamental method of social progress and reform." There is a certain logic to this belief. Insofar as schools played an important part in the shaping of the character of a society’s children, they could if they were designed to do so, fundamentally transform the society. The school provided a relatively controlled environment in which the conditions of self-development could effectively shape its course. Indeed, if teachers did their job well, there would hardly be need of any other sort of reform. (John Dewey and American Democracy, p. 109)Inspired and guided by this mission, American public education in the 20th century became the vehicle for implementing and testing the latest social theories out of the secular academic world.http://www.tparents.org/Library/Unif...in/secular.htm

Nonsense. Dominionism is real. Many of the fascist christianist are members whose objective is to make America a Christian Theocracy. Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell, James Dobson, Antony Scalia, Opes Dei are part of the conspiracy. That you won't believe it just belies your ignorance. Ignorance probably connected to your hate and religion.

The only decent anti-gay marriage argument is in the financials. We can't let them get married because we need their tax money. Every other argument is religious without any evidence. Does it bother you that some people value their marriage based on the marriages of other people? That's kind of screwed up. My marriage is terrible because Bob down the street got married to Bill? Yeah......no. Furthermore, you don't see people like Arch says that celebrities who get married for stunts aren't ruining marriage. You'd THINK that a high profile person who treats marriage as a way to get a comeback would do more damage then the quiet gay couple down the street who mind their own business and are good neighbors. The people who say that gays would ruin marriage are those who WANT gays to ruin marriage. The only person that can devalue marriage are those who want to devalue it. Gays shouldn't be allowed to get married because the Grand Pomba says "dem gays are evils."hhaahha.

If marriage is under attack, it had nothing to do with gays, but everything to do with heterosexual behavior, infidelity, divorce. They have only themselves to blame.

For the MonitorApr 27, 2007There is nothing more frightening than the marriage of state and religion. The framers and founders were painfully aware of this and took steps to avert such a dangerous union.Persons such as Mr. Lull ("My Turn," Monitor, April 24) would have the near-omnipotent power of government given the moral authority of the church (theirs, of course) to oppress those who believe differently from them. What really scares them?Since I can not fathom how giving others the same rights and privileges that I enjoy threatens me or my marriage, I can only assume they feel their status is somehow threatened.How sad. I can only imagine how low their self-esteem must be. Perhaps counseling would help.For those of you with slightly less fragile egos, this issue is not dissimilar from other divisive civil rights issues of the past. Chicken Little and his followers were wrong then, and they are wrong now. The sky is right where it has always been.One does not choose to be born black, female or gay.All you really need to do is examine your circle of friends and family and ask yourself a simple question. Would you tolerate any one of them being denied the rights and privileges you enjoy because of how they were born, or to whom? Because of the color of their skin or gender?One hopes your answer would be of course not.

Apr 27, 2007To Pastor Greg Lull ("My Turn," Monitor April 23): Your rallying of the troops against civil unions comes across as dropping the bomb on Luxembourg.You invoke the Christmas tiff in Hillsboro: a local matter, soon resolved by the good citizens, and with no bearing on civil unions. You are alarmed at the words of militant homosexuals from 1969, who were mad as hell and weren't going to take it anymore, as if they speak for your neighbors today who just want the same rights you enjoy.You are entitled to believe that the Holiness Code of Ancient Israel and the correspondence of Paul of Tarsus are the literal, inerrant Words of God - a belief that not all your fellow citizens, or even all your fellow Christians, share. Your belief does not entitle you to discriminate against those who differ from you. In our great country, not even an alleged majority is empowered to do that.This issue is not a war, Pastor. You of all people should know the power of words. To equate the desire to visit committed partners on their deathbeds with the carnage in Iraq, or a nuclear strike on the foundations of society, is tasteless hyperbole.Your side doesn't have to win. Why not use your bully pulpit to work toward a society where all are winners?

I think it's sad that we live in a country where everyone (no matter your race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or socio-economic status) are techically afforded the same rights, but who do not actually have the same rights. That is, if you're an American citizen. Undoubtedly, it's discriminating against gay/lesbians to not allow them to marry. This is just another example of how influential religious beliefs can have upon a legal issue. Hell, I know there are plenty of heterosexual couples in our society that should not have been allowed to get married, particularly those who have married 3 or 4 times. However, I believe this will always be a debatable and prominent issue in our society, just like racism. Although it's wonderful that we can freely speak our mind and form our own opinion in this country, that liberty is often misused when people form ignorant opinions without having done their homework first.

What are you talking about?! Gay marriage has been legalized in a couple of states already. You should have checked that out before replying here. I think its like 4 states, I think Arizonia is one of them. Ones who want to marry go to these states and marry. Thats what I'm talking about. And because it was stated that the child issuse is off-topic. I did not look at your link, and will not respond according to that topic.

We have been on this planet since the begining(Biblical or otherwise). Get the hell over it! For the Chrisians according to your faith God created us and God doesn't make junk. Maybe we are a lesson in your journey? Your "Marriage" holds too many pagan customs and symbols(rings/veils/hand binding,etc) for you to even think of holding a monopoly on the custom of marriage.
