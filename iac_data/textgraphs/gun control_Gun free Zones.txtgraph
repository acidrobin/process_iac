Gun free Zones

Simply naming an area a gun free zone does not make it a gun free zone. If it is truely to be a gun free zone, the law must be enforced. To enforce the law, you must provide a means of security / controlled access to the zone, to screen for and prevent guns from entering the zone. If the law is enforced, the gun free zone will work.

An example of this would be an airplane for the most part. The laws are strictly enforce although they can still be beaten. However instances of this actually occurring in a way that puts people in danger are few and far between. So yes it can work but it takes incredible measures to make it work.

It appears the safety Nazis feel gun free zones should be ran like prisons. Maybe the safety Nazis should take a field trip to their states prison system and ask the guards if guns or any other weapons ever make it into the prisons. Prisons are considered gun and drug free zones. If this was true then how can an inmate get shot by a gun in prison?

I think that JustAnotherGuy realizes that gun free zones work on a small level when there is a sufficient amount of effort put into upholding these laws. I'm sure you also know that the laws necessary to create these gun free zones will intrude on your right to privacy and lessen the amount of freedoms you have. So the long and short of the matter is that gun free zones can work on a small level and should be used in specific cases but to try and get them to work on larger levels would be very difficult.

You need to go to a prison and ask the prison officials if there are weapons in the gun free zones of prisons. As pointed out drugs and guns made it onto an airplane because criminals can place them on airplanes any time they want to.Gun free zones do not work because criminals will not obey them!

No I don't . I want children (at least my children and family) to be placed in a school where they do not have to worry about one of their classmates pulling out a tech 9 and going on a rampage in the library. I don't think that is too much to ask. I think eliminating the risk of this makes a school a much more effective place to learn. How many people do you think actually learned anything at Columbine the day they came back to school, or perhaps were they a little distracted. I'm all for the government giving you and like-minded extremists your own school (hell, even your own state...why not) and letting you all carry guns into schools and every other place you want to. As long as when a gunfight breaks out at your school in Rottencrotch Nebraska, I don't have to see all the parents on TV crying and bawling about how could this tragedy happen here, and saying that something should have been done, this never should have happened. I think there is a time and place for guns, but I don't think that guns belong in schools.

Please demonstrate to us how running your gun free school would be different from how a prison is operated. You stated you wanted a fence with locked gates around the school. You wanted everybody searched before they entered school. You wanted all items searched before they entered school. This is how they operate prisons. Drugs and guns still make it into prisons. Let us not forget the airplane with the drugs and guns on it after all of the passengers were searched for weapons.

So you want to run the schools like prison! Are you going to put armed tower guards around the school grounds? Not only does this sound like a prison, it sounds like that thing in Berlin. Berlin Wall a device used to keep people in. It also had armed guard towers. So to keep guns out of a gun free zone you would insist on a police force using guns to do this.

That was an answer I was waiting for. I really thought that it was only in Texas and a few other places were concealed guns are allowed.

Yes, it is illegal. For the most part, the "gun free zones" is a propoganda campaign so EVERYBODY knows that you can't carry guns in schools and airports. Otherwise you end up with people going "well, I didn't know I couldn't take my .44 to school....."Currently, there are 36 states that allow concealed carry, and there is popular concealed carry legislation pending in 6 others. For all the anti gunners propoganda and doctored numbers, crime has decreased in ever state that has allowed concealed carry without exception.The reasons we have so many armed criminals in America is a subect for much debate. We could put up an entire forum JUST dedicated to this. It is sometimes difficult for people from other countries to understand why Americans are overwhelmingly pro-gun. There actaully is a reason that many of us feelw e need to be armed to the teeth. As Tastyfish pointed out, british gangs are lightweights compared to the guys we have running around. All things considered, our police are pretty worthless (we have one of the lowest conviction rates in the western world) and our government seems to be pretty impotent when it comes to dealing with domestic law enforcement.

How many criminals really go to a school to commit a crime because they are worried about armed citizens? This is going a little too far. The gun free zones at schools were enacted in response to school shootings. While I will admit that this is kind of an odd paradox (like the guy who is getting ready to shoot up a school is going to stop because he doesn't want to commit a class 3 non person felony by taking a gun into a gun free zone), at least the intent of these laws was not specifically to chisel away at our rigts. I can honestly sy I think te folks that instituted this honestly believed they were protecting kids.I think there should be an exemption for teachers and administrators, though. IT makes me wonder how many columbines we have to have before the liberals start going "gee, his american history teacher could have popped him in the first 15 seconds and this XXXX wouldn't have happened".

States and municipalities have varying laws concerning the bearing of guns. Check it out for yourself. I'm just stating what I believe to be true:Mississippi has a gun slinger law that allows any non-felon to carry a gun. That doesn't mean they can carry one into the courthouse. In the old West, almost everyone "slung iron", but there were places that they had to check their guns at the door.In some places, you can carry a concealed weapon, in others, you cannot.In Kennesaw, Georgia, the law says every home must have a gun inside. (The crime rate is well below average there.)Establishment of gun-free-zones is not in conflict with our right to bear arms. There are places where the presence of guns is detrimental to the safety of people due to the emotional instability of other people who may have a gun within reach.Legally owned guns should be "checked at the door" or left at home when a person enters a designated gun-free-zone. Law abiding people will have no problem with this. It is the criminals who will object.When guns are outlawed, only criminals will have guns. emoticonXHoho

Hehe...the fact that carrying a gun would make you a criminal makes that statement a bit redundant.... But anyhow.In essance it is a place where it is illegal to carry guns, right?By using your logic, violence free zones (places where violence is illegal) would be pointless as it:1: would not prevent individuals from comitting violence. Not even in prison-like conditions can you prevent 100% of the violence (as evidently, people are violent in prisons as well)2: Violent free zones are zones where law abiding citizens ar forbidden to use violence because law abiding citizens obey the law about violent free zones.

Here maybe this may appease you.WASHINGTON, D.C. (Oct. 29, '98) -- The nation was horrified when 16-year-old Luke Woodham walked into his Pearl, Mississippi, High School with a .30-30 hunting rifle, shot to death his ex- girlfriend and her close friend, then shot and wounded seven other students. Then the nation learned Woodham had stabbed his mother to death earlier that morning. Then the nation learned that the local prosecutor had charged six more students with having conspired in the killings as part of a Satanic plot. What most of the nation never learned was that Assistant Principal Joel Myrick, using his own gun, stopped the killer as he tried to flee the school. The news media virtually ignored the fact that an armed citizen had possibly prevented more bloodshed -- using a gun possessed in violation of the Federal Gun-Free School Act, which prohibits firearms within 1,000 feet of a school. To find out what happened I talked to the school's principal, Roy Balantine. Mr. Balantine said when he heard the shots he ran into the hall and "saw a kid with a gun," then immediately called 911. Mr. Myrick, he said, was in his office on the opposite side of a "commons" that the school surrounds. Myrick also had run into the hall and seen a student with a rifle; he shoved several students into his office and locked the door, then ran toward the shooting. He saw Woodham shoot and wound one of the students -- and Woodham saw him, so Myrick jumped back out of the line of sight. That's when, Mr. Woodham told me, "Mr. Myrick remembered that he had been out to visit his parents over the weekend, and that he remembered that he had forgotten to take his gun out of his pickup. "So Mr. Myrick ran across the commons and out the back door and got the gun, and loaded it, then came around the side of the building." At that point, Mr. Balantine said, he saw the student pull out of the school parking lot and pull up behind a car that was stopped at a stop sign. As Myrick ran toward the car, Woodham pulled around the stopped car, but spun out and off the road. Before he could get the car going again, Myrick was there with the .45 pointed in Woodham's face, demanding "Why did you do that?" That's when Woodham "instantly became a coward," Myrick had told one local reporter. Woodham must have feared that Myrick would shoot him for he stammered, so Mr. Balantine told me, "Oh, Mr. Myrick; I'm the one who gave you the discount on the pizza last week." Myrick got Woodham out of the car, made him lie on the ground, pulled his coat over his head and kept one foot on his back until police arrived. Woodham's rifle was in the car, and he still had 30 rounds. "With all that ammunition, we don't know what he might have done," Mr. Balantine told me. "We don't know if he would've gone to the junior high or the pizza parlor where he worked, or what. There's reason to believe he might not've been through killing." "I'm just thankful that Mr. Myrick had the presence of mind to remember his gun and bring it all to a stop." Amen, Mr. Balantine. Police and local reporters are convinced that Woodham was a member of a satanic cult that had been ritually sacrificing animals and planning killings before fleeing to Mexico. But predictably, there's a bit of a flap in Mississippi about the "terrible fact" that this vice principal had a gun at school, and that he was violating the gun-free school law (which the Supreme Court struck down but Congress reinstated last year). Under Mississippi law he could legally have a gun in his car. I'm thankful he had it, and asked Mr. Balantine to thank him for me and those of us who admire his courage -- and for setting a clear example of a gun being used to save lives. Further, I told him, if the U.S. Attorney or anyone else wants to give Mr. Myrick any legal troubles, to give me a call and I'd be delighted to start a defense fund.

You brought up the example, I did not. My initial statement to you was "if you say so, sure". In other words, I have no knowledge of this case. I responded to it as if it was true...that does not mean that it is. Then you asked if I could provide specific details about it. If I do not have any knowledge if the case, how would I know the details. So, since you mentioned the case, I asked you to provide some information on it...you know, some factual proof. Now, do you by chance have any or not? Or should nobody take anything you say as credible?

Here maybe this may appease you.WASHINGTON, D.C. (Oct. 29, '98) -- The nation was horrified when 16-year-old Luke Woodham walked into his Pearl, Mississippi, High School with a .30-30 hunting rifle, shot to death his ex- girlfriend and her close friend, then shot and wounded seven other students. Then the nation learned Woodham had stabbed his mother to death earlier that morning. Then the nation learned that the local prosecutor had charged six more students with having conspired in the killings as part of a Satanic plot. What most of the nation never learned was that Assistant Principal Joel Myrick, using his own gun, stopped the killer as he tried to flee the school. The news media virtually ignored the fact that an armed citizen had possibly prevented more bloodshed -- using a gun possessed in violation of the Federal Gun-Free School Act, which prohibits firearms within 1,000 feet of a school. To find out what happened I talked to the school's principal, Roy Balantine. Mr. Balantine said when he heard the shots he ran into the hall and "saw a kid with a gun," then immediately called 911. Mr. Myrick, he said, was in his office on the opposite side of a "commons" that the school surrounds. Myrick also had run into the hall and seen a student with a rifle; he shoved several students into his office and locked the door, then ran toward the shooting.

The principal had to run out to his vehicle to get his gun. I guess like unarmed airline passengers you would have unarmed principals attack criminals armed with a gun. By the time the principal got his gun the criminal was leaving. No one knows if he was still going to kill others or not.The criminal had more ammunition and was attempting to leave and do what no one knows.The gun free zone did one thing, it stopped law-abiding citizens from having guns near enough to them to prevent these killings. The gun free zone did not stop the criminal from carrying a gun onto campus and kill people with it.Once again proving that only law-abiding citizens obey gun free zones. While criminals do not obey gun free zones.

The fact that the criminal carried a gun into the school and the principal did not demonstrate who obeys the gun free zones. The principal had to run out to his vehicle after hearing the shots from the criminals. Unarmed law-abiding citizens at gun free zones will always be at the mercy of criminals until the police are summoned. While waiting for the police to come the criminals will be able to kill as many people as they want to.Criminals do not obey gun free zones!

As I have explained many times before Rev, putting up a sign does nothing more than notify people that it is a gun free zone. It only works if it is enforced by security. It is like the apartment community I used to live in. There was a sign out at the entrance that stated no soliciting...however I would continuously find flyers on my car or taped to my door for restaurants and the like. Now, I live in a gated community that has a sign posted stating no soliciting. Because there is someone controlling access to the community, I no longer get any flyers. I know it is a simple example, but it relates very well.

My idea would be:Metal detectors and security.This wouldn´t prevent school shootings as such but at least the maniacs couldn´t reach the inside that easy.It also isn´t a nice imagination to have guarded school entrances but if necessary then it has to be done.

Yes and there also should be someone to watch out for people trying to get inside the school in a irregular way.This again wouldn´t be guaranteed safety but a first step.And if you´d start installing metal detectors you would certainly take care about any entrances that might be used to cheat the detectors.

As there won´t be armed guards in class rooms and it is about safety, I think children can differ from prison to school.Criminals don´t obey laws.But it will be a lot harder for them to take their guns to school and the average thug might consider to not take his gun with him at all.School criminals (and I am not talking about something like Littleton) would commit less crimes at schools because they can´t threat others with guns anymore.It is surely easier to get an armed criminal into a school if it is not a gun-free zone or would you even deny this?

As far as I am concerned, if it takes walls, fences, guards, x-ray machines, metal detectors etc... to keep my children safe at school, so be it. I would rather my children learn in an environment like this than die in a place like Littleton at the hands of 2 deranged sociopathic killers who got picked on too much. I think security measures such as controlled access, and simple screening can make a world of difference in cases such as these, and as The Comedian suggests, it will make two bit thugs a little more apt to think before they walk into a school with a 30/30 in their arms. These seem like common sense items to me...and I suspect The Comedian thinks so as well. I guess there are just those who lack common sense in this world.

The security measures don´t look threatening to kids too imo. Airports got detectors and guards, policemen are walking the streets armed.If you also explain to the kids why there are these things they maybe felt even better. The ones that felt worse would be the big tough guys messing around normally.

The real test would be to ask the kids form Littleton, Jonesboro and other places how they feel about security in our schools. Then ask the parents who send their children to these schools how they feel about it. We can all sit here and deabte about it all day. It is easy to do when you have not been personally affected by one of these incidents.

This is a dangerous assumption jito. How do you know that there are no guns at your 9 y/o's school? Does anyone assure that guns are not brought in, or do you just assume that because it is against the rules and you have not heard of a case that it is not happening.Littleton and Jonesboro were not schools with significant violence or gang problems. Most of these school shootings are occuring at suburban or rural schools with no known history of gun problems in the past. This type of attitude is dangerous. It is the "it can't happen in this town, not here" attitude. Many people in Jonesboro felt the same way until 2 people were killed and 7 injured in their quiet little school. Irrelevant. You do not have to own a weapon to pick it up and kill someone with it. These shootings are still going on despite the children not owning the weapons.

We are not debating why these criminals decided to enter their schools with guns and shoot people. We are debating on how to prevent these criminals from getting into the schools carrying guns. While the problem of kids being bullied and ostracised can contribute to the reasons some of these kids decide to shoot their classmates, this is not the debate. I do agree that at risk kids need to be identified and assessed as to the level of threat they provide, and the behavior that causes them to be bullied and ostracised cannot be tolerated. But again, that is a subject for another post. You propose to abolish gun free zones, and allow people to carry guns into schools. Do you honestly think that some of these kids will care knowing that a teacher or the principle might be armed? Can you assure me that someone will be present to stop a shooting before it begins? Even in the case you presented before, you stated that the principle heard the shooting, then came running out and saw the gunman. By this point, people have been shot. The problem with your method is that for someone to notice that there is a shooting taking place, shots must be fired first in most cases. So in your opinion it is better to let a few people die first, then get into a gunfight with the shooter perhaps after he has some hostages. My (and I think The Comedians) contention is that if you prevent guns from entering the school, you eliminate the possibility of this at all. Common sense goes a long way...which do you think is better?

Littleton would have happened at a gun-free school too. The guys wanted to kill and just that. They had started firing even with the army close-by.What sundowner and I (I think he feels similar) are trying to explain:If you were a thug (not a killer) and used to bring a gun to school because nobody cared and you felt better with it and could threat others, would you still take it with you if you could be arrested for just smuggling it into a school? You are not allowed to smoke in several places. Go protest.Is it impossible to restrict a right in certain cases (and in that case it would only be restricted in a certain area) to protect others lives?

Littleton would have happened at a gun-free school too. The guys wanted to kill and just that. They had started firing even with the army close-by.What sundowner and I (I think he feels similar) are trying to explain:If you were a thug (not a killer) and used to bring a gun to school because nobody cared and you felt better with it and could threat others, would you still take it with you if you could be arrested for just smuggling it into a school? You are not allowed to smoke in several places. Go protest.Is it impossible to restrict a right in certain cases (and in that case it would only be restricted in a certain area) to protect others lives?

Of yourse they don´t obey laws (hey, you took that one over from sundowner and me :p).But the thugs I was talking about would maybe worry quite well about a possible arrest. Once arrested, police might be interested in the background of the guy they just captured smuggling a gun into a school.Even for criminals there is a cost/effect ratio.Do read recent posts?Detectors, security,...

Sundowner, I think you have misunderstood the intent of my post. There may be guns getting snuck into my son's school (although I hope not), and gun violence can happen anywhere. I totally agree.I am actually responding to JustAnotherGuy's idea that my son's (or even that many) gun-free schools employ the use of metal detectors, fences and what-not. I am saying that his school is "gun-free" (by the rules), but most certainly does not operate as a prison.

This is a dangerous assumption jito. How do you know that there are no guns at your 9 y/o's school? Does anyone assure that guns are not brought in, or do you just assume that because it is against the rules and you have not heard of a case that it is not happening.Littleton and Jonesboro were not schools with significant violence or gang problems. Most of these school shootings are occuring at suburban or rural schools with no known history of gun problems in the past. This type of attitude is dangerous. It is the "it can't happen in this town, not here" attitude. Many people in Jonesboro felt the same way until 2 people were killed and 7 injured in their quiet little school. Irrelevant. You do not have to own a weapon to pick it up and kill someone with it. These shootings are still going on despite the children not owning the weapons.

Read the law books again. Children do not have the right to own or carry weapons.This is just funny. Of course they worry about going to jail. They don't care about the law, but the idea is to not get caught.

Children are not the only people in gun free zones. So this shoots your argument down!If criminals were worried about getting caught, they would not be breaking the law. This why gun free zones will only affect aw-abiding citizens.

Your son's school does use these devices? That is great. That is what I have been saying all along, that every school needs to employ this type of security. Let me ask you, have they found any guns or knives at any of the screening points in his school that you know of? And also let me ask, do you feel that your son is safer in this school, than a school where anyone can carry a gun into it unchallenged if they wish? And does your son complain about his school being a prison, or is he happy with the security measures?

The confusion was shared then. Yes, I agree, other educational issues need to be addressed along with the issue of safety. Then from my first post to you, my question was do you just trust that these rules keep guns out, or is it that nobody has yet been caught with a gun? JustAnotherGuy likes to repeat catch phrases over and over stating that criminals will not obey gun free zones...and only law abiding citizens obey gun free zones. This is something so basic and fundamental that I would assume this is understood. I certainly do not think this constitutes a basis for an argument though. He contends that by employing security measures we are denying people of their constitutional rights. Although repeated requests have been made for him to tell us how he would prevent school shootings...he has not provided any ideas. The only thing he can even remotely come close with is saying that people could defend themselves with guns if they were attacked. But it still leaves schools open to becoming shooting galleries...at least until one of these armed people can respond and kill the shooter. (Unless the shooter by that point has hostage/s. Likely then the rescuer would create more problems than he solves with his gun). But it is all still after the fact. Chances are someone has already been shot before an armed citizen is responding to the situation. But in his mind, a few dead innocent school children are acceptable as long as we do not violate peoples constitutional rights and treat them like "criminals". I contend that with simple security measures we can keep all guns out of schools, and eliminate the threat all together. Sorry for misunderstanding you.

You should call one of your local state prisons and ask them why they employ such measures. Could it be for the SAFETY of the guards and the inmates? And one other point. Criminals go to prison to be punished. Children go to school to learn. Prisoners stay in prison, school children go home in the afternoon. You want to know what the difference is...there's a big start. So it could be stated that yes, they would have security measures in common, for the purpose of safety. You don't like safety?

Criminals go to prison to be punished. Part of that punishment is being suspected of violating prison rules. To do this, prisoners are forced to pass through metal detectors, the prisoner’s body’s are searched, and all of their belongings are searched. If your school is doing this to keep kids from bringing guns to school then they are operating the school like a prison.If I recall there is still a drug problem on school grounds. Kids and teachers are still being attacked at schools. And every so often you hear of a gun being on campus. How is treating every person entering a school campus as criminals preventing the crime?Once again criminals do not obey laws pertaining to gun free zones!

But that is not the punishment in prison. The punishment is not being able to leave. Losing freedom. People can come and go from schools at will, even ones with security devices in place.Security isn't punishment, your argument doesn't hold.Not to mention it still does not address the fact that kids can't have guns anyway.

The weak argument is treating every person entering a school as a criminal. This will not stop the criminals from taking guns into a school. The criminals will simply go around the security measures. The law-abiding citizens that are treated like criminal will be the unarmed people when armed criminals enter school campus.The fact that kids cannot have guns? Well the only kids that will obey that law will be the law-abiding kids. This will mean that the criminals will be the only armed people on school campuses.Now since you people are having problems understanding what a prison is I will once explain it to you.A prison is a compound with a fence completely around it. This fence will have few gates. These gates will have metal detectors and armed staff to operate the metal detectors. Since some of the people defending these security measures have also stated they want armed patrols. This means a armed uniformed person will patrol the fence line. Now how is your security measures around a school not like a prison? Yes you did say the kids and adults entering a school campus can go and come.

But are you also the one saying that treating innocent people as criminals is wrong? So how is it that you expect authorities to treat these 2 as criminals and punish them before they committed their crime? Again, it comes down to simple logic that if someone had stopped these kids at the door, they would have never gotten into the school and killed 13 people.

Nobody ever disputed the fact that criminals do not obey the laws. This is a no-brainer for most of us here. We know it, we accept it, you don't need to keep saying it. This is why they are called criminals. Instead of saying it over and over, why not state how it applies to the argument. As I have said, only with enforcement can we make gun free zones effective.

I just wrote the short version of something I posted too often.One of my points pro gun-free zones is, that nowadays the "average thug" can go to school armed wothout anyone trying to prevent it. So he is quite a threat as soon as he starts to bully someone or wants someone´s money.With gun-controls at the school entrance, these guys would think twice about being armed at school imho. Why should they risk to get arrested for just bringing in a gun? Further investigations by the police could follow and other crimes might get discovered. So he risks a trip to jail just because he carried a gun in school.He really might think about keeping his little crimes out on the streets.

If I may interject a comment or two here, Comedian, I would suggest a few things. First, the no guns free school zones were a kneejerk reaction to a series of events that really had nothing to do with the 'average thug', though in all honesty, I'm not sure exactly what an average thug is. I gather, and please inform me if I'm wrong, an 'average thug' is what normally we would call a bully or a bully and his band of co-bullies. These kinds of people are about extortion, intimidation, and coercion. The rash of school shootings in the nineties were about fear, hate, being bullied, rejection, feelings of inadequacies, ect. The handful, and statistically the stats are almost insignificent, of instances of school shootings were the result of a system that encourages peer pressure, ridicule of students, and an attempt at payback of the offending person or persons. Remember the incident when the assistant school principal ran to his car, parked away from the school zone, retrieved his pistol, went back and held the perp at bay until the cops could arrive? Another incident is the case at Columbine. The security guard, to the best of my knowlege was armed, but ran when the murderers started shooting. Any good person with a firearm could probably defused the incident and some may not have died. By the time the cops got there, it basically was all over. No, the 'average thug/s' are not the ones we're talking about here. Someone determined to wreak havoc in a school, or anyplace else, will not let simple things like detectors or 'no gun zone signs' stop him/her. An armed teacher or two just may very well do so.

I just wrote the short version of something I posted too often.One of my points pro gun-free zones is, that nowadays the "average thug" can go to school armed wothout anyone trying to prevent it. So he is quite a threat as soon as he starts to bully someone or wants someone´s money.With gun-controls at the school entrance, these guys would think twice about being armed at school imho. Why should they risk to get arrested for just bringing in a gun? Further investigations by the police could follow and other crimes might get discovered. So he risks a trip to jail just because he carried a gun in school.He really might think about keeping his little crimes out on the streets.

I used the term "average thug" because I don´t know how to call them else. I was talking about small-class criminals whose crimes are theft, blackmail and such. These crimes are easier to commit with a weapon in hand imo.School shootings like in Littleton couldn´t have been prevented in a gun-free school. Those kids were out to kill as much people as possible. But they hadn´t been able to enter the school cafeteria and classrooms because their guns would have been detected at the entrance.So a shooting would certainly had started but maybe it would have cost less lives.Also note that I am aware that it would need a few trained securities at the entrances who would act if necessary. And they could certainly provide more safety than an armed teacher (apart from the chilling thought of an armed teacher in general).

If I may interject a comment or two here, Comedian, I would suggest a few things. First, the no guns free school zones were a kneejerk reaction to a series of events that really had nothing to do with the 'average thug', though in all honesty, I'm not sure exactly what an average thug is. I gather, and please inform me if I'm wrong, an 'average thug' is what normally we would call a bully or a bully and his band of co-bullies. These kinds of people are about extortion, intimidation, and coercion. The rash of school shootings in the nineties were about fear, hate, being bullied, rejection, feelings of inadequacies, ect. The handful, and statistically the stats are almost insignificent, of instances of school shootings were the result of a system that encourages peer pressure, ridicule of students, and an attempt at payback of the offending person or persons. Remember the incident when the assistant school principal ran to his car, parked away from the school zone, retrieved his pistol, went back and held the perp at bay until the cops could arrive? Another incident is the case at Columbine. The security guard, to the best of my knowlege was armed, but ran when the murderers started shooting. Any good person with a firearm could probably defused the incident and some may not have died. By the time the cops got there, it basically was all over.

Someone determined to wreak havoc in a school, or anyplace else, will not let simple things like detectors or 'no gun zone signs' stop him/her. An armed teacher or two just may very well do so.

I guess what I am not understanding is why your "average thug" would want to go to a school in the first place. There isn't really anything there they woudl want to steal, high scholl kids don;t really have any money to speak of, or at least don;t carry it around with them if they DO have some money, so why would they be there in the first place? I don;t think crime in our schools is nearly as big a problem as a lot of people make it out to be. Yes, there is some drug dealing that goes on there. Big deal. Stataistically, most of the school shootings fall into the lyttleton category, somebody decides to kill a bunch of people. A school is a pretty good choice if you want ot kill a bunch of people, because there is not likely to be much resistance. If you post security men at the doors and metal detectors, you have just picked the first two victims. Unless, of course, you want the security men to be armed. IF you want them armed, why not let law abiding citizens who have passed a background check, a firearms safety check, and a marksmanship test carry their guns?

Generally, the goal of the gun-free zones is to limit the number of guns. That is why the security guards would, but others would not.

He goes there because he his a pupil.And being armed makes trouble makers feel stronger and meaner.I am not American so maybe I assume some situation that is not true.But isn´t violence in general, not big news stories like murder, a problem in schools in big cities? And wouldn´t it therefore be good to keep the violence as low as possible?Encouraging pupils to spend their free time learning how to shoot because this makes their school life safer would be a capitulation to violence imo. ;)And armed security men would be slightly different to cops or security men seen at other locations; and just because their are the only persons who are legally allowed to carry guns at the place they get some automatic authority as well.

Ahhh, a misconception.Violence in schools is not a problem in the US. YOu are more likely to be struck by lightning than to be injured due to violence in an American school. Unfortunatly, the anti gunners like to use example of the few times that there are violent episodes in our schools to push their agenda. I think that they most likely sit at home with their fingers crossed just waiting for columbine type massacres so they can rally the american public and get stupid laws passed. Beyond the standard schoolyard bully who might beat you up and steal your lunch money (whihc I use because it is a cliche, not because it really seems to be a problem), there IS NOT PROBLEM with school violence in America, just a bunch of media fueled hype.THe problem comes when you get somebody who pops their top and decides to go on a killing spree. These people are not going to stop because the metal detector has beeped, especially if they have just shot and killed the guy who is manning the metal detector. Then you have a situaion where somebody is loose in a school, intent on murdering as many people as possible. I think it is foolish to pass laws that effectively bar the only tool that might make a real difference in stopping a killing spree cold.

Those kinds of criminals are not the kind to shoot a school up like that. Basically they're cowards and want to live another day to enjoy the fruits of their behaviour.Comedian, you're smarter than this. Once they have committed to killing, why worry about detectors at the entrance to the cafeteria and classrooms. It's doubtful if they would have been there anyway. ( detectors )Remember, those two kids had planned on using homemade explosives to kill even more, as well as causing immense damage to the school.How many? Ten? Fifteen?The cost would be prohibitive.Why? How? The armed guard turned tail and ran, leaving the school, kids, and teachers, to the perps mercy. If only 3 or 4 of the teachers had been armed and trained, the chances are very few, if any, would have died. Does a teacher become less qualified to teach because he/she is armed? Would they not have a vested interest in trying to diffuse the incident. The two perps were cowards.

Is it better to force them to start a potential killing spree outside of the school or should they be able to sneak in with all of their guns?It takes less to secure an airport check-in. ;)And you spend 1 billion per day on your military. A few millions to get safer schools should be left somewhere.The guard doesn´t stand for all others out there. And no one can tell you that an armed teacher wouldn´t run away from two killers as well.And although I might be wrong about the violence issue, I still think that the gun-free zone at schools would show people that this place is about learning and that we are better nowadays than just shooting to solve problems.A decrease in safety would certainly be not the case.

Outside is not where they care to do the killing, but suppose as in the case where the two did stay outside and cut them down, where is the detectors, armed guards, and everything else that supposedly deters them.

Hell, any kind of firepower against those bastards would probably have pinned them down. Possibly, but several armed and trained teachers, on the scene, working together, would more than likely hold the day.

A Littleton incident cannot be prevented when the killers are already on their way to kill.I already said so.At the entrances.Call me pigheaded on this but I still think that a school is a wrong place for guns and weapons in general.Sorry, I think I expressed myself wrong.I meant to say that this guard was a bad example as it is obviously not a guard´s job to run away.Do you want a teachers militia to secure schools? Their main concern should be to educate, nót to observe the scene.Pupils that can legally go to school armed still frighten me in some way. There are always too many XXXXXX who like to show off and injure someone with a weapon.So they have at least done a bit of good?;)

Comedian, I had written a nice epistle regarding the post last evening. Alas and alack, due to this wonderful Compaq choosing that moment to 'do the hangups', I had to abort the mission, and was just too tired to do it again. I'll try to hit the high points.AgreedSee above.[quote]Call me pigheaded on this but I still think that a school is a wrong place for guns and weapons in general.[quote]Okay, you're pigheaded! Lol! There, does that make you feel better?That's okay. We all are woefully lacking, at times, to express ourselves correctly. No Problem. BTW, we agree.99.99 % of the time, they would be teaching. It would probably never be necessary to ever do otherwise, but this asks a question. If your child was in a school such as Columbine when the **** hit the fan, would you have been glad there was a teacher or teachers present, armed, but not to the knowlege of the perps, that were willing to place themselves in danger to protect your kid/s? To me, it's a no brainer, but hey, that's just me.The chances are your fears are groundless. Kids use to be able to take firearms to school and never killed anyone by doing stupid things. They can't even take a pocketknife to school any longer. Someone will bitch and raise hell about it.Is this truly a fear, or are you attempting to transfer what you may do, in like circumstances, to others. I have two grandsons I would trust implicitly to take firearms to school. They both have been taught and know what a firearm is capable of. I worry much more about them driving.:pNot from how I see it.

Imo the police should be the ones that use force, teachers not.Difference is again that I believe that a school should be weapon-free per se. But I admit that I cannot really back this up with a safety argument. Not after some of you serious posters told me that violence doesn´t seem to be such an issue in the US (although I still think that situations at big high schools in big cities like LA or Chicago might be different). I think when you teach them about proper gun care, you are looking after their driving skills as well. ;)I also think that they are the positive example. How many kids really get a decent lesson or more about gun use?But it is the difference in cultures again.I think I can sum it up: We got a situation that isn´t too much of a problem (school violence). To prevent any from happening, you say that everything is fine the way it is, you just don´t have a real proof due to the lack of violence(now THAT sounds weird). Same goes for me, but due to my background I think that we should also take this situation as a chance to change people´s mentality. And were better to start than in school?Btw: May I ask about your age?Matter of opinion. But so it is for me.:)

Oh yessss! If I never own another Compaq, it'll be too soon.No, I don't have problems with cultural differences. I guess what truly amazes me, though, is the over reaction by do gooders in general to situations that are reallt extreme anomalies, and have this mistaken idea they can save the world by outlawing this, that, or the other. It somewhat amazes me as well, that when the Brits take a dump, the Canadians and Aussies think they must too. It seems more aki to the world empire syndrome, the Brits use to have.Pardon my questioning this statement, but I see little comparison between trashmen, who are charged with keeping the trash cans safe, and teachers, charged with keeping their students safe.Uh huh. Brings to mind the old saying, 'where are the cops when you need them the most?'There is a certain amount of violence in all schools, to a degree, and I admit that, but it doesn't take the form of a vendetta killing, so much, as at Columbine. But, in my opinion, this is the very reason some teachers should be armed. The anomalies will arise and transpire and the cops damned sure can't be everywhere at once.Maybe in the abstract, but not in dealing with reality. A pistol or rifle round deals with so much energy measured usually by velocity and foot pounds of energy. A kid, especially a kid that hunts or possibly target shoots, or even just 'plinks' at tin cans, can see a certain amount of damage that a bullet can do. Very few will ever equate that with a much more deadly force of a 3000 pound projectile traveling at a high rate of speed and generating a hell of a lot more energy.Then possibly it's time to start doing this in the very schools we are talking about with training beginning at a very young age and graduating into actual firearm competitions by middle school and high school.There is violence, but really not the type that generates national media coverage as the anomalies of school shootings do. The Pols then don't think they have to APPEAR to be doing something positive, trying to generate votes or publicity for bigger and better political positions.Yeah, you can ask. I so old, dirt was named after me. Actually I'm 68!

I don't either, but I believe the truly good teachers, given proper counseling, could overcome their problems. Even if thet, couldn't, I believe mostgood teachers would consider it sacrifice well paid.Youth and its encompassing blessings, never think it can happen to them. They are almost invincible.You would think so, but my experience says it's not so. traffic accidents are usually treated by the media in a locale, but unless a massive one, very seldom mentioned on national TV, whereas a school shooting like Columbine is news for days or weeks. The fallout from Columbine is still making waves.Absolutely. That nasty old NRA has a program they usually will present to the lowest grades free of charge, but the GGs are so afraid of proslytizing, on the part of the NRA, they, in many instances, kill the program before it gets started.Should it be?I understand the quandry, but not the reasoning.Almost all of the major legislation passed by our congresscritters in the last seventy years has been to kneejerk reactions to a percieved problem concerning firearms. The true can be said to a large extent about the Brits. :pAs I told my doctor, I've got a 25 year old mind stuck in a 68 year old body. Growing old ain't for sissies. :p :p :p :p

If the attitude towards guns and crime is 'liberal' (I mean guns are regarded as nothing special) that is maybe a possible way.It is sad but I think everyone has to agree here.But does everday gun crime make good headlines? I think that most of the crime issues are covered by the Media with equal attention as traffic accidents; means: the more dead, the higher the quote, thus more cameras and reporters (dirty vampires...).The Columbine fallout isn´t much of a surprise too me because it was just too much of it. A few dead get forgotten quite fast but a massacre like this, and such a Media hype as it happened, will be remembered for many years if not decades. And if not abused in either way this doesn´t have to be bad.Maybe they should simply create a new office or install a new part in an existing one to calm people down.But maybe this is just a too easy suggestion from a foreigner. ;)Let them offer shooting as a sports course but don´t force them to take these course in addition to the gun-safety subject.If they feel the need to learn more, they will enlist on their own.I wanted to say that it is hard for me to admit that a bit pro-gun could do some good.But I didn´t understand the word 'quandry' so maybe my reply makes no sense.We got a big freak out about dog laws in Germany (yes, you read correctly) after a so-called fighting dog (I don´t know if this is the right term in English) attacked and killed a child.Of course it was a terrible incident but the result in laws did nothing to better the situation but confused lots of people (as well as it costed a bit).I think your concern about gun laws is similar. But not every gun law has to be wrong and unneccessary.I think I´ll find out soon enough. ;)

I don't either, but I believe the truly good teachers, given proper counseling, could overcome their problems. Even if thet, couldn't, I believe mostgood teachers would consider it sacrifice well paid.Youth and its encompassing blessings, never think it can happen to them. They are almost invincible.You would think so, but my experience says it's not so. traffic accidents are usually treated by the media in a locale, but unless a massive one, very seldom mentioned on national TV, whereas a school shooting like Columbine is news for days or weeks. The fallout from Columbine is still making waves.Absolutely. That nasty old NRA has a program they usually will present to the lowest grades free of charge, but the GGs are so afraid of proslytizing, on the part of the NRA, they, in many instances, kill the program before it gets started.Should it be?I understand the quandry, but not the reasoning.Almost all of the major legislation passed by our congresscritters in the last seventy years has been to kneejerk reactions to a percieved problem concerning firearms. The true can be said to a large extent about the Brits. :pAs I told my doctor, I've got a 25 year old mind stuck in a 68 year old body. Growing old ain't for sissies. :p :p :p :p

In effect, there is nothing special about firearms. What is special is the right of every free man to be armed. Not the tool, but the right.I've skipped a lot, as I don't believe we're too far apart on some things. Give me a month with you down here in my baliwick, I'll turn you into a gun lover.:pI'm not too sure I follow this.[As long as the programs are offered, I don't have a problem with this.My bad, the word should have been quandary; a state of perplexity or doubt. Predicament, dilemma, or plight.We've got that problem, as well.The problem, Comedian, is these laws are passed with little thought about how effective they will be. Why pass them if the don't perform as promised?

If the attitude towards guns and crime is 'liberal' (I mean guns are regarded as nothing special) that is maybe a possible way.It is sad but I think everyone has to agree here.But does everday gun crime make good headlines?

Agreed, but one comes with the other.And if a right and therefore the tool is in effect for over 200 years than it is a part of society. That´s why I argue about things like gun-free zones or armed passengers, not banning guns in the US alltogether. That would be an unrealistic goal for the far future.No, thanks. :)I shot a lot during my military service (where the real fun with guns begins) and it really is fun and it certainly gives you an immense feeling of power (the last can be good and bad).But I don´t think that introducing guns into our gun-free society would lower our crime rate; which isn´t too alarming anyway.My suggestion was to install some kind of agency (that was what I meant with 'office') that supervises the whole gun safety subject.Schools had an official partner throughout the country and old prejudices between the NRA and anti-gunners would be needless.But I am not sure if this would even be possible because maybe this would fall under state law.Are there already any or is it forbidden to introduce shooting clubs in schools?Ok, thanks. Although I wouldn´t have known this one either. ;)The only thing that all countries seem to have in common is maybe the non-lack of crappy politicians. :pIn that case a law is useless.I hope this is not a too big problem in the US in general when it comes about new laws?

Difference is that we cannot control lightning, we can control kids bringing guns into schools and killing other kids. Or do you just seem to think that a few dead children once in a while is acceptable, as long as your personal freedom is no way decreased? My agenda is certainly not "anti-gun", it is anti-gun crime. I am all for guns, I own 8 of them myself. I just think something needs to be done to prevent this type of tragedy from happening in the future. IMHO, one dead child gunned down by another child in school is a huge problem, one that deserves attention.

Sorry, Comedian, I had forgottened this thread. Let me suggest to you, in relation to your above posting, if a nut case or one simply wishing to make some grandiose statement decides to shoot up a place, ( and this is not as common as the media would have you believe ) is he/she more likely to attempt to do so where he/she knows there are armed citizens, or in a 'gun free' zone?Then, of course, the benefits may not be worth the introduction. I certainly have no quarrel that with something that works in another country, as it is not any of my business. My quarrel is those from another country thinking their agenda will work here, and in reality, not having a clue about the American crime culture. I'm not sure how it works where you live, ( Germany, I think you stated ) but this country is over run with beauracratic XXXXXX as it is. The llast thing we need is another beauacracy, with all the entailing costs, that would accomplish little, except yo promote their own careers. The partnership between the NRA, schools, and government, lasted for a good while, but alas, the damned GGs have screwed that up.I'm not sure, but I would doubt seriously if such programs exist any longer.Unfortunately, you are only too correct. I have advocated for quite a while now, putting politicians on short rations, and weeding out the incompetents and ne'er do wells.This is exactly what happens when most politicians believe they know better than the people that sent them to office, exactly what the people need.It may be a world wide problem. I suspect it is. It seems though, we have an overabundance of congresscritters in this country that have gone way beyond their level of incompetence.Again, sorry for not responding sooner. Have a great day.
