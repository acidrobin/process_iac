"I Don't Have Enough Faith to Be an Atheist" is a book out by Norman L.

Along the way, in a readable and often entertaining way, they debunk relativism, agnosticism, atheism, Darwinism and New Testament liberalism. Their explanations of how the big bang, the design found in both the Universe and living organisms (like humans!), and morality point to God are worth the price of the book.I especially like the clarity they bring to the creation-evolution debate. Their point about how science is built on philosophy helps clear away much of the dust kicked into that often raucous debate. "It's not about the Bible vs. science or religion vs. science" they write, "but about good science vs. bad science." Geisler and Turek show that it's actually the Darwinists who are practicing the bad science. Darwinists rule out intelligent causes before they even look at the evidence. In doing so, they ignore observation-- the very foundation of science-- much as the opponents of Galileo once did. That's bad science built on bad philosophy. I Don't Have Enough Faith to Be an Atheist has four great chapters that systematically show why the New Testament documents are telling the truth. The authors show why we can be assured that the documents were written within a few decades of the evens which they report and contain historically-confirmed eyewitness details. They also cite non-Christian writers, archaeology, and list over 30 characters found in the New Testament that have been confirmed by secular sources. But they are at their best when they point out how the New Testament story is an unlikely invention. After listing a series of embarrassing gaffes of the apostles, Geisler and Turek ask the reader, "If you were a New Testament writer, would you include these embarrassing details if you were making up a story? Would you write that one of your primary leaders was called 'Satan' by Jesus, denied the Lord three times, hid during the crucifixion, and was later corrected on a theological issue? Would you depict yourselves as uncaring, bumbling cowards, and the women-whose testimony was not even admissible in court-as the brave ones who stood by Jesus and later discovered the empty tomb? Would you admit that some of you (the eleven remaining disciples) doubted the very Son of God after he had proven himself raised to all of you?" Geisler and Turek don't have enough faith to believe it's a made-up story. Neither do I. This is an engaging and affirming book with a vast scope. I highly recommend it!(See Hotlink at the Top)

I Don't Have Enough Faith to Be an Atheist

DO you want to have debates or just do book reviews on atheists?Is attacking atheist you way of promoting religion? You don't seem to post on anything but athiests, so I assume there is a reason for that. I am curious what that reason is.

Without a doubt Peter is my favorite in the NT.Acts 2 is a shocking turn of events, when on the day of Pentecost 3,000 believed in Jesus as the Jewish Messiah, and were saved and received the power of the Holy Spirit.Truly God used the lowest and most worthless and in Peter's lowest, God used the occassion for the highest Good. And, at the end of his life, he asked to be cruicified upside down (a merciful request, BTW) - who could make this scenario up?Why would 3,000 Jews believe in a dead Messiah? Why was the tomb empty? If Jesus was not the Messiah, who could believe the Gospel?Why would anyone risk being a Jewish heretic, and being cast out of Jerusalem? Acts 7 if memory serves me, or 8,9 as the believers in "The Way" - Jews for Jesus as it were, were expelled from Jerusalem.Some did stay behind with James, who was later beheaded 40 - 50 A.D. or so.

You missed the point! Earlier in Life, Freud described God as a Father wish fullfilment notion.Later in Life, Freud condicted himself and saluted the Swiss Theologian AND God!Now, look, we all evolve, and grow our childish beliefs (e.g. atheism)I will go further, NO one is an Atheist on their Death bed or in a Fowhole as the WWII guys knew all too well.

Crappola!I say "bless you" when someone sneezes and often identify myself as Catholic as I am from a Catholic family and am in fact "confirmed". That don't me I actually buy any of it. Don't try to make Freud out to be a member of "the flock" later in life. That's pure nonsense. Do you know what a figure of speech is?

Sigmund Freud divided all people into "believers" and "unbelievers.”Unbelievers include all those who consider themselves cynics, skeptics, scoffers, agnostics, or atheists. Believers include the rest, whose belief ranges from merely an intellectual assent that someone or something is out there to those like Lewis, Augustine, Tolstoy, and Pascal who have had a life-transforming experience after which their faith becomes the primary motivating and organizing principle of their lives. Freud came down clearly and strongly against the notion that there is "Anyone" out there. He described his worldview as secular and called it "scientific," and he claimed that no source of knowledge of the universe exists other than "carefully scrutinized observation what we call research." Therefore no knowledge, he said, can be derived from revelation or from intuition. He stated that the notion of the universe created by a being "resembling a man but magnified in every respect, an idealized superman, reflects the gross ignorance of primitive peoples." He stated that no intelligent person could accept the absurdities of the religious worldview. Freud described the concept of God as merely a projection of the childish wish for the protection of an all-powerful father. He added that "religion is an attempt to master the sensory world in which we are situated by means of the wishful world which we have developed within us as a result of biological and psychological abnormality." He concluded that the religious view is "so pathetically absurd and . . . infantile that it is humiliating and embarrassing to think that the majority of people will never rise above it." Except for the brief time as a college student under the influence of a brilliant philosopher named Franz Bratano, a devout believer, when Freud wavered in his atheism, he stated that he remained an unbeliever all of his life. A year before he died, Freud wrote to Charles Sanger, "Neither in my private life nor in my writing have I ever made a secret of being an out-and-out unbeliever." When we carefully assess the record, however, we find that Freud may not have been quite as adamant in his atheism as he proclaimed. Certainly he did refer to himself often as, "an infidel Jew," and he rejected outright the religious view of the universe, especially the Judeo-Christian view. He certainly attacked this view with all his intellectual might and from every possible perspective. Yet, for some reason he remained preoccupied with these issues; he just could not leave them alone. He spent the last thirty years of his life writing about them. In an autobiographical study he said that these philosophical and religious issues interested him throughout his life from early youth. A great deal of evidence exists that Freud's worldview proved less than comfortable for him. Faith was by no means a closed issue for him, and he was extremely ambivalent about God's existence. Anna Freud, Sigmund's daughter who died a few years ago, explained to me the only way to know her father: "Don't read his biographies;" she instructed, "read his letters." Throughout Freud's letters are statements such as,"If someday we meet above," "[my] one, quite secret prayer," and statements about God's grace.During the last thirty years of Freud's life, he carried out a continuous exchange of hundreds of letters with a Swiss theologian, Oskar Phister.It's interesting to note that his longest correspondence was with this theologian. He admired Phister and wrote, "You are a true servant of God . . . [who] feels the need to do spiritual good to everyone he meets. You did good this way even to me." He later said that Phister was, "In the fortunate position of being able to lead men to God."Source:: Click HereArmand M.

Ha! THere we have it, Freud suffered from Faith in his illussionary Non-belief.We humans are perfectly capable of blocking out God, but obly for a while, and this explains the popularity of drugs and booze, as many seek to kill the conscience. (And, as many pursue lifestyles that create cognitive pain!)God willing, most of us get sober, and accept our fate as God's creation, and created with meaning, purpose and with an eternal destiny!We are all eternal, it just depends on where end up!!!

The disciples had to be portrayed as a bunch of ignorant, clueless boobs. All the more so to show the superiority of the "master". That one word was never written by any of the twelve is evident by this example alone: We read in MT 14:13 the miracle of feeding five thousand people with a couple fish and five loaves of bread. The disciples are bowled over with this development--speechless--despite already personally observing numerous over miracles, such as walking on water, untold healings, water transforming into wine, etc.Then one brief chapter later, we are to believe Jesus is faced with feeding a mere four thousand people with nothing more than seven loaves and "a few little fishes". The disciples' response? MT 15:33: "Where are we to get enough loaves to satisfy so great a crowd?" If you personally had just observed five thousand people rubbing their bellies in satisfaction and fulfillment, would that be your question? Must we believe these twelve were nothing more than open-mouthed, clueless doofuses? Or is it more probable that it never happened?

They also cite non-Christian writers, archaeology, and list over 30 characters found in the New Testament that have been confirmed by secular sources. But they are at their best when they point out how the New Testament story is an unlikely invention. After listing a series of embarrassing gaffes of the apostles, Geisler and Turek ask the reader, "If you were a New Testament writer, would you include these embarrassing details if you were making up a story? Would you write that one of your primary leaders was called 'Satan' by Jesus, denied the Lord three times, hid during the crucifixion, and was later corrected on a theological issue? Would you depict yourselves as uncaring, bumbling cowards, and the women-whose testimony was not even admissible in court-as the brave ones who stood by Jesus and later discovered the empty tomb? Would you admit that some of you (the eleven remaining disciples) doubted the very Son of God after he had proven himself raised to all of you?" Geisler and Turek don't have enough faith to believe it's a made-up story. Neither do I. This is an engaging and affirming book with a vast scope. I highly recommend it!(See Hotlink at the Top)

You missed the point! Earlier in Life, Freud described God as a Father wish fullfilment notion.Later in Life, Freud condicted himself and saluted the Swiss Theologian AND God!Now, look, we all evolve, and grow our childish beliefs (e.g. atheism)I will go further, NO one is an Atheist on their Death bed or in a Fowhole as the WWII guys knew all too well.

Whenever I hear a preacher (usually my brother) talking about something Jesus did in his life, it makes Jesus sound really full of himself and superior. Like: "hey man, I came to your house and you didn't wash my feet or kiss my cheek, Hey, I'm da son a god ova here."Yeah, you'd think they'd get used to it.The disciples seem to have the least faith of all christians.They needed constant reminder of Jesus's power by displays of supernatural acts. When people questioned Jesus he didn't say "Just have faith that I'm god/son of god." Instead, he pulled a David Copperfield.

The disciples had to be portrayed as a bunch of ignorant, clueless boobs. All the more so to show the superiority of the "master". That one word was never written by any of the twelve is evident by this example alone: We read in MT 14:13 the miracle of feeding five thousand people with a couple fish and five loaves of bread. The disciples are bowled over with this development--speechless--despite already personally observing numerous over miracles, such as walking on water, untold healings, water transforming into wine, etc.Then one brief chapter later, we are to believe Jesus is faced with feeding a mere four thousand people with nothing more than seven loaves and "a few little fishes". The disciples' response? MT 15:33: "Where are we to get enough loaves to satisfy so great a crowd?" If you personally had just observed five thousand people rubbing their bellies in satisfaction and fulfillment, would that be your question? Must we believe these twelve were nothing more than open-mouthed, clueless doofuses? Or is it more probable that it never happened?

Jumping forward in the Book:Chapter 3 from Geisler and Turek's book.This chapter covers the Teleological argument. Which the authors formulate like this:1. Every design had a designer.2. The universe has a highly complex design.3. Therefore, the universe has a Designer.There is a discussion of The Anthropic Principle.the universe is specifically tweaked to enable life on earththe universe is extremely fine-tuned (designed) to support human life here on earth.Geiser and Turek give an example of an atheistic or agnostic reaction to this proof:"How do atheists respond to this "proof for God"? Some atheists admit there's some kind of Designer out there. Astronomer Fred Hoyle had his atheism shaken by the Anthropic Principle [....] Holyle concluded, "A commonsense interpretation of the facts suggests that a super intellect has monkeyed with physics, as well as chemistry and biology, and that there are no blind forces worth speaking about in nature."Atheists have had to resort to wild speculation to give chance more of a chance. Their speculation is called the Multiple Universe Theory.There are multiple problems with this multiple-universe explanation. First, and most significantly, there's no evidence for it! The evidence shows that all of finite reality came into existence with the Big Bang. Finite reality is exactly what we call "the universe." If other finite realities exist, they're beyond our ability to detect. No one has ever observed any evidence that such universes may exist. That's why this multiple universe idea is nothing more than a metaphysical concoction--a fairy tale built on blind faith--as detached from reality as Stephen Hawking's "imaginary time."We can back one chapter where the Big Bang was covered.

Well let's say there is only one universe (I don't really believe the multiple universe theory), got that? So there are billions and billions of planets in the universe. So it's luck that it happened on Earth, but not that they evolved.Let me try another example. You and a friend are playing cards. You are dealt 4 aces. You know your friend and trust him not to cheat. Do you automatically assume he rigged it since the odds against it are (4/52)*(3/51)*(2/50)*(1/49)=3.69*10^-6=.00000369?Pretty unlikely but say you play a trillion card games in your life. Still unlikely that in your life it will happen. Even if it depended on luck, there are enough tries that the odds are one time life would evolve.And to your thing about all designs must have a creator. What about God? Was he created? By who/what? In all scientific theories and religions the same question keeps not being answered "but what about before that?" If time is continuous, something must have happened before the first thing, which isn't possible. What was the beginning? But what created that beginning? So my answer is to admit that I don't know everything and that I really don't know. People can continue to give me theories but there really is no human answer to this. I'll just have to wait and see when I die, or if I just die not see, but believing in something out of fear isn't what a free thinker would do. I admit that I don't know and live my life based on what I DO know.

Yes, in effect, they believe in three gods.Christianity believes in the Trinity - three in one.Consider the Triune nature of God, in the Old Testament, or in Judaism:The Use of the Compound OneThe fourth line of evidence for unity of the Godhead in the Old Testament is in Deuteronomy 6:4; a very famous verse for Jewish people. Deuteronomy 6:4 is called the sh’ma, and it is considered the essence of all forms of Judaism. That verse reads: Hear, 0 Israel: Jehovah our God is one Jehovah:…This verse, more than any other, emphasizes the concept of a unity. In the field of Jewish evangelism, Deuteronomy 6:4 is often used by Jewish people to teach against the plurality of the Godhead. But, if this verse is studied very carefully, it is evident that it is not teaching an absolute unity, but a compound unity. Rather than arguing against a plurality of the Godhead, Deuteronomy 6:4 actually supports the concept of plurality in the Godhead. To begin with, it should be pointed out that where it reads Jehovah our God the Hebrew word for God is plural, and literally reads, "our Gods." But, the key word to focus attention on is the word one.EchadThe Hebrew word for one is echad. By comparing the usage of echad elsewhere in the Old Testament, it is clear that this word refers to a compound one, not an absolute one. For example, Genesis 1:5 states: And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day. The combination of evening and morning comprised the unity of echad, or one day. Another key passage is Genesis 2:24: Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. A man and a woman who come together in marriage are said to become one [echad] flesh. There are two personalities, a man and a woman, coming together in marriage, and the two become one. Obviously, they do not become an absolute one, for they retain their separate personalities; however, there is definitely a unity there. Another example is Ezra 3:1, where the whole assembly of Israel was as one [echad]. Although it was comprised of numerous individuals, they were all looked upon as one; obviously a united one. Another example is Ezekiel 37:17, where Ezekiel is told to put two sticks together, and they are combined to become one [echad] stick. These examples of the usage of the word echad in the Hebrew text, which is the very same word used in Deuteronomy 6:4, show that it speaks of a compound unity, not an absolute unity.YachidThere is another Hebrew word which does mean an absolute one: yachid. It is used in Genesis 22:2, where it emphasizes Isaac as Abraham's only, unique son. So, if Moses had wanted to emphasize absolute oneness of God, he would have used the term yachid. But he did not use that term for the oneness of God. Deuteronomy 6:4 is, therefore, an argument in favor of the plurality of the Godhead and, at the same time, it teaches the unity of this plurality of the one God."Source::More - Click Here

By comparing the usage of echad elsewhere in the Old Testament, it is clear that this word refers to a compound one, not an absolute one. For example, Genesis 1:5 states: And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day. The combination of evening and morning comprised the unity of echad, or one day. Another key passage is Genesis 2:24: Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. A man and a woman who come together in marriage are said to become one [echad] flesh. There are two personalities, a man and a woman, coming together in marriage, and the two become one. Obviously, they do not become an absolute one, for they retain their separate personalities; however, there is definitely a unity there. Another example is Ezra 3:1, where the whole assembly of Israel was as one [echad]. Although it was comprised of numerous individuals, they were all looked upon as one; obviously a united one. Another example is Ezekiel 37:17, where Ezekiel is told to put two sticks together, and they are combined to become one [echad] stick. These examples of the usage of the word echad in the Hebrew text, which is the very same word used in Deuteronomy 6:4, show that it speaks of a compound unity, not an absolute unity.YachidThere is another Hebrew word which does mean an absolute one: yachid. It is used in Genesis 22:2, where it emphasizes Isaac as Abraham's only, unique son. So, if Moses had wanted to emphasize absolute oneness of God, he would have used the term yachid. But he did not use that term for the oneness of God. Deuteronomy 6:4 is, therefore, an argument in favor of the plurality of the Godhead and, at the same time, it teaches the unity of this plurality of the one God."Source::More - Click Here

You fail to mention that Polkinghorne is a Church of England clergyman who is eager to put a creationist spin on the origin of the universe.As an antidote to this "fascination with the created order", it's probably useless to suggest that you take time to read a very short book on the first 3 minutes by Steven Weinberg. (If you are appalled by the mathematics that underlie this excellent primer, don't worry - all the equations etc. are stashed away in a supplement at the end of the book).

Consider Professor of quantum physics at Cambridge University, Dr. John Polkinghorne, and his book, One World, there is a marvelous exposition of his fascination with the created order.He said,“Ladies and gentlemen, if you were to analyze just one contingency in the early picoseconds of the universe”—a picosecond is how long it takes the speed of something moving at the speed of light to traverse the breadth of a single strain of hair—he said, “If you look at the early picoseconds of this universe and analyze just one contingent, the expansion and relation to the contraction, do you know how precise that had to be?”He said, “It would be like taking aim at a one-square-inch object at the other end of the universe twenty billion light years away and hitting it bull’s eye.” And then he said, “Gentlemen, there’s no free lunch. Somebody has to pay.”

God is One.Quote:Throughout the centuries, the Christian community has carried on a dialogue with the Scriptures and the community’s experience, always searching for understanding and appropriate ways to express its beliefs. Naturally, individual theologians and Church councils made use of the philosophies and other insights of their age. During the first centuries of Christianity’s existence, questions about Jesus and the Trinity raised special interest. How can we speak of this human being who is also God? How can we speak of one God who is Father, Son and Spirit? (What many of us now simply accept as part of our Creed had to be hammered out over many years.) Three people who played a very important role in that process during the fourth century were St. Basil of Caesarea, St. Gregory of Nyssa and St. Gregory of Nazianzus. Because they lived in Cappadocia (an area of present-day Turkey), these three saints are simply called the Cappadocians. For many of us in the West, their thought is not well-known. A key concept in their teaching about how the Trinity is both one and three is perichoresis, a term conveying dynamic and creative energy, eternal movement, mutuality and interrelatedness. The three divine persons are what they are by relation to one another. Some scholars like to use the image of dance to describe this term. In this divine dance there is an eternal movement of reciprocal giving and receiving, expressing the essence and unity of God. Moreover this interrelatedness of the triune God is not self-contained but is poured out in creation, Incarnation and final fulfillment. God is overflowing love, leading humanity and all creation into the divine dance of God’s life.

So Christianity is polytheistic and mormonism is a sect of that.That's what you're saying, right?And only Judaism and Islam are truly monotheistic.

Deal with his point!PAY UP!Start explaining the meaning and purpose of our creation or existence!There is no free lunch in this Universe and the Atheist, IMO, also carries a burden to explain the time + matter + chance canard.We are randon products of what?Why?Why this Universe, in this time? Why have a mind to ponder the our existance? Note, that we are the only animal to do this. I am therefore I think!I think therefore I am!Why?

So, time + matter + chance?Where is the Meaning, the rhyme or sublime reason?Hmmmm, what would Steven Gould say?The late, great Harvard professor Stephen Jay Gould has said the following regarding the quest for meaning: The pathways that have led to our evolution are quirky, improbable, unrepeatable and utterly unpredictable. Human evolution is not random; it makes sense and can be explained after the fact. But wind back life’s tape to the dawn of time and let it play again-and you will never get humans a second time . . . We cannot read the meaning of life passively in the facts of nature. We must construct these answers ourselves—from our own wisdom and ethical sense. There is no other way.(Stephen Jay Gould, quoted in David Friend and editors of Life magazine, The Meaning of Life, 33.)

Ravi Zacharias writes:In his book Meaning, philosopher Michael Polanyi stated that by reducing life to atomic elements and blind forces, science has, in effect, made the pursuit of life’s meaning meaningless. Polanyi warns us that it is not for science to make this determination because scientific method can only address the question of what—nature and matter—but not why—the purpose of such matter. And yet the stuff of reality, again, the "what," and the purpose driving reality, the "why," are inextricably bound together. Science tends to reduce all of reality to the "what"—the material. But surely only as one understands the "why" of life can the "what" be defined, for it is the "why" that provides the glue and our purpose for why we are here in the first place. Simply put, if I am an intentional creation of God, then life must be deemed sacred, for there is a built-in purpose to my existence. But if I am merely the product of time and chance, the body may be profaned, for life itself is disposable. In fact, in a naturalistic framework the words "profane" and "sacred" are only descriptive of one’s feelings of reverence or irreverence. In a world without God there is no essential meaning or sanctity to humanity. What the brain is to the body, the mind is to the soul. Fulfillment and purpose may only be known by a mind because such experiences require that which is essentially personal: joy, love, beauty, wonder. We can move from mind to meaning but not so easily from matter to meaning. That is why, after explaining the "what" of our universe, Stephen Hawking ends his book A Brief History of Time with these words: "Now if we only knew why, [then] we would have the mind of God." His inescapable implication is that the answer to the final question would have to come from a mind that transcends our material universe. There is a mind beyond us which has infused our world with meaning and purpose—the mind of God. My friend, a meaningful "why" for reality can only have its source in the very mind of a personal God.

O.K., much better and more logical is to cover......I Don't Have Enough Faith to Be an Atheist - Chapter 3 "In the Beginning There Was a Great SURGE"A continuation of my comments on Geisler and Turek's book.This Chapter starts with Einsten and how his Theory of Relativity progressed, all the while Einstein's own "faith" is challenged.Einstein didn't like where his calculations were leading him. If his theory of General Relativity was true, it meant that the universe was not eternal but had a beginning.Einstein later called his discovery "irritating." He wanted the universe to be self-existant [....] In fact, Einstein so disliked the implications of General Relativity [...] that he introduced a cosmological constant (which some have since called a "fudge factor") into his equations in order to show that the universe is static and to avoid an absolute beginning.By 1922, Russian mathematician Alexander Friedmann had officially exposed Einstein's fudge factor as an algebraic error. (Incredibly, in his quest to avoid a beginning, the great Einstein had divided by zero--something even schoolchildren know is a no-no!)He subsequently described the cosmological constant as "the greatest blunder of my life," and he redirected his efforts to find the box top of the puzzle of life. Einstein said that he wanted "to know how God created the world. I am not interested in this or that phenomenon, in the spectrum of this or that element. I want to know His thought, the rest are details."Now off to the Cosmological Argument proper:In logical form, the argument goes like this:1) Everything that had a beginning had a cause.2) The universe had a beginning.3) Therefore the universe had a cause.Now for the justification of Premise 1:Premise 1 [...] is the Law of Causality, which is the fundamental principle of science. Without the Law of Causality, science is impossible.In fact, to deny the Law of Causality is to deny rationality. The very process of rational thinking requires us to put together thoughts (the causes) that result in conclusions (the effects). So if anyone ever tells you he doesn't believe in the Law of Causality, simply ask that person, "What caused you to come to that conclusion."Back to Einstein:Until about the time of Einstein, atheists could comfort themselves with the belief that the universe is eternal, and thus did not need a cause.Next, the authors cover the Second Law of Thermodynamics:The Second Law is also known as the Law of Entropy, which is a fancy way of saying that nature tends to bring things to disorder. That is, with time, things naturally fall apart. Your car falls apart; your house falls apart; your body falls apart.[....]But if the universe is becoming less ordered, then where did the original order come from?"If everything is material," I asked, "then what is a scientific theory? After all, the theory about everything being material isn't material; it's not made out of molocules."Without a moment's hesitation he quipped, "A theory is magic.""Magic?" I repeated, not really believing what I was hearing. "What's your basis for saying that?""Faith," he quickly replied."Faith in magic?" I thought to myself. "I can't believe what I'm hearing! If faith in magic is the best materialists have to offer, then I don't have enough faith to be a materialist!"In retrospect, it seemed to me that this professor had a brief moment of complete candor. [....] In doing so, he provided another example of the will refusing to believe what the mind knows to be true, and howthe atheists' view is based on sheer faith. [....]Since I could see the professor was not really interested in accepting the truth, I didn't ask him any more potentially humiliating questions. But since we couldn't ignore the power of the Second Law on our own bodies, we both ordered desert.Nevertheless, we wanted to press the fact that atheists like Atkins must be able to explain how the universe began from absolutely nothing.Next is, the Fine-Tuning argument in the area of cosmic background radiation ripples:The ripples show that the explosion and expansion of the universe was precisely tweaked to cause just enough matter to congregate to allow galaxy formation, but not enough to cause the universe to collapse back on itself. Any slight variation one way or the other, and none of us would be here to tell about it.Jastrow writes, "Now we see how the astronomical evidence leads to a biblical view of the origin of the world. The details differ, but the essential elements in the astronomical and biblical accounts of Genesis are the same: the chain of events leading to man commenced suddenly and sharply at a definite moment in time, in a flash of light and energy."Therefore, there must be something outside of nature to do the job. That's exactly what the word supernatural means.

I just don't have enough Faith to be an Atheist!Ahhhhhhhhhhh, JUST RIGHT!Quote:In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Fred Hoyle discovered that an incredible fine-tuning of the nuclear ground state energies for helium, beryllium, carbon, and oxygen was necessary for any kind of life to exist. The ground state energies for these elements cannot be higher or lower with respect to each other by more than 4% without yielding a universe with insufficient oxygen or carbon for life.3 Hoyle, who has written extensively against theism4 and Christianity in particular5 nevertheless concluded on the basis of this quadruple fine-tuning that "a super-intellect has monkeyed with physics, as well as with chemistry and biology."6 In 2000, a team of astrophysicists from Austria, Germany, and Hungary demonstrated that the level of design for electromagnetism and the strong nuclear force is much greater than what physicists previously had determined.7 The team began by noting that for any kind of conceivable physical life to be possible in the universe certain minimum abundances of both the elements carbon and oxygen must exist. Next, they pointed out that the only astrophysical sources of significant quantities of carbon and oxygen are red giant stars. (Red giant stars are large stars that through nuclear fusion have consumed all of their hydrogen fuel and subsequently engage in the fusion of helium into heavier elements.) What the astrophysical team did was to mathematically construct models of red giant stars that adopted slightly different values of the strong nuclear force and electromagnetic force constants. They discovered that tiny adjustments in the values of either of these constants imply that red giant stars would produce too little carbon, too little oxygen, or too little of both oxygen and carbon. Specifically, they determined that if the value of the coupling constant for electromagnetism were 4% smaller or 4% larger than what we observe, then life would be impossible. In the case of the coupling constant for the strong nuclear force, if it were 0.5% smaller or larger, life would be impossible. These new limits on the strengths of the electromagnetic and strong nuclear forces provide much tighter constraints on quark masses and on the Higgs vacuum expectation value.8 Without getting into the details of what the Higgs vacuum expectation value and quarks are all about, the new limits not only demonstrate an enhanced design for the physics of stars and planets but also an enhanced mathematical design of fundamental particle physics. 3. Getting the Right Nucleons One must monkey with the physics of the universe to get enough of the right elements for life, and further to get those elements to join together to form life molecules. One must also fine-tune the universe to get enough nucleons (protons and neutrons) to form the elements.In the first moments after creation, the universe contained about 10 billion and 1 nucleons for every 10 billion anti-nucleons. The 10 billion anti-nucleons annihilated the 10 billion nucleons, generating an enormous amount of energy. All the galaxies and stars that make up the universe today were formed from the leftover nucleons. If the initial excess of nucleons over anti-nucleons were any smaller, there would not be enough matter for galaxies, stars, and heavy elements to form. If the excess were any greater, galaxies would form, but they would so efficiently condense and trap radiation that none of them would fragment to form stars and planets. Source:: Click Here - More

I just don't have enough Faith to be an Atheist!Ahhhhhhhhhhh, JUST RIGHT!Quote:In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Fred Hoyle discovered that an incredible fine-tuning of the nuclear ground state energies for helium, beryllium, carbon, and oxygen was necessary for any kind of life to exist. The ground state energies for these elements cannot be higher or lower with respect to each other by more than 4% without yielding a universe with insufficient oxygen or carbon for life.3 Hoyle, who has written extensively against theism4 and Christianity in particular5 nevertheless concluded on the basis of this quadruple fine-tuning that "a super-intellect has monkeyed with physics, as well as with chemistry and biology."6 In 2000, a team of astrophysicists from Austria, Germany, and Hungary demonstrated that the level of design for electromagnetism and the strong nuclear force is much greater than what physicists previously had determined.7 The team began by noting that for any kind of conceivable physical life to be possible in the universe certain minimum abundances of both the elements carbon and oxygen must exist. Next, they pointed out that the only astrophysical sources of significant quantities of carbon and oxygen are red giant stars. (Red giant stars are large stars that through nuclear fusion have consumed all of their hydrogen fuel and subsequently engage in the fusion of helium into heavier elements.) What the astrophysical team did was to mathematically construct models of red giant stars that adopted slightly different values of the strong nuclear force and electromagnetic force constants. They discovered that tiny adjustments in the values of either of these constants imply that red giant stars would produce too little carbon, too little oxygen, or too little of both oxygen and carbon. Specifically, they determined that if the value of the coupling constant for electromagnetism were 4% smaller or 4% larger than what we observe, then life would be impossible. In the case of the coupling constant for the strong nuclear force, if it were 0.5% smaller or larger, life would be impossible. These new limits on the strengths of the electromagnetic and strong nuclear forces provide much tighter constraints on quark masses and on the Higgs vacuum expectation value.8 Without getting into the details of what the Higgs vacuum expectation value and quarks are all about, the new limits not only demonstrate an enhanced design for the physics of stars and planets but also an enhanced mathematical design of fundamental particle physics. 3. Getting the Right Nucleons One must monkey with the physics of the universe to get enough of the right elements for life, and further to get those elements to join together to form life molecules. One must also fine-tune the universe to get enough nucleons (protons and neutrons) to form the elements.In the first moments after creation, the universe contained about 10 billion and 1 nucleons for every 10 billion anti-nucleons. The 10 billion anti-nucleons annihilated the 10 billion nucleons, generating an enormous amount of energy. All the galaxies and stars that make up the universe today were formed from the leftover nucleons. If the initial excess of nucleons over anti-nucleons were any smaller, there would not be enough matter for galaxies, stars, and heavy elements to form. If the excess were any greater, galaxies would form, but they would so efficiently condense and trap radiation that none of them would fragment to form stars and planets. Source:: Click Here - More

Furthermore:Because of Einstein's equation, E = mc2, even small changes in c, the velocity of light, lead to huge changes in E, the energy, or m, the mass. Thus, a slight change in light's velocity implies that starlight will either be too strong or too feeble for life or that stars will produce the wrong elements for life. ...stable orbits of planets about stars and of electrons about the nuclei of atoms are only possible in a universe described by three large and rapidly expanding dimensions of space. In addition, six extremely tiny dimensions that are presently dormant but actively expanded during the first 10-43 seconds of the universe's history are critical for quantum mechanics and gravity to coexist. Therefore, physical life requires a different fine-tuning of the number of effective dimensions both in the present, namely four (three space plus one time), and in the earliest moment of the universe's existence, namely ten (nine space plus one time).

Your faith is special! emoticonXBouncerOur Electrons and protons are fine-tuned and well odered!Quote:Molecular bonding depends on two factors, the strength of the force of electromagnetism and the ratio of the mass of the electron to the mass of the proton. If the electromagnetic force were significantly larger, atoms would hang on to electrons so tightly no sharing of electrons with other atoms would be possible. But if the electromagnetic force were significantly weaker, atoms would not hang on to electrons at all, and again, the sharing of electrons among atoms, which makes molecules possible, would not take place. If more than just a few kinds of molecules are to exist, the electromagnetic force must be more delicately balanced yet. The size and stability of electron orbits about the nuclei of atoms depends on the ratio of the electron mass to the proton mass. Unless this ratio is delicately balanced, the chemical bandings essential for life chemistry could never take place.

More Evidence of Fine-Tuning and ah, just the right Balance and Miraclous Order:Quote:"If some god-like being could be given the opportunity to plan a sequence of events with the express goal of duplicating our 'Garden of Eden,' that power would face a formidable task," declare Ward and Brownlee. "With the best intentions, but limited by natural laws and materials, it is unlikely that Earth could ever be truly replicated. Too many processes in its formation involved sheer luck . ... [T]he physical events that led to the formation and evolution of the physical Earth ... required an intricate set of nearly irreproducible circumstances." How so? Well, if you want any kind of life on a planet, you've got to have a sun, and not just any sun will do. It has to be the right distance from the center of the galaxy. If it's too close to the star-dense center, it will likely be sterilized by a supernova, an exploding star. If it's too far away, it will be too poor in heavy elements, the building blocks of a habitable planet. Your sun will also have to have the just right mass; otherwise, the planets orbiting it will be too close or too far away to sustain life. For these and other reasons, Ward and Brownlee declare, our rare earth required a rare sun. Shall we add the presence of Jupiter? If you don't want your planet to be bombarded by comets and asteroids, you'd better have a "sweeper." Because of its great mass, Jupiter cleans interstellar debris from our solar system. Without it, the Earth would likely be continually pummeled — and therefore lifeless. Let's also add that, if Jupiter were any closer to its sun, as other Jovian-type planets generally are, it would have crushed the Earth. Another happy accident! We have a glimpse of how rare the conditions surrounding our planet are, but the conditions of Earth itself are rarer still. According to the authors, getting life, microbial life, might be relatively easy. Therefore, such non-complex life may very well be abundant in the universe. But complex life is both difficult to attain and maintain. To begin with, you need an atmosphere, surface water and a constant but narrow range of temperature. Attaining and maintaining these require an immensely complex dance of factors — the right amount of initial carbon available, a molten core of the right elements and temperature, the presence of a sufficient magnetic field and other factors too numerous to mention. In addition, if you want to maintain the conditions of life over sufficiently long periods of time, say, multiple millions of years, you have to avoid all kinds of catastrophes all too common on other planets. Earth, unlike many other planets, has managed to escape such destruction. On top of all this, we, the Earth, actually have complex life, the existence of which is far, far more unlikely than the conditions which allow it. When we string together the list of all these improbable conditions and events, the authors claim, the probability of creating a planet with complex life approaches zero. The actual presence of Earth, given the extremely complex and interrelated conditions which allowed its birth and continuation, is near miraculous.Science, it would seem, is leaning back toward faith: We really may be the only rational animal in the universe after all.Source::More

An estimated 50 billion galaxies are visible to modern telescopes. Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, contains hundreds of billions of stars broadly similar to our Sun. There is already quite a lot of indirect evidence of planets orbiting some stars at distances that would (or might) allow a form of life to evolve there. The proposition that life is not unique to this earth is based on probability. It is not impossible, but very, very unlikely that in the billions of possibilities only one place in the entire universe has produced the necessary and sufficient conditions for life to become established.I know this 2 cent's worth will make no difference to your fantasy about the origin of the cosmos, but I thought it worth posting anyway.

You obviously know nothing about this equation. E=MC^2. C is a CONSTANT which is equal to the speed of light. A constant doesn't change. In this universe he observed that the amount of energy was equal to the amount of mass times the constant of the speed of light squared.

Well think about it. You have trillions of stars out there with many planets orbiting around them. The probability that it would have been on Earth is low. But the probability that it would have developed on any one planet is pretty high. In fact I still remember a quote from the movie "Contact" where she says at the end when asked if she thinks there's intelligent life somewhere: "with all the stars and planets out there, if Earth had the only intelligent life, it would be a pretty big waste of space". Even if god created the Earth and humans and animals, don't you think it's a pretty big waste of space for him to create all these stars and planets? But back to my original point let me give you an example.You have a group of people in a room. The probability that one person has the same birthday (year, month, day) is pretty small but if you have 10,000 people the probability would be pretty good. That one person who had the same birthday could go "wow, there must be a god who gave me the same birthday" but just by probability it happened. Understand?

And, that is the POINT!Fine tuned and well ORDERED!Not chaotic in this regard! Note that so many other factors, like our planets and our Earth, have a variable range of speed depending on gravity and distance from the Sun.Sorry, the book I quoted remarks that new calculations have changed the odds. The probability of a planet like Earth is more remote than ever believed.So you would esteem, as a credible source, a Hollywood movie? Actually, quoting Carl Sagan, correct?O.K., next we will flesh out the beginning of Life and discussion Darwin's theory and maybe his Religion, or certainly the Religion of Darwinism!And, back to the Big Bang, "nothing can come from nothing"???

In the winter of 1998, two separate teams of astronomers in Berkeley, California, made a similar, startling discovery. They were both observing supernovae — exploding stars visible over great distances — to see how fast the universe is expanding. In accordance with prevailing scientific wisdom, the astronomers expected to find the rate of expansion to be decreasing, Instead they found it to be increasing — a discovery which has since “shaken astronomy to its core” (Astronomy, October 1999). This discovery would have come as no surprise to Georges Lemaitre (1894-1966), a Belgian mathematician and Catholic priest who developed the theory of the Big Bang. Lemaitre described the beginning of the universe as a burst of fireworks, comparing galaxies to the burning embers spreading out in a growing sphere from the center of the burst. He believed this burst of fireworks was the beginning of time, taking place on “a day without yesterday.”SNIPBut while Einstein imagined an unknown force — a cosmological constant — which kept the world stable, Lemaitre decided that the universe was expanding. He came to this conclusion after observing the reddish glow, known as a red shift, surrounding objects outside of our galaxy. If interpreted as a Doppler effect, this shift in color meant that the galaxies were moving away from us. Lemaitre published his calculations and his reasoning in Annales de la Societe scientifique de Bruxelles in 1927. Few people took notice. That same year he talked with Einstein in Brussels, but the latter, unimpressed, said, “Your calculations are correct, but your grasp of physics is abominable.” It was Einstein’s own grasp of physics, however, that soon came under fire. :ahem: In 1929 Edwin Hubble’s systematic observations of other galaxies confirmed the red shift. In England the Royal Astronomical Society gathered to consider this seeming contradiction between visual observation and the theory of relativity. Sir Arthur Eddington volunteered to work out a solution. When Lemaitre read of these proceedings, he sent Eddington a copy of his 1927 paper. The British astronomer realized that Lemaitre had bridged the gap between observation and theory. At Eddington’s suggestion, the Royal Astronomical Society published an English translation of Lemaitre’s paper in its Monthly Notices of March 1931. Most scientists who read Lemaitre’s paper accepted that the universe was expanding, at least in the present era, but they resisted the implication that the universe had a beginning. They were used to the idea that time had gone on forever. It seemed illogical that infinite millions of years had passed before the universe came into existence. Eddington himself wrote in the English journal Nature that the notion of a beginning of the world was “repugnant.” The Belgian priest responded to Eddington with a letter published in Nature on May 9, 1931. Lemaitre suggested that the world had a definite beginning in which all its matter and energy were concentrated at one point: If the world has begun with a single quantum, the notions of space and time would altogether fail to have any meaning at the beginning; they would only begin to have a sensible meaning when the original quantum had been divided into a sufficient number of quanta. If this suggestion is correct, the beginning of the world happened a little before the beginning of space and time. In January 1933, both Lemaitre and Einstein traveled to California for a series of seminars. After the Belgian detailed his theory, Einstein stood up, applauded, and said, “This is the most beautiful and satisfactory explanation of creation to which I have ever listened.” Duncan Aikman covered these seminars for the New York Times Magazine. An article about Lemaitre appeared on February 19, 1933, and featured a large photo of Einstein and Lemaitre standing side by side. The caption read, “They have a profound respect and admiration for each other.” For his work, Lemaitre was inducted as a member of the Royal Academy of Belgium. An international commission awarded him the Francqui Prize. The archbishop of Malines, Cardinal Josef Van Roey, made Lemaitre a canon of the cathedral in 1935. The next year Pope Pius XI inducted Lemaitre into the Pontifical Academy of Science. Despite this high praise, there were some problems with Lemaitre’s theory. For one, Lemaitre’s calculated rate of expansion did not work out. If the universe was expanding at a steady rate, the time it had taken to cover its radius was too short to allow for the formation of the stars and planets. Lemaitre solved this problem by expropriating Einstein’s cosmological constant. Where Einstein had used it in an attempt to keep the universe at a steady size, Lemaitre used it to speed up the expansion of the universe over time. Einstein did not take kindly to Lemaitre’s use of the cosmological constant. He regarded the constant as the worst mistake of his career, and he was upset by Lemaitre’s use of his super-galactic fudge factor. After Arthur Eddington died in 1944, Cambridge University became a center of opposition to Lemaitre’s theory of the Big Bang. In fact, it was Fred Hoyle, an astronomer at Cambridge, who sarcastically coined the term “Big Bang.” Hoyle and others favored an approach to the history of the universe known as the “Steady State” in which hydrogen atoms were continuously created and gradually coalesced into gas clouds, which then formed stars.Source: “‘A Day Without Yesterday’: Georges Lemaitre & the Big Bang.” - Click Here

Zac'That is the whole point of discussing the book, I am one Theist, and we might have five or six Atheists on the other side!I do read all POV'sNow, let's review!I Don't Have Enough Faith to Be an Atheist - Chapter 3 "In the Beginning There Was a Great SURGE"A continuation of my comments on Geisler and Turek's book.This Chapter starts with Einsten and how his Theory of Relativity progressed, all the while Einstein's own "faith" is challenged.Einstein didn't like where his calculations were leading him. If his theory of General Relativity was true, it meant that the universe was not eternal but had a beginning.Einstein later called his discovery "irritating." He wanted the universe to be self-existant [....] In fact, Einstein so disliked the implications of General Relativity [...] that he introduced a cosmological constant (which some have since called a "fudge factor") into his equations in order to show that the universe is static and to avoid an absolute beginning.By 1922, Russian mathematician Alexander Friedmann had officially exposed Einstein's fudge factor as an algebraic error. (Incredibly, in his quest to avoid a beginning, the great Einstein had divided by zero--something even schoolchildren know is a no-no!)He subsequently described the cosmological constant as "the greatest blunder of my life," and he redirected his efforts to find the box top of the puzzle of life. Einstein said that he wanted "to know how God created the world. I am not interested in this or that phenomenon, in the spectrum of this or that element. I want to know His thought, the rest are details."Now off to the Cosmological Argument proper:In logical form, the argument goes like this:1) Everything that had a beginning had a cause.2) The universe had a beginning.3) Therefore the universe had a cause.Now for the justification of Premise 1:Premise 1 [...] is the Law of Causality, which is the fundamental principle of science. Without the Law of Causality, science is impossible.In fact, to deny the Law of Causality is to deny rationality. The very process of rational thinking requires us to put together thoughts (the causes) that result in conclusions (the effects). So if anyone ever tells you he doesn't believe in the Law of Causality, simply ask that person, "What caused you to come to that conclusion."Back to Einstein:Until about the time of Einstein, atheists could comfort themselves with the belief that the universe is eternal, and thus did not need a cause.Next, the authors cover the Second Law of Thermodynamics:The Second Law is also known as the Law of Entropy, which is a fancy way of saying that nature tends to bring things to disorder. That is, with time, things naturally fall apart. Your car falls apart; your house falls apart; your body falls apart. [....] But if the universe is becoming less ordered, then where did the original order come from?"If everything is material," I asked, "then what is a scientific theory? After all, the theory about everything being material isn't material; it's not made out of molocules."Without a moment's hesitation he quipped, "A theory is magic.""Magic?" I repeated, not really believing what I was hearing. "What's your basis for saying that?""Faith," he quickly replied."Faith in magic?" I thought to myself. "I can't believe what I'm hearing! If faith in magic is the best materialists have to offer, then I don't have enough faith to be a materialist!"In retrospect, it seemed to me that this professor had a brief moment of complete candor.

Any slight variation one way or the other, and none of us would be here to tell about it.Jastrow writes, "Now we see how the astronomical evidence leads to a biblical view of the origin of the world. The details differ, but the essential elements in the astronomical and biblical accounts of Genesis are the same: the chain of events leading to man commenced suddenly and sharply at a definite moment in time, in a flash of light and energy."Therefore, there must be something outside of nature to do the job. That's exactly what the word supernatural means.Hmmmm

so how exactly is observing supernovae seeing how fast the UNIVERSE is expanding? No one knows where the universe ends or if it ends or not. People talk about whether there could be like a solid wall at the end of the universe or whether it's just infinite, or what. I'd like to see how studying supernovae determines how fast the universe is expanding.and as the many other people have asked, do you ever have an original thought? It's important to have sources to back up what you say, but you should decide for yourself what you believe based on both sides, not just reading an article and using it in a debate. We can do research, if it were just one really good article you wanted to show, that's one thing, but you do more cut and paste than actual debate.

The purpose of that was to provide background information about the evolving beliefs of Einstein.The significance of an expanding Universe, is that our Universe has a beginning. "In the beginning God..."Got it?This is a discussion based on the Book by the same title and we just covered Chapter 3, and how a Catholic Priest taught Einstein a few lessons!

And I would like to see some of the equations you have posted, such as where he divided by 0, and where his calculations showed the universe expanding and why. Any source will do or if the text is in the book you can copy part of the equations as well. I'm curious where the theory of relativity has to do with the universe expanding.And a cause doesn't mean an intelligent being created it. A spider tips a book off the table out of balance and it falls to the floor. The cause was that the spider hit it. But the universe could be by chance as well as intellence too. In fact many scientists consider the big bang to be the cause of the universe. I really don't think there's even enough evidence to determine if the universe had a beginning or not much less contemplate its beginning. But if you have a source showing where Einstein intentionaly divided by 0 and that the universe is expanding and that shows where the universe had a beginning I'd like to see it. I'm curious, please don't dissapoint me :)

I already posted, where, early in the evolution of Einstein's thinking and belief, he posited a static and ever existent universe.An expanding Universe, as I understand it, refuted this, and revealed a "beginning", later called the Big Bang.I believe that our Universe makes more sense, with cause, meaning and purpose if created by God.Quote:God provides the best explanation of why the universe exists rather than nothing. Have you ever asked yourself why anything at all exists, or where the universe came from?Typically, atheists have said that the universe is just eternal, and that’s all. But surely this is unreasonable. Just think about it for a minute.If the universe never had a beginning, then that means that the number of past events is infinite. But mathematicians recognize that the notion of an actually infinite number of things leads to self-contradictions unless you impose some wholly arbitrary rules to prevent this. For example, what is infinity minus infinity? Well, mathematically you get self-contradictory answers. This shows that infinity is just an idea in your mind, not something that exists in reality.David Hilbert, perhaps the greatest mathematician in this century, states,The infinite is nowhere to be found in reality. It neither exists in nature, nor provides a legitimate basis for rational thought. ... The role that remains for the infinite to play is solely that of an idea.But that entails that since past events are not just ideas but are real, the number of past events must be finite. Therefore the series of past events cannot go back forever; rather the universe must have begun to exist.This conclusion has been confirmed by remarkable discoveries in astronomy and astrophysics. The astrophysical evidence indicates that the universe began to exist in a great explosion called the Big Bang about fifteen billion years ago. Physical space and time were created in that event, as well as all the matter and energy in the universe.Therefore, as the Cambridge astronomer Fred Hoyle points out, the Big Bang Theory requires the creation of the universe from nothing. This is because as one goes back in time he reaches a point at which, in Hoyle’s words; the universe was "shrunk down to nothing at all." Thus what the Big Bang model requires is that the universe began to exist and was created out of nothing.Now this tends to be very awkward for the atheist thinker. For as Anthony Kenny of Oxford University says, "A proponent of the [Big Bang] theory, at least if he is an atheist, must believe that ... the universe came from nothing and by nothing."...but that’s a pretty hard pill to swallow. Out of nothing, nothing comes. So where did the universe come from? Why does it exist instead of just nothing? There must have been a cause which brought the universe into being. And from the very nature of the case, this cause must be an uncaused, changeless, timeless, and immaterial being which created the universe.Isn't it incredible that the Big Bang theory thus confirms what the Christian theist has always believed, that in the beginning, god created the universe?Now, I simply put it to you: Which do you think is more probable, that the Christian theist is right, or that the universe just popped into existence uncaused out of nothing? I, at least, don't have any problem assessing these probabilities.A Classic Debate on the Existence of God - By William Craig

There is nothing "biased" about the "calculations" - these numbers were not invented by me, they are an attempt to quantify the objective reality of the cosmos and are available in many astronomy textbooks, reference works, etc.Your background in statistics should be more than adequate for you to appreciate the inferences drawn from probability when you consider the huge number of galaxies within which some solar systems (similar to ours) will have evolved.It's glib and fatuous to quote Albert Einstein as though what I've been trying to communicate is "unfounded" and an instance of what Einstein criticised.

I took many Statistics classes at University to earn a degree in Finance.Perhaps your calculations are an attempt to fit your biased, unfounded POV?“If the facts don’t fit the theory, change the facts” – Albert Einstein

Your are, very strictly speaking, correct. It's not impossible that life on this earth is unique in the universe. Arguments to the contrary, in the absence of verifiable evidence, are based on inferences from probability. The very large numbers involved (of galaxies, stars, etc.) is the premise from which this argument is developed.

First, he argues that the chain of movers must have a first mover because nothing can move itself. (Moving here refers to any kind of change, not just change of place.) If the whole chain of moving things had no first mover, it could not now be moving, as it is. If there were an infinite regress of movers with no first mover, no motion could ever begin, and if it never began, it could not go on and exist now. But it does go on, it does exist now. Therefore it began, and therefore there is a first mover. Second, he expands the proof from proving a cause of motion to proving a cause of existence, or efficient cause. He argues that if there were no first efficient cause, or cause of the universe's coming into being, then there could be no second causes because second causes (i.e., caused causes) are dependent on (i.e., caused by) a first cause (i.e., an uncaused cause). But there are second causes all around us. Therefore there must be a first cause. Third, he argues that if there were no eternal, necessary, and immortal being, if everything had a possibility of not being, of ceasing to be, then eventually this possibility of ceasing to be would be realized for everything. In other words, if everything could die, then, given infinite time, everything would eventually die. But in that case nothing could start up again. We would have universal death, for a being that has ceased to exist cannot cause itself or anything else to begin to exist again. And if there is no God, then there must have been infinite time, the universe must have been here always, with no beginning, no first cause. But this universal death has not happened; things do exist! Therefore there must be a necessary being that cannot not be, cannot possibly cease to be. That is a description of God. Fourth, there must also be a first cause of perfection or goodness or value. We rank things as more or less perfect or good or valuable. Unless this ranking is false and meaningless, unless souls don't really have any more perfection than slugs, there must be a real standard of perfection to make such a hierarchy possible, for a thing is ranked higher on the hierarchy of perfection only insofar as it is closer to the standard, the ideal, the most perfect. Unless there is a most-perfect being to be that real standard of perfection, all our value judgments are meaningless and impossible. Such a most-perfect being, or real ideal standard of perfection, is another description of God.Outstanding, and we are almost ready to jump into the next Chapter, the beginnning of Life.

GW made a gift of his Bible to the Pastor, and of the Church where GW attended in Alexandria.

Again, I have no direct proof to post here on this thread.I offer a most resonable indirect proof, and again, I assert that God explains our most intractable puzzles or riddles of creation and our beginning.With God there is meaning, purpose and LOVE!I don't believe that any Atheist, or Philosophical Naturalist had a satisfactory retort for the Anthropic Principle?The universe seems to have been specially designed from the beginning for human life to evolve. If the temperature of the primal fireball that resulted from the Big Bang some fifteen to twenty billion years ago, which was the beginning of our universe, had been a trillionth of a degree colder or hotter, the carbon molecule that is the foundation of all organic life could never have developed. The number of possible universes is trillions of trillions; only one of them could support human life: this one. Sounds suspiciously like a plot. If the cosmic rays had bombarded the primordial slime at a slightly different angle or time or intensity, the hemoglobin molecule, necessary for all warm-blooded animals, could never have evolved. The chance of this molecule's evolving is something like one in a trillion trillion. There are relatively few atheists among neurologists and brain surgeons and among astrophysicists, but many among psychologists, sociologists, [anthropologists] and historians. The reason seems obvious: the first study divine design, the second study human undesign.

Well, IMO, the Atheists have crashed on the rocks of Reality!Au Contraire! :)Let's play out the odds!Quoting from a Classic - God Exists debate, and quoting William Craig:God provides the best explanation for the complex order in the universe.During the last thirty years, scientists have discovered that the existence of intelligent life depends upon a complex and delicate balance of initial conditions that are simply given in the Big Bang itself. We now know that life-prohibiting universes are vastly more probable than life-permitting universes like ours.How much more probable?Before I share with you an estimation, let me just give you some numbers to give you a feel for the odds. The number of seconds in the history of the universe is about 10^18, ten followed by eighteen zeros. The number of subatomic particles in the entire universe is said to be about 10^80 .Now with those numbers in mind consider the following: Donald Page, one of America's eminent cosmologists, has calculated the odds of our universe existing as one chance out of ten to the power of ten to the one hundred and twenty-fourth power ---a number which is so inconceivable that to call it astronomical would be a wild understatement.[Page's estimation is to be found in L. Stafford Betty and Bruce Cordell, "God and Modern Science: New Life for the Teleological Argument"' International Philosophical Quarterly 27 (1987): 416. In fact, as Page explained to me in personal conversation, Betty and Cordell get the number too low, misinterpreting 10^10(124) to mean (10^10)124, when in fact Page calculated 10(10(124)), an incomprehensibly huge number.]Robert Jastrow, the head of NASA’s Goddard Institute of Space Studies, has called this the most powerful evidence for the existence of God ever to come out of science.[Robert Jastrow, "The Astronomer and God," in The Intellectuals Speak Out About God, ed. Roy Abraham Varghese (Chicago: Regenery Gateway, 1984), p. 22.]Once again the view that the Christian theist has always held, that there is an intelligent designer of the universe, seems to be much more plausible than the atheistic interpretation.

In fact, as Page explained to me in personal conversation, Betty and Cordell get the number too low, misinterpreting 10^10(124) to mean (10^10)124, when in fact Page calculated 10(10(124)), an incomprehensibly huge number.]Robert Jastrow, the head of NASA’s Goddard Institute of Space Studies, has called this the most powerful evidence for the existence of God ever to come out of science.[Robert Jastrow, "The Astronomer and God," in The Intellectuals Speak Out About God, ed. Roy Abraham Varghese (Chicago: Regenery Gateway, 1984), p. 22.]Once again the view that the Christian theist has always held, that there is an intelligent designer of the universe, seems to be much more plausible than the atheistic interpretation.

Your condescending manner is tedious but I will continue in hopes of helping you on your way to Nirvana.It is conceivable that the "Big Bang" was the beginning of this universe but not the first. Expansion and contraction across infinity is a valid theory. I believe the Hindus use the term "yuga" to describe similar ideas.

I would like to stop and ask if someone can post the building blocks of life and the first life creature?What was the first one celled living organism?Without God, as creator and designer, did the building blocks come together?Please note, I want to be fair, so pick yourselves up off the floor and wipe off the blood, have a cool drink of water, that off course tastes so good because of GOD!And, let's get on with the show!

Just look at the title of the thread!I like to start with the bone crushing refutation first and then watch for the Athesitic nihilistic whining of the "faithful" to follow.Were you going to prove our Big Bang, expanding Universe, without God?Where would the purpose be, the meaning? Why Life? Why Humans?Are you ready for LIFE?Look, even if you can't explain the random out come for the building blocks of Life, we could move along to the next chapter! :)

Your are, very strictly speaking, correct. It's not impossible that life on this earth is unique in the universe. Arguments to the contrary, in the absence of verifiable evidence, are based on inferences from probability. The very large numbers involved (of galaxies, stars, etc.) is the premise from which this argument is developed.

O.K. folks, we should move beyond Einstein, the Big Bang, and First Cause with most excellent Fine-Tuning to......Chapter 5 "The First Life: Natural Law or Divine Awe?"A continuation of my comments on Geisler and Turek's book.Naturalistic evolutionists claim that this one-celled amoeba (or something like it) came together by spontaneous generation (i.e., without intelligent intervention) in a warm little pond somewhere on the very early earth. According to their theory, all biological life has evolved from that first amoeba without any intelligent guidance at all. This, of course, is the theory of macroevolution: from the infantile, to the reptile, to the Gentile; or, from the goo to you via the zoo.Even back in High School, I remeber kids rolling their eyes at our Biology teacher. Who really ever believed the warm pool of chemicals theory?Believers in this theory of origin are called by many names: naturalistic evolutionists, materialists, humanists, atheists, and Darwinists (in the remainder of this chapter and the next, we'll refer to believers in this atheistic evolutionary theory as Darwinists or atheists. This does not include those who believe in theistic evolution--i.e., that evolution was guided by God.)Forget the Darwinist assertions about men descending from apes or birds evolving from reptiles. The supreme problem for Darwinists is not explaining how all life forms are related [....] The supreme problem for Darwinists is explaining the origin of the first life. For unguided, naturalistic macroevolution to be true, the first life must have generated spontaneously from nonliving chemicals.The incredible specified complexity of life becomes obvious when one considers the message found in the DNA of a one-celled amoeba (a creature so small, several hundred could be lined up in an inch). Staunch Darwinist Richard Dawkins, professor of zoology at Oxford University, admits that the message found in just the cell nucleus of a tiny amoeba is more than all thirty volumes of the Encyclopedia Britannica combined, and the entire amoeba has as much information in its DNA as 1,000 complete sets of the Encyclopedia Britannica! In other words, if you were to spell out all of the A, T, C, and G in the "unjustly called 'primitive' amoeba" (as Dawkins describes it), the letters would fill 1,000 complete sets of an encyclopedia![....]So here's the key question for Darwinists like Dawkins: if simple messages such as "Take out the garbage--Mom," [...] require an intelligent being, then why doesn't a message 1,000 encyclopedias long require one?[...] when we look at the first one-celled life, the Principle of Uniformity tells us that only an intelligent cause could assemble the equivalent of 1,000 encyclopedias."Not so fast!" say the Darwinists. "You've overlooked time and chance as plausible explanations for how life spontaneously generated."[....]You say, maybe natural laws would do it if we gave them billions of years. No, they wouldn't. Why? Because nature disorders, it doesn't organize things (the fact that nature brings toward disorder is another aspect of the Second Law of Thermodynamics). more time will make things worse for the Darwinists, not better. How so?Let's suppose you throw red, white, and blue confetti out of an airplane 1,000 feet above your house. What's the chance it's going to form the American flag on your front lawn? Very low. Why? Because natural laws mix up or randomize the confetti. You say, "Allow more time." Okay, let's take the plane up to 10,000 feet to give natural laws more time to work on the confetti. Does this improve the probability that the flag will form on your lawn? No, more time actually makes the flag less likely because natural laws have longer to do what they do--disorder and randomize.[Go on, get back up in that plane and throw that confetti 10 times, a hundred times!]That probability is virtually zero. But we believe the probability is actually zero. Why? Because "chance" is not a cause. Chance is a word that we use to describe mathematical possibilities. It has no power of its own. Chance is nothing. It's what rocks dream about. [Nothing is what rocks dream about - Plato]If someone flips a fair coin, what's the chance it will come up heads? Fifty percent, we say. Yes, but what causes it to come up heads? Is it chance? No, the primary cause is an intelligent being who decided to flip the coin and apply so much force in doing so. Secondary causes, such as the physical forces of wind and gravity, also impact the result of the flip. If we knew all those variables, we could calculate how the flip would turn out beforehand. But since we don't know those variables, we use the word "chance" to cover our ignorance.We shouldn't allow atheists to cover their ignorance with the word "chance." If they don't know a natural mechanism by which the first life could have come into existence, then they should admit they don't know rather than suggesting a powerless word that, of course, really isn't a cause at all. "Chance" is just another example of bad science practiced by Darwinists.Ha!That last line should generate some passionate Religious response from the Darwin faithful!

The "Big Bang" is a theory. The expanding universe is an observable fact. Whether it will expand forever or ultimately contract, "Big Crunch", is being studied now. It has to do with total mass including matter that we cannot see. Recently researchers have stated that it looks as though it will continue to expand but I doubt the point is settled.All scientific "proofs" exclude God from the equation.

emoticonXAngry posts like these make me cringe.Ok, one established thing that most creationist forget is that all sciences are related.So, when talking about the "randomness of DNA", i have to say this.The reason DNA is how it is is because of the elements it is composed of (Namely N, H, C, and a Phosphate group (PO4 -3)). The reason the N's and the C's hook up the way they do is because of another science, chemistry.Not all atoms are stable. The most stable of atoms are the noble gasses, which have totally filled valence shells. However, unstable atoms play a little trick. They bind with other atoms and share/distribute electrons so that they can have a completely filled valence shell.Each nucleotide (the building block of DNA) is made up of three parts. A phosphate group, a nitrogenous base, and a pentose sugar.Each of these parts exist because of their stability. For instance, the pentose sugar is made up of five carbons, an oxygen (four C's and 1 O form a ring, and the other C is attached to the number 1 carbon), and many H's. When hooking up C's and O's, there are only certain possibilities that can be created with a fixed amount of energy.So, each of the parts that make up a nucleotide exists because that is a stable configuration.It isnt random. Not all combinations exist. That's like saying if i put a bunch of H and a bunch of O's together, there should be thousands of different molecules created, and only one would be H2O.SO, do NOT claim that DNA must have an intelligent creator because it cannot be random, because science does not claim its structure was the result of random creation. Its structure and creation exists because of chemistry and the properties of the atoms that create it.

What random event started life? I certainly don't say life is random at all. Maybe you could clarify as to what the random event was.Yes, there was one DNA in a cell, then the cell replicated and made two DNA. I don't see what's so difficult...But i didn't build one. Neither did God.

This reminds me of a twilight zone where this one person is getting plastic surgery to get rid of this horrible disorder. They never show anyone's face in the whole thing. Then after the surgery they show the person look in the mirror. His face looks fine but he screams. They then back up to show that all the other beings have a pointed nose, circular eye sockets, and fangs. They say they're sorry the person is still ugly. The lesson: The beauty is in the eye of the beholder. It's all in your head.

You posted volumes of TRUTH Bro'Outstanding, it isn't random! It's chemistry but based first on the fine-tuned balance of the atoms - electrons, protons and neutrons!A fine-tuning that could never have been the result of time + matter + chance.I covered this, but it bears repeating, so that I can refer back to this post:Quote:Getting the Right Molecules:For life to be possible, more than forty different elements must be able to bond together to form molecules. Molecular bonding depends on two factors, the strength of the force of electromagnetism and the ratio of the mass of the electron to the mass of the proton. If the electromagnetic force were significantly larger, atoms would hang on to electrons so tightly no sharing of electrons with other atoms would be possible.

emoticonXAngry posts like these make me cringe.Ok, one established thing that most creationist forget is that all sciences are related.So, when talking about the "randomness of DNA", i have to say this.The reason DNA is how it is is because of the elements it is composed of (Namely N, H, C, and a Phosphate group (PO4 -3)). The reason the N's and the C's hook up the way they do is because of another science, chemistry.Not all atoms are stable. The most stable of atoms are the noble gasses, which have totally filled valence shells. However, unstable atoms play a little trick. They bind with other atoms and share/distribute electrons so that they can have a completely filled valence shell.Each nucleotide (the building block of DNA) is made up of three parts. A phosphate group, a nitrogenous base, and a pentose sugar.Each of these parts exist because of their stability. For instance, the pentose sugar is made up of five carbons, an oxygen (four C's and 1 O form a ring, and the other C is attached to the number 1 carbon), and many H's. When hooking up C's and O's, there are only certain possibilities that can be created with a fixed amount of energy.So, each of the parts that make up a nucleotide exists because that is a stable configuration.It isnt random. Not all combinations exist. That's like saying if i put a bunch of H and a bunch of O's together, there should be thousands of different molecules created, and only one would be H2O.SO, do NOT claim that DNA must have an intelligent creator because it cannot be random, because science does not claim its structure was the result of random creation. Its structure and creation exists because of chemistry and the properties of the atoms that create it.

This one truly deserves a non-response. Either you're changing the subject with a loaded question or being needlessly cryptic or both, I can't tell which.

You posted volumes of TRUTH Bro'Outstanding, it isn't random! It's chemistry but based first on the fine-tuned balance of the atoms - electrons, protons and neutrons!A fine-tuning that could never have been the result of time + matter + chance.I covered this, but it bears repeating, so that I can refer back to this post:Quote:Getting the Right Molecules:For life to be possible, more than forty different elements must be able to bond together to form molecules. Molecular bonding depends on two factors, the strength of the force of electromagnetism and the ratio of the mass of the electron to the mass of the proton. If the electromagnetic force were significantly larger, atoms would hang on to electrons so tightly no sharing of electrons with other atoms would be possible. But if the electromagnetic force were significantly weaker, atoms would not hang on to electrons at all, and again, the sharing of electrons among atoms, which makes molecules possible, would not take place. If more than just a few kinds of molecules are to exist, the electromagnetic force must be more delicately balanced yet.

Again, I would assert that Scientific Materialism, or Philosophic Naturalism and Evolution just can't account for the refined consciousness, and the ability to reflect on beauty or appreciate a poem. Even if it is free verse. (Robert Frost said, writing in free verse in like playing tennis with the net down.)Let me repeat a few challenges for atheists!Belief in God answers life's most intractable questions, puzzles and riddles!Our minds were created to comprehend God, and Nature is an indirect means to see God revealed!And, with our senses and our minds! Consider:The fact of consciousness/subjectivity, intentionality, and various mental properties: * Thomas Nagel writes, "Consciousness is what makes the mind-body problem really intractable." * John Searle notes that "the leading problem in the biological sciences is the problem of explaining how neurobiological processes cause conscious experiences." Moving from purely naturalistic, unconscious processes to the existence of consciousness appears to require a much greater leap than consciousness’ deriving from an ultimate, conscious Being - God!Re: Moss Glenn Falls:* the existence of non-utilitarian beauty, which seems to be better explained by theism than by metaphysical naturalism. We could more easily expect "useless" beauty if God exists than if he does not. Ha! Useless beauty, like my poem?

In Germany, a research team used the new instruments to examine an enormous molecule, the yeast 26S proteasome. (Michael Groll et al, "Structure of 20S Proteasome from Yeast at 2.4 A° Resolution," Nature, 386 (1997), pp. 463-471.)Though not the largest molecule in existence, the yeast 26S proteasome contains over two million protons and neutrons and is the largest non-symmetrical molecule mapped to date. This molecule can only be described as a "wonder." It serves as an intracellular waste-disposal and recycling system. Tiny molecules within the proteasome attach markers (called ubiquitin) to waste material (apparently the cell’s command center informs the marker molecules which proteins are ready for disposal). Since these ready-for-disposal proteins resemble tangled balls of yarn, the first job of the 26S proteasome, after identifying a tagged protein, is to unfold, untwist, and unravel it. This function is performed by an apparatus at each end of the proteasome.Once the targeted protein is straightened out, the proteasome drags it into its core and cuts the protein into segments. These segments are precisely measured by a "ruler" inside the proteasome. The cut-up pieces are then ejected from the proteasome, and a "sanitation" fleet (other proteins) drives by to pick them up and sort them, separating the stuff that can be reused from the stuff that cannot.The complexity of such systems—and these are just two of many—within both the tiny enzyme and the huge yeast reflect a mind-boggling quantity, not to mention quality, of information. Where did that information come from? Who structured these molecules and taught them to perform their functions?Did blind chance and random process? Are they simply self-programmed? Does anything in reality self-program without intelligent input?I see these discoveries as a formidable challenge to the assumption that life arose on its own over a few million years. Perhaps at least some scientists will be prompted by the new data to reconsider their conclusion, to accept the possibility—more accurately, the probability—that living molecules and all living creatures evidence the matchless brilliance and power of a Supreme Creator.(Dr, Hugh Ross)

I agree that it is miraculous that atoms exist the way they do. But it doesn't mean they have a creator.Imagine this: When the Big Bang occured, there were tons and tons of different types of atoms. Some had a greater electromagnetic force, some had a lesser one. The one with a greater force quickly collapsed into themselves, destroying the nucleus and expelling great amounts of energy. The atoms that had a lesser electromagnetic force quickly lost their electrons, and thus lost stability and broke apart. Therefore, the only atoms that were left are those atoms that had the correct electromagnetic force. And those are the atoms we see today.There. An explanation of the existence of our atoms w/o a God.The problem with this argument that you cut and pasted is this:It assumes that elements exist for the sole purpose of creating life.I say, what if the atoms are how they are, and it just so happens that life could imerge from these elements?Consider this analogy:I am building a house. In the forest. I look around to see what I can build my house out of. There is nothing but wood. So, I accomodate the design of my house so that it can be built with wood. Now, what you are doing, is looking at that house, and saying, "Wow, someone must have put all these trees here just so that you could build your house" as opposed to saying, "You built your house out of wood because that is what was lying around." You see?Elements do not exist for the sole purpose of creating life. Life is the result of what was "lying around".

Excellent, Richbee. Now, many atheists claim that whatever energy / matter there is has always existed. At the same time they say the universe had a beginning (the "Big Bang"). Which is it? Sounds like double-talk to me.I just received my book, "I don't have enough faith to be an atheist," by Norman Geisler, and it is a powerful lesson in logic, theistic evidences, and philosophy. I especially love his "Roadrunner" rebuttals to humanistic thinking. It's a howler!

Indeed. Yet another problem that exists with a non-Biblical view of the universe is that of entropy. If some claim that the matter and energy in our universe has always existed, then they have a big problem. In short, the universe is "winding down". Our collegiate textbook, "Biology - the Unity and Diversity of Life" (Starr) states, and I'm paraphrasing, "(because of entropy) eventually, energy conversions will cease to occur, and the mean temperature of the universe will approach absolute zero." Now some say that the earth is an open system and, as such, entropy does not occur here. However, theoretically, the universe as a whole is a closed system. So if the matter and energy of the universe is infinitely old (existed in some form before the Big Bang), then total entropy would have already occurred by now in eons past. Therefore, the universe, and matter and energy, must have had a beginning.

Or did life require a world with that level of water and salt concentration? As for approaching Falls, all you are saying is that you will feel the things they cause. Nothing else.That is far more humbling than some arrogant beleif that some big brother created it

Because it helps us imagine being somewhere peaceful - or if we are somewhere peaceful. The cool water is just a tactile thing that can remind us of it later on.Wouldn't say waterfalls are calming though, impressive like many other examples of extreme force in nature, maybe. Not relaxing though

But, wait! Why do I have the senses to appreciate it? What about the universal appeal of the sound of falling water on the rocks?Why is cool running water so delicious for our souls? Please note that I wrote that for a Lady Doctor practicing in downtown Baltimore, a Pediatrician healing children in the middle of July. Picture this, high humidity, screaming children, 30 - 40 patients per day, sweat, labor, you know waht on your hands, blood and more........crying babies in the pain of needles.I was sending her a poetic picture of cool, crisp, soothing water to tickle her toes and refresh her soul. Her Father is Jewish from Moscow, so the picture of Mikveh came up, and then when I studied waterfalls searching for the most fantastic, or uniquely refreshing picture, I discovered that the foot of the falls is sacred in Buddhism. She is Neopagan, or might be Wiccan.Take the serene state of Peace? Why do we seek rest for our souls? Or, cleansing? Why a ritual bath?The Art of Peace Do not failTo learn fromThe pure voice of anEver-flowing mountain streamSplashing over the rocks. - Morihei Ueshiba

Look into negative ions and waterfalls.

You are skipping around. Someone already posted that life was made from what was "laying around". If there wasn't oxygen we obviously wouldn't breathe air to stay alive, there may have been a substitute. Since the other elements that may have existed instead don't exist, we can't describe them, but we could breathe carbon instead of oxygen, or something else not here today (and if it did, we'd say "What would we do without this element to breathe?" the answer is oxygen) or maybe we wouldn't need to breathe.

O.K. thanks!You have amazing FAITH!There are over 41 elements required for Life, so how did just the right matter start "lying around" on just the right Earth with just the right Star or Sun, etc???What if we were missing Oxygen or Carbon? Or, Iron? Or, zinc? Copper? (I'm trying to remember all the trace elements in the human body)BTW, you forgot about my yeast molecule - an near record! Time + Matter + Chance?

You have the most FAITH of any poster I have witnessed!Harvard professor Stephen Jay Gould reminds you:The pathways that have led to our evolution are quirky, improbable, unrepeatable and utterly unpredictable. Human evolution is not random; it makes sense and can be explained after the fact. But wind back life’s tape to the dawn of time and let it play again-and you will never get humans a second time . . . We cannot read the meaning of life passively in the facts of nature. We must construct these answers ourselves—from our own wisdom and ethical sense. There is no other way. (Footnote 1: Stephen Jay Gould, quoted in David Friend and editors of Life magazine, The Meaning of Life, 33.) :lol:

You are adding things that aren't there SJG just says that the mutations that led to humans were random events. He says nothing about the origins of life. 'Whatever chemicals are lying around' is a bit too extreme but it wouldn't be wrong to say that if the right chemicals are lying around then life will certainly form. Its puddles and holes from your point of view.You are open to more than microevolution if you believe that the right chemicals were placed by a creator - or do you beleive that animals appeared fully formed and that any resemblance to them arising from chemicals is purely coincidental?

from About.comC.S. LewisClive Staples LewisDates:Born: November 29, 1898 in Belfast, IrelandDied: November 22, 1963 in Oxford, EnglandBiography:C.S. Lewis was an author, a scholar of English literature and a famous Christian apologist. During the 1920s he was an Oxford don and chair of Mediaeval and Renaissance Literature. At this time he would later say that he was an atheist but began to move towards a committed, evangelical flavor of Anglicanism.His fame as an author came on two fronts. One was his fictional works, the most popular of which is the Chronicles of Narnia collection of works for young people, seven books which incorporate Christian themes and doctrines allegorically. The second front of his fame as an author came with books which were more openly written in defense of traditional Christian doctrines. These include the popular The Screwtape Letters, a collection of letters of advice from a demon to his nephew, and the famous book, Mere Christianity which had begun as a series of radio talks in 1941Because of his simple style and advocacy of traditional, orthodox beliefs in a manner which is easily accessible, Lewis' apologetical works have become standard reading for Christians in the United States. He doesn't talk down to his audience; instead, he treats them as equals and writes for them rather than for philosophers and theologians. One of the consequences, however, is that his arguments often have extensive flaws in their logic and reasoning. His writings may serve as a basic introduction to basic Christian doctrines, but anyone who relies extensively upon them will be ill served in any serious discussion about Christian theology or religious philosophy.Endlessly quoting biased sources really has no utility in a debate.

Time to play this game by Richbee's rules:I COULD tell you why the universe happened by chance, but let me show you what this website has to say instead:The Argument from Probability Before addressing the question of how the laws of physics can have come about in the absence of intelligent design, let me provide a response to the arguments from probability outlined above. If we properly compute, according to statistical theory, the probability for the universe existing with the properties it has, the result is unity! The universe exists with one hundred percent probability (unless you are an idealist who believes everything exists only in your own mind). On the other hand, the probability for one of a random set of universes being our particular universe is a different question. And the probability that one of a random set of universes is a universe that supports some form of life is a third question. I submit it is this last question that is the important one and that we have no reason to be sure that this probability is small. I have made some estimates of the probability that a chance distribution of physical constants can produce a universe with properties sufficient that some form of life would have likely had sufficient time to evolve. In this study, I randomly varied the constants of physics (I assume the same laws of physics as exist in our universe, since I know no other) over a range of ten orders of magnitude around their existing values. For each resulting "toy" universe, I computed various quantities such as the size of atoms and the lifetimes of stars. I found that almost all combinations of physical constants lead to universes, albeit strange ones, that would live long enough for some type of complexity to form (Stenger 1995: chapter 8). This is illustrated in figure 1. (picture found on website)Figure 1. Distribution of stellar lifetimes for 100 random universes in which four basic physics constants (the proton and electron masses and the strengths of the electromagnetic and strong forces) are varied by ten orders of magnitude around their existing values in our universe. Otherwise, the laws of physics are unchanged. Note that in well over half the universes, stars live at least a billion years. From Stenger 1995. Every shuffle of a deck of cards leads to a 52-card sequence that has low a priori probability, but has unit probability once the cards are all on the table. Similarly, the "fine-tuning" of the constants of physics, said to be so unlikely, could very well have been random; we just happen to be in the universe that turned up in that particular deal of the cards. Note that my thesis does not require more than one universe to exist, although some cosmological theories propose this. Even if ours is the only universe, and that universe happened by chance, we have no basis to conclude that a universe without some form of life was so unlikely as to have required a miracle.  http://atheism.about.com/gi/dynamic/...aqs/cosmo.html

what is wrong with an article is that the arguments presented are not yours. typically, in debate especially, only primary sources are used. i don't mind debating Behe, or the entire AiG website, but when you are on this thread posting, I expect to be debating YOU and YOU only. I don't care to try to refute and entire article.Besides trying to make a point or change someone's idea, the spirit of debate is to excercise the brain, and to challenge the opponent into making rational and reasonable rebuttals. If all you do is cut and paste articles, you may think you are changing peoples minds, but frankly, i don't care for the articles, because it has not shown me what YOU can respond with. It only shows me that you are well read.Debating is NOT about making people believe in what you believe. Leave that to the media spinners, the JW, and the wild protesters. Debating is NOT about being right or being wrong. Debating is simply a excercise of the mind. It's whether or not you can create an understandable argument.I wish everyone here went through high-school and college debate. It's a real eye opener. One of the first things we learn is that it doesnt matter if you believe in it, you should still be able to debate it.I think you are so caught up proving to everyone else you are right that you have forgotten the simple pleasures in creating a rational argument.So please, don't cut and paste.I encourage you to do some research. Don't look for others arguments that agree with your idea. Try to create those arguments yourself. If you believe in creation so much, go buy yourself a Biology book (i suggest Campbell and Reece's "Biology: Sixth Edition") and read through it looking for flaws. If you find any, you'll have the satisfaction that you had made that argument all by yourself, and I will have the encouragement to debate YOU, not a web-site.
