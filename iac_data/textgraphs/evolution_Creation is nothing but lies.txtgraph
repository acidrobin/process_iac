You never get any thing new. You never see one animal evolve into another. And therefore its not the evolution that counts as Macro.

Since I'm in a good mood today, I've decided to help "Angelsweety89 " out by fixing her post for her, thus allowing me to reply to it.The theory of evolution grew in part out of the discovery of fossils. The fossil record wasn't "made" by "evolutionists", evolution as an idea grew out of people looking at the fossil record. The fossil record is one of the key things that provides the means to falsify evolution theory. SImply find a single genuine example of say a cow, goat, chimp, pig, horse or human fossil in the same rock strata as a cretacious dinosaur for example and evolutionary theory would take a large knock. Find a bunch of them in devonian rocks for example and it would come tumbling down, utterly falsified. Well your reply makes no sense, but my statement did. One of the best examples of DNA evidence for evolution is found in our very own chromosome 2. Our close relatives, the other apes, do not have a chromosome 2: they have two chromosomes (2p and 2q) that when joined together form a very similar base sequence to our chromosome 2 (including telomeres right in the middle of chromosome 2 in humans just where we would expect it to be if it were formed from a fusion of two separate chromosomes).Not personally, no. Experiments by others though, both in the lab and in the field, have reported instances of new species forming of Rhagoletis sp, Drosophila sp, Eurosta sp and Tribolium sp to name just a few.Yes I am aware that it isn't evidence. In your haste to criticise, you missed the implication of what I said: there is a vast store of evidence in support of evolution. I've merely touched the surface. Allow me to offer a few more:4. the eye of cephalopods is a far better "design" than that of vertebrates. Evolution only allows for characteristics to be inherited from ancestors, not adopted from unrelated concurrent species. This is what is observed with the vertibrate eye.5. The avian lung is a far better "design" than that of mammals. Again evolution only allows for characteristics to be inherited from ancestors, not adopted from unrelated concurrent species. This is what is observed with the avian lung.6. The discovery of Archaeopteryx offered evidence that birds evolved from dinosaurs. The implication of this is that some dinosaurs probably had feathers. We have recently uncovered numerous examples of featured dinosaur fossils in China.Want more?Sorry? Where have you told me these "tons of things"? You have offered no evidence at all in support of your position: just a puerile "I aksed first" reply.Excellent. Can you therefore pelase explain to me the relationship between Hamilton's rule of kin selection and the coefficient of relatedness?What a curious mixture of metaphors.Hmm, perhaps you would care to read http://www.blessedquietness.com/jour...chu/hovind.htm for example. That's the problem with being duped: one is generally unaware of it. If you were aware, then you wouldn't have been duped."Carbon Dating" can only date items up to 60,000(ish) years old. "Carbon Dating" cannot be used to test whether the earth is billions of years old or not. Carbon dating works brilliantly when used correctly. It has even been used to date artifacts related to events described in the Bible (creationists oddly enough seem quite happy with carbon dating just so long as it gives a figure of less than 6,000 years). That is because you are a "silly creationist" emoticonXClown

Explain to me why in 50 years, in parts of isolated Hawaiian forests, species that formerly mated have changed so that they have different DNA, do not mate with each other, and have subsantially different phenotypes, is that not the definition of macroevolution as in regardles to how it is classifed?

Creation vs. EvolutionA Debate.The creation stories recorded in world religions are not science. Evolution is science. Evolution is the natural explanation for a nature world. Evolution is the process by which the characteristics of a species change over time (Discover Biology p.11). Science seeks to explain the natural world and its explanations are tested using evidence from the natural world. (Evolution Berkeley). Data is gathered to learn about the natural world. In a “nutshell” the process of science is, ideas are developed through reasoning, claims are based on testing explanations against observations of the natural world and rejecting the ones that fail the test, and finally claims are subjected to peer review and replication (Evolution Berkeley). The simplest explanation has the advantage, this principle is called parsimony i.e. 1. The snails, nautiloids, squids, octopi and cuttlefish have the basic body parts.2. The shell of a nautilus and its extinct relatives, the ammonites, is very similar to the shell of a snail.3. The tentacles of an octopus, when carefully examined, can be seen to be a modified snail’s foot.4. The stomachs of all members of this group have the same arrangement of parts. One possible explanation is that these animals have independently acquired equivalent organs through a remarkable series of coincidences, but the most likely explanation is that these animals inherited similar organs through common ancestry. That is parsimony. (Evolution Berkeley). The conclusions of science are reliable, though tentative. Science is always a work in progress, and its conclusions are always tentative. Scientific conclusions are not tentative in the sense that they are temporary until the real answer comes along. Conclusions are well founded in their factual content and thinking and are merely tentative only in the sense that all ideas are open to scrutiny. (Method p.11). Tentativeness means that scientist are willing to modify their ideas as new evidence appears. The central ideas of evolution are that life has a history- it has changed over time and that different species share common ancestors.(Evolution Berkeley)The Evidence1. Fossil Records for transitional forms, and clues at the cellular level. http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosit...ossil_ev.shtml2. Homologies http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosit...mologies.shtml3. Chronology and geography http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosit...ribution.shtml4. Artificial Selection, Ecology, experiments and nested hierarchies. http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosit...by_examp.shtml ( Dawkins p. 169-194).Evolution is the scientific explanation for the origin of species. Science is based on reliable principals. The means of science is empirical in nature and are verified by experiments. Scientific claims are reviewed by peers and replicated. Science addresses a different subject matter than religion. The mode of thinking in religion is faith, but science is empirical.

In a “nutshell” the process of science is, ideas are developed through reasoning, claims are based on testing explanations against observations of the natural world and rejecting the ones that fail the test, and finally claims are subjected to peer review and replication (Evolution Berkeley). The simplest explanation has the advantage, this principle is called parsimony i.e. 1. The snails, nautiloids, squids, octopi and cuttlefish have the basic body parts.2. The shell of a nautilus and its extinct relatives, the ammonites, is very similar to the shell of a snail.3. The tentacles of an octopus, when carefully examined, can be seen to be a modified snail’s foot.4. The stomachs of all members of this group have the same arrangement of parts. One possible explanation is that these animals have independently acquired equivalent organs through a remarkable series of coincidences, but the most likely explanation is that these animals inherited similar organs through common ancestry. That is parsimony. (Evolution Berkeley). The conclusions of science are reliable, though tentative. Science is always a work in progress, and its conclusions are always tentative. Scientific conclusions are not tentative in the sense that they are temporary until the real answer comes along. Conclusions are well founded in their factual content and thinking and are merely tentative only in the sense that all ideas are open to scrutiny. (Method p.11). Tentativeness means that scientist are willing to modify their ideas as new evidence appears. The central ideas of evolution are that life has a history- it has changed over time and that different species share common ancestors.(Evolution Berkeley)The Evidence1. Fossil Records for transitional forms, and clues at the cellular level. http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosit...ossil_ev.shtml2. Homologies http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosit...mologies.shtml3. Chronology and geography http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosit...ribution.shtml4. Artificial Selection, Ecology, experiments and nested hierarchies. http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosit...by_examp.shtml ( Dawkins p. 169-194).Evolution is the scientific explanation for the origin of species. Science is based on reliable principals. The means of science is empirical in nature and are verified by experiments. Scientific claims are reviewed by peers and replicated. Science addresses a different subject matter than religion. The mode of thinking in religion is faith, but science is empirical.

ok so you believe in evolution? thats what im understanding. so where did evolution start? and where did creation start? which one would you believe?

Personally I believe religions are a product of human society, which is bourne out by the archaeology and sociology. Things which could be interpreted as having religious significance exist in the archaelogical record at least to the last period of glaciation.My own hypothesis is that religion itself evolved as part of humanity's survival mechanism. In the Middle East amongst the Sumerian culture Religion and politics became entwined which is what we are still dealing with now.That isn't to say religion has no value, rather it is a resource, or a guide to ancient cultures etc. and to the environment in which each religion evolved.The Shamanic forms are most useful in this respect though all religions show a tendency towards teaching respect for others and for the environment in which we live, to greater or lesser extent.

In the broadest sense of the word, from the very beginning of time, if not 'before'. Things that can make stable copies of themselves start to appear in large numbers than those which can't. If there is competition - the thing that can do this best will be more common and may replace things that can not make copies as well when forced to compete for materials. As for life on earth, they started evolving as soon as you get a molecule that can copy itself (probably being somekind of nucleotide template).Religious creation likely comes as a byproduct of the brain that deals with potential predators it can't see. As the brain develops the situations it can imagine as possibilities become more complicated and the vague dark area by the lake where you need to be cautious merges with visions often brought on by hallucinogenic foods.Eventually previous mysticism and superstition begins feeding itself so people are imagining more complex and abstract things in the dark area by the lake.

hey, I'm just curious, does anybody believe in both? I do, i was just wondering if I was the only one.See, the way i look at it, we have some pretty good evidence that evolution happened, depending on how you define the word. If you mean we evolved out of slime, there is no proof of that. But what about evolving from something like neanderthals? I mean, we've been able to trace back the evolutionary chain of dogs, cats, horses, reptiles, insects, etc etc. Not evolving from nothing, but evolving out of something.I do believe in god, or what I guess you could call god. I think life was placed on this planet. But is it not possible, even probably, that god placed lifeforms here designed to evolve? It kinda makes sense, ya know? It's a survival mechanism, an extremely lengthy and much more complex process than when a fox's fur turns color depending on the time of year, but it's the same basic thing.To me, I think evolution is the proof of creation and god, not the antithesis.

Your skulls are very similar, especially to a group of primative reptiles known as synapsids.

Well, the arise of multi cellular organisms has been observed in the lab - you either have slime moulds that spend most of their life as small single celled organisms but can form a multicellular colony that can then differentiate parts of itself to spore. Or, in some very simple tests on single celled algae where the selection process is purely you drain some of their liquid habitat off every now and then after a few generations most of the algae will be of a type that clumps together rather than floaating freely.Then on top of that, the Man'o'war jellyfish is not one creature, but a colony of several different types of organism. The jump from a co-operating colony to a multicellular organism is not that hard to imagine.Oxygen respiration is higly conserved (the enzymes are very similar to each other across a massive evolutionary distance) and likely arose first in creatures like phosphoresant bacteria found in the sea. The enzymes used here are purely for getting rid of oxygen which would otherwise poison the organism. Its electron transport chain in its oxygen removal system is very, very similar to our version (though we have a bit tagged on the end to make use of the byproducts).

If God is incapable of falsehood, why would he intentionally design a world that would lead rational minds to follow the evidence to evolution? Clearly either the process used was evolution (whether started, seeded, in a universe created by God or not) or God has planted false evidence to mislead people and then damn them.Course if you don't have a omnipotent, all good God then you are back at sqaure one again - if his power is not infinite then there are things that he could not or has not done.

I do not follow what you are arguing here. There are animals that have "beating hearts", but do not breath air as an example, they are called fish. There are animals that have brains but no heart such as the earthworm. It is a mystery to me why you would claim that biology cannot explain these features. God created using evolution, this is obvious. He even let lots of intermediate stage animals live until today so that we might better understand how he evolved life.

Science is athiestic (some here prefer I say nontheistic) and does not care a hoot for whether there is a god or no. It does not seek to prove god does not exist and it does not seek to prove god does exist. Good science doesn't even pass judgement on whether "he" was involved or not in the event.Science says "Once there was an animal with no heart. Then there was an animal with a simple heart. Then there was an animal with a complex heart. This we know from careful study and investigation. We also know from careful study and investigation that DNA provides the code for this and changing the code over time would cause the heart to evolve as observed". Thus and only does science truly talk about evolution: it reports what it sees. There should be no conflict with religion in this regard, no?

Trouble is there is the 'Ooo ee ooo oo' factor with theorectical scientists - where something they say sounds cool, but really makes no sense whatsoever and means very little.At its very essence the unknown and God become one - by trying to fit something that exists beyond all kind of human understanding into a nice replica of a human you clearly show that you completely missed the whole 'beyond human understanding' part.If the being is truly as it has to be, then what you beleive is really irrelevant - its a choice based upon the situations created by the universe. At the very basic caveman level, and at the most advanced scientific level God is the system of the universe. It may be sentient in a way similar to something we can vaguely consider but without knowing how it works there is no way we can know how it thinks. Internal consistancy is the main problem most organised religion has - unless you can claim to understand a being that doesn't even exist in, let alone use the same physical laws as you do then anything that is supposedly said by it is meaningless.You have no way of telling whether its complete lies to be followed; designed for some greater purpose later on, abosolute truth that needs to be followed or intended for people to pick holes in so they turn instead to what they are supposed to do. If God is not human, then the teachings of religion are irrelevant and open to complete personal interpretation or to be ignored without any threat of divine punishment as in this case you are just as likely to be damned to eternal punishment for following the rules as not. Its only the actions of other individuals that contain your actions.Alteratively, God is subject to human understanding in which case there is a huge problem that some information will be forever beyond your knowledge and therefore Gods, not to mention that the actions of God in the bible are subject to individual interpretation as much as any other human viewpoint.All that changes is that some lying entity is more powerful than you, which again means that you are just as likely to arbitary punishment as if the entity was a God beyond human understanding. Infact in this case, if the afterlife is not purely random or non-existant yet still governed my an entity with motives understandable by humans then God requires worship.In this case then it is best to ultilies this need that they have of you and your fellow men to ensure that this is an equal exchange rather than to enslave yourself to a complete unknown that is just as likely to punish you for obeying the rules (or despite obeying the rules). Without a need for worship there is no reason for either party, God or Man, to pay attention to anything the other says.

Sounds fair - especially seeing as Jesus had to die to make up for God punishing someone who couldn't even realise they had done something wrong until they had actually commited the act.Without any knowledge of good and evil, free will is just a curse if you are going to be punished for making choices that you have no chance of understanding.

Why don't you believe in the invisible pink unicorns that live behind your sofa?

Missed the point there though, if God is evil, or just wildly beyond human ideas of fairness then there is no point beleiving in him. He is just as likely to be lying, or trying to make you choose the correct path by making religion as preposterous as possible as tell the truth.So you live in fear of God and limit yourself or discriminate against others, and I do what I want and live how I will and we are both as likely to go to Hell or Heaven as each other.Its the real version of Pascal's wager

Well, lets not get into vacuum state physics and the relation between matter and energy...but trees arn't made of nothing, and with the help of someone else I could make a human fairly easily.

The old testament is a combination of creation myths from a nomadic culture from 2600 years ago, followed by a bit of historical fiction, and then some rules to make up a way to prevent assimulation into other religions. The gospels are fairy tales through and through.Neither are science books. I mean, the bible talks about wizards, witchs, talking snakes, talking donkeys, and you say WE have to believe it or else??

Ok then - for the first point yes, since all creatures were supposedly made by god that would include the unicorns.Second point would be that they evolved from invisible light red pre-horses

its our human nature to go against everything God has for us. because we think were right. that gives us the immature amounts of "ego" in this world. too many people are so full of themselves that they dont even realize it until one day an 18 wheeler totals their 1985 porsche! God has to kick you in the butt one day and the more you walk away from him the harder he will hit to make you realize whats true. and why you ask does such a supposedly loving God do that? well simple i answered it in the question. because he loves us so much he sent his ONLY son to DIE for US. now thats going into the truth of God's word which you probably already know and dont believe. but see thats where ego comes and kicks you in the butt. you have the truth right in front of you and you think its wrong. why may i ask?

what your ignorance wont let you understand is that they are all one (the trinity) yet seperate beings - Father son and the holy spirit God sent Jesus the man form to earth. and its takes alot of love to do this. try being beaten and whipped until your organs were hanging out and having thorns stuck in you and people spitting on you and cursing you. then on top of that endure 8 to ten hours of being stuck no nailed on a cross( the nails going through your feet and hands) pushing yourself up to breathe because your diapraghm no longer supports you because it is hangin out as welll.

Yet we are talking of a being that could do miracles and was in some respects God, if we brush the very slightest on the trinity.Seems only fair that after 4000 odd years God is curious to what he condemned man to for his own failure to understand the rules he made for his own creation.Or was it more like possession? A man died but the holy spirit within him just ascended back to heaven to be reborn? For an immortal entity I don't think any kind of human punishment can equal that of what real humans feel if there is no threat of real ceasation.

Prove it. Any of it.You see, this is why the Creation and Arc stories (and I emphasis that they are stories) are important. Because if they are proven to be false (and they have been. Let me repeat that, those parts of the bible are false) then all of the bible must be thrown into doubt. We must question all of it. Me must treat all of it as myth until it can be independantly verified by an objective third party.

And why must we? You seem to be assuming that having a fantasy religion is less desirable than not having one. In a Darwinistic sense, it appears best to believe whatever your probable mates believe, especially if it is be fruitful and multiply. Darwin actually insists that people be stupid, and be so stupid as to not be convinced through argument (sex, of course, is another matter). Therefore, just enjoy the irony.

The relatively new field of neurotheology suggests that it's in our nature to believe in God. A brief overview of some of the ideas.First, research is showing that belief in God may be neurologically prewired into humans. During spiritual moments - feelings of oneness with the Universe - our brains show distinctive patterns of activity/nonactivity. In fact, one of the regions affected is just the part of the brain that helps maintain the self/nonself boundary: when this part of the brain is cut off from receiving input, one's boundary stops being sharply defined - it dissolves, so to speak - and s/he feels a spiritual oneness with everything. Also, temporal lobe epilepsy can produce out of body AND religious experiences (one woman who had just given birth, and had temporal lobe epilepsy, told her husband how wonderful it was to have given birth to Christ). So when one experiences spiritual/religious moments, they are tied to physiological activity in the brain: and, activation of the brain has been shown capable of causing such experiences.Second, consider belief in God to already have arisen in some ancient population of humans. Would natural selection tend to preserve this mode of thought or eliminate it? Retain it. The feeling of optimism that is associated with belief in a higher power and an afterlife is beneficial. Religion has several positive psychological affects. But that doesn't make it true.A couple of books on these matters are:"Why God Won't Go Away: Brain Science and the Biology of Belief", Andre Newberg, Eugene D'Aquili, & Vince Rause, Ballantine Books, 2001"The God Gene: How Faith is Hardwired into OUr Genes", Dean Hamer, Doubleday, 2004If you mean that many people come to believe in God only after when they hit rock bottom financially or emotionally, or are in some other way in a sorry state, such as on death's bed or in the emergency room or cancer ward, then I agree. Now WHY might that be a time many people are converted? Psychological reasons! The optimism associated with belief in a higher power and an afterlife allows one to have hope and push on.PS: I just saw something typical on TV that made me chuckle. I was watching one of the amazing video shows and a man in the navy, while on an aircraft carrier, was walking by a jet about to launch. He got sucked into the engine ... OUCH! His whole body was taken in and he was messed up pretty good, but didn't die because his helmet got lodged in the blades and temporarily stopped the blades and another crew member immediately signalled for the pilot to shut down the jet. So this guy, when interviewed, says that God must have been looking out for him. WHAT? So God let this guy get sucked into a jet engine ... that's looking out for a person? Tell you what, God, please don't do me any favors!!!!

Speaking of stupid (not an accusation), why do you not believe in Zalmoxis ( Salmoxis), supreme god of the Thracian Getae and Dacians. Known only from the writings of Herodotus.

Once things can be explained by purely natural means, we stop relying on the the supernatural. How do the planets maintain their orbits? Does God push them around the Sun, as was once thought because no known natural method was available? Is the explanation the modern, scientific explanation, which requires nothing but natural processes?We're not quite that far with neurotheology, but we'll continue to gain more knowledge of the underlying physiology.There's no empirical evidence for God's existence, and the indirect "scientific" evidences (those of YEC, ID, etc.) have been countered, and all the while the gaps to stuff a God into have been decreasing in number and size. And now the deep personal experiences of God that are the main basis for many people's belief are beginning to be explained physiologically: activate the temporal lobe and you just might get a religious experience. The position that religion is just a psychological crutch, whose underlying physiological components have been retained by natural selection due to the optimism they produce, keeps getting better supported.

ok saying God was greater than him was a term of repsect dumbbutt. yes they are healed and yes they arent healed.its God's decision. if youre humble sure hell bless you. but it also says honor your father and mother so your days will be long on the earth.

He prayed to himself?Yeah, I know he did because it says so in the Bible. ;) Many people are prayed for and do not heal.Mighty christian of ya, thanks. emoticonXClown Right, because I'm a human and Jesus wasn't. But he had a choice?Oh, I've read them.Tell me, after Jesus rose again, did Mary see it being rolled away or was it rolled away when she got there?Or should I read the part where Jesus says he is equal to God then read the part where he says he's not?John 10:30 I and my Father are one.John 14:28 Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.

Isn't that more an example of how people can look at situations from an optimistic or pessimistic viewpoint?I think our turbine-ingested deck crewman was an optimist and despite his dreadful accident still looked at it from a positive perspective: someone saw him get sucked in and was able to get the pilot to switch of the jet and save his life. The fact that he said God was looking out for him just shows that he is religious- if it had been myself I would have said I was lucky to have crewmates who reacted quickly and in the right way to save my life.

The relatively new field of neurotheology suggests that it's in our nature to believe in God. A brief overview of some of the ideas.First, research is showing that belief in God may be neurologically prewired into humans. During spiritual moments - feelings of oneness with the Universe - our brains show distinctive patterns of activity/nonactivity. In fact, one of the regions affected is just the part of the brain that helps maintain the self/nonself boundary: when this part of the brain is cut off from receiving input, one's boundary stops being sharply defined - it dissolves, so to speak - and s/he feels a spiritual oneness with everything. Also, temporal lobe epilepsy can produce out of body AND religious experiences (one woman who had just given birth, and had temporal lobe epilepsy, told her husband how wonderful it was to have given birth to Christ). So when one experiences spiritual/religious moments, they are tied to physiological activity in the brain: and, activation of the brain has been shown capable of causing such experiences.Second, consider belief in God to already have arisen in some ancient population of humans. Would natural selection tend to preserve this mode of thought or eliminate it? Retain it. The feeling of optimism that is associated with belief in a higher power and an afterlife is beneficial. Religion has several positive psychological affects. But that doesn't make it true.A couple of books on these matters are:"Why God Won't Go Away: Brain Science and the Biology of Belief", Andre Newberg, Eugene D'Aquili, & Vince Rause, Ballantine Books, 2001"The God Gene: How Faith is Hardwired into OUr Genes", Dean Hamer, Doubleday, 2004If you mean that many people come to believe in God only after when they hit rock bottom financially or emotionally, or are in some other way in a sorry state, such as on death's bed or in the emergency room or cancer ward, then I agree. Now WHY might that be a time many people are converted? Psychological reasons! The optimism associated with belief in a higher power and an afterlife allows one to have hope and push on.PS: I just saw something typical on TV that made me chuckle. I was watching one of the amazing video shows and a man in the navy, while on an aircraft carrier, was walking by a jet about to launch. He got sucked into the engine ... OUCH! His whole body was taken in and he was messed up pretty good, but didn't die because his helmet got lodged in the blades and temporarily stopped the blades and another crew member immediately signalled for the pilot to shut down the jet. So this guy, when interviewed, says that God must have been looking out for him. WHAT? So God let this guy get sucked into a jet engine ... that's looking out for a person? Tell you what, God, please don't do me any favors!!!!

It's much more economical for large populations.Again, if Jesus was an ordinary human and not god incarnate, then he wouldn't have been able to heal the sick and do all those neat tricks.Jesus, according to your religion, was not an ordinary human.Any "suffering" was done by almighty god and wasn't suffering at all.And if Jesus died for me, then he's dead.

It wasn't addressed to me, but...Before delving into a lengthy and somewhat technical discussion, let me address a common YEC misrepresentation, which is to assert that evolution should be rejected (for example, not taught in public schools) because “evolution is only a theory”. This Creationist catch phrase is disingenuous.To help focus what otherwise could be a quite wide-ranging extensive discussion, let’s see how the two opposing views fair as explanations for just one key biological event…the origin of humans. The scientific explanation for the origin of humans is, of course, evolution; while the YEC position is special creation (divine intervention in the creation of our species) Scientific origin of humansWhat does science have that verifies its position that humans are the result of evolution? Fully supported and demonstrated underlying principles, for one! The following is the “in a nutshell” version. Science has shown that DNA stores genetic information, in its base sequences. Science has shown that it is the genotype (genetic makeup) of an organism that determines its phenotype (outward appearance or biochemical properties). Science has shown that changes made to DNA base sequences result in altered phenotypes. Science has shown that mutations – changes in the DNA base sequences (that can be inherited) – occur spontaneously, changing the information stored and therefore the phenotype. Thus, there is a fully supported scientific explanation for why organisms are as they are (why they have the morphology and biochemical properties they do) as well as how their morphology/biochemical properties can change over time … completely naturally. Logic and experimentation have shown the next key factor: natural selection. Individuals in a population, though very similar to one another, differ. Because of individual differences in the members of a population, some will be more fit than others: in the particular environment the population finds itself in, some individuals will have a better chance of surviving and/or reproducing, thus having a better chance of passing on their own genes to the next generation. This differential passing on of genes into future generations (with “fitter” genes being more likely to be passed on that less “fit” ones) leads to changes in the genetic makeup of generations over time: more technically, the population’s allelic frequencies change, and therefore, by definition, evolution – microevolution, to be more precise – has occurred. And as one might expect, as the genetic makeup of a population changes, so too do the morphology and/or biochemical properties of its members. Thus, there is a fully supported scientific explanation for how populations evolve. In addition to all of the sound reasoning that indicates speciation would occur in the wild, science also has documented cases of such: both for plants (for example, by means of allopolyploidy) and for animals (for example, by allopatric speciation). Also, note that according to most biologists, speciation is a macroevolutionary event: thus, Creationists cannot legitimately claim that only microevolution is well supported by scientific observations. So we see that science has a fully supported theoretical model for speciation, which has been confirmed by observations and lab experiments.We see, then, that evolution itself stands on firm, well supported, scientific ground.The rest is often times said to be nothing more than extrapolation...because microevolution and speciation have been observed in the short amount of time that biologists have been examining organisms, there is reason to believe that additional time would allow for larger scale evolution, such as “humans from chimps” (sticking with the common Creationist misconception). But is this just extrapolation? No! Multiple scientific evidences support the position that humans and chimps shared a common ancestor. First, human and chimp DNA is between 95% and 99.4% identical (it depends upon whether or not one counts insertions and deletions and whether or not one looks at just protein-coding genes). Second, although chimps have 24 pairs of chromosomes and humans only 23 pairs, one of the human chromosomes is the result of a fusion of two separate chromosomes our common ancestor with chimps possessed. Is this just an ad hoc explanation for why we humans have one less pair of chromosomes? No. That fusion occurred can be seen by examining the 2 chimp chromosomes that would have fused and noticing the match of banding patterns and the presence of telomere sequences in the middle of the corresponding one human chromosome. Third, the banding patterns of at least two human chromosomes (chromosomes 2 and 6) are virtually identical to those of the corresponding chromosomes in chimps (and some other primates, such as orangutans). Fourth, unlike nearly all other animals, humans cannot synthesize vitamin C because the needed gene has at some point in the past become nonfunctional: it’s a pseudogene. Chimps and other primates too cannot manufacture vitamin C because their genes also are nonfunctional pseudogenes.Fifth, both humans and great apes have nonfunctional Uox (urate oxidase) genes. Further, the nucleotide substitution that causes the human and great ape genes to be nonfunctional is identical.Sixth, the beta-globin genes in humans and chimps (and gorillas) are organized in the same manner, and pseudogene versions of one those genes share multiple, identical substitutions in the three species.Seventh, both humans and chimps have a CYP21P pseudogene, and both are pseudogenes because they share the same 8-basepair deletion.Eighth and ninth, the ZNF75B gene (which codes for a zinc finger protein; zinc finger proteins are one type of DNA-binding protein, and their binding to DNA can influence the expression of other genes) is a pseudogene in both humans and chimps (as well as gorillas and orangutans), and the ZNF75 gene in humans and its homolog in chimps are both located on Xq26 (a particular region of the queen – that is, longer – arm of the X chromosome).Tenth, a COX4 pseudogene (which codes for a protein used in the “electron transport chain” of aerobic respiration) just under 2,000 DNA bases long is shared by humans, chimps, and gorillas…but is not found in orangutans or macaque monkeys.And eleventh…Besides the many genetic evidences that humans and chimps share a common ancestor, there are also the expected - and several possibly unexpected - anatomical similarities between chimp and human brains. The following pictures show (if you are already familiar with the anatomy of the human brain) that the chimpanzee brain is a near twin of ours (the biggest anatomical giveaway that this is a chimp’s brain is that the brain stem projects backwards, instead of downwards as it does in humans…because of our upright posture).(image from http://brainmuseum.org/Specimens/pri...himp6sect6.jpg)1) There is an asymmetry in the planum temporale in both human and chimp brains.2) A further brain asymmetry is shared between humans and chimps: that of the hippocampus. Yet the nearby amygdala is symmetrical in both.3) Because of their neuroanatomy, most chimps, like humans, are right handed.4) Can an animal seeing its reflection in a mirror recognize the reflection as being of itself? No. Unless it is one of an extremely few exceptional species, such as humans, chimpanzees, or orangutans.So that we humans evolved from a common ancestor we shared with chimps is not mere extrapolation from the confirmed processes of microevolution and speciation: rather, it is also supported by a multitude of convincing genetic and neurological evidences.YEC ORIGIN OF HUMANSLet’s see, what observations or objective information tell us that a supernatural being poofed fully formed man into existence, only about 6 to 10 thousand years ago, and then yanked out a rib to create woman? None. Zip. Zilch. All that supports those religious assumptions is a book written several thousand years ago, translated and mistranslated time after time over the years during various transcriptions of it, with the book containing second-hand and third-hand stories, written by people completely ignorant of modern biology, astronomy, geology, physics, and other sciences, as well as being grossly superstitious. But let’s spend a few minutes considering what it would mean for a Creationist God to have created humans. More precisely, we are looking at two possible explanations for human origins: Creation (special creation by God about 10,000 years ago) and evolution (our species arising by descent with modification over millions of years). Let’s consider just the first piece of genetic evidence provided above (the ~99% identity between chimp and human DNA) and ask which of the two possibilities is the better explanation.According to Creationists, God is an all-knowing, all-powerful, all-righteous supernatural being who created the entire Universe in only 6 days: His powers are unlimited and He knows the past, the present, and the future. But then why would God have created humans and chimps to share ~99% identity in their DNA? First, God could have created humans with completely different DNA sequences, but He didn’t. For example, God could have zapped humans into existence with a gene for hemoglobin that is only, say, 50% or 75% identical to that of chimpanzees. Why did God make it exactly identical? Worse, why did He make the human and chimpanzee base sequence for hemoglobin identical, yet make them different from that of other animals? And, in just the right manner to give the supposedly false illusion of a hierarchical system (groups within groups) of relationships, that He also tricked scientists into believe by falsely creating a vast number of other genes that also demonstrate the same nested grouping? For some unexplained reason, God knowingly chose to make our DNA – not just for hemoglobin, but for a whole host of other genes too - so similar to chimps that it convincingly gives the supposedly false illusion that we share a common ancestor with them? Why? That would be knowingly misleading … grossly misleading. But wait, there’s more.Second, God is all powerful and not limited by the laws of nature…He could have created humans that didn’t even have DNA! We humans could be based on some weird genetic molecule called “ZNA”, made of inorganic metals like zinc and iron, while all other life was based on DNA. Now that would be great evidence that we were created separately from all other life. So why wouldn’t God have done that? Instead, He chose – knowing the future – to create humans with DNA, and with DNA ~99% identical to chimps, to mislead people into falsely believing humans and chimps evolved from a common ancestor? Third, why did God even create chimps? If God didn’t create chimps (and other similar primates) that are so genetically similar to humans, which He assuredly could have done, we wouldn’t even be having this discussion! He didn’t have to create chimps in order to create humans…He controls the whole Universe. Maybe He wanted to plant more misleading evidence…laying it on extra thick. All of these things God did, intentionally, knowing the future. Why? It sure appears that He did so specifically to mislead future scientists into believing “the lie” of evolution.

Once things can be explained by purely natural means, we stop relying on the the supernatural. How do the planets maintain their orbits? Does God push them around the Sun, as was once thought because no known natural method was available? Is the explanation the modern, scientific explanation, which requires nothing but natural processes?We're not quite that far with neurotheology, but we'll continue to gain more knowledge of the underlying physiology.There's no empirical evidence for God's existence, and the indirect "scientific" evidences (those of YEC, ID, etc.) have been countered, and all the while the gaps to stuff a God into have been decreasing in number and size. And now the deep personal experiences of God that are the main basis for many people's belief are beginning to be explained physiologically: activate the temporal lobe and you just might get a religious experience. The position that religion is just a psychological crutch, whose underlying physiological components have been retained by natural selection due to the optimism they produce, keeps getting better supported.

There are things that man cannot know, but somehow has a need to know, so they make something up or jump on a preexisting bandwagon fueled by faith - believing in something that cannot be proved. The Christian, Jewish and Muslim religions all have one God, a general practitioner, to call on for all things. The Greeks, Aztecs and others had many Gods, specialists, for every thing from war to wine, whose favors could be had for the appropriate sacrifice, such as a goat or a virgin (this would be a difficult thing today since our supply of virgins is at an all time low). In studying today's main religions, I have reached the conclusion that if all professed believers would actually practice what they preach, we would have a better world.Dono

i'm agree with you, religions at large preach good things to follow up, is on my view men themselves (and in special the politicians) who are in charge to break and even bring those good things down, so if regretabily this world goes so wrong are not precisely the religions which should be responsibles for that.

There are things that man cannot know, but somehow has a need to know, so they make something up or jump on a preexisting bandwagon fueled by faith - believing in something that cannot be proved. The Christian, Jewish and Muslim religions all have one God, a general practitioner, to call on for all things. The Greeks, Aztecs and others had many Gods, specialists, for every thing from war to wine, whose favors could be had for the appropriate sacrifice, such as a goat or a virgin (this would be a difficult thing today since our supply of virgins is at an all time low). In studying today's main religions, I have reached the conclusion that if all professed believers would actually practice what they preach, we would have a better world.Dono

It wasn't addressed to me, but...Before delving into a lengthy and somewhat technical discussion, let me address a common YEC misrepresentation, which is to assert that evolution should be rejected (for example, not taught in public schools) because “evolution is only a theory”. This Creationist catch phrase is disingenuous.To help focus what otherwise could be a quite wide-ranging extensive discussion, let’s see how the two opposing views fair as explanations for just one key biological event…the origin of humans. The scientific explanation for the origin of humans is, of course, evolution; while the YEC position is special creation (divine intervention in the creation of our species) Scientific origin of humansWhat does science have that verifies its position that humans are the result of evolution? Fully supported and demonstrated underlying principles, for one! The following is the “in a nutshell” version. Science has shown that DNA stores genetic information, in its base sequences. Science has shown that it is the genotype (genetic makeup) of an organism that determines its phenotype (outward appearance or biochemical properties). Science has shown that changes made to DNA base sequences result in altered phenotypes. Science has shown that mutations – changes in the DNA base sequences (that can be inherited) – occur spontaneously, changing the information stored and therefore the phenotype. Thus, there is a fully supported scientific explanation for why organisms are as they are (why they have the morphology and biochemical properties they do) as well as how their morphology/biochemical properties can change over time … completely naturally. Logic and experimentation have shown the next key factor: natural selection. Individuals in a population, though very similar to one another, differ. Because of individual differences in the members of a population, some will be more fit than others: in the particular environment the population finds itself in, some individuals will have a better chance of surviving and/or reproducing, thus having a better chance of passing on their own genes to the next generation. This differential passing on of genes into future generations (with “fitter” genes being more likely to be passed on that less “fit” ones) leads to changes in the genetic makeup of generations over time: more technically, the population’s allelic frequencies change, and therefore, by definition, evolution – microevolution, to be more precise – has occurred. And as one might expect, as the genetic makeup of a population changes, so too do the morphology and/or biochemical properties of its members. Thus, there is a fully supported scientific explanation for how populations evolve. In addition to all of the sound reasoning that indicates speciation would occur in the wild, science also has documented cases of such: both for plants (for example, by means of allopolyploidy) and for animals (for example, by allopatric speciation). Also, note that according to most biologists, speciation is a macroevolutionary event: thus, Creationists cannot legitimately claim that only microevolution is well supported by scientific observations. So we see that science has a fully supported theoretical model for speciation, which has been confirmed by observations and lab experiments.We see, then, that evolution itself stands on firm, well supported, scientific ground.The rest is often times said to be nothing more than extrapolation...because microevolution and speciation have been observed in the short amount of time that biologists have been examining organisms, there is reason to believe that additional time would allow for larger scale evolution, such as “humans from chimps” (sticking with the common Creationist misconception). But is this just extrapolation? No! Multiple scientific evidences support the position that humans and chimps shared a common ancestor. First, human and chimp DNA is between 95% and 99.4% identical (it depends upon whether or not one counts insertions and deletions and whether or not one looks at just protein-coding genes). Second, although chimps have 24 pairs of chromosomes and humans only 23 pairs, one of the human chromosomes is the result of a fusion of two separate chromosomes our common ancestor with chimps possessed. Is this just an ad hoc explanation for why we humans have one less pair of chromosomes? No. That fusion occurred can be seen by examining the 2 chimp chromosomes that would have fused and noticing the match of banding patterns and the presence of telomere sequences in the middle of the corresponding one human chromosome. Third, the banding patterns of at least two human chromosomes (chromosomes 2 and 6) are virtually identical to those of the corresponding chromosomes in chimps (and some other primates, such as orangutans). Fourth, unlike nearly all other animals, humans cannot synthesize vitamin C because the needed gene has at some point in the past become nonfunctional: it’s a pseudogene. Chimps and other primates too cannot manufacture vitamin C because their genes also are nonfunctional pseudogenes.Fifth, both humans and great apes have nonfunctional Uox (urate oxidase) genes. Further, the nucleotide substitution that causes the human and great ape genes to be nonfunctional is identical.Sixth, the beta-globin genes in humans and chimps (and gorillas) are organized in the same manner, and pseudogene versions of one those genes share multiple, identical substitutions in the three species.Seventh, both humans and chimps have a CYP21P pseudogene, and both are pseudogenes because they share the same 8-basepair deletion.Eighth and ninth, the ZNF75B gene (which codes for a zinc finger protein; zinc finger proteins are one type of DNA-binding protein, and their binding to DNA can influence the expression of other genes) is a pseudogene in both humans and chimps (as well as gorillas and orangutans), and the ZNF75 gene in humans and its homolog in chimps are both located on Xq26 (a particular region of the queen – that is, longer – arm of the X chromosome).Tenth, a COX4 pseudogene (which codes for a protein used in the “electron transport chain” of aerobic respiration) just under 2,000 DNA bases long is shared by humans, chimps, and gorillas…but is not found in orangutans or macaque monkeys.And eleventh…Besides the many genetic evidences that humans and chimps share a common ancestor, there are also the expected - and several possibly unexpected - anatomical similarities between chimp and human brains. The following pictures show (if you are already familiar with the anatomy of the human brain) that the chimpanzee brain is a near twin of ours (the biggest anatomical giveaway that this is a chimp’s brain is that the brain stem projects backwards, instead of downwards as it does in humans…because of our upright posture).(image from http://brainmuseum.org/Specimens/pri...himp6sect6.jpg)1) There is an asymmetry in the planum temporale in both human and chimp brains.2) A further brain asymmetry is shared between humans and chimps: that of the hippocampus. Yet the nearby amygdala is symmetrical in both.3) Because of their neuroanatomy, most chimps, like humans, are right handed.4) Can an animal seeing its reflection in a mirror recognize the reflection as being of itself? No. Unless it is one of an extremely few exceptional species, such as humans, chimpanzees, or orangutans.So that we humans evolved from a common ancestor we shared with chimps is not mere extrapolation from the confirmed processes of microevolution and speciation: rather, it is also supported by a multitude of convincing genetic and neurological evidences.YEC ORIGIN OF HUMANSLet’s see, what observations or objective information tell us that a supernatural being poofed fully formed man into existence, only about 6 to 10 thousand years ago, and then yanked out a rib to create woman? None. Zip. Zilch. All that supports those religious assumptions is a book written several thousand years ago, translated and mistranslated time after time over the years during various transcriptions of it, with the book containing second-hand and third-hand stories, written by people completely ignorant of modern biology, astronomy, geology, physics, and other sciences, as well as being grossly superstitious. But let’s spend a few minutes considering what it would mean for a Creationist God to have created humans. More precisely, we are looking at two possible explanations for human origins: Creation (special creation by God about 10,000 years ago) and evolution (our species arising by descent with modification over millions of years). Let’s consider just the first piece of genetic evidence provided above (the ~99% identity between chimp and human DNA) and ask which of the two possibilities is the better explanation.According to Creationists, God is an all-knowing, all-powerful, all-righteous supernatural being who created the entire Universe in only 6 days: His powers are unlimited and He knows the past, the present, and the future. But then why would God have created humans and chimps to share ~99% identity in their DNA? First, God could have created humans with completely different DNA sequences, but He didn’t. For example, God could have zapped humans into existence with a gene for hemoglobin that is only, say, 50% or 75% identical to that of chimpanzees. Why did God make it exactly identical? Worse, why did He make the human and chimpanzee base sequence for hemoglobin identical, yet make them different from that of other animals? And, in just the right manner to give the supposedly false illusion of a hierarchical system (groups within groups) of relationships, that He also tricked scientists into believe by falsely creating a vast number of other genes that also demonstrate the same nested grouping? For some unexplained reason, God knowingly chose to make our DNA – not just for hemoglobin, but for a whole host of other genes too - so similar to chimps that it convincingly gives the supposedly false illusion that we share a common ancestor with them? Why? That would be knowingly misleading … grossly misleading. But wait, there’s more.Second, God is all powerful and not limited by the laws of nature…He could have created humans that didn’t even have DNA! We humans could be based on some weird genetic molecule called “ZNA”, made of inorganic metals like zinc and iron, while all other life was based on DNA. Now that would be great evidence that we were created separately from all other life. So why wouldn’t God have done that? Instead, He chose – knowing the future – to create humans with DNA, and with DNA ~99% identical to chimps, to mislead people into falsely believing humans and chimps evolved from a common ancestor? Third, why did God even create chimps? If God didn’t create chimps (and other similar primates) that are so genetically similar to humans, which He assuredly could have done, we wouldn’t even be having this discussion! He didn’t have to create chimps in order to create humans…He controls the whole Universe. Maybe He wanted to plant more misleading evidence…laying it on extra thick. All of these things God did, intentionally, knowing the future. Why? It sure appears that He did so specifically to mislead future scientists into believing “the lie” of evolution.

Let me explain a bit more in depth why I object to your attempted redefintion of God.You are trying to define that which is SUPERNATURAL as being PURELY NATURAL. That’s would be a direct contradiction, and could be considered a silly thing to try to do. Hence, one reason I said you’re playing a silly word game. In addition, you are trying to define that which is considered a BEING as being that which is NOT a being. And you are trying to define that which is PERFECT as being that which is NOT perfect. And you are trying to define that which has WISDOM with that which does NOT have wisdom. Finally (at least as far as I'll point out), you are trying to define that which humans WORSHIP with something you say should NOT be worshipped. The commonly accepted ideas of what God is, on the one hand, and what you were proposing on the other, are not consistent with one another. Now, if we were to follow your lead and redefine God as being the laws of nature and all of matter, then we would no longer be talking about God, but rather, about the laws of nature and all of matter. If the two things were exactly equal, as you propose, then there would no longer be any need for the superfluous word – indeed, THE UTTERLY SUPERFLUOUS CONCEPT - GOD. And what would be wrong with our just redefining SANTA CLAUS as being the laws of nature and all of matter? (Would public schools have to start allotting equal time to the study of Santa Claus in science classes?!?!) Of course, I imagine you’d recognize THIS attempt at a redefinition as being just a silly word game. I see the two as quite similar.One might look at it this way … you yourself show that you are playing a silly word game by having to mention that you would be REDEFINING God. PS: I have heard something about Pantheists (IIRC), and believe they hold a view at least somewhat similar to what you were proposing, but I'm not any more familiar with their position than that. If you feel your proposal had some merit you might want to check into their views.

[QUOTE=Tastyfish]I'm not breaking the worship no other god bit, but other than that its just the same, except I get to decide how to live my life.[QUOTE]There is more freedom in Christ than there is without.But I know this makes no sense.. it's kind of like explaining democracy to a communist. Most are perfectly content to keep the status quo.

I guess it is hard to understand how 3 beings could be the same, but not the same at the same time.. but illogical? Some things are just hard to visualize and understand. I do not dismiss things that I cannot understand as flawed. For example, I don't know how to visualize a 7 dimentional object, or even draw one... but that doesn't make it logically flawed, just beyond the 4 dimentional constraints of my brain.And yes, crucifiction was very much symbolic of a substitution of the animal sacrifice, the old sacrifice, that is exactly the point. Christ became that sacrifice, once and for all.He had to. Or his sacrifice would have been meaningless.Again, God as man. Means exactly that, a man. This is a duality argument. We'll just go round and round. It's obvious that we won't agree. It's a faith argument for me, and a logical argument for you.I said time travel because you implied that only Jesus could grant supernatural powers.. so I just picked someone from a different era than Jesus.Now I see that you meant that God the Father could grant supernatural powers, at any time to anyone. But your original argument was that the reason why Jesus was God was because he was granted special powers from God... so, it follows that this can't be the reason why he is God.. that would make everyone who had special powers God. Right?

Yes, the Bible is full of contradictions and things that are just plain wrong.That's really all there is to it.You can pull out your apologetica all you like, but plainly the entire premise of Jesus/God "dying" for people's sins pretty weak (and silly).Even if it weren't logically flawed, can't you see that it was attempting to substitute the old barbaric practice of animal sacrifice?In what way does this demonstrate the Jesus experiences life as an ordinary human in every way?It just says he became a high priest and and that he was tempted and "suffered."Again, how much can god really "suffer"?(as much as he wants...)Why would he have to time travel to be infused with superpowers by God?The bible is filled with people doing superhero stuff.These powers were always given by god.At that point, these were no ordinary humans.They were superheros.They wouldn't have made it into scripture otherwise.

If you bothered to read the old testament, you would know that a blood sacrifice is not requried for atonement.Seems to me a requirement for a human sacrifice is pretty meaningless as it is.Numbers 23:19. God is not a man that he should lie, god is not the son of man that he should repent.

How convenient.That's really all it's about, convenience.This is my point. There was no real sacrifice.The display that was intended to look like a sacrifice is meaningless.As I sort of said before, God can suffer as much or as little as he wants, when he wants.And if it's the almighty "suffering" then what kind of sacrifice is that?I guess the bush I'm beating around is this:If God is indeed all powerful then what did he sacrifice?It can't be his son if his son was himself and didn't actually die anyway.Yes, but I thought you weren't quite sure when you said before "IF god exists..."Jesus was around before 1 AD.Jesus is the Creator. He is the alpha and the omega.He is God.Or am I mistaken about your religion?Nope, that's not what I was saying.You said Jesus was an ordinary human.I said he was not since he was God almighty.I said he healed the sick etc.You said that Jesus's disciples did this also.I said they did this only after being granted special powers by God/Jesus.Then you said that people who lived on Earth before Jesus also had superpowers.I said they did only after being granted these powers by Jesus/God.Jesus/God/HS grants all the powers to ordinary humans making them superhuman.Now, are you saying that Jesus was just an ordinary human that relied on God to grant him superpowers?

The scientific method puts ideas into a frame work and then whittles away all of the nonsense until the final result is apparent.In a world of infinite choices, science has focused the knowledge and understanding of mankind in such a way to allow freedoms like we never imagined.Communism is an environment of slavery of the mind, where less than 1% of the population actually understand the other possibilites that exist and 99% have no choice.

This is comparing the philosophy of faith and reason though, not specifically Christianity. The only additional freedom you get is that you can beleive in whatever you want, physically you are restrained by the same rules regardless of how much you beleive in gravity, however religions tend to reduce the number of acceptable actions.For crying out loud, firstly the point I was making was that democracy and communism are not so alien ideas that its impossible to understand both. Secondenly, how is what you say any better than 1% of the population having the resources to carry out the possibilities that exist and the other 99% having to just look on in envy or be totally unware?Communism isn't evil in the slightest, far from it especially when capitilism (which is significantly, slightly more dubious ;)) its just an idea, one that hasn't been applied very well. Just the same as comparing Christianity and the Crusades

Numbers 19:23 God is not a man that he should lie. God is not the son of man that he should repent.

Let’s take a look at the soap opera that was Abraham (originally called Abram in the Bible) and Sarah (originally called Sarai in the Bible).What? Our dear father Abraham not only has concubines, but also slept with another woman, and they had a baby, while he was married to Sarah? Well, in fact, several leading male characters have multiple wives simultaneously in Genesis.But does God condone this? Yes! So God doesn’t even think about punishing Abraham, Sarah, or Hagar. In fact, he seems pretty cool about the whole thing!Oddly enough, the ‘opposite’ happens too. That is, Sarah and Abraham ‘pretend’ to be brother and sister instead of husband and wife, so the beautiful Sarah is taken to Pharaoh who marries her: now Sarah is married to two men at once. But let’s not let Abraham off too easily. It’s not like he just slept with one servant girl while he was married. What? Our dear father Abraham had concubines? And not concubine, but concubines … plural. Good thing no one believes the Bible should be used as a moral guide.Before moving on, let me expose more of the soap opera. Abraham and Sarah are married, and they sleep together but it takes a while before they eventually have a son. The icky part is that Sarah is Abraham’s half sister!You see, Abraham and Sarah pull their little ‘trick’ on someone else: they say that they are brother and sister instead of husband and wife, and once again, another man takes Sarah for his own (though he never gets around to marrying or sleeping with her).Yuck!!! Maybe the Bible is trying to tell us, “Incest is best, put your sister to the test!” Well, if you think about what happened to Lot, maybe the Bible’s message in sex is, “Incest is best, put your father to the test!”Was just sleeping with a bunch of other women while married to Sarah his only personality flaw? Nope.What a horrible thing for any father to do to his son. Does anyone really think Isaac just passively stood there and let his father bind him and lay him up on an altar to be burned alive? Of course not ... that's why Abraham had to bind him. There must have been an intense struggle: the young boy must have been physically overpowered by his father, bound, then laid up on the altar. Horrifying. And as if that nightmare weren’t enough, then Isaac – bound and helpless - had to watch as his father came at him wielding a knife with which to slay him! I guess the Bible is trying to teach us that if we hear voices in head, we should do what they say, no matter how gruesome the act might be. Sure, that’s the right thing to do.But there’s more to the story than the awful example Abraham sets for parents. It shows that God is not infallible!The Bible tells us quite clearly that God said Isaac was Abraham’s only son. In fact, God – or the angel of the Lord, who seems to be God himself, or at least able to speak with authority on God’s behalf – says it twice more: a total of three times in that one story.So is Isaac really Abraham’s only son, as God said? No! So we know Abraham had another son, Ishmael, and that he outlived Abraham. But maybe Ishmael was not yet born when God commanded Abraham to kill his ‘only’ son Jacob. Nope!Ishmael was the son that Abraham had with the maidservant, Hagar, that his wife Sarah told him to sleep with, which he did and she got pregnant and had a child. That happened back in Genesis 16; it’s not until Genesis 22 that God commands Abraham to kill his ‘only’ son Isaac.Well, maybe the chronology in the Bible is out of whack, and what happened in Genesis 22 actually occurred before that which happened in Genesis 16. Nope!Remember, back in Genesis 16 the reason that Sarah gives her servant to Abraham to sleep with is because Sarah has not yet bore any children. Yet Isaac is Abraham’s and Sarah’s son! So Isaac had to come after Ishmael, since Sarah had not yet had any children when Abraham had Ishmael through Hagar.That’s logic, and it’s air tight. But there’s actually even better, direct proof in the Bible.Note that Ishmael was Abraham’s son, and was already 13 years old when God told Abraham that he would have a son named Isaac in one year. So clearly Ishmael was born before Isaac.Further, note that we are told in Genesis 21:5 that Abraham was 100 years old when Isaac was born, but he was only 99 when he was circumcised, which, on that same day, Ishmael was already 13. Again, clearly Ishmael was born before Isaac.Also, remember that Ishmael was there when Abraham died.So Ishmael was born 13 years before Isaac, and was still living after his father had died. That means that Ishmael, Abraham’s first son, had to have been alive when God commanded Abraham to kill his ‘only’ son Isaac.There’s no way that Isaac was Abraham’s only son when God command Abraham to kill his ‘only’ son Isaac. God goofed.What are a few things we have learned about the Bible/Genesis in this quick look at Abraham and Sarah.1) Men having sex with other women while married is okay.Abraham slept with another woman – a servant named Hagar – while he was married to Sarah, and God not only didn’t seem to mind, he seemed to give it a good ole two thumbs up.2) A man having multiple concubines is okay.3) Incest is okay … sure, go ahead and marry, sleep with, and have kids by, your half sister.4) If you hear voices in your head telling you to overpower your son, tie him up, throw him up on some firewood, brutally stab him, and then burn him to death, by all means, the right thing to do is to go ahead and do it.5) God makes mistakes.He didn’t even know that Abraham had another son, Ishmael.

Originally posted by CushThis is one of the things that really annoys me about religion; the assumption that there are things which cannot be understood by "our feeble minds".Who says our minds are feeble? Consider the amount of knowledge contained within the mind of a man c100,000 years ago. Now consider the amount of knowledge you could contain within your mind in the present day after a lifetime of studying history, maths, science and philosophy. That doesn't seem very feeble to me.The original concept of a God was born from ignorance - people didn't know how to explain natural disasters, the stars, the seasons, illness, or pretty much anything. So everything was attributed to a God. We are still left with mysteries today, but the big ones are the origins of the universe and of life. (We've come a pretty long way from pondering the cause of rain, haven't we?)Of course these are the things that the faithful cling to in order to "prove" their God's existence. "How can you explain our existence," they clamour, "without accepting that God did it? It is too complex! It is beyond us!"I believe that it is not beyond us. If science is allowed to progress, eventually we will understand the mechanisms behind the mysteries.If we could ask ancient man to prove his God's existence, he would smile and say "Who else brings the rain? Who else moves the sun across the sky?"

Well I don't believe in God but I always thought that the main thing about prayer was for comfort and calming. Say a loved one just died, and you pray to God to make it all right. A believer would feel better because it is something that seems above your power to control and submitting to a higher power to control it for you is comforting. The reason I don't pray is that I wouldn't be comforted by it anyway because I don't believe it's true.

No, this is in fact micro evolution and she is right. It may be a slightly different bacteria, but it is still bacteria and is in no way comparable to macro evolution or one species turning into another. The bacteria is still a bacteria.What you are talking about is akin to survival of the fittest. And the fittest will adapt to their environment, but they will not change species.Or a better example is that what you are saying is the same as someone who would use the many different dogs as an example of change. Surely a chihuahua cannot be the same as a great dane. Well yes, they are both dogs and come from the same family and have been manipulated to look that way, but there is a limit on even this change. The chihuahua is only so small and the great dane will only get so big. Either way they are still dogs.

What you are asking to see - something like a reptile evolve into a mammal - typically takes millions of years to occur. Why would you even expect humans to be able to see that occur firsthand? What we have are multiple, independent lines of evidence that show us that this occurred in nature. We have transitional fossils, anatomical similarities, genetic similarities, and similar embryonic development, as well as a supported, purely natural theory that explains all of the similarities.Here's an interesting example of "missing links" in the evolution of multicellularity from unicellular organisms.

Lets us simplify then as I am sure we are both aware, neither of us can prove without a doubt scientifically that a. evolution is a fact or b. God is real.And, rather than carry on two simultaneous arguments, I will suggest we continue this on the other board as it directly relates to what I believe that you absolutely cannot prove. And that is the origin of life.Ergo, my argument on the other board.

But I would like to add, you are wrong, I do not want to see this first hand. Also, we do not have this in fossils, if we did there would be no doubt would there. Can we agree that animals didn't take big huge leaps from fish to lion? yes, then where are all the linking fossils? No linking fossils means it didn't happen.Again, this is exactly the argument I have started on the other board. Lets continue there.

What you are asking to see - something like a reptile evolve into a mammal - typically takes millions of years to occur. Why would you even expect humans to be able to see that occur firsthand? What we have are multiple, independent lines of evidence that show us that this occurred in nature. We have transitional fossils, anatomical similarities, genetic similarities, and similar embryonic development, as well as a supported, purely natural theory that explains all of the similarities.Here's an interesting example of "missing links" in the evolution of multicellularity from unicellular organisms.

God is?? Where is any evidence of that what so ever?

Lets us simplify then as I am sure we are both aware, neither of us can prove without a doubt scientifically that a. evolution is a fact or b. God is real.And, rather than carry on two simultaneous arguments, I will suggest we continue this on the other board as it directly relates to what I believe that you absolutely cannot prove. And that is the origin of life.Ergo, my argument on the other board.

Oh, but you are most certainly wrong. Evolution can be, and has been, 'proven' scientifically to be a fact.

That's quite silly. 1) If "I" have an explanation for everything related to life's diversity, except for the origin of life itself, then "I" have an explanation for everything related to life's diversity, except for one thing ... the origin of life itself. Makes sense, doesn't it? "Everything with one exception" is vastly different than "nothing".2) By your own reasoning, if you cannot prove the origin of God, then you have nothing. And since you can't prove the origin - let alone the mere existence - of God, then you have nothing! Did you realize your logic shot down your own argument?

You do realise, don't you, DE, that you can show a creationist any number of transitional fossils - even such an extensive and exquisitely detailed display as your talkorigins links - and s/he will still chant the mantra: 'There are no transitional fossils. There are no transitional fossils. There are no transitional fossils...'.Conceding on this one would so undermine the whole creationist position that they cannot even contemplate it.

I know that you really really want to believe it doesn't work. However, that little study that you printed before has flaws the size of the Grand Canyon riddled through it. There are too many variables to quantify.I'm sorry if you prayed for the ability to fly, or turn invisible when you were younger, only to find nothing but unanswered prayers. And got bitter about it.But, me thinks you are missing the point. Prayer is not only a petition, it is also a supplication for oneself.If nothing else, you are definitely not lukewarm. Which is a plus.

That's not what the Bible teaches. It's a way to communicate with and petition God ... paraphrasing, whatever you ask for in prayer, if you believe, you will receive it. Problem is, prayer does NOT work.

Let’s take a look at the soap opera that was Abraham (originally called Abram in the Bible) and Sarah (originally called Sarai in the Bible).What? Our dear father Abraham not only has concubines, but also slept with another woman, and they had a baby, while he was married to Sarah? Well, in fact, several leading male characters have multiple wives simultaneously in Genesis.But does God condone this? Yes! So God doesn’t even think about punishing Abraham, Sarah, or Hagar. In fact, he seems pretty cool about the whole thing!Oddly enough, the ‘opposite’ happens too. That is, Sarah and Abraham ‘pretend’ to be brother and sister instead of husband and wife, so the beautiful Sarah is taken to Pharaoh who marries her: now Sarah is married to two men at once. But let’s not let Abraham off too easily. It’s not like he just slept with one servant girl while he was married. What? Our dear father Abraham had concubines? And not concubine, but concubines … plural. Good thing no one believes the Bible should be used as a moral guide.Before moving on, let me expose more of the soap opera. Abraham and Sarah are married, and they sleep together but it takes a while before they eventually have a son. The icky part is that Sarah is Abraham’s half sister!You see, Abraham and Sarah pull their little ‘trick’ on someone else: they say that they are brother and sister instead of husband and wife, and once again, another man takes Sarah for his own (though he never gets around to marrying or sleeping with her).Yuck!!! Maybe the Bible is trying to tell us, “Incest is best, put your sister to the test!” Well, if you think about what happened to Lot, maybe the Bible’s message in sex is, “Incest is best, put your father to the test!”Was just sleeping with a bunch of other women while married to Sarah his only personality flaw? Nope.What a horrible thing for any father to do to his son. Does anyone really think Isaac just passively stood there and let his father bind him and lay him up on an altar to be burned alive? Of course not ... that's why Abraham had to bind him. There must have been an intense struggle: the young boy must have been physically overpowered by his father, bound, then laid up on the altar. Horrifying. And as if that nightmare weren’t enough, then Isaac – bound and helpless - had to watch as his father came at him wielding a knife with which to slay him! I guess the Bible is trying to teach us that if we hear voices in head, we should do what they say, no matter how gruesome the act might be. Sure, that’s the right thing to do.But there’s more to the story than the awful example Abraham sets for parents. It shows that God is not infallible!The Bible tells us quite clearly that God said Isaac was Abraham’s only son. In fact, God – or the angel of the Lord, who seems to be God himself, or at least able to speak with authority on God’s behalf – says it twice more: a total of three times in that one story.So is Isaac really Abraham’s only son, as God said? No! So we know Abraham had another son, Ishmael, and that he outlived Abraham. But maybe Ishmael was not yet born when God commanded Abraham to kill his ‘only’ son Jacob. Nope!Ishmael was the son that Abraham had with the maidservant, Hagar, that his wife Sarah told him to sleep with, which he did and she got pregnant and had a child. That happened back in Genesis 16; it’s not until Genesis 22 that God commands Abraham to kill his ‘only’ son Isaac.Well, maybe the chronology in the Bible is out of whack, and what happened in Genesis 22 actually occurred before that which happened in Genesis 16. Nope!Remember, back in Genesis 16 the reason that Sarah gives her servant to Abraham to sleep with is because Sarah has not yet bore any children. Yet Isaac is Abraham’s and Sarah’s son! So Isaac had to come after Ishmael, since Sarah had not yet had any children when Abraham had Ishmael through Hagar.That’s logic, and it’s air tight. But there’s actually even better, direct proof in the Bible.Note that Ishmael was Abraham’s son, and was already 13 years old when God told Abraham that he would have a son named Isaac in one year. So clearly Ishmael was born before Isaac.Further, note that we are told in Genesis 21:5 that Abraham was 100 years old when Isaac was born, but he was only 99 when he was circumcised, which, on that same day, Ishmael was already 13. Again, clearly Ishmael was born before Isaac.Also, remember that Ishmael was there when Abraham died.So Ishmael was born 13 years before Isaac, and was still living after his father had died. That means that Ishmael, Abraham’s first son, had to have been alive when God commanded Abraham to kill his ‘only’ son Isaac.There’s no way that Isaac was Abraham’s only son when God command Abraham to kill his ‘only’ son Isaac. God goofed.What are a few things we have learned about the Bible/Genesis in this quick look at Abraham and Sarah.1) Men having sex with other women while married is okay.Abraham slept with another woman – a servant named Hagar – while he was married to Sarah, and God not only didn’t seem to mind, he seemed to give it a good ole two thumbs up.2) A man having multiple concubines is okay.3) Incest is okay … sure, go ahead and marry, sleep with, and have kids by, your half sister.4) If you hear voices in your head telling you to overpower your son, tie him up, throw him up on some firewood, brutally stab him, and then burn him to death, by all means, the right thing to do is to go ahead and do it.5) God makes mistakes.He didn’t even know that Abraham had another son, Ishmael.

Well, that is what Paul said. Jesus said differently. The people who are alleged to known Jesus in his lifetime stayed religious Jews. This guy whosaw Jesus in a heat stroke vision when traveling made the changes.

Nope. Bible's wrong. So the Bible says that if your son is a wild man he is not actually your son? Perhaps another reason not to believe anything in it.

Yes, but personally I believe that it is more inspirational to teach mostly the good. I was always taught to believe in a loving personal God. And that is great. I don't like it when preachers teach hell and damnation. I believe that God wants people to come to him out of a sense of love not fear.That's some religious people. It does not represent the community as a whole, like me for instance.No, I think that those type of people just forget about this stuff. I think that this is exactly what contributes to the bibles authenticity. Yes, of course it does. That's why they call it the greatest book every written. It is real life. It is gritty. It is harsh reality. Not some suger coated dream world. No, you totally don't get it. At that time, God spoke directly to people. And if you had God speaking to you you would follow his requests. Or take Job for example. God wasn't talking to him at all and yet no matter how he seemed to be cursed, he still loved God. You may call that crazy, but I call that REAL faith.

This is my 997th post, the majority of them in the "Creation vs Evolution" section. No, I didn't just get here.The problem you have is that your claim that "life or abiogenesis is so complex as to require a designer" is a simple statement of personal incedulity, ie you find it impossible to image how life could have started without a designer. I have no such failure of imagination and can imagine how life could have started without a designer. Both positions are simple personal opinion though as we do not know, and probably never will know, how life started. Unfortunately people holding the same opinion as you try to promote ID as more than just an opinion. Yes it is a possiblity, but so is the idea that life started when the giant spaghetti monster crapped upon the Earth whilst cruising through the solar system.

Well, no. The believer will always tell you that his heart is his truth. When you believe you have first hand experience that the non-believer can never know. That is why you don't understand how we can be so sure, and we don't understand how you can't be sure.

It doesn't sound like just a hope.. and you can not know if there is anything out there to answer, or if a prayer is answered at all if there is. I am sure it does make you feel better, but is it anything but a placebo?

Right, uh huh. That sounds like a big rationalizing to me.

hahahahahahhahahahhahahaNow that is funny.Ok so by your logic, not having any evidence of something is not proof that it didn't happen. So, that's more like saying, just because when you got home your door was still locked and nothing was missing or moved and no strange hair on the floor, doesn't mean you didn't get robbed by a hairy man.hahahahhahhha. that's a good one.You obviously havn't read my posts have you. I had specifically made the point that even if you could prove evolution, it wouldn't disprove God because people believe that life started by intelligent design and not by some freak fluke impossible accident. Anything else funny man?

No its first hand experience. That was my point. BTW: what do you call believing in abiogenesis. That's not rationalizing, it a huge huge leap of <b>faith</b>.

That's because you are not praying for the right things.I had a friend once who used to pray for things for herself. Nice clothes and hair and just nice things in general.She got very upset because she said that God doesn't answer her prayers.I'm sure you can see the fault w/ this.Ultimately, prayer is something we use for others and for our faith. W/ others we don't always get the answer we are looking for either. You have to trust that God knows best and will do what is best for us individually.

Would you please quote the exact verse in Gen. that says man was created fully formed and functional.

Well the problem w/ the war in Iraq is that it is a conflict caused by the leaders of this world. The kingdoms or power structures of this world are not God's territory.If I can give you an example, I have a cousin who died not too long ago from breast cancer. I didn't pray for her to be cured, I prayed for her salvation. I know that she is w/ God now.Shortly thereafter, my mom was diagnosed w/ the same. Even though I want to pray for her to be cured, I pray for her salvation to be sure. I also pray for her strength ability to fight etc.When she does pass (hopefully many years from now), I will know that she is with God and I leave the when up to him.

why certainlygen 1: 26-30Then God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth." So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. And God blessed them, and God said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth." And God said, "Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit; you shall have them for food. And to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food." And it was so. when god made man, he was sexual (male and female), capable of communcation, comprehension and memory (god's instructions) and made in god's image and likeness. therefore, man could speak, walk, pick fruit and eat, etc, all at the onset of his appearance on earth

[Groan] Oh, not again.Thirty years ago creationist literature was really strong on whales. I still possess glossy magazines published in the 60s by an organisation called Ambassador College, constructed entirely around the idea that contemporary palaeontology had nothing to offer by way of a transition from terrestrial mammals to whales.Nowadays creationist sources are strangely quiet about whales. Why? Because in the last few decades the cynodont-cetacean transition has been revealed by a superb series of transitional fossils.Fossilisation is a chance event; and when a fossil has formed, its uncovering by human researchers is another chance event, with the odds stacked strongly against it. Creationists treat the fossil record as a constructed given, rather than what it is - a wholly contingent assemblage of chance discoveries. That we can so clearly read transitions such as cynodont to whale, even in such an incomplete record, is testament to the sheer profligacy of the evolutionary process.
attacks
But I would like to add, you are wrong, I do not want to see this first hand. Also, we do not have this in fossils, if we did there would be no doubt would there. Can we agree that animals didn't take big huge leaps from fish to lion? yes, then where are all the linking fossils? No linking fossils means it didn't happen.Again, this is exactly the argument I have started on the other board. Lets continue there. The answer I am looking for you to be able to answer is this: not, can you prove the mutation of species, but can you prove the beginning of life. If you cannot prove that you have nothing.

So they were assailing him - a man of dignity and authority being cast as a despicable and detestable outcast.This could not be allowed.

This is my 997th post, the majority of them in the "Creation vs Evolution" section. No, I didn't just get here.The problem you have is that your claim that "life or abiogenesis is so complex as to require a designer" is a simple statement of personal incedulity, ie you find it impossible to image how life could have started without a designer. I have no such failure of imagination and can imagine how life could have started without a designer. Both positions are simple personal opinion though as we do not know, and probably never will know, how life started. Unfortunately people holding the same opinion as you try to promote ID as more than just an opinion. Yes it is a possiblity, but so is the idea that life started when the giant spaghetti monster crapped upon the Earth whilst cruising through the solar system.

Seriously man, what I said was I am me and you are you. I AM OK WITH THAT. I suggest you be to. We can't go much further from here unless your willing to try it out for yourself.Later.

I do not know exactly how it occured. Perhaps you missed the bit where I said "... as we do not know, and probably never will know, how life started." We can speculate, build models and test them, but even if we reached the stage of replicating every step required for life to form naturally, we would have no way of knowing if it really started that way.I am intrigued by your claim that you know exactly how your chosen creator(s) created life though. Perhaps you can go into some details for us? What design methodologies did it use? Did it make prototypes first? In what order, exactly, did it design every extant and extinct organism? Was it a single designer, or a committee design?No it doesn't. It looks for patterns and finds them: it presumes they must be there. This is not cause and effect reasoning, it is shoehorning what you find into preconceived notions. I dealt with one aspect of ID - irreducible complexity - in a formal debate here recently. Read the thread http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=6048 to get some idea of why ID is not scientific and is merely opinion.If either where true, then yes maybe they would be funny. However I mock invalid reasoning and I see no valid reason to believe life formation through purely natural means as impossible.That is why you do not get my reasoning: you fail to understand my position. You form a false dichotomy of acceptance and rejection of a creator in your mind and force me into one of those positions. I do not know whether life was created or not. I may have been. It may not have been. We will (probably) never know either way.

Well no. As you've plainly stated above for us, some translations use the more correct 'youths' or 'young lads' not children. And they were not making fun of him. Do you not understand the reference of 'go up'?Please note:The translation, “there came forth little children out of the city” (KJV) is an unfortunate rendition (cf. “young lads” – ASV, or “youths” – NIV, NKJV). The Hebrew word rendered “children” derives from na’ar – used 235 times in the Old Testament. Na’ar is a very broad root word, and can have reference to anyone from a newborn child to an adult. Furthermore, the Hebrew word rendered “little” comes from qatan, and generally means young or small. In commenting on this term in 2 Kings 2:23, the Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament remarks: “Elisha being taunted (cf. qalas, qarah) by young lads (II Kgs 2:23) who as members of covenant families ought to have been taught God’s law whereby cursing his servant was tantamount to cursing him and rightly punishable by death (cf. qalal)” (Harris, et al., 1980, 2:795). Obviously, therefore, the immediate context in which na’ar is used will determine the maturity of the subject so designated.The young men of Bethel mocked Elisha. The Hebrew word qalas means to scoff at, ridicule, or scorn. The term does not suggest innocent conduct. Note the Lord’s comment elsewhere: “...they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and scoffed at his prophets, until the wrath of Jehovah arose against his people, till there was no remedy” (2 Chron. 36:16).Too, the expression, “Go up...Go up,” is held by many scholars to reflect the wish of these young men that the prophet go ahead and ascend (as did Elijah – 2 Kgs. 2:11), i.e., leave the earth, that they might be rid of him! Also, the taunt, “thou bald head,” was likely a reproach. Old Testament scholar John Whitcomb has suggested that this was an expression “of extreme contempt. They were pronouncing a divine curse upon him, for which baldness was often the outward sign (cf. Isa. 3:17a, 24)” (1971, p. 68).http://www.christiancourier.com/archives/elishaBear.htm

Fair enough. But I think if we look at it objectively, abiogenesis is virtually impossible. I think for it to have taken place at all it must have required a designer.

No, not really.It has not been demonstrated in the lab in any meaningful way. Unless of course you are referring to something other than the debunked Miller ex.(on edit) and BTW: (I already gave you this as a freebee, but) the organization of amino acids is not even in the same ball park as RNA.

ummm.... the "murderous gang", according to the bible, was a group of children who were making fun of elisha because he was bald (as children often do. elisha, having his feelings hurt, retaliates by summoning 2 bears out of the woods that prompty slash the children to death (2 kings 2: 23-24). and elisha was not in the lineage of jesusand i suppose god is now a better god with fairer principles and is taking a more hands-off approach to the affairs of earth? its the new and improved god, ladies and gentlemen!i have tried. i was a devout pentecostal christian till only about 2 years ago. in fact, a lot of my spiritual shedding was because of this forum. i know all about trusting in god and finding personal evidence for his existence and intervention in my life. ive spoken in tongues, been baptized, holy-ghost filled, even witnessed to friends who became christians as a result of my life testimony. in school i never did drugs or cursed, i was a virgin until 18. i could explain the bible clearly and i used to teach occassionally in my church youth groupi think i have more knowledge of the bible that the average church goer, and i never had a problem with accepting any part of the bible as true. i even have a deep appreciation of the social and psychological benefits of both the mainstream church system, and the principles found in the biblemy beef is mainly with the illogicality and inconsistency of god himself. god is not a logical guy, by no stretch of the imagination. my problem stems from the fact that i was taught that he was. in the bible, every promise is conditional. do X and god will do Y. it simply does NOT work that way. doing X has absolutely no correlation to recieving Y. no promises are kept. nobody is guaranteed anything will happen, whether good or bad, if they do something. obeying your parents does not guarantee long life. paying tithes does not guarantee "the windows of heaven being opened, pouring out blessing you cant contain" (whatever the heck that even is). a nation in prayer does not guarantee the healing of the land. and whats even worse, in the face of god outright not fullfilling his promises, believers are ready to soothe it over with a "god works in mysterious ways" variation, essentially lying to themselves and giving god a scapegoat. the believer starts to question his own faith: "did i really love god with all my heart?" "did i really humble myself enough?" "was i believing without doubting?"; questions that can never be answered, since none of these things can be measured.after a while, i just got tired of hearing people making excuses for god's unreliability and total disregard. whats the point of believing in a god that shows no sign of being interested in anybody on earth?believe me, i've been there, to the point where i simply cant even be there anymore.

Well I may be wrong here, but many things were different before Christ. You had the laws and sacrifice for example. You have God watching over the lineage of Jesus from what I can tell. You had him protecting his prophets from a murderous gang for example w/ bears.It was an entirely different time and much was different.You can't possibly know what it is like to have a personal relationship w/Jesus unless you are willing to open yourself up to Him and try it out. There is much more to prayer, but unbelievers mock what they don't understand and have never experienced. I understand that and patiently accept the mocking, ridiculing etc. because I understand.

i guess it doesnt (by whatever your definition of "fully formed" is). however genesis makes a point that man, at the onset of his appearance upon earth, was capable of communication, memory and the concept of ownership and dominion. he was sexual and capable of sexual reproduction. he was also capable of toiling land, and had the ability to teach agriculture and domestication.evolution disagreesmy question to you: do you think that genesis implies that man was fully formed upon his appearance on earth?

Let me just jump in here to perhaps show you why nobody takes creationism seriously.Did anyone say that RNAzymes were "proof" of anything?NO.But that didn't stop you from claiming that they said it was "proof."It's just observations that lead to hypotheses.It's hypothetical that the DNA/protein world evolved from an RNA world.Then, you attempt to ridicule scientists guesses, which are more accurately labelled hypotheses since they are based on prior knowledge and new observations, as something less than or equal to creationist "guesses" about how life arose on this planet.Even though creationist guesses are not even testable hypotheses, you somehow think that by deriding scientific hypotheses as mere guesses, this gives any credence whatsoever to creationist fantasies.What would you have the scientists do?Give up?

How can someone believe that evolution is a fact and not believe in abiogenesis?

my point is that this is what genesis says. this is irreconcilably contrary to what evolution concludes based on real-world evidence. a process that took billions of years (uninhabited planet, to planet teeming with modern life forms) is described in genesis as taking less than 1 week. a process that occured by chemical bonding and reactions is described in genesis as being instantaneously completed by an intelligent and deliberate supernatural force. a process that was completely misunderstood by humans thousands of years ago is described in genesis as having absolute and conclusive accuracy on the subject. a population of humans that evolved from a long line of populations of more primative primates is described in genesis as beginning with a single and lone pairif anything, genesis can be taken as the dawn of man's self-awareness. around 6000-10,000 years ago, we find the first clues about man's ability to cultivate plants and animals, and use tools and crude forms of clothing. it may even be true that the first "self-aware" homonid was a single man, who's awareness clicked on him when he was an adult. it may also be true that this man's family was the first to assume the concept of morality, and felt superior to the ther homonids that were still running around unclothed and unashamed of their nakedness. if this is the case, then genesis can be considered probably the most well preserved record of the dawn of civilaztaion in humans. i truly wouldnt be surprised if that was the case. in fact, the symbolization of man's first days and generations of this self-awareness depicts a very plausible picture of what really happened. (i can elaborate on this if necessary)i am of the very strong opinion that the biblical version of genesis is an adaptation of this history. in fact, what we have in genesis is nothing more than a collection of regional cultural tales and legends, compiled by the early israelite scribes, doctored to add a god element into it, then cleverly strung together to form a sort of time-line of events. the israelites were certainly a clever and prosperous bunch, and they seemed to see their superiority over other tribes as a blessing of their god, yahweh. as this national pride grew, so did their god, and so did their exploits. what we have today is the result of a group that seemed to hold on to their superstitions as credit to their good fortune longer than anybody else in the middle-east/north african regionjust imagine if pharoah had succeeded in wiping out the israelites. we'd probably have churches praising horeb today

But it does, it does matter to the toe. It matters infinitely if it was in fact designed. And based on the c*** sure attitudes I have met on this forum, I would expect more than the answer: abiogenesis is really just science fiction.

Gosh, where does it say that 'abiogenesis' had to have occured. That doesn't matter one way or another to the TOE. It doesn't matter to the TOE how life first developed. What matters to the TOE is how life changes over time.

Well, it doesn't seem that any evolutionary biologists think that it matters. And, you seem to have a big lack of knowledge on the abiogenesis too. I suspect that is because you WANT there to be an 'inteligent designer' (i.e. god).So far, all you have done is attempt to discredit evolution and abiogenesis with invalid arguements, poor science, and logical fallacies.What evidence do you have of "I.D" beside 'oh, it seems to complex to happen naturally, so it was an unnamed intelligent designer which we won't define (but you can call god, wink wink)'?

How many times are you going to go the Ad Hominem route? The obvious signs of losing an argument or being unable to argue it w/ any real ability or merit.I have brought up obvious and merited inconsistencies in the failures of science to show why abiogenesis is a valid argument. You haven't attempted to respond to any of them except through the additional use of Red Herings.You haven't managed to show any logical reason why we should side w/ abiogenesis. In fact you havn't said much of anything. ID uses the same scientific information that abiogenesis does. It is the conclusion drawn from that informaton that is different. You have shown me no reason to believe logically that ID shouldn't be a realistic alternative.

Well, not necessarily. I don't believe it took a literal week. Time is relative and a man made thing. I don't think that God kept our literal schedule.Your reversal of faith astounds me. I bet in your day, you were quite convincing as a Christian. Very knowledgeable and on the ball w/ answers as to why God is real.Anyway, I don't get into arguing the validity of the creation story. Some things you need to take on faith and that is one of them. I don't analize it, I don't pick it apart, I just accept that we are here and quite comfortably know in my heart that it was by design.Ultimately, I knew one guy who used to tell me that the earth was 10,000 years old. I thought he was a bit looney. The same guy told me that there were probably dinasour babies on Noah's ark. Did I argue this w/ him. No. Of course not. But again, quite looney.Someday God may say 'Nidder', you really should have accepted creation as literal. Ye of little faith. Or he may say, its ok it was merely representational. Either way makes little difference to me.

my point is that this is what genesis says. this is irreconcilably contrary to what evolution concludes based on real-world evidence. a process that took billions of years (uninhabited planet, to planet teeming with modern life forms) is described in genesis as taking less than 1 week. a process that occured by chemical bonding and reactions is described in genesis as being instantaneously completed by an intelligent and deliberate supernatural force. a process that was completely misunderstood by humans thousands of years ago is described in genesis as having absolute and conclusive accuracy on the subject. a population of humans that evolved from a long line of populations of more primative primates is described in genesis as beginning with a single and lone pairif anything, genesis can be taken as the dawn of man's self-awareness. around 6000-10,000 years ago, we find the first clues about man's ability to cultivate plants and animals, and use tools and crude forms of clothing. it may even be true that the first "self-aware" homonid was a single man, who's awareness clicked on him when he was an adult. it may also be true that this man's family was the first to assume the concept of morality, and felt superior to the ther homonids that were still running around unclothed and unashamed of their nakedness. if this is the case, then genesis can be considered probably the most well preserved record of the dawn of civilaztaion in humans. i truly wouldnt be surprised if that was the case. in fact, the symbolization of man's first days and generations of this self-awareness depicts a very plausible picture of what really happened. (i can elaborate on this if necessary)i am of the very strong opinion that the biblical version of genesis is an adaptation of this history. in fact, what we have in genesis is nothing more than a collection of regional cultural tales and legends, compiled by the early israelite scribes, doctored to add a god element into it, then cleverly strung together to form a sort of time-line of events. the israelites were certainly a clever and prosperous bunch, and they seemed to see their superiority over other tribes as a blessing of their god, yahweh. as this national pride grew, so did their god, and so did their exploits. what we have today is the result of a group that seemed to hold on to their superstitions as credit to their good fortune longer than anybody else in the middle-east/north african regionjust imagine if pharoah had succeeded in wiping out the israelites. we'd probably have churches praising horeb today

May I chime in? What you have said here is misleading. Abiogenesis is a very specific, scientific field of study which conducts experiments and makes observations to strengthen or weaken the theory of how life first began. ID (or Creationism in a sinister cloak) is an all-encompasing argument-from-ignorance, which says because we don't completely understand how this or that mechanism could have evolved then it must have been designed by a Creator (my vote is for the Flying Spaghetti Monster, personally). In other words: abiogenesis = specific, testable theory. ID = untestable philosophy. The they are not competing theories.

Someone already mentioned this somewhat, but I think it's worth bringing up again.We've got 2 main explanations for the origin of life here on Earth (the discussion so far has been neglecting other possibilities, such as panspermia and directed panspermia). 1) Organic chemistryWe know organic chemistry is real. Further, we know that amino acids, sugars, and nitrogenous bases form abiotically (we've found them in meteorites, for example). We know that some RNA molecules can both carry genetic information and catalyze chemical reactions, and in fact, we know of a non-biologically produced ribozyme that can partially replicate itself. We don't have a complete, continuous pathway from gases and/or simple inorganic molecules all the way to self-replicating biopolymers (yet), but we do have several pieces of the puzzle verified.2) GodWe don't know that any God exists. Nor can any one do an experiment to show that a deity exists. Belief in God is based on personal faith and divine revelation, not on objective, independently verifiable observations.Of the two, which is the better explanation? The one that we know to have a basis in reality, which also has some empirical support: the naturalistic explanation.

You have the burden of proof.You are also the one going against the mainstream scientific view of the origin of life.

actually, it works the other way too. evidence of id would be evidence that a designer exists. if you find a perfectly round burrow in a log, that would be evidence that the hole was deliberately designed. even if you never see the bettle or termite that made the hole, you could reasonably conclude that such a creature exists. interestingly enough, if you saw a beetle walking along the log, just about the size of the hole, that would not be evidence that that beetle made the hole, or lives in it, or is a burrowing insectsimilarly, even if we were to prove god's existence, it would not be proof that he designed anything we have observed. however, if we find something that seems to have a deliberate designer, that would be evidence that the designer exists (not "proof", evidence)

I've tried to explain this to them previously in attempt to explain ID, but its almost like if they admit the logic of it, it'll mean somehow that their argument is weaker. And I've wondered what that fear is really all about. They can say, hey, based on current knowledge abiogenesis is impossible, but even if its an illogical explanation I'll buy it because I don't believe in intelligent design. So, really its nothing more than the oposite of what they accuse and mock the creationist of. Is it really so different than me saying, hey look abiogenesis is an impossible explanation, that science doesn't back up. And any cell that is capable of replication also has design. Design doesn't come from nowhere so to infer a designer for the design is not that big a leap of faith.

actually, it works the other way too. evidence of id would be evidence that a designer exists. if you find a perfectly round burrow in a log, that would be evidence that the hole was deliberately designed. even if you never see the bettle or termite that made the hole, you could reasonably conclude that such a creature exists. interestingly enough, if you saw a beetle walking along the log, just about the size of the hole, that would not be evidence that that beetle made the hole, or lives in it, or is a burrowing insectsimilarly, even if we were to prove god's existence, it would not be proof that he designed anything we have observed. however, if we find something that seems to have a deliberate designer, that would be evidence that the designer exists (not "proof", evidence)

Nider could you answer my question

I've tried to explain this to them previously in attempt to explain ID, but its almost like if they admit the logic of it, it'll mean somehow that their argument is weaker. And I've wondered what that fear is really all about. They can say, hey, based on current knowledge abiogenesis is impossible, but even if its an illogical explanation I'll buy it because I don't believe in intelligent design. So, really its nothing more than the oposite of what they accuse and mock the creationist of. Is it really so different than me saying, hey look abiogenesis is an impossible explanation, that science doesn't back up. And any cell that is capable of replication also has design. Design doesn't come from nowhere so to infer a designer for the design is not that big a leap of faith. And not dissimilar to the inferrance made in your example above.I've heard a lot of people say over the years including yourself that Christians justify and make leaps of faith where there is no explanation etc. But never have I heard so much of this as in the defense of abiogenesis.

No. I don't. I do not believe they are mutually exclusive.Science gives us many answers but it does not have all the answers. Faith is a very individual thing and not the same for everyone.Why do you ask?

That's quite true. I think that many Christians don't look at science because they are afraid of what they might find, but then again, I think the science folks are guilty of the same in reverse. Science is not a sin. It helps us explain the physical world around us. In fact the more I learn about science the more I find that a creator is the most probable conclusion.Who told you science is a sin?

As a Canadian, I'm embarassed by Nidder1...First off, it is not an ad hominem to point out the fallacies in your arguments Nidder. This is what I've seen happen. Saying, for example, that ID is an argument from ignorance which relies on a god-of-the-gaps mindset is not an ad hominem. It's a statement of fact. As has been pointed out to you numerous times in this thread, ID is not science. Rather, it is anti-science. When science comes upon a question to which the answer is "I don't know", the procedure is to investigate and come upon the best answer that fits all the available evidence. In other words, an hypothesis is formed, tested, and either discarded or held up as a (temporary) answer. It's a temporary answer because it could always change based on new observations. ID, instead, when presented with a question to which the answer is "I don't know", promptly replies with "God did it!", and that is the end of that question. Which one furthers our knowledge more? You can see that, as I stated above, ID relies on ignorance. If we knew all the answers, there would be no room for ID. As answers are found, the space where ID can stake a claim gets smaller and smaller. See where "god-of-the-gaps" comes into play here?I've also seen numerous references given to you, links to sites with information which supports the arguments given by the others on this board. These posts are almost immediately followed by you claiming your opponents off no proof to back up their assertions. Those links, those lead to their evidence. By reading them, you are not "[proving] Trebor's point for him". Rather, you are actually reading and considering the evidence you have asked him to provide you with. Closing your eyes and plugging your ears does not make your case. Read the links. If you disagree, say why, and offer counterpoints. Just keep in mind that science does not offer "proof" of anything. Nothing is definite. I noticed in one of your earlier posts that you were scoffing at a quote offered by one of your opponents because the researcher being quoted said "could have". In science, that's as good as it gets. If you're looking for proof, check out a math board.Also, what makes you think that "disproving" abiogenesis in any way, shape or form makes ID the de facto alternative? Not only is that completely illogical, but abiogenesis, as has been pointed out to you numerous times, has absolutely nothing to do with the ToE. I could believe that life began when Barney the purple dinosaur went back in time and sneezed in a particularly rich broth of chemicals, and his cold germs were the first real life on this planet. Doesn't affect the ToE in any way. If you want to believe that God created the first life on this planet, believe away. Still doesn't affect the ToE in any way.As for your claim that abiogenesis is "an impossible explanation, that science doesn't back up", how does the science not back it up? As was already outlined to you by DamEtel, numerous pieces of the puzzle have already been found. There are a few spots where scientists still say "I don't know", but we do know more now than we did even five years ago. There aren't many more gaps for your god to fit into when it comes to Life Origins.I've seen a lot of people ignore what is presented to them on a silver platter, but never anyone as bad as a christian who's faith is threatened. Since you put a personal question of faith to Unkerpaulie, let me ask you a couple: Is your god so frail and impotent that you have to keep him within narrowly confined boundaries? If your faith is so fragile that facts threaten it, don't you think you should examine why that is, rather than declare reality at fault?

Thx, I'll spend some time arguing from a whole new perspective. It'll certainly be refreshing.To briefly answer your other question before I go science says that life organized and started by itself - abiogenesis. Or rather organized isn't a good word there as it denotes intelligence. It accidentally fell together no matter how impossible and grew from there. Briefly ID takes note of the obvious design of a cell for example and infers a designer for the design. Its an assertion that empirical evidence supports the conclusion that the initial life on earth was deliberately designed by an intelligent agent and did not accidentally come together at astronomical odds.I'll see you at the other link.

I.D. is called 'Intelligent Design'. Mainly, it is the claim that the biochemical pathways in life are too 'complex' to have formed naturally, and therefore, an 'Intelligent designer' created these pathways. When questioned 'What is the nature of this intelligent designer', they say it is irrelevent. However, it is a back door into 'creationism'.. since the groups that push 'I.D.' tend to be funded and supported by evangalsitic christians that have an axe to grind against evolution.

But seeing as how you've been asked these same questions repeatedly for the past, oh, ten pages, it seems only proper that you answer them before we get to anything else.BTW, saying I was embarrassed wasn't meant as an insult, it was just a statement of fact.

There is no actual evidence of design. What there is are:1) Argument from incredulity."Gosh, this stuff is complex: I can't imagine how it could come about naturally, therefore, it must be designed."2) Argument from analogy. "A watch is complex and we know it needs a watchmaker; similarily, a cell is complex, and therefore it too needs a designer."3) A flawed argument to the best explanation.As I pointed out earlier in the thread, actually, the better explanation for the origin of life on Earth is the naturalistic one, since we (a) know organic chemistry exists (but do NOT know that God exists) and we (b) have several of the steps needed to get from inorganic compounds to self-replicating biopolymers confirmed.You want to talk about evidence for Intelligent Design in biology. Okay:What actual evidence do you have that the first life was supernaturally created? None. Zip. Zilch.What actual evidence do you have that the bacterial flagellum, or protein sorting, or the immune system, were designed by a supernatural, unembodied designer? None. Zip. Zilch.Uhm, WE ALREADY KNOW FOR A FACT THAT BEETLES AND TERMITES EXIST! Flawed analogy.So you've seen God making cells? <snicker>Right, but it would validate that He could have POSSIBLY done it. Without any evidence of God, we don't even have that much.

actually, it works the other way too. evidence of id would be evidence that a designer exists. if you find a perfectly round burrow in a log, that would be evidence that the hole was deliberately designed. even if you never see the bettle or termite that made the hole, you could reasonably conclude that such a creature exists. interestingly enough, if you saw a beetle walking along the log, just about the size of the hole, that would not be evidence that that beetle made the hole, or lives in it, or is a burrowing insectsimilarly, even if we were to prove god's existence, it would not be proof that he designed anything we have observed. however, if we find something that seems to have a deliberate designer, that would be evidence that the designer exists (not "proof", evidence)

Yeah, I haven't seen much substance from Nidder1 either: basically, he just makes a bunch of accusations of wrongdoing on the part of those that don't agree with him ... and gripes endlessly.

oh, where to start...I wonder, do you realize the point you just made for me? You're right, snowflakes don't reproduce themselves, and they also aren't under any selction pressures like organisms are. Yet, due simply to the properties of water crystals, they appear to form designs. My point was that something can appear to be designed without actually being designed. Something you somehow completely missed. But, now that it's been explained, can you see how, due to simple chemistry, organic molecules could form? Do you see how these compounds could combine to form a primitive form of RNA? Do you see how these primitive RNA molecules could replicate themselves? Do you see how, after multiple copies, errors could occur? Get where I'm going with this yet? You seem to think that life began with a full fledged cell falling together from a bunch of random molecules sitting around. That is not even close to what is being proposed. In fact, it's thought that many of the organelles found in a modern cell were in fact discrete organisms that were incorporated into primitive cells. So, as you can see, a cell is not the beginning. Chemistry is.You have an odd idea of "no interest". I asked you specific questions. I'm awaiting your response, with great interest.Nidder, for future reference, this would be considered an ad hominem, just in case, y'know, you get confused again. I would like to see how I've not followed your "logic", or gone off point. It appears to me that I've tried to get you to stick to a point and back up your assertions. The way it looks to me, you're the one who's having trouble sticking to a point. Just as a refresher, here are my questions again:Which one would you like to start with?

Hmm, toby, are you not the one who keeps telling others to "butt out"? Strange how you would leap to the defense of Nidder here when no one has addressed you. Especially since one of your major beefs seems to be when people jump into a debate midstream.What does that even mean in this context?I assume you mean that we are attempting to define his position for him. It seems clear to me he supports ID, so I asked him some pretty straightforward questions:"state why the RNA world hypothesis is not valid (with references, and in your own words ), and what evidence there is to support ID besides "It's pwetty, so it's designed" or incredulity.is each snowflake created by a designer? If not, then how can you tell which items that exhibit design are created by a designer and which "accidentally fell together no matter how impossible"?explain the evidence for ID, how we would test for the presence of ID, and what steps occured in the ID creation of the first life. DamEtel and Trebor have done the same for abiogenesis, so it seems only fair, don't you think?"I don't see the problem here.Hmm, in the span of, what, three posts? he called me confused, illogical, and implied a few others. Where's the ad hominem on my part? Or on Trebor's? As a great man once said "I do not think that means what you think it means..."Uh, that junk, what that is, that's called "reference material". It's also called "answers". See, when a question is asked, an "answer" is given. Now, I know it sounds strange, but that's the way it works where I come from. I don't know, maybe I'm just funny that way. See, if someone asks me an answer, and a really smart person who's devoted a lot of time in search of an answer happens to come across one and writes it down, I "quote" them. Now, this might also be a strange concept, but bear with me here. By "quoting" the person who has done all this research, or by creating a link to their work (you know this practice as posting "junk"), you are ensuring that the position is made perfectly clear. That is, there is no chance of misunderstanding the answer, as it is laid out quite clearly.Put it this way. If I ask you the definition of the word "alabaster", you'll probably go to dictionary.com, find the definition, and copy and paste it, right? No, according to you and Nidder, that's completely unnacceptable. I want you to give me the definition of "alabaster" in your own words. No quoting, no linking. Just your words. And it better be just as accurate and correct as any dictionary I can find. Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?Was Nidder insulted by it? Possibly. Is it an ad hominem? No. It was a statement of fact. As a Canadian, I am embarassed that a fellow Canadian is peddling such garbage. That's it, that's all. Besides, he hasn't presented an arguement, so how could I attempt to discredit the non existent by ridiculing him?I have. Many times. Have you seen a response? Oh, wait, there was this:And what set off such a vitriolic response? Why, this:So, I asked him to clarify his position, and answer a couple questions. Yep, I'd be upset too. And on a debate board yet! I obviously have no shame.He has "claimed" that ID is the more reasonable assumption. His burden is to support that assertion. I have yet to see any attempt at doing so. Would you like to try?

FWIW, I stopped responding to either toby or Nidder some weeks ago. Any critique of their position, no matter how finely focused on their argument, is dismissed as either an ad hominem attack (Nidder) or 'well poisoning' (toby). When they demand supporting evidence for your views, and you provide it, they refuse to read it and call it 'junk'. Neither has a good understanding of basic science - viz  Nidder's apparent belief that the freezing of water is synonymous with snowflake formation.There is nothing to be gained by debating these people.

Any critique? I suppose we should consider the critiques in the “I don’t see how creation can compete with evolution”, which is where you last critiqued my argument on this forum. I didn’t complain to you about well poisoning in your critiques, nor in trebor’s, nor in jaxian’s, nor in thebootfitter’s, nor in Winston Smith’s, nor in sinjin’s, nor in pandion’s initial critiques (even though he said I was being called childish). It appears that I replied 17 times before mentioning poisoning the well. Any critique? Surely, this is a vast over statement. Please provide a quote where I claim well poisoning that is not preceded by a personal slight.Please provide a quote where I ask for supporting evidence and when provided, refuse to read it and call it junk. You are absolutely making this stuff up.That’s some logic you’ve got there. I don’t have a good understanding of basic science, and you use as evidence Nidder’s apparent belief.

There are several large astroids many miles in diameter, which are spherical due to the simple force of gravity. Grains of salt are often cubical due to the geometric relationships between Na & Cl ions. And the crystals of many minerals are even more elaborately shaped. If you put a magnet beneath a piece of paper with iron filings on top, you get a really nice geometric shape coinciding with the magnetic flux lines. In graded sand beds, gravity sorts the grains of sand quite well by size. Simple mutations in developmental genes can easily make radical changes in the architecture of the organisms affected. So you see, there is ample evidence of sophisticated design in nature which does NOT require intelligent forsight... oh, I almost forgot to mention the snowflake... So you definitely need evidence of a designer before you conclude that something was INTENTIONALLY designed (such as microscopic abrasions on the wooden cube where the knife or saw or file were applied).

only one way to do that. find out exactly how the thing was made. we know cars are made in complex factories operated by people. we know that tree branches can split and form y shaped sticks. in the case of the cubed wood, we know that a piece of wood can be sawed and shaped into a cube, but also that a part of a tree that finds itself growing within a space shapped like a cube will grow to fill up that space and assume the shape. in that particular instance, more observation would be needed, although it can quickly be determined if the wood had actually been cut or not. prschuster raises some good points. we could also find a perfectly spherical stone that has been beaten into shape by the tide pushing it over rocks for some years, or the perfectly flat surfaces and geometrical shapes of most crystals. these things are already observed as "undesigned". however, i suspect that lcd flat-screen computer monitor would raise suspicions about whether it has been designed or notthe argument really takes its harshest beating when being applied to living things. many living things have the ability to design, including designing themselves. a geometrically symetrical animal is not evidence of intelligent design, because it is itself a living thing.

It's interesting that biological processes hardly ever seem to give rise to structures containing perfect right angles. The only example I can bring to mind - and it's an imperfect one - is the near-square markings on flowers of the Snake's-head Fritillary, Fritillaria meleagris. We have, of course, a crucial part of our own anatomy whose name in Latin means 'right-angled thing'; but there too the angle only approximates to 90 degrees. (And if any belligerent debater wants to say my example is full of s*it, for once they'll be right.)Why should this be? Biology is full of spheroidal objects, largely due to surface tension effects. Honey bees create near perfect hexagons; spider webs get close to octagons. Why the avoidance of the square and its relations?Any suggestions?

Note that we actually have muscles in our backs that go by those names. I think a beehive or sheet of cells would lend themselves to being scrunched or distorted more easily if they had square shapes. Spheres are usefull in biological structures because they present the smallest amount of surface area per unit volume of any shape. And flat, leaf-like surfaces are common for the opposite reason (they maximize surface area to volume ratio). Rectangular/square structures don't have either of those advantages. Also, look at how unstable a rectangular book shelf is unless it is reinforced with a back board, while the triangular shape of trusses in buildings are commonly used for support, which wouldn't work so well if they were placed at right angles.

Why the avoidance of the square and its relations?Any suggestions?Walking-fish:I'm not a structural engineer or anything, but it seems to me that a rectangular shape can easily be collapsed to a rhomboid or trapezoid. Note that we actually have muscles in our backs that go by those names. I think a beehive or sheet of cells would lend themselves to being scrunched or distorted more easily if they had square shapes. Spheres are usefull in biological structures because they present the smallest amount of surface area per unit volume of any shape. And flat, leaf-like surfaces are common for the opposite reason (they maximize surface area to volume ratio). Rectangular/square structures don't have either of those advantages. Also, look at how unstable a rectangular book shelf is unless it is reinforced with a back board, while the triangular shape of trusses in buildings are commonly used for support, which wouldn't work so well if they were placed at right angles.

Nope. Both can change shape without changing the volume contained or the circumference. Actually, quite unstable. That is not to deny the geometric truth that a circle contains the largest area within the shortest external boundary. That is also true of a sphere. It contains the largest volume within the smallest surface area.But stable to external pressure? Nah.If you check out homes being built you will notice that the rectangular walls are supported with diagonal cross bracing. Look at the structure of bridges that also have such diagonal cross bracing. The purpose is to create triangles. You see, you can change the shape of a square or a rectangle or a circle without changing the length of the perimeter. Not so with a triangle. In two dimensons, the most stable structure is a triangle. In three dimensions, the most stable is a four sided figure where each side is a triangle (whatever that is).

Nope. The base of a pyramid is a square with four triangular sides. The most stable would be a figure where every side is a triangle: a triangular base with three triangular sides. I have a rubik's cube sort of thing that has this shape (except, of course, it isn't a cube).Like I said, I don't know the name for it, but it's not a pyramid.

Good thought. Actually correct in that environment. A sphere is quite resistant to equal pressure from all directions. I was thinking of surface structures.Try this. Take an egg (not hard boiled) and hold it so that your fingers wrap around it and squeeze. I've been told that you won't be able to break it. However, squeeze with just your middle finger and it will break.

Sorry, no help here. "Everything" is either evidence one way or the other, it doesn't get to be both until you find out what the answer is. You start with the evidence and then draw a conclusion, you don't start with a conclusion and then mold the evidence to fit it. If something fits two contrary conclusions, then it's evidence for neither.And why must God, or "the designer", be obvious? That isn't clear to me at all. If a designer did his thing 4 billion years ago the evidence might be very subtle.

In that case, not. A backbone made precariously vertical by putting an extra curve into a suspension arch; a foodway that crosses an airway; a gut diverticulum that serves no purpose but to act as a site for potentially lethal inflammation - hell, none of these testifies to any intelligent design whatsoever. No obvious god here.But every one of these can be readily explained as an adaptive modification of a pre-existing structure. It's called evolution.

Walking-fish:The short answer is that the appendix will eventually disappear if more people die from appendicitis than those that are helped by the 2ndary immunological function that it has taken up. That will confer greater survival potential upon those with the smallest cul de sacs at the bottom of their cecums. Now that wasn't too hard to understand, was it? For the rest of your questions, you can read a text on evo-devo (evolutionary developmental biology). That will explain how developmental genes play a big part in determining the structure of organ systems. BUT YOU WILL NEVER READ SUCH A BOOK BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT REALLY INTERESTED IN THE ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS, ARE YOU?Now here are some questions for you. Why didn't the creator eliminate the problem with back ailments in humans by giving us 4 legs like a centaur? Evolutionists can answer that question by their understanding of developmental restraints. Can creationists come up with a better answer? Why did the creator engineer our digestive & respiratory tracts so we can choke on our food? Evolutionists can answer that question as well, but can you? Why did the creator put the visual cortex of the brain at the back when the eyes are in front, making it easy for lesions to obstruct the optic tracts on their tortuous journey from the eyes to the brain? Evolutionists have a good answer for this one as well, but do you? From the looks of some of these suboptimal designs, you'd think that the designer has a drinking problem, because any good sober engineer wouldn't make these mistakes.

Right. Those lacking a knowledge of biology look at things as they currently are and can't imagine how things so complex could just form overnight. Well, they didn't (as you state).Take our impressive four-chambered heart. There is a 'morphological continuum' going back to mere contractile vessels: starting at the end with our 4 chambered hearts, we can look out into the world of extant animals and move back through 3-1/2 chambered hearts, to 3 chambered hearts, to 2 chambered hearts, to single chambered hearts, to simple vessels that can contract and thereby move blood.Likewise, take our impressive camera-type eye (which, by the way, is inferior to that of eagles!). There is a 'morphological continuum' going back to the simple eyespots (ocelli) in certain worms.Take just about any complex structure we humans have - even our brains - and we can look out into the world of extant animals and construct a 'morphological continuum' for it.

The significance of the appendix's immunological function is much overstated (especially by creationists). Sure, it has patches of lymphoid tissue in its walls, but so has most of the intestine. There's precious little evidence that we're measurably worse off without the appendix's immunological contribution.I use the following analogy. Suppose some industrial archaeologists are investigating a railroad line. The main line still functions, carrying freight from A to B. But there's this inexplicable little branch line, that peters out after a few metres, going nowhere and delivering nothing. However, alongside the branch line are some toolsheds, just as there are alongside most of the main line.Archaeologists with a sense of historical change hypothesise that the branch line did in fact once have a function in the processing of freight, but over time this function has been lost and only a remnant of the original structure remains.A rival faction, who maintain that nothing ever changes, disagree: the little scrap of branch line was obviously built exactly as we see it today, in order that the toolsheds could be placed alongside it. Its function was to act solely as a place to put the sheds.Which of these seems more reasonable to you?

Hell, no.And they ignore the fact that the immunological function is spread along the entire gut in Peyer's patches. It would be remarkable if the appendix, as a gut diverticulum, didn't have patches of lymphoid tissue. But to pretend it has to be there so that those particular patches have a place to grow is just plain absurd.

Meh?Allah, as far as the muslims are concerned is the same god as the ones the Jews and Christians have, if anything its Mohammad who you think is wrong (though presumably real). Bhudda isn't even a god, nor ever claimed to be. Fair enough you can disagree with his philosophies but it seems a odd point of view to disbelieve in the existance of merely the founder of a philosophy seeing as clearly it must have had one at some point.
