Abortion is the reason Europe is turning Arab

Your reasoning of the effects of abortion are correct. The liberals who see abortion as a normal, acceptable, right to choose abortion are aborting themselves into extinction. Reverence, and a love of life is not what motivates Muslims. The power of Islam is. There is nothing to indicate that Muslims "love" life. They'll cut your limbs or head off for nearly any reason. They'll remove your head with a hacksaw so to take the time for "you" the victim to enjoy the moment and to voice your opinion and video it for your family and countrymen to enjoy.

In point of fact, the low birth rate in most of Europe is not due to the availablity of abortion, but to good sex education and the ready availablity of effective contraception to everyone who needs it. See this study, for instance: http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/PUB...heet/fsest.htmPeople have small families because they want small families. In point of fact, the abortion rate in Europe is generally much lower than the rate in the US, due, again, to education and contraception. Would you force folks to have children they don't want?

You live in Sydney, is there a major difference in women's rights issues compared to the status of these rights is the U.S.? Women's rights in the west are far advanced compared to those of Islamic women. I understand that you are being facetious but are rights ignored for women in Oz?

Simone is quite right...women will no longer breed to order according to the dictats of outdated religion. British Muslim women will follow at some point (many already are). There are a few hothead extremists who sit on London street corners with placards stating that "UK will be Islamic", "Sharia Law for UK" etc. etc. But those nutters are ignored along with all the other (non-religious) nutters currently walking the streets of London. (For the record, Muslims make up 2.1 per cent of the total United Kingdom population. They are hardly "taking over" )."muslims are taking over the world" is a poor excuse of a reason to be anti-abortion and shows desperation, IMO!

1. Simone may be right about women choosing not to breed to order. Perfectly acceptable attitude. I doubt it has anything to do with dictates of religion.

There is no such thing as "reverence for life". People have picked and choosed the people they cry over ever since time began. Hypocrisy is as old as religion.Sharia law is a reality where Muslims are the majority, yes. Why? Because Sharia law is Muslim law. What's your point?

You have to be more specific. The militant Islamists view the West as encroaching on their Muslim civilization and accuse us of trying to destroy Islam. They view their actions as actions of defense of Islam. Many in the Muslim world support them based on this arguement of defense. If we would stop supporting Israel and pull out of engagement in the Middle East (not realistically achievable or even desirable from our point of view), then their main motivation and means of recruitment would be gone. It is only very fringe extreme groups that have any aspirations of forcing Islam on the rest of us through terrorism or military force. Most Muslims just want to live their lives in peace.About 2/3rds of Americans believe that abortion should be legal in the first trimester. I believe in Democracy where majority rules (assuming that people have the opportunity to get educated on both sides of the issue). Do you believe that those 2/3rds of Americans should not get their way?

tactics not motives

Muslims do view America as a rich country and a country of opportunity. There are just a wide variety of views about how the US views Islam. Most well educated Muslims that I have met share their less-educated members views against US support of Israel and against the US incursion into Iraq - or at least against the way it was handled - but certainly do not think that the US is out to destroy Islam in totality. However, Muslims in general hold a wide range of views about the US - many quite extreme. Unfortunately, in the Middle East, the press is not truly free so people are far more open to trusting rumor and conspiracy theories. From what I am told, that helps feed the anti-American feelings. Essentially, though there have been actions we have taken which could justifiably be criticized by Muslims of the Middle East, many - particularly the extremists - vastly exaggerate and distort our actions to make us appear to have evil purposes - thus justifying their terrorist actions in their minds. I don't think there are too many things that we can say or do to prove them wrong - we have no credibility in the Middle East. That is why I continue to hope that moderate Muslims will be brave enough to speak out more.The 66% number for people supporting the legality of first term abortions is from http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm - most of the way down the page. It comes from a CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll. Jan. 10-12, 2003. Surveying 1,002 adults nationwide - Margin of Error &#177; 3%. This is the most recent poll I know of which breaks up the question based on trimester. Last I heard, these organizations were not considered left wing. Indeed, I have heard many on the left consider CNN somewhat right wing. Anyway, you will also see that, in the poll, the majority of people view that second term abortions should be illegal, which goes against most pro-choice views. So, this is obviously not a left-wing biased result.The constitutionality of an issue is not something that is decided by refurendum in this country. The constitution itself can be changed by popular vote electing representatives that can change it. As for the constitutionality of Roe vs Wade, you just happen to disagree with the decision so you call it "creating laws". I am sure you would not label court decisions in your favor as such. If Roe vs Wade were overturned, there would be no "tearing our nation apart" but it would certainly politically mobilize the silent majority of pro-choice supporters that now take those rights for granted as being guaranteed by Roe vs Wade. You would be waking up a sleeping giant.On a last note, last year, I had a discussion on the Abortion forum with some Brits who said that, in Britain, once third trimester abortions were largely outlawed, a large part of the furvor died down regarding the abortion debate since there were few people who were adamant about pushing the law further. I hope that something similar happens here.

Anyway, you will also see that, in the poll, the majority of people view that second term abortions should be illegal, which goes against most pro-choice views. So, this is obviously not a left-wing biased result.The constitutionality of an issue is not something that is decided by refurendum in this country.

As for the constitutionality of Roe vs Wade, you just happen to disagree with the decision so you call it "creating laws". I am sure you would not label court decisions in your favor as such. If Roe vs Wade were overturned, there would be no "tearing our nation apart" but it would certainly politically mobilize the silent majority of pro-choice supporters that now take those rights for granted as being guaranteed by Roe vs Wade. You would be waking up a sleeping giant.On a last note, last year, I had a discussion on the Abortion forum with some Brits who said that, in Britain, once third trimester abortions were largely outlawed, a large part of the furvor died down regarding the abortion debate since there were few people who were adamant about pushing the law further. I hope that something similar happens here.

Muslims do view America as a rich country and a country of opportunity. There are just a wide variety of views about how the US views Islam. Most well educated Muslims that I have met share their less-educated members views against US support of Israel and against the US incursion into Iraq - or at least against the way it was handled - but certainly do not think that the US is out to destroy Islam in totality. However, Muslims in general hold a wide range of views about the US - many quite extreme. Unfortunately, in the Middle East, the press is not truly free so people are far more open to trusting rumor and conspiracy theories. From what I am told, that helps feed the anti-American feelings. Essentially, though there have been actions we have taken which could justifiably be criticized by Muslims of the Middle East, many - particularly the extremists - vastly exaggerate and distort our actions to make us appear to have evil purposes - thus justifying their terrorist actions in their minds. I don't think there are too many things that we can say or do to prove them wrong - we have no credibility in the Middle East. That is why I continue to hope that moderate Muslims will be brave enough to speak out more.The 66% number for people supporting the legality of first term abortions is from http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm - most of the way down the page. It comes from a CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll. Jan. 10-12, 2003. Surveying 1,002 adults nationwide - Margin of Error &#177; 3%.

That is why there is a 3% margin of error added. If the sample were truly random, then the science of statistics say that the margin of error is 1 / Sqrt (sample number ) = 3%. There is a legitimate point to be made that any type of survey on such issues is not 100% random since often those who will even answer surveys are those that have strong opinions to begin with (already a preselected portion of the population). Nevertheless, the fact is that the same poll (from the same specific group of polled people) said that they would outlaw second term abortions. This should show you how this is not a poll purposely skewed toward the pro-choice side, since the pro-choice side would have kept second trimester abortions also legal.There are many things that are not specifically mentioned in the Constitution and that the Court has ruled on - in either direction (left or right). That is why the court exists in the first place - to interpret the Constitution for a given new situation. If the Constitution was clearly defined for all scenarios, then one would only need administrative clerks (or even only a computer nowadays) to make such a ruling - not well experienced and educated justices.Most polls that I have seen (from pollingreport.com) show the pro-choice and pro-life side being close, but the pro-choice side slightly leading. However, the poll about first trimester abortions, and the situation that occurred in Britain, tell me that it is late term abortions which most concern people. That, along with my personal stance on abortion, is why I hope that we will have some reasonable law limiting third trimester abortions. That may finally put the issue mostly to rest. I think that is part of the reason why the right does not push for a law specifically outlawing third trimester abortions. Thy might well realize that this would spell the end of further pro-life movement.

I agree with you that one's own opinions need not be directed by the majority opinion. On the occasions when I find my opinion not in the majority (or at least a large minority), then I do question whether there is something that I might be missing and look into the reasons why the majority hold their opinion and judge for myself based on those reasons. However, in a Democracy, we are ethically obligated to abide by the indirect decision of the majority (indirect since it is filtered by representatives, for better or worse), unless those decisions run counter to the Constitution. There are certainly majority decisions that I disagreed with but have to live with nonetheless. If one disagrees with the majority, then all one can do is to help contribute money or time toward convincing the majority of one's cause.There is no other acceptable reason to you and those who think similarly to you on the pro-life side. Many, indeed most, others hold a range of more progressive views. The Constitution is not clear on the subject of when human rights start but there is enough language referring to "birth" that that seems to be the official starting point. Also, Abortion was legal during the start of our country. On the other hand, the right to privacy is one that is contentious since it is only spelled out indirectly in the Constitution. The bottom line is that I accept that the Constitution is open to interpretation when it comes to abortion rights. I agree that politicians of today often do not vote based on well developed reasons but based on political expediency - a continued source of disappointment. I think that there are various factors from both sides stopping direct legislation about third trimester abortion:1. Many on the pro-choice side are afraid of the slippery-slope and would be extremely careful about any language in third trimester abortion restrictions that could be used to open the possibility of restrictions in first and second trimester.2. The pro-life side might view a ruling only restricting third trimester abortions as an acceptance of that as the limiting point, which would not be acceptable to them, so they might try to force language into the restriction that would try to push open the gate to first and second trimester restrictions.3. The pro-life side might recognize that, if third trimester restrictions were implemented, then a main motivating factor for pro-life momentum (i.e. the sympathy toward late term fetuses) would no longer be relevant since that part would be solved. There might not be enough sympathy toward first and even second term fetuses to sustain further progress.So, there are legitimate concerns on both sides where third trimester restrictions are concerned. I continue to hope that some of these obstacles can be overcome, but I am not holding my breath.

Since they respect life (their own, that is) more than the West, their numbers are growing much quicker, while our lack of respect for human life is causing the gap to widen.

It really doesn't matter how many abortions are occurring or the ratio to live births or the birth rate per woman. Unless one knows the denominator, the ratios are meaningless.All you need to is how many absolute live births are occurring in one group versus another (and I suppose you also need to consider the infant mortality rate alongside those numbers.) The decision to terminate a pregnancy has the same effect as birth control or abstinence. If one woman has 10 children and 10 abortions, she will end up with more children and a woman who has 2 children and no abortions. I am making no comment on anything but the math. All I am saying is the orginal article does not give enough information to conclude what the title of the thread states. The original article wasn't even discussing Arabs or Muslims, it was talking about immigrants.As previously stated, worst thread ever.

Math wasn't your strong suit, I see, so let me translate for you. There are 105 abortions for every 100 live births. That means that for every 100 babies brought by the stork an ADDITIONAL 105 were dropped. :p

Since my ethnicity is Polish (my parents immigrated from Poland to the US), I have some familiarity with the abortion situation in Poland, at least. During communist times, contraception was not always easily available - part of the bungled beaurocracy that kept many consummer products unavailable. Therefore, abortion was used far too often. The communist government seemed not to be significantly discouraging it. After communism fell and a new capitalism was introduced, then not only were contraceptives more easily available but the Catholic Church gained significant political influence and was able to essentially outlaw nearly all abortions. I cannot speak for other Eastern European countries, but some of the trends might have been similar.

The reason we might be having 2.3 kids and Islamic countries is because women are given the right to choose abortion and have rights over their own bodies by law. In certain countries, women are overruled by law not to go out in public unattended, not to teach or have a job, and have no rights over their own body, but a man does. It's BS. The difference is, we are given a better sex ed than certain countries and that as women, it ISN'T our duty or only duty to be a baby machine. We are able to hold careers and be independent. (There are independent women within Arabic countries who are educated, who have careers of their own within these countries too, but they come from educated families and aren't as common place, perhaps.). I am not going to start having kids because of someone else's fear that we are being taken over by Islam. In fact there are many parallels between the fundamentalists there and the ones in the west.

Your reasoning of the effects of abortion are correct. The liberals who see abortion as a normal, acceptable, right to choose abortion are aborting themselves into extinction. Reverence, and a love of life is not what motivates Muslims. The power of Islam is. There is nothing to indicate that Muslims "love" life. They'll cut your limbs or head off for nearly any reason. They'll remove your head with a hacksaw so to take the time for "you" the victim to enjoy the moment and to voice your opinion and video it for your family and countrymen to enjoy.

I'm still confused by this comment. Did you actually mean that? If you did, that is not Pro-choice but Pro-abortion. Women did not have a choice in whether their pregnancies were terminated or not which, having it, is the definition of the PC point of view. So no, they were NOT Pro-choice.
