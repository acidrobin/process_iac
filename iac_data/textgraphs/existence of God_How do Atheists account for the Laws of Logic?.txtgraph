How do atheists account for the laws of logic in a universe without God? The Laws of logic are conceptual by nature and absolute. Being absolute they transcend space and time. They are not the properties of the physical universe (since they are conceptual) or of people (since people contradict each other, which would mean they weren't absolute). So, how do they account for them?Examples of logical absolutes are: something cannot be itself and not itself at the same time (Law of non contradiction). A thing is what it is (Law of identity). A statement is either true or false (Law of excluded middle). These are simple, absolute logical absolutes.How can absolute, conceptual, abstract laws be derived from a universe of matter, energy and motion? In other words, how can an atheist with a naturalistic presupposition account for the existence of logical absolutes when logical absolutes are conceptual by nature and not physical, energy, or motion?

How do Atheists account for the Laws of Logic?

I tried to respond to this when it was in the Religion forum, but it disappeared right before my eyes.I need some clarification of your posit.Are you claiming that atheism precludes logic?I take exception with this part:I agree that the rules of logic are not properties of the physical universe. They are properties of mankind, devised from common sense and experiences of nature. (Logic tells me if I stick my hand in fire, I will get burned.) ...and the fact that people contradict each other has no bearing on the absoluteness of the rules of logic. It merely reflects the failure of many to grasp the rules and play by them....and this part:I recall many occasions wherein someone said of a third party, quite truthfully, "He's not himself today." Clearly, he was nobody else and he was still alive, so he was physically himself, but emotionally detached.:)

Though one could say that a law of physics (i.e., the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence) is a statement which is conceptual, it is a statement that describes actual physical and observable behavior. But, logical absolutes are not observable and do not describe behavior or actions of things since they reside completely in the mind. We do not observe the laws of logic occurring in matter. You don't watch an object NOT bring itself into existence if it doesn't exist. Therefore, no law of logic can be observed by watching nothing. We discover laws of physics by observing and analyzing the behavior of things around us. The laws of logic are not the result of observable behavior of object or actions. For example, we do not see in nature that something is both itself and not itself at the same time. Why? Because we can only observe a phenomena that exists, not one that does not exist. If something is not itself, then it doesn't exist. How then can the property of that non-existent thing be observed? It cannot. Therefore, we are not discovering a law of logic by observation, but by thought. Or, where do we observe in nature that something cannot bring itself into existence if it does not already exist? You cannot make an observation about how something does not occur if it does not exist. You would be, in essence, observing nothing at all and how can any laws of logic be applied to or derived from observing nothing at all? i dont get it, he can say he is someone else but that does not mean that he is someone else, again law of logic are conceptual.The laws of logic are not dependent upon different peoples minds since people are different. Therefore, they cannot be based on human thinking since human thinking is often contradictory.

the fact that the world is governed by laws of logic is exactly what eliminates god. since logic exists, god is not needed.i suppose you assume that logic needs an intelligent initiator of some sort in order for it to exist? why? logic dictate that adding quantity causes that quantity to increase. this would occur with or without god's existence and needs no devine intervention to be consistently true. logic dictates that a system in equilibrium has a total of equal opposite forces and that the sum of all the forces in the system is 0. this is not contingent on god's presmce either. the more explanations of phenomena that can be logically explained, the less god is needed. god and logic are indirectly proportionate. an increase in logic causes a decrease in god

actually, thats not logic, but its closely related. of course, if you stick your hand in fire it will get burned. logic dictates that the sum of initial energy must equal sum of final energy. etc etcyou are very right that logic is predictable and constant. this is exactly why logic diametrically opposes god. a body of water cannot divide itself and leave a dry path down the center unless god something to defy logical law. because gravity exists, its logical for water or any fluid to be drawn by gravity to the lowest level possible. there is nothing miraculous about the common and predictable properties of water under the force of gravity, so god isnt needed to explain it because logic already hasif, however, that body of water behaves in a way that logic cannot explain, then we can almost positively assume that such is the intervention of god. the only acts that can be accredited to god, in the bible, are those where something illogical occured

www.carm.org says the following, they make a good pointyou can find it at http://www.carm.org/atheism/God_rock.htmCan God make a rock so big He can't pick it up? This question is representative of the type of paradoxes atheists use in attempts to prove that God cannot exist. It works like this. God is supposed to be omnipotent. If He is omnipotent, then He can create a rock so big that He can't pick it up. If He cannot make a rock like this, then He is not omnipotent. If He can make a rock so big He can't pick it up, then He isn't omnipotent either. Either way demonstrates that God cannot do something. Therefore God is not omnipotent. Therefore God does not exist. Is this logical? A little. However, the problem is that this bit of logic omits some crucial information, therefore, it's conclusion is inaccurate.What the above "paradox" lacks is vital information concerning God's nature. His omnipotence is not something independent of His nature. It is part of His nature. God has a nature and His attributes operate within that nature, as does anything and everything else. For example, I have human nature. I can run. But, I cannot outrun a lion. My nature simply does not permit it. My ability to run is connected to my nature and I cannot violate it. So too with God. His omnipotence is connected to His nature since being omnipotent is part of what He is. Omnipotence, then, must be consistent with what He is and not with what He is not since His omnipotence is not an entity to itself. Therefore, God can only do those things that are consistent with His nature. He cannot lie because it is against His nature to do so. Not being able to lie does not mean He is not God or that He is not all powerful. Also, He cannot cease to be God. Since He is in all places at all times, if He stopped existing then He wouldn't be in all places at all time. Therefore, He cannot cease to exist without violating His own nature. The point is that God cannot do something that is a violation of His own existence and nature. Therefore, He cannot make a rock so big he can't pick up, or make something bigger than Himself, etc. But, not being able to do this does not mean He is not God nor that He is not omnipotent. Omnipotence is not the ability to do anything conceivable, but the ability to do anything consistent with His nature and consistent with His desire within the realm of His unlimited and universal power which we do not possess. This does not mean He can violate His own nature. If He did something inconsistent with His nature, then He would be self contradictory. If God were self contradictory, He would not be true. Likewise, if He did something that violated his nature, like make a rock so big He can't pick it up, He would also not be true since that would be a self contradiction. Since truth is not self contradictory, as neither is God, if He were not true, then He would not be God. But God is true and not self contradictory, therefore, God cannot do something that violates His own nature.Another way to look at it is realize that in order for God to make something so big He couldn't pick it up, He would have to make a rock bigger than Himself. Since He is infinite in size, He would have to make something that would be bigger than Himself. Since it is His nature to be the biggest thing in existence because He created all things, He cannot violate His own nature by making a rock that is larger than He. Also, since a rock, by definition, is not infinitely big, then it isn't logically possible to make a rock, something that is finite in size, be infinite in size (no longer a rock) since only God is infinite in size. At dictionary.com, a rock is defined as a "Relatively hard, naturally formed mineral or petrified matter; stone. a) A relatively small piece or fragment of such material. b) A relatively large body of such material, as a cliff or peak. c) A naturally formed aggregate of mineral matter constituting a significant part of the earth's crust." A rock, by definition is not infinitely large. So, to say that the rock must be so big that God cannot pick it up is to say that the rock is no longer a rock. What the critics are asking is that God become self contradictory as a proof He doesn't exist. Their assertion is illogical from the start. So what they are doing is trying to get God to be illogical. They want to use illogic to prove God doesn't exist instead of logic. It doesn't work and the "paradox" is self-refuting and invalid.

CHRISTIAN APOLOGETICS & RESEARCH MINISTRY www.carm.org--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Can God make a rock so big He can't pick it up? This question is representative of the type of paradoxes atheists use in attempts to prove that God cannot exist. It works like this. God is supposed to be omnipotent. If He is omnipotent, then He can create a rock so big that He can't pick it up. If He cannot make a rock like this, then He is not omnipotent. If He can make a rock so big He can't pick it up, then He isn't omnipotent either. Either way demonstrates that God cannot do something. Therefore God is not omnipotent. Therefore God does not exist. Is this logical? A little. However, the problem is that this bit of logic omits some crucial information, therefore, it's conclusion is inaccurate.What the above "paradox" lacks is vital information concerning God's nature. His omnipotence is not something independent of His nature. It is part of His nature. God has a nature and His attributes operate within that nature, as does anything and everything else. For example, I have human nature. I can run. But, I cannot outrun a lion. My nature simply does not permit it. My ability to run is connected to my nature and I cannot violate it. So too with God. His omnipotence is connected to His nature since being omnipotent is part of what He is.

How do atheists account for the laws of logic in a universe without God? The Laws of logic are conceptual by nature and absolute. Being absolute they transcend space and time. They are not the properties of the physical universe (since they are conceptual) or of people (since people contradict each other, which would mean they weren't absolute). So, how do they account for them?Examples of logical absolutes are: something cannot be itself and not itself at the same time (Law of non contradiction). A thing is what it is (Law of identity). A statement is either true or false (Law of excluded middle). These are simple, absolute logical absolutes.How can absolute, conceptual, abstract laws be derived from a universe of matter, energy and motion? In other words, how can an atheist with a naturalistic presupposition account for the existence of logical absolutes when logical absolutes are conceptual by nature and not physical, energy, or motion?

Logical truths simply follow from the way in which concepts are defined.1 + 1 = 2 is true and always true because of the meaning of (1), the + sign, and =. They are not dependent on matter, nor are they dependent on god.It is true regardless of whether there is any matter which the number 1 can be used to describe, or regardless of whether any conscious being exists which can think it.These are not concepts created by man, but discovered by him.I am not sure what you mean here by derived. If you mean created, they are certainly not created by the physical universe, they are true regardless of whether any universe exists at all. Yes this may contradict the view of some "strict" naturalists, who claim that the physical, material world is all that exists, but they simply deny that things like the "law of non-contradiction" exist at all.

Good has nothing do with logic. Explain what good and logic have in common????The Christian theistic worldview can account for the laws of logic by stating that they come from God. God is transcendent; that is, He is beyond the material universe being its creator. God has originated the laws of logic because they are a reflection of His nature. Therefore, the laws of logic are absolute. The are absolute because there is an absolute God. The atheistic worldview cannot account for the laws of logic/absolutes, and must borrow from the Christian worldview in order to rationally argue.

very true. logic exists whether people are there to grasps its concepts or not.where we disagree is at your assumption that god created logic. how can this be? logic is not contingent on any intelligent entity, whether it be man or god, to exist. the logic of increasing a quantity by adding to it would remain whether god existed or not. you have yet to tie the existence of logic to god as its cause

Abram, I would suggest you study cognitive processes and the evolution of both the human body and the human mind. We take reality and describe it in our minds and thus form it into abstract concepts which we can operate with. Or, for more fun, just read a few articles on camouflage. You'll see that you don't become invisible by looking exactly like your surroundings, but by simply not looking like anything at all to the observer's eye.

I'm still having a hard time with this. If nothing exists, no matter, then how can "the number one" exist? On what basis is it defined? If there is only nothing, then you can't add to it, like I said 0+0=0.I know this is getting slightly off topic and philosophical, but it would seem to me that "concepts", and I'm not sure exactly how that's being defined, must have a basis in reality, and therefore in matter.I agree in that they are not created. I disagree in that IMHO, they are a function of our physical universe. IMHO, you don't have the concept without the universe to "define" it.

Well, I can tell you that 2+2=10, or indeed that 2+2=11, and be correct.

If I search long enough, I can probably find someone who doesn't think 2+2=4. Does that invalidate it as being correct?Waxy

This is my understanding as well. Interestingly, concepts only approximate that which they intend to define. Confusion between concept and actuality is fertile ground for misunderstanding.

Abram, I would suggest you study cognitive processes and the evolution of both the human body and the human mind. We take reality and describe it in our minds and thus form it into abstract concepts which we can operate with. Or, for more fun, just read a few articles on camouflage. You'll see that you don't become invisible by looking exactly like your surroundings, but by simply not looking like anything at all to the observer's eye.

You said there are not physical entities. The atheists world in only physical

addition works in the intangible as well. 1 minute + 1 minute = 2 minutes. 1 idea + 1 idea = 2 ideas. the concept of quantity is not limited to matter. if there was just a vaccous void were absolutely nothing was happening, then there would be no application of logic. but even that in itself would be logical. nothing + nothing = nothing is logical. it would actually be logical if a void with nothing added to it result in something. so even in a void, logic still prevails

I'm still having a hard time with this. If nothing exists, no matter, then how can "the number one" exist? On what basis is it defined? If there is only nothing, then you can't add to it, like I said 0+0=0.I know this is getting slightly off topic and philosophical, but it would seem to me that "concepts", and I'm not sure exactly how that's being defined, must have a basis in reality, and therefore in matter.I agree in that they are not created. I disagree in that IMHO, they are a function of our physical universe. IMHO, you don't have the concept without the universe to "define" it. I don't know, it's too early in the AM, maybe someone can point out the errors in my thinking.Waxy

The term "matter" means physical properties that can be observed through our senses. Matter, energy can change forms but can be observed. Music can be observed and tested because music is sound waves which are a form of energy in the category of physical properties. The Laws of Logic are not material and cannot be observed.

i didnt mention good anywhere in my postthis is totally false. the laws of logic being absolute does nothing to support a case for god. in fact, everything the bible tells us about god's nature indicates that god is illogical, unpredictable, unreliable and irreplicable. this is totally the opposite of logic

I think I understand what you're getting at, I'm just having trouble accepting it.I'm not sure the application to the abstract nullifes the need to have something concrete on which to base the concept.Perhaps I'm getting too philosohpical, but I just can't get past the need (my need) to have a basis for the concept in observable matter. Would the concept exist if there was no matter or no means to test/validate it? I know you've said yes, I'm struggling with how. How do you make the jump from nothing to addition of nothing, when there is nothing to add, or for that matter (no pun intended), to even suggest or being to define the concept of addition?Could the concept potentially be different in another universe/reality? Are the concepts limited by our current ability to understand them? etc... etc....

very true. logic exists whether people are there to grasps its concepts or not.where we disagree is at your assumption that god created logic. how can this be? logic is not contingent on any intelligent entity, whether it be man or god, to exist. the logic of increasing a quantity by adding to it would remain whether god existed or not. you have yet to tie the existence of logic to god as its cause

I agree for the most part. However, without the knowledge and absolute certainty of being able to physically test the hypothesis (2+2=4) and prove it true, we would not be able to use the extrapolation of that hypothesis to derive the answer in your scenario with the same degree of certainty.I would liken it to the difference between a scientic theory - evolution, gravity, etc.... and mathematics. We can prove absolutely that 2+2=4, despite all of the evidence for evolution, gravity, etc..., they cannot be tested physically or derived using logic to provide absolute certainty.

the logic works, but we cant verify it in the physical realm. youll never be able to put 2 groups of 2,000,000,000,000,000,000 hamsters together and count them as you would 4 matchsticks. we know that addition works, and that extrapolation (in this case) would work on the same principles of logic. but you could never verify it physically, since it would be physically impossible. yet it would not be necessary to physical prove the sum. i see your point, but the point is that it can be proven without the use of material objects and what not

As far as I can tell, this "logic is abstract and beyond the material, and beyond the human mind, so it must come from God" idea is no different to Intelligent Design or people who ask "So what caused the Big Bang?"The fact that there are 1) Things which are so complex that we do not yet understand them2) Abstract concepts which cannot be quantified3) Laws of logic which exist independent of usare all intriguing subjects worth talking about, but no matter how many billions of arguments I hear on the subject, not one comes anywhere near convincing me that the only explanation is that God must exist in order for these perplexing aspects of existence to exist.The opening post:OK, I agree that the "laws of logic" themselves are conceptual by nature. However the rest of this statement is flawed. The laws of logic that we are aware of are concepts which we have noted as we have become more aware of the way in which the universe works.Even though these logical truths would exist independently of us, they would not exist independently of the universe. While they are not properties of the physical universe, they are properties of the interactions and possibilities which take place within the universe. They do not have to come from anywhere. They exist as a result of the existence of the universe and its physical configuration, not as a result of the existence of God.Both of your examples are simply the product of the fact that on a macroscopic scale, we live in a highly ordered universe where matter and energy ebb and flow in predictable patterns. Objects and phenomena in our universe obey four basic forces which give rise to all physical interactions, and can be measured and tested, hence cannot be more than one thing at once, and can be shown to have happened or not to have happened. One does not need God at this point in the argument.(On the quantum scale however, neither of these statements describe experimental data satisfactorily.)Absolute, conceptual, abstract laws are derived from the universe of matter, energy and motion through the working of the human mind.Before human minds existed, 2 mountains and two mountains were still 4 mountains, planets followed their orbits, entropy increased. The universe does not need God to tell it how to work, it does it on its own as a result of its own configuration.These abstract logical concepts existed before us, but it is us who has termed them "abstract concepts", otherwise they are just The Way Things Work.My comparison to other "big questions" was relevant to all this because it is a common phenomenon for people to attribute things we do not fully comprehend to the existence of the Divine. I am intrigued by these questions ADW is posing though, just to see where they go. But "is it safe to say you know things by sense perception?" seems like a loaded question to me. You asked "How do you know things?" and I think unkerpaulie answered fully and satisfactorily. Where do you go from there?

I agree for the most part. However, without the knowledge and absolute certainty of being able to physically test the hypothesis (2+2=4) and prove it true, we would not be able to use the extrapolation of that hypothesis to derive the answer in your scenario with the same degree of certainty.I would liken it to the difference between a scientic theory - evolution, gravity, etc.... and mathematics. We can prove absolutely that 2+2=4, despite all of the evidence for evolution, gravity, etc..., they cannot be tested physically or derived using logic to provide absolute certainty. Without absolute physical proof and the ability to physically, and repeatably, test something, it cannot be considered absolute.Anyhoo, I'm so offtrack, I could be arguing against myself at this point. :) Waxy

we know things because we have consistently demonstrated them to be true. in other words, they have been provenconsider this statement: touching a hot pot will burn mei know that a hot pot will burn me because i've consistently been burned by hot pots when i touch them. this is personal experience and the first level of proof. expanding on this, we know that fire converts propane gas (in the stove) from chemical energy to thermal energy. we also know that thermal energy is conducted through and temporarily stored in metal objects, such as a pot. and we know that our nervous system has sensors in our fingertips that detect temperature and causes us to feel a painful sensation when it detects something very hot. so touching a hot pot will burn me. this is scientific evidence and the second level of proofeither level of proof is enough to consider the statement to be true. when we mentally affirm a statement we consider to be true, we "know" that it is trueill answer your follow up question right away. 'knowing" something by faith is different from "knowing" something by evidence, in that it is the opposite. faith is considering a statement to be true at the lack of evidence or in the face of contradictory evidence. i may "know" that a hot pot will burn me because i have been told, but havent proven this myself. this "knowledge" is based on faith, and continues to be based on faith until i have evidence that this is true. as time goes on and i experience being burnt by pots or understand the mechanics of being burnt by hot pots, i no longer rely on the faith i had in being told, because i have enough evidence to know that it is true for myselfan atheist "knows" things through evidence. specifically concerning things of god and the supernatural, there is simply no evidence of a consistent and reliable condition. "evidence" for god's existence is usually very sporadic and unpredictable, and its simply not consistent enough to be considered evidence, so the statements based thereon are considered not true

"There is no proof that God exists" is quite accurate. Only the deepest philosophy will come to the point of seriously debating the fault in the statement, which is that as we are posessed of imperfect knowledge we cannot deny the possibility that some as yet undiscovered proof of god might exist. In this case, we'd modify the statement to "There is no known proof that God exists." However, in the context, what you are doing is not deep philosophy, but nitpicking.As for the laws of logic, once more I shall try to explain from another angle: logic, mathematics and similar are ways in which we describe the universe. Take an apple. Take another apple. Now you have two apples, but you don't actually have two of the same things. You just recognize that apples are similar one to another and that it is reasonable to invent the nonexistent context of an abstract apple.While this may be somewhat unclear, it is clarified if you take an apple and a pear. You now have two fruits. However, you will notice that there is no fruit in reality, only apples, pears, peaches and so on. Fruit is an abstract concept. That abstract concept exists only as a set of criteria within our minds. Even so, these concepts are not universal, which is immediately obvious once you notice the various things people consider fruit even though they fail to meet some criteria, thus showing their non-universality.This is how abstract concept can "exist" in our minds, without having an existence of their own. And these concepts are something we invented. Until you are introduced to one, you don't have knowledge of them. For example, you have no knowledge of the concept of "hofflenosh", which is what this thread is all about, but it is still an abstract concept.As for science and God, you do have a point, but you are also misrepresenting that point. Science is about studying the natural world, if you define it as the world that we can in some way observe, that has some effect on us. While this does mean that science cannot study that which may exist without affecting our reality, it must also be noted that it is not possible to study anything that has absolutely no effect on us by any means, not even logic and philosophy.Also, while the purely philosophical argument does hold water, making the position of agnosticism theoretically more accurate than either atheism or religion, one must realize the limits of what this argument means.First, it does not prove the existence of god.Second, it does not extend very far when it comes to real life. Religion is not just about philosophical debate, it also makes several demands of real life. Observance of rituals, setting up taboos, establishing morality and similar. In order to accapt these, however, one must be able to substantiate them with arguments based upon reality.Here, we get into different waters. The arguments proposed by the religious often lack a suitable amount of rational support. In the case of those that don't, science can often offer alternative explanations that turn out to be better supported and more likely. In the case of these arguments, atheism is actually a valid position.And, just in case:"I declare that I know the existence of an entity of a higher order, beyond the ken of mortals, and that this entity demands that we cease existing immediately, for which it offers to reward us with an eternity of blissful nonexistence. If we do not comply, it threatens to utterly destroy us all."Just to prevent any tricky ideas about there being only one and such...

personal experience as evidence has a lot to do with sensory projection. however, it is evidence because it results in the same sensory experiences consistently. scientific evidence is not subject to sensory projection. this can be physically measured and testedthats not what i said. i said "when we mentally affirm a statement we consider to be true". not everyone affirms the same things as true. knowledge changes from person to person. truth is, regardless of if it is known or notit is correct to say that science has not found any proof for god yet. therefore, as of now, there is no proof of god's existence, furthermore, you describe god as "not limited to the universe". to me this implies that god is beyond physical, sensory and scientific detection. if such is the case, there will never be scientific proof for godthe law of non-contradiction is true because it has been consistently and reliably proven to be true. you cannot know your name and not know your name at the same time. therefore this logical law is true.

i wont go how you totally misread and misunderstood irius' arguments about logic, but ill respond to this final remarkatheism as a way of life has nothing to do with finding life meaningless or devalued. as atheists we realize that there is no hereafter so what we do while we are alive is what counts, not because we hope we can buy our way into heaven by being nice, but because we can make earth a better place by being nice. theist doctrine promotes "laying up treasures in heaven". it means you have a greater interest in a heaven that awaits you after life, than in the earth you occupy during life. terms like "passing through" and "not my home" demonstrate even more that theists dont see earth as the ultimate realm to work at improving. instead, you see this as a "test" or "dress rehearsal" and eternal residence in heaven is your goal. if you really think about it, you are the ones that see life on earth as of little worth, since this is only a means by which you can get a later reward. the atheist sees life on earth as the reward in itself

The logic is in knowing beforehand that your hand will be burned if stuck into a fire. This has nothing to do with the physical aspects of heat, nerves and burning skin. Please introduce me to someone who has no mother.The deductions regarding experiments in physics involve logic and logical conclusions based upon repeated observations of things happening around us.To logically conclude that an apple will fall to the ground if released from any given height above the ground has no dependence whatsoever on whether a god made all this matter that we're part of.You mistakenly imply that if a certain group doesn't understand the logic, then the logic is invalid.This contradicts the fact that logic is an invention born of brain power. If there were no living beings, there would be no logic. There would be plenty to think about but nobody to do any thinking requiring what we know today as logic. Logic is TOTALLY a human construct....and since it has nothing at all to do with the existence of God, atheists are just as good at it as the Bible Thumpers. As a matter of fact, I know an atheist who is far more logical than anyone else I've heard to date.

How do atheists account for the laws of logic in a universe without God? The Laws of logic are conceptual by nature and absolute. Being absolute they transcend space and time. They are not the properties of the physical universe (since they are conceptual) or of people (since people contradict each other, which would mean they weren't absolute). So, how do they account for them?Examples of logical absolutes are: something cannot be itself and not itself at the same time (Law of non contradiction). A thing is what it is (Law of identity). A statement is either true or false (Law of excluded middle). These are simple, absolute logical absolutes.How can absolute, conceptual, abstract laws be derived from a universe of matter, energy and motion? In other words, how can an atheist with a naturalistic presupposition account for the existence of logical absolutes when logical absolutes are conceptual by nature and not physical, energy, or motion?

The logic is in knowing beforehand that your hand will be burned if stuck into a fire. This has nothing to do with the physical aspects of heat, nerves and burning skin. Please introduce me to someone who has no mother.The deductions regarding experiments in physics involve logic and logical conclusions based upon repeated observations of things happening around us.To logically conclude that an apple will fall to the ground if released from any given height above the ground has no dependence whatsoever on whether a god made all this matter that we're part of.You mistakenly imply that if a certain group doesn't understand the logic, then the logic is invalid.This contradicts the fact that logic is an invention born of brain power. If there were no living beings, there would be no logic. There would be plenty to think about but nobody to do any thinking requiring what we know today as logic. Logic is TOTALLY a human construct....and since it has nothing at all to do with the existence of God, atheists are just as good at it as the Bible Thumpers. As a matter of fact, I know an atheist who is far more logical than anyone else I've heard to date.

All you have said is there are two apples. I noticed you said “describe”, I can describe what a chair is, but that description is not the chair itself. Are the apples the "law of non-contradiction"?“Fruit” is a name we give to identify a physical object; the laws of logic are not physical.When you say “fruit” exists you can show its existence in the physical world. If the laws of logic exist, then show me. For one thing, atheism cannot account for a universal concept that is not material, and does not depend on our thinking. In addition to that, I am using the same argument atheist’s use against the existence of God to get the atheist to show me the existence of the laws of logic. Atheists say, “Show me God” I cannot see him. Theist describe that the universe cannot exist without God by showing the affects of God in the material universal (design) Show me the laws of logic, where is it? I cannot see it. Using apples is describing it is not the law itself. Just like I describe the evidence of Gods existence.The laws or logic are not universal? Again, you are using matter to show something that is non-material, I can look at fruit until I am blue in the face but that only describes concepts, it is not the laws of logic itself. How can they? If they exist in the mind and not on there own, then I can chose not do think about or believe in these laws (Bivalency, Involution, Idempotency,Identity, (Non-)Contradiction, Excluded Middle, Contraction, Commutatively, DeMorgan's, Associatively, Distributivity) and they stop existing? Or I could say, "hofflenosh" is a concept I think is stupid and does not exist, come to think of it, the law of excluded middle is a stupid concept so it does not exist either. If is existed only in the mined, it would not be absolute. It would be your opinion of the law of logic existing against someone that says they do not exist. So before "we invented" the laws of logic they did not exist?Something could be itself and not itself at the same time, before "we invented" the law of non-contradiction?Just because we do not know the laws of logic does not mean they do not exist. I could debate someone and violate the laws of logic and claim I don’t have any knowledge of them and therefore they don’t exist for me.Attacking the person again, not the argument, I guess atheists can make logical fallacies because it’s a concept that they can choose to not exist like the concept of “hofflenosh”Hmmm, you cannot study the laws of logic. That’s like saying we cannot study math because it as no effect on us. Try violating the law of non-contradiction in a test you take. Say to person that is giving the test, “The wrong answer can be the right answer at the same time sir, because the law of non-contradiction has no effect and does not exist for me, beside its impossible it study the laws of logic or anything abstract like this test.” I can see why people would be drawn to atheism, wow, "eternity of blissful non-existence” (“blissful” you can enjoy non-existence?) as an atheist it does not matter what you do, life has no meaning, we are atoms banging around at random, you live—you die—you stink—and then you’re extinct. Do whatever you want, rape, murder, or be the next Hitler. If you want to be kind and caring like Mother Teresa, that’s fine too, because there is no difference between Hitler, Stalin, Lenin, Mao and Mother Teresa; in the end, they all have the same consequences for their actions: non-existences.

im not saying that my worldview is 100% provable because i live by faith but my faith is not blind, it makes sense to what we see in the world. However, if one examines the atheists worldview, it has lots of things that it cannot account for. All that exist is matter; do I excuse a rock for tripping me? They cannot account for morals. If morals come from man, then man can change them, if they come from majority consensus, it still begs the question is the majority right? The majority can change. If we are born with them, I could say, I was born to kill. (Animals do not have morals why should we?) "common sense" what makes your common sense better then mine? how do you know your common sense is correct? common sense is relative, not absolute.maybe, but see, that does not match the materialist universe?Why not, think about it. No rules, all we are, are animals. If atheism is true, that is what we are left with. Go ahead make an argument for morality.

i think you lost him at apples somewhere...abram, he's saying, before we invented the concept of "fruit", the concept of "fruit" did not exist. a fruit is both a thing and a term that collecively defines a group of things. each "fruit" is a physical thing with an identity of its own, such as apples, oranges, pears, etc, and none of them are simply a "fruit". therefore no such thing as a "fruit" exists, except the general concept that collectively defines apples, oranges, pears, etc. (why am i even bothering)here is the proof that the law of non-contradiction exists (again)you cannot know your name and not know your name at the same time. therefore the logic of non-contradiction is true.

i agree, that fruit is a concept that is aplied to the phyical world, but the fruit concept is different in the fact that it did not exist untill we placed the term "fruit" with the physical matter. The laws of logic, on the other hand, were not made up concepts and aways existed and does not have any physical manifistation like "fruit" does.your example is good about you can not know your name and know your name at the same time. but again, that example is not the law itself. My question is how do you know that statement is true? you seam to gain knowledge my using your senses (touching the pot)what sensing are you using to know that statement. you are now using abstract things like "names" to describ the laws of logic because you know you cannot show the laws of logic in the physical universe. So you know something exists thats universial, not apart of, or dependent on the mind of man, non-material, and can not be show in physical world. Atheists dont believe in God because they cannot see him, eventhrough there are physical evidence of a creator but will believe in the laws of logic when it cannot be sean in the physical universe. I can discribe God just like you can give examples of the laws of logic, but the discription of both are not them. that was my first point. my second point was the laws of logic must come from God because universial, unchanging, non-material, absolute concepts (laws of logic) cannot exist when all there is, is matter. i guess i did not get anywhere with this, but it just something to think about. and with that, as for me, im done with the topic.thanks for putting up with me.

What the hell, may as well try again...But this is not a logical conclusion. 1) The universe is purely a physical entity2) The many elements of the universe interact with each other predictably3) Humans have extrapolated logical laws from this predictability. 4) These laws include physical theory and the more fundamental logical laws such as non-contradiction.5) These laws exist independent of humanity6) These laws do not exist independent of the universe7) These laws have no meaning without the human mind to categorise them8) These laws, whilst not a property of the physical universe, are a function of the physical universe9) These laws do not need God to exist.

Abram, when a chess computer plays chess it uses what are essentially concepts of a chess board, chess pieces, and the rules of chess. Go ahead Abram, open up the "thinking" part of a chess computer and show me the physical chess board and physical chess pieces that the computer moves around on it while analyzing a position. You can't: they don't exist ... not as their physical selves. Instead, logic circuits model these entities - they create immaterial representations of physical objects and then manipulate the representations logically. And the rules of chess - analogous to the laws of logic - are programmed into the computer: ultimately, they exist as some organization of matter even though you can't see, feel, hear, smell, or taste rule of chessSo Abram, would you argue that chess computers are more than just matter? Do you claim that chess computer possess a soul?

I would not argue that. Chess computers run only on electricity. A computer does not have a "mind of its one." A computer is only matter (electricity is a form of matter). The way a computer works as if it is intelligent, but is really works because it is following what has been pre-programmed. All it does is follow the physical laws. Computers do not use concepts! When you make a move on a chess game, it is like turning on the lights in room. All you are doing is sending an electrical single to the computer that must follow what has been pre-programmed. E-mail Dell or something; ask a computer expert if computers have concepts. I grantee you computers do not. Computers are noting but physical matter.I have answered your question but as I said, I am done with this topic. My position still stands, the laws of logic are non-material, universal, unchanging, and absolute. Atheists cannot explain why they exist because there worldview is only material. If the laws of logic are material, then show me. Material things change and are not absolute. It is like saying, all that exist are marbles, but appealing to some non-marble entity to prove there worldview. There are rocks, trees ...and logic! Look everyone there are the laws of logic...hum I can’t see them...are they under that rock? You said everything is material. They have to acknowledge that they cannot account for the laws of logic but use them in order to argue for atheism.

A human brain runs on electricity too. For example, “electrical impulses” called action potentials propagate along neuronal axons.A human brain is likewise only matter. Both a chess computer and a human brain can solve problems that they have never encountered before, and they do so using logical rules. Rules of chess or rules of logic that you can’t touch, taste, smell, hear, or see.Irrelevant. The important fact is that a computer is ONLY matter and yet can use “non-physical” rules – rules that you can’t see, smell, touch, hear, or taste.So show me valid evidence that the brain does not do likewise!What I said was that a chess computers uses what are essentially concepts. And they do, as I explained. What they move around to analyze a chess position is not actual, physical chess pieces that can be seen and touched, but rather logical representations of them that are manipulated by their information processing circuitry. For example, a white king might be logically represented as a 32-bit binary string similar to 10101010010101110101011110100100. That’s not a physical king that you can pick up and move on your chess board: it doesn't have the same mass, height, volume, color, or other physical properties as an actual, physical white king. It is a logical representation of a particular chess piece. Similarly, a white king in our brain is represented by a particular pattern of brain activation: a specific set of neurons fire when we see or recall a white king. There is no actual physical chess piece inside our brain, but rather a logical representation of it. That representation does not have the same mass, height, volume, color, or other physical properties of the actual object it stand in for.And when a stream of photons bouncing off of an apple strikes our retinas, electrical signals are sent to our brain, which then interprets them as representing an apple according to preexisting images stored in our memory.Dell? LOL! No thanks, I already have a BS in CIS and have been a professional computer programmer and database manager for the past 10 or so years.Our brains are nothing but physical matter: if you believe otherwise, then you have an unobservable claim that requires evidence. So demonstrate it.You already said you were done in this thread, then posted again. So you said one thing but your actions were quite the opposite. Jesus has a word for people like you: "Hypocrite!".Only in your personal opinion. Many people have shown it to be flawed, but like some many other Christians, when presented evidence against your position, you essentially shut your eyes, plug your fingers in your ears, and are start muttering "blah blah blah”: then claim no one has countered you.Look everyone, a computer using rules of chess …. Hum I can’t see them … maybe if I open up the CPU? A purely material chess computer can still use immaterial rules of chess to solve problems it has never encountered before.

The fact that something cannot be true and not true at the same time does not mean that this law has an "existence".

It is simply an intrinsic property of the universe.etc....You have tried to put words in the mouths of Atheists by saying "they cannot explain why the laws of logic exist because their worldview is only material".I doubt many atheists (or anyone) thinks of the laws of logic as anything more than a property of the way the universe is. There is nothing metaphysical about them, therefore there is no contradiction in the atheist worldview in order to "accept" their "existence".Sorry Abram, your God just vanished in a puff of realisation.

Right back at you! After posting my statement, I realized that I had forgotten what I had been doing in this thread, but never made it back here to change it. I am sorry if my tone was out of line. I hadn't spent much time at all reading the posts in this thread, and still haven't. But I believe that you were pretty much correct in saying that my computer argument did not address his actual argument.My idea was to attack his argument from a different angle: one I didn't see anyone yet using. I was starting by trying to show that the rules of logic can EXIST in a purely material object. I tried to do this by first showing that there is nothing supernatural about a chess computer, yet the rules of chess do EXIST in it, somewhere, even though we can't touch, smell, see, hear, or taste them. By analogy (though analogies are always potentially invalid), the rules of logic can EXIST in our purely material brains, though we cannot touch, smell, see, hear, or taste them. If I could convince him that the rules of logic could EXIST in a purely material object, I believed that that would be enough to do the trick.

the issue of non-material is probably the only thing that god and logic have in common. however, it is easy for an atheist to believe in logic and apply logic than to belief in god and apply faith.logic is consistent and reliable. it cant be rigorously tested and conditioned, and still always produce predictable results. take a look at this: 4, 7, 10, 13... the numbers in this sequence follow a pattern. they increase by 3. our sensory perception and our familiarity with addition helps us determine this. if asked for the 5th number in the sequence, you might say 16, but someone that didnt catch the pattern might say something else. since this is subjective, it may vary from person to person depending on their level of math proficiency. now watch this: 3x + 1. this is a formula to the sequence above. however, if asked to calculate the solution when x=5, then there is no sensory perception involved. you simply apply the substitution and get 16. applying this formula does not require perception or subjective perspective. hence it is 100% reliable and predictablefaith, unfortunately, does not work this way. there is nothing reliable and predictable about applying faith. for example, the bible says "children obey your parents in the lord, so that it may be well with you and you will live long on the earth". applying this "formula" does not produce reliable and predictable results. obedient children sometimes die young, and disobedient rebelious children sometimes grow to old age. not only that, but the clause "in the lord" creates a complication, since what is "in the lord" as far as parenting goes varies from church to church in various degrees. because no definite corelation between being obedient to your parents "in the lord", and long life, can be established, the "formula" is inconsistent and unpredictable and is discarded as false.most faith-based formulae and conditions wind up the same way for the same reasons

i agree, that fruit is a concept that is aplied to the phyical world, but the fruit concept is different in the fact that it did not exist untill we placed the term "fruit" with the physical matter. The laws of logic, on the other hand, were not made up concepts and aways existed and does not have any physical manifistation like "fruit" does.your example is good about you can not know your name and know your name at the same time. but again, that example is not the law itself. My question is how do you know that statement is true? you seam to gain knowledge my using your senses (touching the pot)what sensing are you using to know that statement. you are now using abstract things like "names" to describ the laws of logic because you know you cannot show the laws of logic in the physical universe. So you know something exists thats universial, not apart of, or dependent on the mind of man, non-material, and can not be show in physical world. Atheists dont believe in God because they cannot see him, eventhrough there are physical evidence of a creator but will believe in the laws of logic when it cannot be sean in the physical universe. I can discribe God just like you can give examples of the laws of logic, but the discription of both are not them. that was my first point. my second point was the laws of logic must come from God because universial, unchanging, non-material, absolute concepts (laws of logic) cannot exist when all there is, is matter. i guess i did not get anywhere with this, but it just something to think about. and with that, as for me, im done with the topic.thanks for putting up with me.

I would like to poke my head in here at this late date. I have read most all posts, but please excuse me if I repeat what has already been said. I just want to comment that the premise of this thread simply makes no sense at all and is easily refutable.If something is conceptual, that by definition means it was conceived by the human mind. That's what a concept is. I think that simply ends the discussion. Concepts are of human construction and thinking. Logical constructs are absolute only to the extent that they were designed that way.I don't even know what that means. Kinda woo-woo but has no meaning. I'll give you that, though there is a whole school of debate about what thoughts are. Well they are of people and if logic is followed, contradiction does not occur. Blah, blah. So you looked something up. Adds nothing. Stated above.This whole thing is simply an epistemological argument, for which there is no answer. What is the nature of knowledge? There are positivists (Abe here) and there are constructivists (what Abe says you have to be if you don't believe in god.) This is a metaphysical debate that is decades old and it simply depends upon your point of view for the purpose of the discussion at hand.

How do atheists account for the laws of logic in a universe without God? The Laws of logic are conceptual by nature and absolute. Being absolute they transcend space and time. They are not the properties of the physical universe (since they are conceptual) or of people (since people contradict each other, which would mean they weren't absolute). So, how do they account for them?Examples of logical absolutes are: something cannot be itself and not itself at the same time (Law of non contradiction). A thing is what it is (Law of identity). A statement is either true or false (Law of excluded middle). These are simple, absolute logical absolutes.How can absolute, conceptual, abstract laws be derived from a universe of matter, energy and motion? In other words, how can an atheist with a naturalistic presupposition account for the existence of logical absolutes when logical absolutes are conceptual by nature and not physical, energy, or motion?

There are contradictions in the bible, for so the bible doesn't obey the law of non contradiction. As to the law of identity, Jesus is called both the "Son of God" and the "Son of Man", which means Also, many parts of the bible are taken as 'metaphors' - yet the law of excluded middle should prevent us from doing that.I'm sure someone will be able to refute my individual points, but on the whole the bible is not an entirely logical source.Furthermore, even if these laws were created by a God, this God does not have to be the same one described in any religion whatsoever. In fact, he doesn't have to be omnipotent, so he could even be dead - Atheists could state that God created these laws then died. In which case, God does not exist but Atheists have still accounted for the creation of said laws.

I'm so depressed at having missed this one! I don't suppose anyone will mind if I chip in anyway.Assume God is required to have 'created' logic (along with everything else). Now imagine there is no God. Without him, according to our assumptions, there is certainly nothing - yet our derivation of that certainty presupposes the validity of logic. With no god to create logic, we cannot exclude the possibility of the universe existing. If the universe can exist without god...:)Then there's the part about god's 'own nature'. If god cannot violate his own nature, that implies a form of logic to which he is beholden, and which he therefore did not choose. If one form of logic can exist beyond god, so can ours.:)What else...Oh yes: 1+1 = 2, and its binary and unary equivalents 1+1 = 10 and 1+1 = 11. These expressions operate according to the axioms of a mathematical space - axioms we define. They model our perception of reality; they are not in themselves real.On no level is the equation 1+1 = 2 expressed outside of human consciousness. A rock with another rock next to it is precisely that; they and everything else in the universe represents a single configuration of matter. Before they can be called "two rocks" you need an intelligence capable of conceptually partitioning reality and categorising its perceptions. However, the absence of such an intelligence would in no way impede the rocks' (or the universe's) behaviour as a configuration of matter. Ergo, counting is a human invention.Finally:The logic we use to make statements about reality is derived from the way we observe material things behaving, and that logic is not immutable. Quantum physics demonstrates the fundamentally uncertain nature of reality at very tiny scales: the 'law of excluded middle' in particular taking it firmly in the shorts. Given that logic can vary on such a simple metric as physical scale, your argument is starting to look more than a bit frayed at the edges :)

Where are the laws of physics encoded? I don't think they exist, written down, in some particular place, rather they're the properties of physical reality, in as much as logic is a property of meaning.I don't think being engraved on a stone tablet somewhere actually adds to the legitimacy of the set of rules governing our world.

I have some news for you. The laws of logic existed before you came up with them. The laws of logic by defination are outside the meterial universe because they are concepts. The atheistic worldview cannot account for the laws of logic/absolutes becuse only the meterial universe exists.But they did not exist before ANYONE came up with them did they. They are as you I think indicated conceptual. And of course the formal logic of say Aristotle is dependent on the law of the excluded middle which forces all logical operations to be two valued only. This law is subject to attack both from a physical direction (namely quantum mechanics) and on the basis of fuzzy set theory (essentialy a logic of continua). So its possible that some or all of the "laws" of logic are not valid! Or at least they may not be the only set of internally consistent logical propositions.Now one might ask why are the "laws of logic" so self-evident to most humans. Well that one is fairly simple - those laws reflect the behavior of the physical world we live in. If our brains did not in effect synchronize with that world we would not have survived and reproduced. The world has molded us as it were by evolution to apply the relevant rules to a large degree. The fact that QM is counter-intuitive reflects the fact that our survival and reproduction was NOT dependent on being able to operate within that domain during our evolution. In effect we come out of the box more or less wired for success, but many of our ancestors likely died before we adapted as well as we have. AND we probably are still not maximally adapted.

It is perhaps evidence of this that we do not intuitively reject many classes of logical fallicies. We do not see circular arguments easily for example, we have to apply formal analysis or be trained to do so. Most of us fall for the gamblers fallacy, and a host of other incorrect rules of thumb. We buy into the law of the excluded middle without thinking about it much (even though its an assumption made to make binary logic work). Our minds are not fully synchronized with the physical world only partially so.

I just have to add something to this debate.I'm not sure on this "the laws of logic existed before man thought them" thing. Let us suppose that, purely philosophically, there is this "law of logic" that exists that we still have not discovered. Just because we have not yet discovered it does not mean that it does not exist. On a side note, who is to say that it has not been discovered by some other creature (but let's not go there). There have been many truths, or laws of logic, that we have discovered as we developed, but this does not mean that we invented them. Much like gravity, it existed long before we thought, "Oh, so that's what it is."But does all this mean that these laws/concepts/physical properties were created by some superior being?There was also the argument that because people disagree, then laws of logic cannot be human constructs. This argument does not make sense. Humans are not particularly logical in their thinking, and some humans get things wrong. But this goes no way to either prove or disprove that the "laws of logic" are human constructs.Abram's repeated assumption that atheists do not believe in things that they cannot touch/eat/hump/whatever is complete rubbish.In fact, the initial assumption behind this whole thread is complete rubbish.What is more illogical than to say, "I do not understand this, so it must have been created by something for which I have no evidence"?There was another branch a bit further back that brought up the question, "Can God create a rock so big that he cannot lift it?"If God is omnipotent, then the answer would have to be yes. But then, I here you cry, if he can't lift it, then he can't be omnipotent. To which my answer would be, "Of course he can, but what makes you think that he is constrained by our extremely limited understanding of logic?"Maybe there are absolute laws of logic out there, but we are still far too primative to understand them. I don't see how we can be so presumptuous to think that a concept does not exists yet simply because we have not thought of it. I do understand that a concept by definition has to be created by a mind, but as a concept, let's assume that there is a "truth/concept" out there that we have not yet thought of, conceptually speaking anyway.But I also don't see the argument that if we have not yet thought of or understood something that it must have been created by maaaaaaagic.Smiley

GOD and theology have often filled the same role that "here there be dragons" used to on maps. Rather than "deliberately leaving the page blank" humans merely inserted "GOD did it" for things they could not otherwise explain. Then of course we have been going back over the territory and slowly taking down the signs which served to mark our place. One of the neater ways to find new fields for scientific investigation is to look for the "God did it" place markers and see if one can now take down the sign and erect a logical and scientific explanation in its place. It tends to raise the Hackles of those who have forgotten why the sign was placed there in the first place and thus have become convinced it was originally intended to the be final marker.

I know the thread has moved on a bit since #48, but I couldn't see where the above statement had been challenged (probably getting bleary-eyed.)If there is no 'matter', then there is nothingness, unless you decide that the nothingness does in fact hold energy, ergo your God. As matter and energy are syonymous, no matter means no energy therefore nothingness.How therefore can you state unequivocally that logic exists in nothingness? How did you test this fact? If there is nothingness, then logic can't exist as it has no purpose. And one of it's purposes is to help sentient (and perhaps non-sentient) creatures relate to their environment.If God is so all-encompassing, He doesn't need logic, therefore before the Creation, logic can't have existed in nothingness.I don't think we are embued with logic - evidenced by some thick puddings we meet from time to time - but rather we learn and acquire logic and the skill to use it. It's a tool. If some wish to define it as a 'law' for the purpose of ascribing it a handle, so be it. But it's still a construct as an identifiable method of how we relate ourselves to our world.Its existence or absence or identification or labelling or whatever does nothing to show that God/gods exist.My deux centimes.

Sorry, but skimming through this recently revived thread, and I had to take a moment of pause before my pancrease explodes and blood starts shooting from my eyes. He asks: 'Is this logical'?And he answers: 'a little'.So I sit here scratching my head and wondering: If the laws of logic are absolute, then how can it be a little logical? If logic is absolute, then it either is logical or it isn't. Could it be that logic is conceptual, and therefore subjective? Hmmm.

www.carm.org says the following, they make a good pointyou can find it at http://www.carm.org/atheism/God_rock.htmCan God make a rock so big He can't pick it up? This question is representative of the type of paradoxes atheists use in attempts to prove that God cannot exist. It works like this. God is supposed to be omnipotent. If He is omnipotent, then He can create a rock so big that He can't pick it up. If He cannot make a rock like this, then He is not omnipotent. If He can make a rock so big He can't pick it up, then He isn't omnipotent either. Either way demonstrates that God cannot do something. Therefore God is not omnipotent. Therefore God does not exist. Is this logical? A little. However, the problem is that this bit of logic omits some crucial information, therefore, it's conclusion is inaccurate.What the above "paradox" lacks is vital information concerning God's nature. His omnipotence is not something independent of His nature. It is part of His nature. God has a nature and His attributes operate within that nature, as does anything and everything else. For example, I have human nature. I can run. But, I cannot outrun a lion. My nature simply does not permit it. My ability to run is connected to my nature and I cannot violate it. So too with God. His omnipotence is connected to His nature since being omnipotent is part of what He is. Omnipotence, then, must be consistent with what He is and not with what He is not since His omnipotence is not an entity to itself. Therefore, God can only do those things that are consistent with His nature. He cannot lie because it is against His nature to do so. Not being able to lie does not mean He is not God or that He is not all powerful. Also, He cannot cease to be God. Since He is in all places at all times, if He stopped existing then He wouldn't be in all places at all time. Therefore, He cannot cease to exist without violating His own nature. The point is that God cannot do something that is a violation of His own existence and nature. Therefore, He cannot make a rock so big he can't pick up, or make something bigger than Himself, etc. But, not being able to do this does not mean He is not God nor that He is not omnipotent. Omnipotence is not the ability to do anything conceivable, but the ability to do anything consistent with His nature and consistent with His desire within the realm of His unlimited and universal power which we do not possess. This does not mean He can violate His own nature. If He did something inconsistent with His nature, then He would be self contradictory. If God were self contradictory, He would not be true. Likewise, if He did something that violated his nature, like make a rock so big He can't pick it up, He would also not be true since that would be a self contradiction. Since truth is not self contradictory, as neither is God, if He were not true, then He would not be God. But God is true and not self contradictory, therefore, God cannot do something that violates His own nature.Another way to look at it is realize that in order for God to make something so big He couldn't pick it up, He would have to make a rock bigger than Himself. Since He is infinite in size, He would have to make something that would be bigger than Himself. Since it is His nature to be the biggest thing in existence because He created all things, He cannot violate His own nature by making a rock that is larger than He. Also, since a rock, by definition, is not infinitely big, then it isn't logically possible to make a rock, something that is finite in size, be infinite in size (no longer a rock) since only God is infinite in size. At dictionary.com, a rock is defined as a "Relatively hard, naturally formed mineral or petrified matter; stone. a) A relatively small piece or fragment of such material. b) A relatively large body of such material, as a cliff or peak. c) A naturally formed aggregate of mineral matter constituting a significant part of the earth's crust." A rock, by definition is not infinitely large. So, to say that the rock must be so big that God cannot pick it up is to say that the rock is no longer a rock. What the critics are asking is that God become self contradictory as a proof He doesn't exist. Their assertion is illogical from the start. So what they are doing is trying to get God to be illogical. They want to use illogic to prove God doesn't exist instead of logic. It doesn't work and the "paradox" is self-refuting and invalid.

I believe Jesus actually can be both. Jesus called himself "the son of man", and we all fall into that category. Jesus calmed his father was in heaven. Jesus asked his mother, "Who is my brother or my sister?" How can Jesus be the son of man and yet the son of God? What prayer did Jesus give when asked?Jesus told those who asked for a prayer from him to pray; "Our Father, who art in heaven." Hold up- If we pray, "our father", then who are we?We are the son of man. We are the son of God. Maybe getting to know yourself brings you closer to God than anyone else can. What does being born again mean? All things born have a mother and a father. I believe love is logical. And Love is the simple key to understanding yourself and your neighbor. No other key will get you closer to self understanding. Now its logical to say a designer places a little of himself in everything he makes. If this is true then God is in us. Maybe love and a mirror is the best book you'll ever read on the subject of God.

Logic is a human construct. We didn't discover it, we invented it. The Greeks firstly IIRC. Guess what, they weren't Christians.

Your conclusion does not follow from the premise. Logic is a tool we created to help us make sense of the environment in which we exist. How we know what we know, if you like. Imagine it as the rules of gridiron.Aliens will most likely not experience their environment as we do (They would be us if they did.) so their "Logic" might look like the more widespread rules of rugby. Still a ball game, but organised differently.

Sinjin posted the following:If logic was invented by man that would mean that when people did not exist neither did logic. That does not sound logical to me. Most people believe there is life eleswhere in the universe (I'm not saying I do but I just want to illustrate a point). If logic was invented by man does that mean aliens elsewhere in the universe do not have logic to guide them?Just a question. "In Christ are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge." (Colossians 2:3)

Logic is an act of reason. Laws of logic are necessary for logical reasoning. Take the law of non-contradiction. You don't need a university degree to know that it would be wrong to say it is raining and it is not raining at the same location at the same time. Logic is built into us because we have been created with the ability to reason logically, because we have been created in the image of God, who is the epitome of logical reasoning. Speak to enough people and you will know that logical reasoning is a universal truth accepted by all. Nobody invented it. No cultural group on the planet invented it. All the "evidence and experience of life" we have tells us that laws of logic are universal, transcendent truths. Your idea that aliens will not experience the same logic we do is unfounded because it is built on the erroneous assertion that environment determines the outworking of logical reasoning. Here on planet earth we are one race and we have much in common. But human beings are incredibly diverse. There are so many different culture groups all around us. Yet logic is universal. To suggest that logic is simply a universal and harmonious tool all people groups on the planet somehow created for all of us to make use and sense of is, well, not logical."In Christ are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge." (Colossians 2:3)

Your conclusion does not follow from the premise. Logic is a tool we created to help us make sense of the environment in which we exist. How we know what we know, if you like. Imagine it as the rules of gridiron.Aliens will most likely not experience their environment as we do (They would be us if they did.) so their "Logic" might look like the more widespread rules of rugby. Still a ball game, but organised differently.

Acting to achieve a desired outcome requires a preexisting understanding of the logical connection between cause and effect, ie the logic of causality. Logic must logically precede purposive action. Whether you think that's because we evolved logical brains or because god planted the idea there is up to you, but the idea we "created" logic (by using logic) is incoherent.

Not necessarily. The preexisting understanding is required only where the action is not dictated by reason such as any action dictated by the very nature of thing or by its instinct. The term 'purposive action' is tautological, since an action, by definition, does something and that something can be considered the purpose of that action. What you are arguing is that logic must precede any action based on reason and I agree. Our gradual understanding of reality helped us form the laws of logic and allowed us to transition from instinctive action to reasoned action.

Correction here. I mean to say "The preexisting understanding is not required where the action is not dictated by reason such as any action dictated by the very nature of thing or by its instinct"

Well that's really my main point, and Penfold's specific example does seem to be based on reason.

"Laws of logic are necessary for logical reasoning" is the only part you got right. Logic is the identification and conceptualization of reality as it exists. The laws of logic are derived from the way reality works. The ability to identify the rules maybe built into us but the logical concepts themselves are not. If humans did not exist then logic wouldn't exist either, but reality itself and all its constituent rules would remain unaffected. Your argument boils down to that God is the source of all reality and all its rules. Good luck convincing any atheist of that, especially given that there is no evidence. Since reality is the source of everything that exists, asking for the source of reality is like asking who made God. However, our position is stronger here because we have definite evidence that reality exists but there is no evidence that God does. Besides, a self-contradictory, whimsical God would negate the very idea of logic.That's because reality, on which logic is based, is itself universal. Transcend what? Reality itself? You will have to give an example of that because I don't think that the concepts of logic would make any sense outside the context of reality. Take Dante's description of God for example and tell me if it makes any logical sense. His idea of aliens was probably a bad analogy. Take reality as we know it exists only in this universe, it might exist in a different way, with different rules in another one. Things such as law of non-contradiction might not be applicable there. Since the reality we live in forms our environment, it can be justifiably said that environment does determine the outcome of logical reasoning. Like I explained before, logic is the identification and conceptualization of reality and the way it works. When everyone is looking at and trying to understand the same thing then it is not only unsurprising that all would come to the same conclusions, it is expected.

I disagree. I dont think humans invented logic, we just invented the means of communicating and expressing it, and even that is giving ourselves too much credit. even animals (and aliens, im sure) can appreciate the reality of cause and effect, conditions, specificity and contradictions, and determine if something makessense or can be accepted as true or not based on an internal model of reality that pervades era and environment. thats what logic is, a set of laws that we can depend on to verify what we observe. we didn't invent these laws at all.

Logic is definitely a man made tool, nothing more.
