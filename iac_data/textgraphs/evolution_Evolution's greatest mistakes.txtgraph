the ability had to come from somewhere before natural selection could select it. How did this happen? Mutations have never been shown to create any new structure or even modify phenotype in a beneficial, selectable way. So how did it happen?

But I have yet to run across a mutation that creates a new, beneficial, selectable, modification of phenotype . I'm not saying one doesn't exist -- I just haven't seen one yet.

Thus since bacteria are too small to be seen by the naked eye they have no appearance and they thus have no phentype??????Sorry but phenotype refers to the expression of a gene or allele - not to the physical appearance. It includes all observable expressions of the genome (ie the genotype). Originated by Mendel to differentiate dominant and recessive inheritance patterns (as I recall).

So let's consider some pathways by which relatively minor genetic changes can have some huge phenotypic effects. Sorry for the length.First, insect wings:From the abstract of Averof M and SM Cohen, 1997. Evolutionary origin of insect wings from ancestral gills. Nature, 385: 627-630. Second, whale limbs, from http://www.iephb.nw.ru/labs/lab38/sp...ro/node42.htmlhttp://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2..._maki.php#more and an article by Thewissen’s at http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/0602920103v1 Embryological development often provides important clues to evolutionary changes (for example, note how nostrils develop in cetacean embryoes: http://www.neoucom.edu/DLDD/ ). In the PNAS study, Thewissen and his colleagues looked at how limb development happens in modern whale embryos (specifically, the dolphin Stenella), in contrast to the development of more regular hind legs in other amniotes (specifically, chicks and mice). In chicks and mice, the embryo develops two key signalling centers that control growth of the limb bud, an “Apical Ectodermal Ridge” (a ridge of skin cells that will eventually expand outward to become the perimeter of the limb) and the “Zone of Polarizing Activity”, which controls the development of the distal part of the limb. As the embryo body grows longer, something kicks in to start the growth of two pairs of limb buds (lateral projections) along the sides of the growing body. Each limb bud starts with the growth of an Apical Ectodermal Ridge, which establishes the start of a limb. If you transplant the limb bud, its AER, and a chunk of the underlying mesoderm underneath, you’ll get a whole new limb growing at the transplant site. However, without the underlying mesoderm, nothing will happen.The AER controls the proximal-to-distal patterning of the arm (i.e., growth outward from the shoulder or hip). (If you cut off the AER, the limb stops developing, and you never get beyond the elbow or knee, but if you transplant it onto another limb bud, you’ll develop two sets of lower arms or legs at the same site.) It does this in part by releasing a flood of related molecules, Fgf (“Fibroblast Growth Factor) 4, 8, 9, and 17. Subsequently a second signalling center develops (the “Zone of Polarizing Activity”), along the back of the limb. This differentiates the posterior side of the limb from the anterior side (i.e., it makes pinkies differ from thumbs). If you cut off a chunk of the ZPR and transplant it to the front of the limb, you can get a hand or foot with “little fingers” (or toes) on both sides (e.g., fingers 4-3-2-3-4 in birds). Development in the ZPR is under the control of the Sonic Hedgehog genes, which get turned on by the Hand2 molecule. Subsequently, muscle and nerve cells grow into the expanding limb, and cartilage is laid down. Thewissen and his colleagues described progressive evolutionary changes of hind legs in early whales (archaeocetes up to Basilosaurids). (For pictures, click on names at http://www.neoucom.edu/DEPTS/ANAT/Th...ins/index.html or see http://www-personal.umich.edu/~ginge...les/Whales.htm . Also see (Pakicetus at http://www.researchcasting.ca/pakicetus.htm ; Ambulocetus at http://www.researchcasting.ca/ambulocetus.htm ; and Kutchicetus at http://www.researchcasting.ca/kutchicetus.htm .) The legs got progressively smaller in whales in progressively younger strata, and their feet reduced from four toes to three. Also, progressively fewer vertebrae became involved in forming a sacrum (“defusion of the sacrum”), and the legs became detached from the vertebral column. Even before Basilosaurus, the legs were clearly non-functional for swimming or walking, being too small and totally detached from the spine. Otherwise, however, they formed “normally”, which is to say that they were composed of normal-looking (i.e., femur, tibia, fibula, ankle, and three or four reasonably normal-looking toes), all of which articulated in the normal fashion. Thus, all of the genes etc., must have worked normally in relation to one another during development, just not as intensively or for as long as usual. Thus the fossil record paints a picture of the gradual evolution of loss of leg function in whales rather than the sudden turning off or destruction of a switch that ordinarily turns on leg development. However, this is “phase 1" in the loss of legs, because next whales apparently did switch off leg development, apparently quite early on in the sequence of limb bud development. Thewissen and his colleagues found that modern whales (specifically, dolphins) form good limb buds for both arms and legs, but development of the legs shuts down, and the limb buds get resorbed. They found that both fore- and hind-limb buds start normally in terms of developing Apical Ectodermal Ridges and Zones of Polarizing Activity. The forelimb develops normally: The Fgf molecules appear, Hand2 is seen everywhere in the limb bud, and then is restricted to just the ZPA area. Sonic hedgehog is turned on in this area, and the front flippers develop as expected. (Actually, the AER persists for an unusually long time in the forearm, and may be responsible for the way whale paddles grow long by developing extra finger bones. Also apoptosis or programmed cell death, is suppressed, so the fingers are not isolated but grow within a mitten of skin. But otherwise, arm development is normal. See pictures of embryological development at http://www.neoucom.edu/DLDD/ .)In whale hind limbs, however, the AER appears and Fgf8 appears throughout (showing that the AER is, at least at that stage, fully functional). However, between Carnegie Embryological Stage 14 and Stage 18 (see http://www.neoucom.edu/DLDD/ and http://www.neoucom.edu/DLDD/ ), instead of Fgf8 becoming restricted to the AER, and the ZPA developing, producing Hand2, and turning on Sonic Hedgehog, instead Fgf8 disappears completely, and the AER degrades away. Correspondingly in the area that ought to be becoming the ZPA, Hand2 is nowhere to be found, and Sonic hedgehog is never turned on, so the ZPA is never really established, and the hind leg totally fails to develop. Note that simply turning off Hand2 or Sonic hedgehog totally and everywhere would not work, because you then wouldn’t get arms (flippers) at all, and a bunch of other necessary things would fail to happen. More specifically, Sonic Hedgehog induces FGF-4 expression in the AER, induces BMP2 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2), and causes appropriate neural tube and axial patterning.In short, it seems that whale leg reduction was well under way by gradual reduction in size and functionality, but once the legs were totally useless in terms of their original functions, whales experienced the first of a series of mutations that suppressed production of Hand2 in the hind limb buds. At first (about 41 m.y. ago), this led to loss of toes and foot bones, and ultimately (by about 34 m.y. ago) it resulted in the complete shut-down of production of the distal leg beyond the tibia. (Some primitive families of modern mysticete whales produce a non-protruding femur, and one even a tibia. Odontocetes stop at the innominate, or hip plate). Thewissen et al. speculatively tie the suppression of Hand2 and the loss of leg development to the loss of differentiation of sacral and lumbar vertebrae - in other words, they suggest that failure to differentiate along the vertebral column also fails at a fairly fundamental level to follow through with full limb bud development. Incidentally, this means that although the anatomical evolutionary story involves loss (of legs), the evo-devo story is one of addition of control mechanisms (localized suppression of Hand2). This also offers a neat explanation for the occasional appearance of cetaceans with atavistic legs or parts of legs, as these can simply represent the failure (to varying degrees) of suppression of Hand2. Bat wings: Bat wings present much the same sort of problem to evolutionary science as whales used to: the earliest bat, while primitive in some respects, is first and foremost a fully formed bat. So where did its wings come from? With bats, there are still no fossils that shed any light on this problem.Karen Sears and her colleagues investigated the problem by looking at what goes on developmentally during the formation of bat wings, and how things differed from the development of mouse arms (see “Development of bat flight: Morphologic and molecular evolution of bat wing digits” at http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/103/...urcetype=HWCIT )They discovered that at a crucial phase of arm development (stage 20), BMP2 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2) is much more abundant in bat wings relative to either mice arms or bat legs, and it causes the fingers to lengthen dramatically. Up to that stage, the hands are remarkably similar. They demonstrated that BMP2 was responsible for this episode of hypertrophy (hyper-growth) by (1) artificially adding an extra dose of BMP2 to bat embryo hands at that stage, and noting that they grew even longer, and (2) artifically adding a BMP2 blocker called “Noggin” at the same stage, and noting that the fingers quickly stopped growing. Thus they showed that a very simply adjustment in intensity of expression of a regulatory gene could have remarkable morphological consequences. I stress “could” because other pathways exist that could have similar effects. Thus the authors speculated that the development of bat wings need not be a complicated process, in developmental terms and necessary genetic changes.

Wait. natural selection is supposed to be the creative element in your theory. If bacteria trade specific genes which provide resistnace, the creativity lies right there -- no selection. It would be no different if an organism experienced a nonrandom or adaptive mutation...the mutation would immediately make its host more fit....which means fitness occurred without selection...it would also mean that the individual evolved and did not need the population to do so. Bacteria swapping genes are no different.

Genotype(1) = Protein synthesis(1) = Phenotype(1)Genotype(1.01) = Protein synthesis(1.01) = Phenotype (1.01)ad infinitum.This is how new structures form. we are made of protein. A change in the mechanism that manufactures protein results in a change in structure. Every single change to DNA results in some structural change.The idea that some changes are 'adaptable' and some are 'not' is kind of misleading. Any and all changes are adaptable to some environment. Among the ones that are adaptable to the extant environment, some will affect the differential of reproduction rates. These changes will either become 'fixed' or will die out. Other changes that do not affect differential reproduction rates will remain in the population at statistically random levels, until a given environmental effect causes them to affect differential reproduction rates.

NDS does not deal with creativity nor does it have a "creative" element. Selection is non-random and its clear why that is so. Genetic changes on the other hand are largely by chance and show no discernable pattern in most instances. This includes gene-transfers, and acquistition of endosymbionts. And think about it my friend, horizontal transfer is not some sort of flea market where the organisms get together and swap genes like a market place.

NDS does not deal with creativity nor does it have a "creative" element. Selection is non-random and its clear why that is so. Genetic changes on the other hand are largely by chance and show no discernable pattern in most instances. This includes gene-transfers, and acquistition of endosymbionts. And think about it my friend, horizontal transfer is not some sort of flea market where the organisms get together and swap genes like a market place. "I'll trade you a resistance gene if you will give me a metal tolerance gene" is NOT what goes on!

unfortunately, your person 2 is hiding behind "science" that cannot explain existence or the origin of even one thing. Of course, you can say "it all just happend"...but is that really science? I say the mind of God is the culprit for all we see around us, you say it all just "happened." You're no different than me. You're no more scientific than me. You just have a different worldview.

Well thankya pardner. I just wish those ears would open up to the glory that is the real world. i don't personally care about the idea of creationism (which is the reason behind most "deaf ears"), because I know how psychologically entrenched these beliefs can be.I'd consider it a massive, stunning victory if even one were to say: "That's amazing! That must be how God did it!"And why not believe that? Why cling to failed theories that are not only unsupported, but totally falsified? If I believed (I don't), but if I did, I'd look at evolution as an amazing, miraculous work of god. I don't belive, and never will, but I still look at evolution (and also many other amazing natural phenomena) with an awe and reverence that must be close to religious wonder. I just don't add a god at the end of it. This is what I don't get:Person 1: That's amazing.Person 2: That's amazing. Must have been a god.Person 1: Huh?So you can guess which I am.

Oh really:"The essence of Darwinism lies in a single phrase: Natural selection is the creative force of evolutionary change. No one denies that selection will play a negative role in eliminating the unfit. Darwinian theories require that it create the fit as well." - Stephen J. Gould, The Return of Hopeful Monsters, Natural History vol 86, June/July 1977, p 28

ARe you saying all or most changes are selectively neutral? And I don't see how this explanation helps you. Either mutations fuel your theory or they don't. If they don't then there's nothing for selection to select because there's no pool of random variants that could potentially pass on their trait.

Genotype(1) = Protein synthesis(1) = Phenotype(1)Genotype(1.01) = Protein synthesis(1.01) = Phenotype (1.01)ad infinitum.This is how new structures form. we are made of protein. A change in the mechanism that manufactures protein results in a change in structure. Every single change to DNA results in some structural change.The idea that some changes are 'adaptable' and some are 'not' is kind of misleading. Any and all changes are adaptable to some environment. Among the ones that are adaptable to the extant environment, some will affect the differential of reproduction rates. These changes will either become 'fixed' or will die out. Other changes that do not affect differential reproduction rates will remain in the population at statistically random levels, until a given environmental effect causes them to affect differential reproduction rates.

interesting. Anyone agree with Dr. Schwartz?http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases...0126194000.htmDetermining the mechanism that causes those delayed expressions of change is Schwartz's major contribution to the evolution of the theory of evolution. The mechanism, the authors explain, is this: Environmental upheaval causes genes to mutate, and those altered genes remain in a recessive state, spreading silently through the population until offspring appear with two copies of the new mutation and change suddenly, seemingly appearing out of thin air. Those changes may be significant and beneficial (like teeth or limbs) or, more likely, kill the organism.

That's very interesting. I'm reminded of the time Bill O'Reilly interviewed Richard Dawkins.

First of all its not a swap, there are horizontal transfers, but it would be very rare for it to go both ways. Secondly what are transferred are various genetic elements, sometimes very very large numbers of them borne on plasmids. These MAY include resistance genes, but they are cerainly specifically constratined to do so. In other words the exchanges are non-specific.

http://www.4forums.com/political/members/supersport.htmlYes really, evolution does not involve creation it involves adaptation but not creation in the sense of sentient directedness. Gould was after all prone to use metaphor (much like Dawkins et al) and those metaphors when take literally are misleading to laymen although they are clear to other evolutionists and biologists. So yes really, there is no "creative" element in the evolutinary process although selection is NOT a random process.

Sorry but "share" is a very misleading way of looking at it. Genes are sometimes transferred between species of bacteria. The correct term is horizontal transfer.

Its a genetically controlled capability and it confers something of a survival advantage under some conditions. Thus it likely arose through selection processes acting on existing variability. Any more questions?

Most changes probably are slectively neutral when they occur, because the chance of a mutation being 'relevant' to a species' environment at any one particular time is probably pretty small. However the environment is always changing, so neutral mutations that hang around in a population may have an effect at some point in the future. You were asking how a random change could possibly be of beneficial effect. I was just pointing out that it doesn't have to have an immediate beneficial effect. For example a species of bacteria that lives on sulphur could mutate so that some of its members can also live on sodium. If its environment contains no sodium you will not notice an effect. However if that environment changes at some point to one that contains sodium but no sulphur, the bacteria with the mutation will survive while the non-mutated members of the same species will die out. This is obviously a simplistic example but I think it illustrates the concept.

And this is my point: it doesn't matter what area of science we talk about, you always want to know about origins. Which is fine, it's a sign that you have a curious, inquisitive mind as do we all. But we don't have any satisfactory answers about origins. Science is gradually attempting to work towards those answers, while religion's answer "God did it" is completely useless, insofar as it adds no useful knowledge and doesn't open up any further lines of enquiry. Here's what I found so interesting about O'Reilly's attitude:O'Reilly: I'm throwing in with Jesus, rather than you guys, because you guys can't tell me how it all got here.Dawkins: We're working on it.O'Reilly: Well when you get it, maybe I'll listen.So the impression I get from this is that O'Reilly just wants someone, anyone, to tell him: "This is how we got here, we've got all the answers, don't you worry your pretty little head about it." But the fact is we don't know, and I'm fine with that. It's what we don't know that makes science so exciting, because there's a vast amount of discovery still to be made.And I find it impossible to believe in an old book when there are hundreds of other of old books, when there is no evidence for any of the major biblical events, no evidence for god or for Jesus being his son, and plenty of evidence that totally falsifies, for example, the flood and the frankly ludicrous notion of a young earth. Given all that, I am forced to consider the possibility that it did all 'just happen'. That doesn't mean that that is what I 'believe in', but it seems to be a strong possibility. It's something that is obviously very difficult to think about, which is why philosophers and scientists have been wrestling with the issue since time immemorial. But just because it's an almost insanely thorny problem, does not lead me to conclude that a magic man in the sky is responsible for it. But surely the answer to a god's existence is, after saying "my god created the universe", to say that "my god just exists, and has always existed". How is this any different from saying "the universe just exists, and has* always existed"?*possiblyAll I can say is that this is totally contrary to everyhting I have experienced. Scientists certainly do say "we have answers" because they most certainly do have some answers. What they absolutely, specifically do not say is "we have all the answers", or rather "we have the answers to how it all began". Which religion claims to, and what gets my goat is that most exchanges with creationists take the form ofCREO: How can x possibly happen?EVO: Explanation.CREO: OK but then how does that happen?EVO: Explanation.... repeated until you get to a point where you are once again discussing either origins, or the limits of contemporary science, or most likely both, given how much we know today. At this point science says, like Dawkins above, "we don't know but we're working on it". The creationist can only say "God did that part!". At which point the scientist shrugs, sighs, and goes off to do his job, because the input from the creationist has not helped answer the question in any way.The evidence for evolution.Evidence # 1. The nested hierarchy of species. Now, remember how ToE says new species form. Each one branches off from an existing species. Therefore, ToE predicts that all species will be related to each other, and this relationship will be structured like an enormous tree, with smaller and smaller branches. Many of the main trunks and limbs may now be extinct, but if we find evidence of them (fossils) they should still fit in this pattern, and no other. And we have found that all 12 million or so known species, as well as all the extinct species we know about, are related to each other in just this way. Nor is this an artificial or arbitrary classification system, it is based on objective and measurable standards, and in particular on genetic relationships that can actually be seen in their DNA.Evidence # 2. Homologies. These are similar structures on different organisms. It's not just that they exist, just that many creatures have similar structures or features, but that they resemble each other according to their inheritance. I'll give an example: Bats, human beings, whales and moles are all mammals, and all descended from a common ancestor. All us mammals branched off from birds a long time ago. Bat's wings, human hands, whale flippers and mole's paws all have the same number of bones in the same arrangement. This is because we share a common ancestor, so that's what nature had to work with and evolve from. Birds' wings, on the other hand, use different bones! So even though bird wings and bat wings look alike, a bat's wing is actually more like your hand than it is like a bird's wing. ToE predicts this and explains why: it's because birds and mammals branched off from a common ancestor before birds developed flight. So, it's not just that creatures share common features, but the exact specific pattern of their similarities.Evidence # 3. Geographical distribution of species. This is a pattern that really helped Darwin figure it out. Again, you've continents, islands, etc. So say you've got a tropical island off the coast of a continent. What species do you find there? Do they resemble more the creatures on the adjacent continent, or the species on another tropical island on the other side of the world. It turns out that the species greatly resemble those on the adjacent continent, and do not resemble those in the comparable environment on the other side of the world, as evolution predicts.What you tend to find in these environments is a lot of birds, because birds can fly there. Some of these island environments have very limited species of land animals, and they tend to evolve to fill all the niches there are.For example Australia. Everyone knows there are no placental mammals on Australia. There are only marsupials and a few monotremes. There are a very few marsupials in the entire rest of the world, such as the possum. Why no mammals on Australia? Marsupials preceded placentals. Once placentals evolved, they tended to be more successful and replace the marsupials, which went extinct. Australia broke off from Asia before placentals evolved, so we still see marsupials there, but hardly anywhere else.I should also add that with ToE and other strongly grounded scientific theories, it's not the nested heirarchy, not the homologies or geographic distribution or vestigial features or DNA or the fossil record that really counts; it's the combination of all of these. When many separate lines of evidence all support the theory, and are all consistent with it and with each other, especially when they come from different fields, such as geology, physics, archeology and paleontology, that's called consilience. And that is what really nails a theory as being well-supported. We will see that ToE has very strong consilience, which is why scientists rank it as among the best grounded and most certain theories, along with gravity, electromagneticism, germs and so forth.Evidence # 4. Vestigial structures. Vestigial organs and structures are organs or structures remaining or surviving in a degenerate, atrophied, or imperfect condition or form. ToE predicts that organisms will retain abbreviated, ineffective versions of organs inherited from their ancestors. There are many of these. The point is not just that they exist, but that they always reflect their ancestral origins.A good example are the eyes of blind fish. These fish live in caves with no light, and cannot see whatsoever. Nevertheless they have tiny, buried eyes that fill no function but have not atrophied yet all the way into non-existence. ToE explains that the reason they have them is that they descended from sighted fish.Another nice example is that biologists believe that mammals evolved after life emerged onto land. Aquatic mammals such as whales descended from land mammals with limbs. So while whales do not have legs, they still retain vestigial hip bones. On rare occasions whales are found with tiny useless back limbs.Evidence # 5. The age of the earth. Evolution makes a prediction about it. Darwin realized from the beginning that for ToE to be correct, the earth had to be very, very old. At that time there wasn't enough data to know exactly how much, except that it would have to be very old. At that time and for the preceding 100 years, geologists had begun to realize that the earth was quite a bit older than previously suspected. (These geologists were all Christians, btw.) Between 1850 and 1900, they started trying to use the data they had to make some kind of estimate, data such as the proportion of salt in the oceans and so forth. The leading physicist of the day, Lord Kelvin, used Fourier's theory of heat conduction and innovative math to calculate the age of the earth, based on certain starting assumptions about the temperature of the earth's core and rate of heat conduction, and came up with 100 million years. 100 million years is a lot, but Darwin and his proponents knew it wasn't nearly long enough for ToE to account for the tremendous diversity and complexity of life on earth. Then radiation was discovered in the early C20th, and it ws realized that the earth had another source of heat energy, radioactivity in its core. So Kelvin's calculations were correct, but he was missing key data. Soon after, physicists realized that, because radioactive isotopes decay at a constant rate, the earth in effect had a sort of clock that could be used to calculate its age.Applying this method to meteorites (because all earth rocks have metamorphisized), geophysicist now estimate the age of the earth to be about 4.56 billion years old, which is plenty of time for the diversity of life to have arisen by strictly evolutionary processes.This method has been calibrated against several simpler measures, including tree rings, ice cores, and, most notably, lake varves. I like varves because they are so simple even I can understand them. It is observed that two layers of sediment form in lakes each year: a lighter layer in spring and summer, and a darker layer in fall and winter. These layers are laid down in the lake bed. Millions of years later, when the layers of sediment have hardened into sedimentary layers of rock, you can count them. So you don't have to understand any fancy physics at all, you just have to be able to count. When radiometric dating is calibrated against lake varves, they agree very well, verifying the theory of radiometric dating very well. All 4 of these methods are based on sound, simple bases, and all 4 correlate very well.Evidence # 6. DNA. When Darwin figured out descent with modification, he knew almost nothing about genetics. Although Mendel had begun his work it was not disseminated until much later. Darwin worked with pigeon breeders to understand that practical application of breeding. ToE predicts some kind of mechanism that would account for descent with modification. That is, people observed that organisms reproduce imperfectly, but didn't know why. ToE predicted that some kind of mechanism would be found that would explain HOW offspring come to resemble their parents, but not completely. Over the next hundred years, biologists discovered DNA and how it works. ToE did not predict the double helix structure, meiosis and mitosis, 4 chemicals, coding for proteins, etc. etc., just that there would be some mechanism that would account for these features in reproduction. Because of sexual combination, and mutation, DNA does completely account for this phenomenon.Once DNA was disocovered and understood, it lent much objective support and clarification to all of evolution. For example, when we say there is a nested heirarchy (evidence #1) we can see that it is not an arbitrary imposition of classification, but can be objectively based on DNA resemblances. It became possible to determine how closely related various organisms are. The work that is going on now about exactly how DNA triggers changes in organisms is very exciting and, like most scientific discoveries, surprising.Evidence # 7. The fossil record. Bear in mind again that when Darwin first figured this out, very, very few fossils had been found. ToE makes very specific predictions about what kinds of fossils will be found, and where. Now thousands and thousands of fossils have been found and identified. Let's just start with one feature of the fossils that have been found.According to ToE, at one time there were only replicating molecules, then single cell organisms, simple bacteria and algae, then eukarytic cells, simple multi-celled wormy thingies, simple aquatic life, amphibians, reptiles on land, mammals--in that order. Therefore we should expect to see that the older rocks should contain only fossils of the earlier forms of life, and newer rocks the more recent and complex forms. Further, and most important, we should never see more recent and complex forms in layers of rock that are under, and older than, more ancient and simple forms of life. And this is exactly what we have seen, over and over again, thousands of times. This has been so well established, over such a long period, by so many different scientists, that it is now accepted as a basis on which to build. Therefore we see modern scientists using this pattern as an assumption for new work.This evidence is so powerful, so consistent with geology and physics, and so extensive, that biologists by consensus accepted that ToE was confirmed with as much certainty as any current scientific theory.Please note that ToE does NOT predict that we will find a lot of fossils, or that we will find complete lines of fossils for every step in an evolutionary chain, or anything like that. That is because fossils are so rare, for geologic reasons. ToE makes two main predictions about fossils:1. They will appear in the rock layers in chronological order, from simplest/oldest to most complex/newest. (Of course, new layers have simpler creatures as well, but older layers do not have the more complex creatures, because smaller and simpler forms of life continue while newer and more complex ones arise.)2. Each and every one will fit somewhere on a vast tree with thousands of limbs, millions of branches, and tens of millions of twigs. It may be that the supporting branch is extinct, and we haven't yet found those fossils, so there are missing branches and twigs, but the overall sceme fits this tree-like pattern, which grows through geologic time.You can immediately see how these two predictions are so crucial to ToE over the grand scheme of time. Both of them have been confirmed over and over, in fact, every time, thousands of times. No bunnies have ever been found fossilized in pre-cambrian stone. No creatures have ever been found that could not be placed in time and relationships on this enormous tree of life.Evidence # 8. Transitional fossils. It's important to understand that ToE does not predict that we will find every transition for every line of descent. The main reason for this is that fossils are extremely rare, due the necessary conditions for their formation. But to the extent that we have been able to piece together such lines of descent, it confirms ToE.An excellent example: Paleontologists have been working for some time on the transition to life on land. Obviously this is a crucial, very exciting area. They finally figured out where they think this happened--in river deltas. Then they knew what kind of rocks were formed in river deltas, and where. So they went excavating in just those kind of rocks. And they found an example of what the theory predicts.It's called Tiktaalik. It's an amphibious fishy thing. Now these guys have all kinds of technical reasons why they classify it as they do, it has a doo-hickey bone in its ears, and its wrists look like such and such, etc. Too technical for me. But a couple of things about this. One is that finding such a creature was a very specific prediction that ToE made. They didn't just stumble on it or dig any old where. They predicted where they would find it, dug there, and did. And although we keep finding more fossils in this area, more water/land transitionals, and learning more and more about exactly how this happened, we now have a pretty good outline of where different extinct creatures fit in this story, which is cool. Finally, a very important prediction of ToE is confirmed: that life emerged from water to land, and that we can find fossils of extinct creatures on this cusp.Evidence # 9 Speciation has been observed in the lab. I'll say it again. Speciation has been observed in the lab. The question that ToE tries to answer is, what causes species? Initially, it was a hypothesis: random mutations plus natural selection plus time. But the problem is that it takes too much time to actually observe a new species developing. Now several scientists have had a chance to see new species emerge in fast-reproducing species, such as E. coli and fruit flies, just as evolution predicts. Examples can be found here.So, without any of the other evidence listed so far, which is more of a circumstantial type, we know that ToE explains the emergence of new species. The only question remaining is whether this process can be extrapolated on a larger scale.Because all this evidence is so huge, both in quantity and significance, biologists consider ToE to be basically completely confirmed, and no longer research its validity. They now use it as a foundation on which to explore further questions. It has comparable importance to germ theory, relativity, or electro-magnetic theory. That is why it, and only it, is taught in all introductory biology classes everywhere.EDIT: For the 3rd time, thank you Vicious Love of IIDB.org for the evidence summary.

Thanks for your point of view. I've seen that clip with Dawkins on O'Reilly. And it's interesting how Dawkins attempts to give a defense for his atheism by saying "we understand" such things as why the tide rolls in and out....only to be countered by O'Reilly, correctly-so, that just because one understands something (or thinks they do) does not make an ORIGIN of something. Evolutionists/atheists make this same mistake all over creation...starting with the genome. They think because they can observe the genome that this somehow explains where the genome came from. Same with cells. It's hogwash!....materialists no more understand where the genome or cells came from than they know where existence itself came from.Christians often get accused of arguing from incredulity. Well.....YEA!! I simply find it hard to believe that it all just "happened." Just looking at existence itself tells me that something had to give rise to it. Where did space come from? Time? Matter? Energy? Oxygen? Intelligence? Love? Belief?......a freak explosion out of nothing for no reason? C'mmon. But ironically it's Dawkins and atheists like him who think its Christians who are absurd for believing in God and for not believing that everything around us just "happened." And what's so funny about it, is Dawkins' theory for evolution has been squashed by the evo devo crowd....what once was a theory of new genes and slow, gradual modifications, suddenly became a theory of the same genes producing different animals. So Dawkins is wanting us to believe in his atheism when his theory of evolution is quickly losing favor in the evolutionary community.But I think you have it wrong....Christians are not the ones saying we have the answers. I certainly don't. My position is that nobody has the answers, that the answers to the big questions are and will always be hidden. It's SCIENCE who plays themselves off as being the ones with the answers. They are the priests and profits of the new century. They've taken the place of clergy in the minds of millions....and millions put their faith in them. But I don't. Quite honestly, I trust nobody. Everyone has an agenda and nobody knows jack squat. I have my reasons for believing in a young earth and that's because I have not been given enough evidence to convince me otherwise. Of course there are a couple lingering issues, radiometric dating being one of them, (which Barry Setterfield may have answered) but Darwinism certainly is not one of them because this theory is unprovable, untested, unsubstantiated, and more than anything, unbelievable.

Liminus, your response is way to long to respond to every point, but let's just take part of your "evidence." Evidence # 2. Homologies. These are similar structures on different organisms. It's not just that they exist, just that many creatures have similar structures or features, but that they resemble each other according to their inheritance. I'll give an example: Bats, human beings, whales and moles are all mammals, and all descended from a common ancestor. All us mammals branched off from birds a long time ago. Bat's wings, human hands, whale flippers and mole's paws all have the same number of bones in the same arrangement. This is because we share a common ancestor, so that's what nature had to work with and evolve from. Birds' wings, on the other hand, use different bones! So even though bird wings and bat wings look alike, a bat's wing is actually more like your hand than it is like a bird's wing. ToE predicts this and explains why: it's because birds and mammals branched off from a common ancestor before birds developed flight. So, it's not just that creatures share common features, but the exact specific pattern of their similarities.First of all, claiming the fact that certain animals may have similar eyes, ears, hands, feet and organs is not evidence that a darwinian mechanism is responsible. This evidence works perfectly well in a creationist pov as well. There are tens of millions of creatures in the animal kingdom. To pick and choose a few that may share similar characteristics as another is fine, but what about all the others that don't share these characteristics? And you are claiming that a bat wing is similar to a human hand, but obviously the human hand is not a modification of a bat wing...it's a completely different structure. Yet, I'm supposing you say we descended from a common ancestor. Well where the heck is this creature? Don't you find it odd that all these thousands of common ancestors that must have existed aren't able to be found? What must the common ancestor of the bat and whale and human looked like? What did the common ancestor of man and chimps look like? Where is it? Your list is full of silly predictions, but as a creationist, I would predict that not even one common ancestor would be found, which is exactly what has happened. http://www.evolutiondeceit.com/chapter14_1.php"The older text-books on evolution make much of the idea of homology, pointing out the obvious resemblances between the skeletons of the libs of different animals. Thus the "pentadactyl" limb pattern is found in the arm of a man, the wing of a bird and the flipper of a whale, and this is held to indicate their common origin. Now if these various structures were transmitted by the same gene-complex, varied from time to time by mutations and acted upon by environmental selection, the theory would make good sense. Unfortunately this is not the case. Homologous organs are now known to be produced by totally different gene complexes in the different species. The concept of homology in terms of similar genes handed on from a common ancestor has broken down."And sometimes different creatures can share morphological characteristics because of the environment they live in. For example, it's well-known that in hot climates, many creatures in that environment will tend to be tall and thin, as well as having longer limbs. In a cold environment, many creatures are shorter and stockier so to conserve heat. This phenomenon most certainly has nothing to do with mutation, but with a developmental phenomenon in each individual.And ultimately, you're going to have to show me that mutation can change an animal's phenotype for the better. I have yet to see an example of this. Your theory requires all kinds of new additions and new features, but I have seen no mutational mechanism capable of accomplishing it. Neither is there any evidence of groups of creatures splitting off from some mysterious common ancestor.

And this is my point: it doesn't matter what area of science we talk about, you always want to know about origins. Which is fine, it's a sign that you have a curious, inquisitive mind as do we all. But we don't have any satisfactory answers about origins. Science is gradually attempting to work towards those answers, while religion's answer "God did it" is completely useless, insofar as it adds no useful knowledge and doesn't open up any further lines of enquiry. Here's what I found so interesting about O'Reilly's attitude:O'Reilly: I'm throwing in with Jesus, rather than you guys, because you guys can't tell me how it all got here.Dawkins: We're working on it.O'Reilly: Well when you get it, maybe I'll listen.So the impression I get from this is that O'Reilly just wants someone, anyone, to tell him: "This is how we got here, we've got all the answers, don't you worry your pretty little head about it." But the fact is we don't know, and I'm fine with that. It's what we don't know that makes science so exciting, because there's a vast amount of discovery still to be made.And I find it impossible to believe in an old book when there are hundreds of other of old books, when there is no evidence for any of the major biblical events, no evidence for god or for Jesus being his son, and plenty of evidence that totally falsifies, for example, the flood and the frankly ludicrous notion of a young earth. Given all that, I am forced to consider the possibility that it did all 'just happen'. That doesn't mean that that is what I 'believe in', but it seems to be a strong possibility. It's something that is obviously very difficult to think about, which is why philosophers and scientists have been wrestling with the issue since time immemorial. But just because it's an almost insanely thorny problem, does not lead me to conclude that a magic man in the sky is responsible for it. But surely the answer to a god's existence is, after saying "my god created the universe", to say that "my god just exists, and has always existed". How is this any different from saying "the universe just exists, and has* always existed"?*possiblyAll I can say is that this is totally contrary to everyhting I have experienced. Scientists certainly do say "we have answers" because they most certainly do have some answers. What they absolutely, specifically do not say is "we have all the answers", or rather "we have the answers to how it all began". Which religion claims to, and what gets my goat is that most exchanges with creationists take the form ofCREO: How can x possibly happen?EVO: Explanation.CREO: OK but then how does that happen?EVO: Explanation.... repeated until you get to a point where you are once again discussing either origins, or the limits of contemporary science, or most likely both, given how much we know today. At this point science says, like Dawkins above, "we don't know but we're working on it". The creationist can only say "God did that part!". At which point the scientist shrugs, sighs, and goes off to do his job, because the input from the creationist has not helped answer the question in any way.The evidence for evolution.Evidence # 1. The nested hierarchy of species. Now, remember how ToE says new species form. Each one branches off from an existing species. Therefore, ToE predicts that all species will be related to each other, and this relationship will be structured like an enormous tree, with smaller and smaller branches. Many of the main trunks and limbs may now be extinct, but if we find evidence of them (fossils) they should still fit in this pattern, and no other. And we have found that all 12 million or so known species, as well as all the extinct species we know about, are related to each other in just this way. Nor is this an artificial or arbitrary classification system, it is based on objective and measurable standards, and in particular on genetic relationships that can actually be seen in their DNA.Evidence # 2. Homologies. These are similar structures on different organisms. It's not just that they exist, just that many creatures have similar structures or features, but that they resemble each other according to their inheritance. I'll give an example: Bats, human beings, whales and moles are all mammals, and all descended from a common ancestor. All us mammals branched off from birds a long time ago. Bat's wings, human hands, whale flippers and mole's paws all have the same number of bones in the same arrangement. This is because we share a common ancestor, so that's what nature had to work with and evolve from. Birds' wings, on the other hand, use different bones! So even though bird wings and bat wings look alike, a bat's wing is actually more like your hand than it is like a bird's wing. ToE predicts this and explains why: it's because birds and mammals branched off from a common ancestor before birds developed flight. So, it's not just that creatures share common features, but the exact specific pattern of their similarities.Evidence # 3. Geographical distribution of species. This is a pattern that really helped Darwin figure it out. Again, you've continents, islands, etc. So say you've got a tropical island off the coast of a continent. What species do you find there? Do they resemble more the creatures on the adjacent continent, or the species on another tropical island on the other side of the world. It turns out that the species greatly resemble those on the adjacent continent, and do not resemble those in the comparable environment on the other side of the world, as evolution predicts.What you tend to find in these environments is a lot of birds, because birds can fly there. Some of these island environments have very limited species of land animals, and they tend to evolve to fill all the niches there are.For example Australia. Everyone knows there are no placental mammals on Australia. There are only marsupials and a few monotremes. There are a very few marsupials in the entire rest of the world, such as the possum. Why no mammals on Australia? Marsupials preceded placentals. Once placentals evolved, they tended to be more successful and replace the marsupials, which went extinct. Australia broke off from Asia before placentals evolved, so we still see marsupials there, but hardly anywhere else.I should also add that with ToE and other strongly grounded scientific theories, it's not the nested heirarchy, not the homologies or geographic distribution or vestigial features or DNA or the fossil record that really counts; it's the combination of all of these. When many separate lines of evidence all support the theory, and are all consistent with it and with each other, especially when they come from different fields, such as geology, physics, archeology and paleontology, that's called consilience. And that is what really nails a theory as being well-supported. We will see that ToE has very strong consilience, which is why scientists rank it as among the best grounded and most certain theories, along with gravity, electromagneticism, germs and so forth.Evidence # 4. Vestigial structures. Vestigial organs and structures are organs or structures remaining or surviving in a degenerate, atrophied, or imperfect condition or form. ToE predicts that organisms will retain abbreviated, ineffective versions of organs inherited from their ancestors. There are many of these. The point is not just that they exist, but that they always reflect their ancestral origins.A good example are the eyes of blind fish. These fish live in caves with no light, and cannot see whatsoever. Nevertheless they have tiny, buried eyes that fill no function but have not atrophied yet all the way into non-existence. ToE explains that the reason they have them is that they descended from sighted fish.Another nice example is that biologists believe that mammals evolved after life emerged onto land. Aquatic mammals such as whales descended from land mammals with limbs. So while whales do not have legs, they still retain vestigial hip bones. On rare occasions whales are found with tiny useless back limbs.Evidence # 5. The age of the earth. Evolution makes a prediction about it. Darwin realized from the beginning that for ToE to be correct, the earth had to be very, very old. At that time there wasn't enough data to know exactly how much, except that it would have to be very old. At that time and for the preceding 100 years, geologists had begun to realize that the earth was quite a bit older than previously suspected. (These geologists were all Christians, btw.) Between 1850 and 1900, they started trying to use the data they had to make some kind of estimate, data such as the proportion of salt in the oceans and so forth. The leading physicist of the day, Lord Kelvin, used Fourier's theory of heat conduction and innovative math to calculate the age of the earth, based on certain starting assumptions about the temperature of the earth's core and rate of heat conduction, and came up with 100 million years. 100 million years is a lot, but Darwin and his proponents knew it wasn't nearly long enough for ToE to account for the tremendous diversity and complexity of life on earth. Then radiation was discovered in the early C20th, and it ws realized that the earth had another source of heat energy, radioactivity in its core. So Kelvin's calculations were correct, but he was missing key data. Soon after, physicists realized that, because radioactive isotopes decay at a constant rate, the earth in effect had a sort of clock that could be used to calculate its age.Applying this method to meteorites (because all earth rocks have metamorphisized), geophysicist now estimate the age of the earth to be about 4.56 billion years old, which is plenty of time for the diversity of life to have arisen by strictly evolutionary processes.This method has been calibrated against several simpler measures, including tree rings, ice cores, and, most notably, lake varves. I like varves because they are so simple even I can understand them. It is observed that two layers of sediment form in lakes each year: a lighter layer in spring and summer, and a darker layer in fall and winter. These layers are laid down in the lake bed. Millions of years later, when the layers of sediment have hardened into sedimentary layers of rock, you can count them. So you don't have to understand any fancy physics at all, you just have to be able to count. When radiometric dating is calibrated against lake varves, they agree very well, verifying the theory of radiometric dating very well. All 4 of these methods are based on sound, simple bases, and all 4 correlate very well.Evidence # 6. DNA. When Darwin figured out descent with modification, he knew almost nothing about genetics. Although Mendel had begun his work it was not disseminated until much later. Darwin worked with pigeon breeders to understand that practical application of breeding. ToE predicts some kind of mechanism that would account for descent with modification. That is, people observed that organisms reproduce imperfectly, but didn't know why. ToE predicted that some kind of mechanism would be found that would explain HOW offspring come to resemble their parents, but not completely. Over the next hundred years, biologists discovered DNA and how it works. ToE did not predict the double helix structure, meiosis and mitosis, 4 chemicals, coding for proteins, etc. etc., just that there would be some mechanism that would account for these features in reproduction. Because of sexual combination, and mutation, DNA does completely account for this phenomenon.Once DNA was disocovered and understood, it lent much objective support and clarification to all of evolution. For example, when we say there is a nested heirarchy (evidence #1) we can see that it is not an arbitrary imposition of classification, but can be objectively based on DNA resemblances. It became possible to determine how closely related various organisms are. The work that is going on now about exactly how DNA triggers changes in organisms is very exciting and, like most scientific discoveries, surprising.Evidence # 7. The fossil record. Bear in mind again that when Darwin first figured this out, very, very few fossils had been found. ToE makes very specific predictions about what kinds of fossils will be found, and where. Now thousands and thousands of fossils have been found and identified. Let's just start with one feature of the fossils that have been found.According to ToE, at one time there were only replicating molecules, then single cell organisms, simple bacteria and algae, then eukarytic cells, simple multi-celled wormy thingies, simple aquatic life, amphibians, reptiles on land, mammals--in that order. Therefore we should expect to see that the older rocks should contain only fossils of the earlier forms of life, and newer rocks the more recent and complex forms. Further, and most important, we should never see more recent and complex forms in layers of rock that are under, and older than, more ancient and simple forms of life. And this is exactly what we have seen, over and over again, thousands of times. This has been so well established, over such a long period, by so many different scientists, that it is now accepted as a basis on which to build. Therefore we see modern scientists using this pattern as an assumption for new work.This evidence is so powerful, so consistent with geology and physics, and so extensive, that biologists by consensus accepted that ToE was confirmed with as much certainty as any current scientific theory.Please note that ToE does NOT predict that we will find a lot of fossils, or that we will find complete lines of fossils for every step in an evolutionary chain, or anything like that. That is because fossils are so rare, for geologic reasons. ToE makes two main predictions about fossils:1. They will appear in the rock layers in chronological order, from simplest/oldest to most complex/newest. (Of course, new layers have simpler creatures as well, but older layers do not have the more complex creatures, because smaller and simpler forms of life continue while newer and more complex ones arise.)2. Each and every one will fit somewhere on a vast tree with thousands of limbs, millions of branches, and tens of millions of twigs. It may be that the supporting branch is extinct, and we haven't yet found those fossils, so there are missing branches and twigs, but the overall sceme fits this tree-like pattern, which grows through geologic time.You can immediately see how these two predictions are so crucial to ToE over the grand scheme of time. Both of them have been confirmed over and over, in fact, every time, thousands of times. No bunnies have ever been found fossilized in pre-cambrian stone. No creatures have ever been found that could not be placed in time and relationships on this enormous tree of life.Evidence # 8. Transitional fossils. It's important to understand that ToE does not predict that we will find every transition for every line of descent. The main reason for this is that fossils are extremely rare, due the necessary conditions for their formation. But to the extent that we have been able to piece together such lines of descent, it confirms ToE.An excellent example: Paleontologists have been working for some time on the transition to life on land. Obviously this is a crucial, very exciting area. They finally figured out where they think this happened--in river deltas. Then they knew what kind of rocks were formed in river deltas, and where.

There is no evidence (not to mention logical reasoning) behind a Bering Strait migration. So how did it happen? This is also true of many other creatures, (camels, elephants, humans, etc) all of which have counterparts on continents separated by vast oceans.

The specific mutations which occurr are NOT apparently under control only the rates at which they occurr. Control in this case really meaning that under stress there is an observable increase in the rate of mutation. That may be control in a very loose sense.

Evidence # 3. Geographical distribution of speciesTell me how monkeys got to the new world. The continents split apart 100 million years ago, yet somehow monkeys evolved and found their way to North and South America from Africa after that event. There is no evidence (not to mention logical reasoning) behind a Bering Strait migration. So how did it happen? This is also true of many other creatures, (camels, elephants, humans, etc) all of which have counterparts on continents separated by vast oceans.

To use an analogy; It's like publishing a book, if they have adequate time and resources they can employ proof readers to go through every page of text and correct all the spelling and gramatical errors. If they have to get something out on a tight deadline you might just have them scribble down whatever they can and p#oto(0py !t reg@rdle$$ of typos.A mutation can result in a brand new gene, all you need is the start codon; AUG There are 64 codons so every mutation has a 1 in 64 chance of producing a new gene.

if cells have control over the rate of mutations, then the question needs to be asked, who or what is in control? And evolutionists like to put a molecular clock on evolution....but if the cell has control over the rate of mutations, (which this rate may be sped up or slowed down according to environment or circumstance) what is the use in putting a clock on it?

Evidence # 6. DNA. When Darwin figured out descent with modification, he knew almost nothing about genetics. Although Mendel had begun his work it was not disseminated until much later. Darwin worked with pigeon breeders to understand that practical application of breeding. ToE predicts some kind of mechanism that would account for descent with modification. That is, people observed that organisms reproduce imperfectly, but didn't know why. ToE predicted that some kind of mechanism would be found that would explain HOW offspring come to resemble their parents, but not completely. Over the next hundred years, biologists discovered DNA and how it works. ToE did not predict the double helix structure, meiosis and mitosis, 4 chemicals, coding for proteins, etc. etc., just that there would be some mechanism that would account for these features in reproduction. Because of sexual combination, and mutation, DNA does completely account for this phenomenon.since you can't show me how accidental changes in DNA beneficially effect a phenotype to make it more selectable, then it's pretty easy to see that this "evidence" is not evidence at all. You have no idea where DNA came from, you have no idea what's in control of it, or what changes its expression, you even have no idea what a "gene" is. Up to just a few years ago science thought the human genome had 100,000 genes -- but now that number is down to 25 - 30,000! Are you kidding me? These guys want us to believe they have the answers about DNA when they don't even know how many genes there are? Not only that, but a recent story just came out (I don't have the link at the moment) that admits how science can hardly even tell where a "gene" starts and stops.....that they all just sorta run together and overlap each other to form a cohesive unit.Your "evidence" is extremely weak, liminus.

Of course it is, especially when this evidence is consilient with the genetic evidence. It could also be evidence for another theory, but there isn't one.Any evidence works from a creationst pov because there is no theory, there are no predictions, and the hypothesis "God did it" is unfalsifiable, therefore the idea is useless for the acquisition and refinement of knowledge.Do what? If you look at any closely-related groups of species, you find homologies. If you look at species that are only distantly related, you will not find so many homologies. Biology 101. No, I don't find it odd, because as has been pointed ad nauseam, fossils are extremely rare, relative to the numbers of creatures that have ever lived. As usual you are focusing on one small part of the evidence and saying "I don't believe this part" when, as is made very clear in the above summary, the strongest feature of evolution (as with any science) is the consilience of the multiple lines of evidence, which all point towards the same conclusions.(snip standard topic-diverting creo questions and meaningless guff from creationist website)Yes, but the sciences of genetics and anatomy are actually quite detailed, in case you didn't know. So we can tell when a feature is an actual homology by seeing that its structure is almost identical across species who are also known to be genetically very similar. Consilience strikes again. Similar features that evolved seperately in different species may seem superficially similar but on closer examination turn out to be built around different bases. The perfect example of this is the wing structure of birds and bats, above. Your examples of tallness/thinness etc are not examples of homologies. A mutation can change a phenotype. Whether this change will be good or not is determined by the environment. Common ancestry is heavily supported by genetics. You've been given examples (such as vitamin C deficiency) before by people who know more than me, but you ignore them.No, there are just no fossils that creationists will ever accept as transitional, because they want to see a half-dog, half-whale or a half-fish, half-frog. Modern examples of what the reality of such creatures might have looked like would be a seal, and a mudskipper. Tiktaalik is an excellent transitional, as is Rodhocetus. Google it. And of course the reality is that all fossils are transitional, as are all creatures. I predict that creationists will never truly understand this concept.Well if you're not going to look at the website, I'm not going to cut and paste any of it here, because you won't believe me any more than you'd believe the website. I'll just give the name of the most famous example, Drosophilia paulistorum.You demand to be "shown" the evidence, but of course no one can show you the evidence except the people who did the studies. If you bother to do some research I'm sure you could find the actual papers, read them, and even contact the experimenters with your questions if you were so inclined.The migration happened between 25 and 40 mya, the Atlantic was narrower and sea levels were lower, exposing chains of islands. The currents were in the right direction for chance rafting incidents to take place, after trees with animals in them fell into rivers for whatever reason. Over the millions of years involved in this scenario, this probably happened many times. It would only need to happen a few times. And before you say that this is too unlikely to happen, a modern example is the famous case of the rafting iguanas. (you have to scroll down a bit for the article.)As usual, all you can do is mock the uncertainties that inevitably exist at the frontiers of science. You have no understanding of consilience: for example the fact that your young-earth beliefs force you to reject pretty much all of geology, cosmology and more besides, also forces you by extension to reject pretty much every single area of scientific study. This is because of consilience. You also, as I mentioned above, demand certainity all the time. You hate the fact that science constantly changes, because you crave stability, hence your reliance on religious dogma. You see the fact that theories get revised and updated as some kind of weakness, when of course it is a huge strength. How else are we to refine our knowledge if we do not keep making new discoveries and changing our theories in light of new evidence? Your entire attitude towards science consists of a strawman argument. You say that science claims it has all the answers, and then you very easily find areas that are uncertain and unexplored, and triumphantly proclaim "Ha! You don't have all the answers". But of course science never claims any such thing, it only claims to have the best conclusions drawn from the currently available evidence. Your endless questions and disbelief completely fail to make any impression on me, because you obviously know even less than I do about the subject, you never do any research of your own, you consistently repeat the same refuted arguments and answered questions as if they were devastating attacks that nobody's ever heard before, and you fail to understand science in that you see its strengths as weaknesses.

Liminus, your response is way to long to respond to every point, but let's just take part of your "evidence." Evidence # 2. Homologies. These are similar structures on different organisms. It's not just that they exist, just that many creatures have similar structures or features, but that they resemble each other according to their inheritance. I'll give an example: Bats, human beings, whales and moles are all mammals, and all descended from a common ancestor. All us mammals branched off from birds a long time ago. Bat's wings, human hands, whale flippers and mole's paws all have the same number of bones in the same arrangement. This is because we share a common ancestor, so that's what nature had to work with and evolve from. Birds' wings, on the other hand, use different bones! So even though bird wings and bat wings look alike, a bat's wing is actually more like your hand than it is like a bird's wing. ToE predicts this and explains why: it's because birds and mammals branched off from a common ancestor before birds developed flight. So, it's not just that creatures share common features, but the exact specific pattern of their similarities.First of all, claiming the fact that certain animals may have similar eyes, ears, hands, feet and organs is not evidence that a darwinian mechanism is responsible. This evidence works perfectly well in a creationist pov as well. There are tens of millions of creatures in the animal kingdom. To pick and choose a few that may share similar characteristics as another is fine, but what about all the others that don't share these characteristics? And you are claiming that a bat wing is similar to a human hand, but obviously the human hand is not a modification of a bat wing...it's a completely different structure. Yet, I'm supposing you say we descended from a common ancestor. Well where the heck is this creature? Don't you find it odd that all these thousands of common ancestors that must have existed aren't able to be found? What must the common ancestor of the bat and whale and human looked like? What did the common ancestor of man and chimps look like? Where is it? Your list is full of silly predictions, but as a creationist, I would predict that not even one common ancestor would be found, which is exactly what has happened. http://www.evolutiondeceit.com/chapter14_1.php"The older text-books on evolution make much of the idea of homology, pointing out the obvious resemblances between the skeletons of the libs of different animals. Thus the "pentadactyl" limb pattern is found in the arm of a man, the wing of a bird and the flipper of a whale, and this is held to indicate their common origin. Now if these various structures were transmitted by the same gene-complex, varied from time to time by mutations and acted upon by environmental selection, the theory would make good sense. Unfortunately this is not the case. Homologous organs are now known to be produced by totally different gene complexes in the different species. The concept of homology in terms of similar genes handed on from a common ancestor has broken down."And sometimes different creatures can share morphological characteristics because of the environment they live in. For example, it's well-known that in hot climates, many creatures in that environment will tend to be tall and thin, as well as having longer limbs. In a cold environment, many creatures are shorter and stockier so to conserve heat. This phenomenon most certainly has nothing to do with mutation, but with a developmental phenomenon in each individual.And ultimately, you're going to have to show me that mutation can change an animal's phenotype for the better. I have yet to see an example of this. Your theory requires all kinds of new additions and new features, but I have seen no mutational mechanism capable of accomplishing it. Neither is there any evidence of groups of creatures splitting off from some mysterious common ancestor.

**Tut tut, liminus. You know very well that there is at least one more theory of evolution apart from the 'randomly generated particle determining an organic trait for a passive organism, a chemically determined trait that,coincidentally, and luckily, is made adaptive by anticipating an indeterminate, random, unforseen, natural environmental occurence before it happens' darwinian mythology. That theory is, [per my label], Endogenous Adaptive Mutagenesis, and a special thread for you, devoted to debating its merits contra those of your darwinism, still awaits your promised attention.I doubt that SS is the buxom blonde bimbo you've been blaming for the delay, is he? And while I'm here, I'll just point out that although consilience in several lines of scientific enquiry has establishe biological evolution as an historical fact, no lines of evidence do that for the Darwin/Fisher, "RMNS", "MET" notion SS referred to, above. Not only is there no consilience, there is no evidentiary consistancy with this hypothetical notion of evolution's mechanism;-- the one you fellows mislabel "_The_ Theory of Evolution", aka, _the_"TOE".

I was wondering how long it would take for WW to put in an appearance, though his chosen line here defies explanation, as usual.This is after all part of the mechanism, his "missing link" in effect that would allow his pet theory to proceed. Admitedly it still lacks any mechanism by which cells could select which parts of their genome would be subject to mutation, much less how they are to be mutated. But despite all that it's still closer to what he's been advocating than anything he's posted to support his own position, if he'd bothered find out what was being said in the first place.

To find the nature of something, you determine the fruits there of. As in science, observation can bring an understanding of something that IS yet very hard to find or examine. Magnetism can't be bottled or viewed yet our understanding is pretty good. Gravity (warping of time and space) can't be bottled (I wish it could) but we can get a very good understanding of it by what it does. Surely God can become more understood by the examination of what he has done. Now I will admit, To understand a God you must throw away the concepts of chance. Chance can not exist if there is a God. Basically its one or the other. All theology boils down to there being a God or chance and in some cases the least likely of things have happened which gave us the environment we have. We have a moon and if you look into the science of how our moon was created, you could easily think chance is the least likely suspect. The arguments science has with Religion has little to do with a God. Science wants to know how it happened or how it works, God or Chance played the role. If we discover man came from an ape, we can say "Oh so thats how God did it!" Or we can say what a fantastic set of random chances that developed such a being. Both are valid and have value. Sadly; it takes as much brains to take one stand as the other. Science can aid one in an understanding of God, but a bible will never aid one in an understanding of science. Look at it this way; if you where God and you made a human with a massive five pound brain, what would be your reasoning? Why such a powerful thinking device, if you wanted blind faith and obedience? The logic is unsound. Clearly if there is a God then Science is exactly what he wants as a pursuit from man. In my mind, the only reason God would hand out the tissues a human has is for one clear reason; to discover him. We are far to over powered in the brains department for just simple hunting. Fact is better than fantasy and fact will find God if we can get the Bible thumpers off our backs.If you truly want to understand a God, do some thinking. Why does a cow have horns? Why does a bee have a stinker that if used will take his life? Why will a water buffalo risk his life for the herd? You don't want to know God, you want people to believe in your Religion. If anything is true in the world one thing is. God is no respecter of Religion. Clearly. the evidence is overwhelming. Its that or God is little control after all.Wouldn't it be interesting to discover we where programed with every law God would have us follow? I mean, that we where actually born Good. Like the designer intended. Wouldn't that explain the lack of interaction from God? Everything God had to say might already be in us. The only flaw would be that some people wanted control over others. The best system to control a group of people is a Religion.

Well lets ask this what do you know that IS which is not a "thing"? Existense claims imply that which is claimed to exist is some-thing rather than no-thing! To satisfy the criterion IS then some-thing must exist!!!!!!!And I happen to know many creationists who think that GOD is a physical being although a omni-everything one. Immortal, omniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent among other things. And most certainly the bible treats GOD as a being and I cannot think of a better source on the nature of GOD - can you?

The problem has been dealt with of course. The problem of evil which is usually attributed to "free-will" neatly separating GOD from taking any responsibility. In other words evil is a feature not a bug!

To find the nature of something, you determine the fruits there of. As in science, observation can bring an understanding of something that IS yet very hard to find or examine. Magnetism can't be bottled or viewed yet our understanding is pretty good. Gravity (warping of time and space) can't be bottled (I wish it could) but we can get a very good understanding of it by what it does. Surely God can become more understood by the examination of what he has done. Now I will admit, To understand a God you must throw away the concepts of chance. Chance can not exist if there is a God. Basically its one or the other. All theology boils down to there being a God or chance and in some cases the least likely of things have happened which gave us the environment we have. We have a moon and if you look into the science of how our moon was created, you could easily think chance is the least likely suspect. The arguments science has with Religion has little to do with a God. Science wants to know how it happened or how it works, God or Chance played the role. If we discover man came from an ape, we can say "Oh so thats how God did it!" Or we can say what a fantastic set of random chances that developed such a being. Both are valid and have value. Sadly; it takes as much brains to take one stand as the other. Science can aid one in an understanding of God, but a bible will never aid one in an understanding of science. Look at it this way; if you where God and you made a human with a massive five pound brain, what would be your reasoning? Why such a powerful thinking device, if you wanted blind faith and obedience? The logic is unsound. Clearly if there is a God then Science is exactly what he wants as a pursuit from man.

well that's a ridiculous assumption because when you break "things" down to smaller and smaller parts, the part get so small that they eventually disappear, thus becoming a "non-things." (funny how all the "non-things" in the world somehow know how to act.) Matter is simply condensed energy.

Its a great topic, one I would love to explore. I find myself at times thinking rude thoughts and wanting to harm someone. In me (all I can speak of), I've noticed some common factors that cause my explosion of ill will. Its fear. Fear is a natural emotion that is used as a defensive mechanism in higher order animals.Fear causes the fight of flight response. Fear is good if you've warmed up to living. It can help you escape situations that could cause you great harm. It seems to me that fear and anger have a close relation. There are Christians that go and urinate on Darwin's grave every year on his birthday. Why? Why is the anger response so deep? They are afraid. They feel Darwin's theory is an attack. Naturally, there is anger. Its science's job to set those fears aside somehow. I honestly don't have an answer as to how. I simply know science must continue if fact has any meaning at all.

Yes, yes! Mater does seem to equal energy if you remove the constant. And you clearly have a point. It's a freak to consider the possibilities. The laws governing conservation of energy and mater is related. Seems the door is wide open on concepts and I hope we get to step in. As long as the law and the funds allow us.

And of course you maintain that energy is not a thing I suppose. Well thats an incorrect view. And please note that the smallest subatomic particles do not disappear if they did they would not exist and thus would not appear in the particle zoo. The other view by the way is that energy (a thing) is merely expanded matter!
