Around the world, thousands of scientists have devoted their professional lives to studying the climate. Not centrally organised, they sometimes build temporary affiliations but they remain scientists throughout – that is, they are independent, constantly challenge each other and are committed to searching for truth through objective, independently verifiable evidence.Overwhelmingly, this evidence has led to four conclusions. The first is that the world is warming. The global average temperature has increased by about 0.8 degrees since 1850, with most of the increase occurring since 1950. The warming varies among decades because of natural fluctuations but the overall trend has been inexorably upward.Warming is evident in other indicators, such as rising sea levels and reduced sea-ice and snow cover. Of these, the most important measure is the extra heat in the oceans, which is steadily rising. Claims that climate change has reversed since 1998 are misrepresentations of the full data.The second conclusion is that the dominant cause of the warming since about 1950 is the increase in the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases released by human activities, of which carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most important.This critical conclusion is based on several independent lines of evidence, including basic physics, studies of climate changes in both in the geological past and in the industrial era, and finally – but far from solely – from the predictions of climate models. Together, these provide an overwhelming case that increasing greenhouse gas concentrations cause warming, and that CO2 is the largest contributor to the current warming trend.Other contributors include changes in the sun’s output associated with sunspots and solar flares, and volcanic dust. However, if these were solely responsible for temperature changes since 1850, the world should have cooled over the past half-century rather than warming at an increasing rate.The third conclusion is that warming will increase in future, if emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases maintain their present paths. "Business as usual" scenarios for future emissions lead to likely global temperature increases of up to six degrees above present temperatures by 2100.These are dramatic temperature increases, which would be accompanied by major disruptions to food supplies, river flows and water availability, significant and ongoing rises in sea level (of up to about a metre by 2100 and potentially metres over longer times), disease threats, disruptions to ecosystems including the extinction of many species, and social and geopolitical destabilisation.The fourth conclusion is that climate change cannot be reversed for many centuries, because of the massive heat stores in the world’s oceans. Even if CO2 and other greenhouse gas concentrations were stabilised today at their present levels, a further warming of at least 0.6 degrees would inevitably follow (on top of the 0.8 degrees observed since 1850) and sea-level rise would continue for centuries to millenniums.These four conclusions have been known and agreed among thousands of independent climate scientists for more than a decade. However, new findings suggest that the situation is, if anything, more serious than the assessment of just a few years ago.The heightened concern among climate scientists arises from a growing realisation that climate change can be accelerated beyond current predictions by reinforcing "climate feedbacks", which contribute to climate change and are accelerated as it occurs, thus causing climate change to feed on itself. When these feedbacks are sufficiently strong they become "climate tipping points" which can flip the climate into a new state with essentially no way to recover.Several feedbacks are of immediate concern. Interactions between climate and the earth’s carbon cycle (the exchange of carbon between the atmosphere, the land and the oceans) will act to accelerate climate change if sinks do not keep pace with emissions (as is already happening) and/or if previously stable carbon stores are released to the atmosphere under climate change, for example by the thawing of carbon-rich frozen soils.Accelerated polar warming will cause loss of ice and a consequent darkening of the surface, leading to more heat absorption and faster warming. Atmospheric concentrations of aerosols (tiny particulates) are likely to decrease in future as nations improve air quality, leading to accelerated warming as the cooling effect of aerosols is reduced.Oceans are becoming more acidic as a consequence of increased CO2 in the atmosphere. When CO2 concentrations exceed levels to be reached by 2035 under business-as-usual emissions scenarios, there will be severe disruptions to marine ecosystems (including the Great Barrier Reef and ocean food chains), which will endanger fisheries and weaken the uptake of CO2 by oceans.Temperature rises of two to three degrees (or higher) carry a high risk of irreversible decay of the Greenland ice sheet from surface warming alone, leading to a sea level rise of up to about seven metres. Destabilisation of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet would cause a further few metres of sea-level rise.A climate conference in Copenhagen in March concluded that societies were highly vulnerable to even modest levels of climate change, with poor nations and communities particularly at risk. Temperature rises above two degrees will be very difficult for contemporary societies to cope with and will increase the level of climate disruption through the rest of the century.All of these concerns are firmly grounded in science. They have led the great majority of climate scientists to conclude (paraphrasing the summary of the Copenhagen conference) that rapid, sustained and effective emissions reductions are required to avoid ‘‘dangerous climate change’’, regardless of how it is defined.Higher future emissions increase the risk of crossing climate tipping points and they increase the likelihood that the long-term social and economic costs of both adaptation and mitigation will be higher.This article was written by Michael Raupach and John Church, CSIRO; David Griggs, Amanda Lynch and Neville Nicholls, Monash University; Nathan Bindoff, Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Co-operative Research Centre; Matthew England and Andy Pitman, University of NSW; Ann Henderson-Sellers and Lesley Hughes, Macquarie University; Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, University of Queensland; Roger Jones, Victoria University; David Karoly, University of Melbourne; and Tony McMichael and Will Steffen, Australian National University.Climate change poised to feed on itself - Opinion - smh.com.au

Temperatures are down just over 0.7 degrees since the day of release, with many scientists speculating that irony results in a negative feedback to the global temperature cycle. Accordingly, the locus of the global cooling trend is Al Gore's house, with his home town recording the coldest July since 1877. This cooling is taken place even when we take measurements from land based thermometers positioned on concrete slabs and near air conditioning outlets.Sadly, the international community moved too slowly to be able to claim credit for this change in temperature trend. Had Kyoto been more successful, this variance could have been claimed as a trophy.

Weather the earth warms or cools there is not much difference in what it would do to our infrastructure.Climate change could happen faster then our technology and money could compensate for.The earth’s climate is changing constantly even without the help of our civilization.It was called the ice age and glaciers covered a big chunk of North America.The study of climate change is important.Even though it contradicts it self it’s still something we should be keeping a close watch on.

Baloney! There has been major melting of ice at both the North and South Poles, meaning that far more of the sun's energy heat and energy will remain trapped in the Earth's atmosphere rather than being bounced off into outer space.Further, enormously unseasonably warm weather recently experienced in the Pacific Northwest broke all sorts of historic records.Temperatures of 104 degrees Farenheit in a region which very rarely registers three-digit temps.In fact, the weather templates of the local TV stations were unable to easily record the record temperatures.Also, the nightly temperatures also reached record highs never before recorded historically.So.... where the devil is this global cooling that a single battalion of fools thinks is in existence?

What report?the 29 year warming trend stands at 1.5 degree cent per century.the trend is that the earth is warming. Of course is not a steady straight line as you well know. The surface temp on land and sea is rising. This is the scientific consensus.by the way, if I remember correctly until recently you didn't care about 'scientific consensus' that you now invoke but you can not prove that is in your side.

Three glaciers in different climate zones of the U.S. Northwest have shrunk rapidly since 1989, confirming the impact of global warming on their decline, the government said in a report. The glaciers in Alaska and the state of Washington have shown a “rapid and sustained” loss of mass over the two decades, according to today’s report from the U.S. Geological Survey. The South Cascade glacier in Washington is shrinking at a rate that may see it disappear in 50 years, said Edward Josberger, the report’s lead author. Glaciers in the Northwest have gained or lost mass from year to year since the agency began collecting data in 1957, because of changes in winter storm patterns tied to shifts in Pacific Ocean currents, Josberger said. The cumulative decline since 1989 suggests that global warming has overcome those seasonal variations. “That’s telling us something on a larger scale is happening,” Josberger, a senior scientist at the geological survey stationed in Tacoma, Washington, said in an interview. Melting glaciers add to the rise of sea level, threatening low-lying and coastal communities. The loss of glaciers in the Northwest also affects rivers and streams where species such as bull trout and salmon live, Josberger said. Those fish prefer the colder, highly oxygenated water that runs off the glaciers in the spring and summer. Maritime, Interior Glaciers Two of the glaciers, Wolverine on Alaska’s coast and South Cascade, are in maritime climates that are strongly influenced by Pacific Ocean currents and winter storms. The third, Gulkana, is in the interior of Alaska where there is less annual snowfall and the temperatures are colder and drier. Scientists track the growth and decline of glaciers by taking snow core samples and measuring the height of the annual snowfall. The data are used to estimate the net balance of a glacier, its average mass over a year. “More than 99 percent of America’s thousands of large glaciers have long-documented records of an overall shrinkage as climate warms,” agency scientist Bruce Molnia said in a statement. Global warming is shrinking glaciers in the Himalayan mountains, threatening water supplies in China and India, and increasing the likelihood of regional disputes, according to a report earlier this year from the Asia Society, a New York-based nonprofit group that promotes Asian-U.S. relations. Asia, with half the world’s population, has less fresh water than any continent except Antarctica.

http://www.publish.csiro.au/view/jou...=138&f=AS06018The paper you reference (published in June '08) talks about cycles of solar activity. This paper in no way indicates that man made global warming is false. It suggests that solar activity occurs in cycles, and we may be coming to the end of a cycle of peak solar activity, after which the earth will cool a few degrees for a 20 year period. It is notable that if this does occur, it will be a temporary cooling. The overall temperature of the earth has increased dramatically over the past 200 years in spite of both the Dalton and Victorian minimums. So while this cooling could temporarily bring global temps down, they will return to pre-minimum levels, which will still be above average. But then it should be noted that one of the authors of this paper recommended that we bulldoze snow to make it less reflective to counter the effects of global cooling. Genious. emoticonXRolleyes

If you have any sense at all you will agree we need to stop this from happening, regardless of how much you have invested in the carbon trading markets. The people warning about this are scientists, you are not qualified to disagree with them or question their logic.If you want anyone to take you seriously you need to link peer reviewed papers from at least 10 qualified astronomers denying global cooling - I will then proceed to smear and defame them based on their age, race, gender, employer (past or present), education, papers published by them earlier in their careers, or tangential association with carbon trading corporations or government funded entities.

I am doing my very best to try to stop global cooling but there is only so much one person can do.I drive the biggest car with the biggest engine I can afford. It was made in 1996 and is a grey import from Japan so it produces plenty of CO2.I also try to produce as much methane that I can( actually I find this quite easy).It looks like China and India are helping to stop the Earth cooling by building hundreds of coal fired power stations.

That's actually a false dichotomy. I have studied related fields so I have some knowledge beyond the layman in the relevant areas of quantum physics, I'm by no means an expert in the field but to say all my knowledge comes from newspapers and the Internet is incorrect.I have no doubt at all that there are solar radiation cycles that affect our climate. This has no bearing on the problems caused by CO2 emissions, the most it can do is provide a breathing space to get CO2 emissions under control. If temperatures are restrained slightly by a low point in natural cycles then it will give us time to get low carbon technology in place for when it reaches another peak - a peak in natural cycles plus the effect of CO2 emissions would be even worse.

My god, can we finally put to rest the myth that recent climate change has been a result of solar cycles? Man is causing this cooling by burning insufficient fossil fuels, regardless of what you denialists believe, fossil fuel emissions drive climate change. The recent high point in solar cycles has given us a breathing space to get our CO2 emissions up to scratch. If temperatures are slightly elevated by a high point in natural cycles it will give us time to build up our high carbon technology for when it reaches another low. A low in natural cycles plus the effect of low CO2 emissions would be even worse.Where is your list of astronomers for me to ridicule and potentially write threatening letters to? Do you call failing to provide me with a list of astronomers to attack science!? I think not!

This has no bearing on the problems caused by CO2 emissions, the most it can do is provide a breathing space to get CO2 emissions under control. If temperatures are restrained slightly by a low point in natural cycles then it will give us time to get low carbon technology in place for when it reaches another peak - a peak in natural cycles plus the effect of CO2 emissions would be even worse.

of course she is trolling, how many posting of hers you have to read to realize that? she doesn't want to admit what she knows it's true so she is making fun of it.making fun of it won't cool the Earth. :)I suppose that had she been aboard the Titanic she would have denied it was sinking and kept on dancing until she was in the water.

Here's some science worth considering. http://icecap.us/images/uploads/TheCooling.pdf

My god, can we finally put to rest the myth that recent climate change has been a result of solar cycles? Man is causing this cooling by burning insufficient fossil fuels, regardless of what you denialists believe, fossil fuel emissions drive climate change. The recent high point in solar cycles has given us a breathing space to get our CO2 emissions up to scratch. If temperatures are slightly elevated by a high point in natural cycles it will give us time to build up our high carbon technology for when it reaches another low. A low in natural cycles plus the effect of low CO2 emissions would be even worse.Where is your list of astronomers for me to ridicule and potentially write threatening letters to? Do you call failing to provide me with a list of astronomers to attack science!? I think not!

Which adds up to you have no more idea whether global warming is actually happening nor whether man is the cause of it than I have.

If CO2 is the cause of global warming and global warming will cause a worldwide catastrophe in the near future then the biggest threat to mankind today is the industrialisation of China and India.So why is the West buying goods from these countries?Do all the Global warming Cassandras refuse to but cheap clothes and electrical goods from China or do they make do and mend to save the planet?

if you knew anything about Greek mythology you ought to know that Cassandra was proven rightthe difference between you and symbiote is that she knows that the earth is not cooling down, so she resorts to sarcasm trying to make fun of the scientific consensus that yes CO2 is warming up the planet. you instead think that really the earth is not warming up.If you put a heater in a room and as the temperature is raising you turn on the air conditioner of course the room's temp will drop for as long as the aircond is on but it doesn't mean the heater is not introducing heat in the room. the earth's 'heater' is the CO2 we the human kind is pumping into the atmosphere.

Thing is, when you quote those sort of sources, it's hard to respond to them without knowing how much of it theyve made up. We know, for example, that the 400 scientists claim is junk, the list containing a great many economists, others who agree with the science of global warming but think technology will get us out of the mess, and a great many who are no more scientists than I am (i.e. they have a degree in a science subject). Knowing that this list is complete hocum, what are we to make of the rest of the piece?

The thing is ..there are eminent scientists who think that man made global warming has become a religion, that we are given worst case scenarios as fact when they are not and that there should be a more constructive argument to promote GW not the apocalyptic shrill that is fed to us by the media.My point is that you me and everyone on this forum gets our information through the same sources so ...your guess is as good as mine..but no better.There are climate scientists that are sceptical about the global warming doomfest that is being pedalled today but if it was a government lie one would expect that they would have little chance to put forward their argument against .

The problem with that argument is that for most of the 8 years of the Bush presidency, the US government was intent on trying to undermine climate change science, as were the major energy companies. Bush finally bowed to the overwhelming weight of the evidence and, yes, the consensus. There were plenty of people looking very hard to find alternative explanations for the evidence and the reality is that they failed totally. If a researcher, whether post-grad or post-doc or professor, finds compelling evidence that undermines the theories that underpin climate change they're going to be hailed as a genius, and if someone had already come up with this evidence then the denial industry would be proclaiming it from the rooftops, as they've already attempted to do with their myriad other attempts (sunspots et al). Finally if such evidence exist there ought to be some scientific papers outlining it. I've posted links in the past to an archive of the papers, dating back a century or more, that support climate change, where are the papers that undermine it?

Another point that I posted but obviously went over your head is that China and India are busy building coal fired power stations by the hundreds . so while you are wringing your hands with worry and conglatulating yourself for buying low energy lightbulbs and dreaming of a Toyota prius they are planning to pump millions of tons of CO2 into the atmosphere!If the doomsday merchants are correct we will see the effects of man made global warming in our life time and it will be catastophic. So why are we in the west the biggest market for their produce?Do we not stop buying goods from countries that are deemed to be or potentially will be major polluters in the years to come?Why arent we completely rethinkiing the way that we will live in the latter part of the 21st century so that we can reduce the amount of CO2 produced and cope with the effects of what we have already done?Possibly because our governments do not believe in man made global warming as much as you do!

There is no 'if' about it. The earth has been warming dramatically for the last 200 years. The temperature record does not lie. So the question is this.

Turning my thermostat down will not make a lot of difference, but if everyone turned their thermostat down...And why would you say that man is probably not responsible? Ever heard of a little thing called the industrial revolution? You have repeated something similar to this over and over...Just because I am not a climatologist does not mean that I cannot educate myself and form an educated opinion. You seem to feel that only experts should be allowed to have a firm belief about global warming. I think you either lack basic reading comprehension and deductive reasoning skills, or you simply have not put time into learning about the subject. While the involvment of CO2 is the most probable explanation by far, I could accept you saying that you do not believe that it is the cause of global warming. What I cannot accept is that you don't even seem willing to admit that the earth is warming up. That is a proven fact, yet you still seem unwilling to admit it. No wonder people like you are called 'deniers'. I will ask again...Do you have any alternative theory to explain why the earth has warmed dramatically?

Turning my thermostat down will not make a lot of difference, but if everyone turned their thermostat down...And why would you say that man is probably not responsible? Ever heard of a little thing called the industrial revolution? You have repeated something similar to this over and over...Just because I am not a climatologist does not mean that I cannot educate myself and form an educated opinion. You seem to feel that only experts should be allowed to have a firm belief about global warming. I think you either lack basic reading comprehension and deductive reasoning skills, or you simply have not put time into learning about the subject. While the involvment of CO2 is the most probable explanation by far, I could accept you saying that you do not believe that it is the cause of global warming. What I cannot accept is that you don't even seem willing to admit that the earth is warming up. That is a proven fact, yet you still seem unwilling to admit it. No wonder people like you are called 'deniers'. I will ask again...Do you have any alternative theory to explain why the earth has warmed dramatically?

It has nothing to do with "amount of energy gained"...whatever that means. It does however have to do with the release of greenhouse gases due to the mass burning of fossil fuels that began back in the mid to late 18th century (strangely enough, about the time of the beginning of the idustrial revolution). The first appreciable rises in global CO2 concentration appeared ~1840. Where?Herein lies the problem. Until you can accept some basic facts, you are not worth debating.

If you are not ready to unequivocally accept the facts regarding the global temp increase, then you have no business in this debate.

In the 18th century they only needed a small amount of energy from fossil fuels because there was only a tiny amount of energy needed to run the mills and factories that where there.Also they had a lot fewer motors cars than there are today ..in fact there were No motor cars because they had not been invented.Therefore if the energy requirements where miniscule compared with today the fossil fuels burnt were miniscule compared with today so it must follow that the amount of CO2 released into the atmosphere was miniscule compared to today.Hope that explains what I mean by amount of energy gained.So guess what ..the amount of man made global warmong must have been miniscule compared with today.So..if global warming increased significantly in 1840 it could not have been caused by the amount of CO2 released into the atmosphere by man.Its there if you bother to lookAs I said on the last post I am quite willing to accept for the purpose of debate that the global temperature is rising. It may well be rising.Between 5000 and 3000BC average global temperatures were warmer than they are today and 1550 to 1850 AD there was a cooling period known as the little Ice age. So just as the earth warmed up ..it cooled laterThere was even serious talk of a forthcoming ice age predicted by scientists in the 1970s.What you and the other warmers seem to insist on is that the rise is a caused by human activity.

U.S. scientists monitoring shrinking glaciers in Washington and Alaska reported this week that a major meltdown is under way.The Gulkana glacier in Alaska is one of three glaciers considered a benchmark by the U.S. Geological Survey.A 50-year government study found that the world's glaciers are melting at a rapid and alarming rate.

There is no overriding government interest in climate change that I can see. It would be an awful lot easier in both Britain and the US to rely on coal. Britain has coal for 300 years or more (and considerable marginal oil shales in places like North Somerset), I could see an argument for a tory government 20 years ago not wanting coal from a political point of view, but any government today would rather do without the headache of nimbyism over wind turbines and nuclear power. I don't see an interest for the government in higher energy prices either. Either politicians have genuine concerns about climate change, or they are responding to public concerns about climate change for electoral expediency.I agree that the short term impact of energy saving measures will be cancelled out by growth in China and India, but in 10 years time we need to be able to go to India and China and say, "look, we know it wouldn't be fair to ask you to not develop in order to save the world from the mess we made, but we've cut our contribution as much as possible, here's the tech we've used now can you agree to use this in future and develop more sustainably?" There's already signs of this happening with India asking for development money for a massive photo-voltaic solar plant.As for fusion, I don't know enough detail the make a judgement of my own, but I understand that cold fusion is impossible as far as our current knowledge of physics goes, and hot fusion will need to be on a massive scale to produce rather than consume energy, because containing plasma is hugely energy consuming.

as long as we are included in the 95% of spiecies to become extinct it is good news.the human population was low in pre-industrial times and without mechanized means of transport, it will impossible for the human (disg)race to invade wild remote areas.without mass production and transportation of food, famine and disease will cut the numbers to the bone.we will live like cockroaches but it won't be billions of us just a couple of millions.

Two scientists, Michael F. Wehner and David R. Easterling, show that such decade-long fluctuations are quite common in weather history. From day to day, season to season, and year to year, the weather shows great variability thanks to natural factors like capricious wind patterns and ocean currents.Changes in climate -- that is, changes in typical weather conditions over long periods of time -- are more difficult to assess.These short-term changes, say the scientists, must be differentiated from long-lasting, consequential trends in order to determine the role of human activities in shaping climate and to formulate industrial policy -- such as imposing a tax on carbon emissions.Wehner, who works at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif., says that the long-term trend really is toward a warmer planet, but that a single year, 1998, has temporarily thrown off the overall upward march in temperature.In that year, an immense transfer of heat from the western to the eastern Pacific occurred: El Nino (Spanish for "Christ Child"), which often coincides with Christmas time. An El Nino event can have a major impact on rainfall patterns and temperatures over several continents.El Nino and other weather factors can cause a short reversal in the warming trend for a year. A 10-year reversal is less likely, but still possible. Just as in throwing a coin, seven heads in a row is unexpected, but it does happen now and then.In the journal Geophysical Review Letters, Wehner says that even a period of 20 years of modest cooling -- the equivalent of throwing 20 heads in a row -- would not reverse the scientific finding that long-term world temperature is trending upward; the trend is based on data now stretching back more than a century.Does this mean that after 10 years of relative cooling the next few years will be particularly warm in order to make up the cool years?No -- scientists can only say that the overall trend, over many years, is toward higher temperatures.No unusually warm day in January or unusually cool day in July can negate the overall trend. Neither can a cooling decade negate a century-long warming trend.In making policy decisions, argues Wehner and Easterling, don't let today's weather or even this year's weather influence your judgment. Concentrate on the long-term trend.This story was reported by Inside Science News Service.

I can't understand why a scientific issue such as global warming end up being treated as a religious issue. Of course religious fundamentalists such as archie deny it is happening because they think only God can change the climate.I suppose the rest just find it an uncomfortable truth and think that denying it, will make it go away.The Guardian had an interesting piece about it today:Climate change deniers claim they're censored. What hypocrites. Anthony Watts, sceptic and scourge of climate change science, has used copyright laws to censor an opponentOne of the allegations made repeatedly by climate change deniers is that they are being censored. There's just one problem with this claim: they have yet to produce a single valid example. On the other hand, there are hundreds of examples of direct attempts to censor climate scientists.Most were the work of the Bush administration. In 2007 the Union of Concerned Scientists collated 435 instances of political interference in the work of climate researchers in the US.Scientists working for the government were pressured by officials to remove the words "climate change" and "global warming" from their publications; their reports were edited to change the meaning of their findings, others never saw the light of day. Scientists at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration and the US Fish and Wildlife Service were forbidden to speak to the media; James Hansen at Nasa was told by public relations officials that there would be "dire consequences" if he continued to call for big cuts in greenhouse gases.Philip Cooney, a senior White House aide who previously worked at the American Petroleum Institute, admitted to Congress that he had made hundreds of changes to government reports about climate change on behalf of the Bush government.Among other changes, he had struck out evidence that glaciers were retreating and inserted phrases suggesting that there was serious scientific doubt about global warming. In the UK, both Viscount Monckton and Martin Durkin, the director of Channel 4's The Great Global Warming Swindle, have threatened to sue people who have criticised the claims they've made about the science.Where, on the other hand, is a single verifiable instance of a climate denier being silenced by the authorities? They have yet to produce one. But it suits them to cry wolf. They love to imagine that they are important enough to censor. The claim chimes with their paranoid invocation of a great conspiracy – involving most of the world's scientists, most of the world's governments, most of the world's media and a few hundred million others – to suppress the truth about global warming.Now we have another marvellous instance of this hypocrisy. Anthony Watts spends much of his time maligning climate scientists and environmentalists on his blog Wattsupwiththat. But while he can dole it out, he can't take it. As Kevin Grandia of desmogblog shows, Watts has just used US copyright laws to take down a YouTube video which exposes his claims. Grandia has since reposted the video (see above) so you can see for yourself what all the fuss is about.It is not clear how his copyright was infringed by the video, but the US laws have been widely used by other people to block material that they don't like. Websites are obliged to remove any video which is subject to a takedown request, and they can put it back up only if they win an appeal. I charge Watts with the accusation he unjustly levels at other people: this looks to me like an attempt to silence his critics.Climate change deniers claim they're censored.

This was a comment posted on the Guardian site in responce to the article.I totally agree......The problem I see with all these climate debates is three fold.I'm a well educated, (reasonably) intelligent person. I have various bits of paper that tell me so. However, I'm not a scientist and I honestly don't feel able to discern XXXX from shinola as far as the raw data and evidence is concerned.Consequently I'm totally at the mercy of advocates / lobbyists / apologists and how they ALL chose to present their cases to me.It seems to me that there is mudslinging, malpractice, egotism and general 'smark-alecyness' on all sides of this. It all blurs into infantile shouting.None of you, who have any strong opinion on this want people like me to actually 'get' this for ourselves. You all simply want us to agree with whatever it is you're selling.You'd all rather I was jaded and apathetic than well-informed. I think that's very sad.

This was a comment posted on the Guardian site in responce to the article.I totally agree......The problem I see with all these climate debates is three fold.I'm a well educated, (reasonably) intelligent person. I have various bits of paper that tell me so. However, I'm not a scientist and I honestly don't feel able to discern XXXX from shinola as far as the raw data and evidence is concerned.Consequently I'm totally at the mercy of advocates / lobbyists / apologists and how they ALL chose to present their cases to me.It seems to me that there is mudslinging, malpractice, egotism and general 'smark-alecyness' on all sides of this. It all blurs into infantile shouting.None of you, who have any strong opinion on this want people like me to actually 'get' this for ourselves. You all simply want us to agree with whatever it is you're selling.You'd all rather I was jaded and apathetic than well-informed. I think that's very sad.

What is the problem with your brain winny? Are you completely incapable of comprehending the english language? You are the only person here who is attempting to inject religion into this debate, and you continue doing it after I have repeatedly insisted it isn't a religious issue, and have only posted secular based evidence against it. So get a clue and respond to the actual evidence I posted above rather than attempting to redefine the debate in such a dishonest way.

I can't understand why a scientific issue such as global warming end up being treated as a religious issue. Of course religious fundamentalists such as archie deny it is happening because they think only God can change the climate.I suppose the rest just find it an uncomfortable truth and think that denying it, will make it go away.The Guardian had an interesting piece about it today:Climate change deniers claim they're censored. What hypocrites. Anthony Watts, sceptic and scourge of climate change science, has used copyright laws to censor an opponentOne of the allegations made repeatedly by climate change deniers is that they are being censored. There's just one problem with this claim: they have yet to produce a single valid example.

I disagree. There is a huge windfall to be gained by our government (US) in the form of Cap and Trade. Selling CO2 credits is like selling the "ether" that fills the universe. It is a license to print money and our liberal government sees that with crystal clarity.Additionally, pumping 10's of billion of taxpayer dollars into renewable energy projects creates jobs and keeps politicians in office.So, it is imperative that Obama and crew sell the idea of AGW to the gullable public in order for him to finance his liberal programs.Are you serious? You expect China to curtail its growth in order to "save the world"? That's a lot to ask of a country that has almost zero regard for the environment now. I doubt that we'll see a fusion reactor in our lifetime. It would require huge advances in magnetic containment and solving a host of other extreme temperature issues.Breeder reactors seems to be the ticket. You make energy and fuel at the same time. It's a win-win proposition.

There is no overriding government interest in climate change that I can see. It would be an awful lot easier in both Britain and the US to rely on coal. Britain has coal for 300 years or more (and considerable marginal oil shales in places like North Somerset), I could see an argument for a tory government 20 years ago not wanting coal from a political point of view, but any government today would rather do without the headache of nimbyism over wind turbines and nuclear power. I don't see an interest for the government in higher energy prices either. Either politicians have genuine concerns about climate change, or they are responding to public concerns about climate change for electoral expediency.I agree that the short term impact of energy saving measures will be cancelled out by growth in China and India, but in 10 years time we need to be able to go to India and China and say, "look, we know it wouldn't be fair to ask you to not develop in order to save the world from the mess we made, but we've cut our contribution as much as possible, here's the tech we've used now can you agree to use this in future and develop more sustainably?" There's already signs of this happening with India asking for development money for a massive photo-voltaic solar plant.As for fusion, I don't know enough detail the make a judgement of my own, but I understand that cold fusion is impossible as far as our current knowledge of physics goes, and hot fusion will need to be on a massive scale to produce rather than consume energy, because containing plasma is hugely energy consuming.

The government already has a licence to print money, it doesn't need another one. Besides, if the government raises revenue from CO2 credits instead of other taxation, all it does it alter the tax base. If the government needs more revenue then it's not a bad way of getting it. Governments don't raise taxes to spend on swimming pools and hookers (actually may be they do in the US, the way bills get through congress I wouldn't be surprised to find a "Company for lonely Congressmen" rider attached to the climate change bill) they spend it on infrastructure and helping people (and blowing things up of course).Sorry, renewable energy is going to create jobs and so you think this is a bad thing?!That's not what I said, I said we can't expect carbon cuts from China until we can offer them the technology to continue to grow and cut carbon at the same time. It's outrageous for us to expect them to keep their people in poverty before we put a brake on our wasteful lifestyles.

You're vastly exaggerating the space required for solar. Wind is part of the solution, but so are wave, tidal, biomass and others. Solar hot water heating is very efficient and cost effective, for example, and would drastically cut gas and electricity use. Using reflectors to focus sunlight onto water to drive turbines and generate electricity also has a lot of promise. The other key thing is that energy consumption needs to be cut, insulation, heat exchange systems, better build quality will all make a big dent in energy consumption, before we get on to actual lifestyle changes, like fuel efficient vehicles and public transport.

Solar heating of water is already in widespread use in those areas that actually get regular sunlight. I saw many examples of it while in Hawaii, for example. For the rest of us though, especially those of you in foggy England, solar isn't a viable answer. Additionally, there needs to be a back-up system for when the sun isn't shining...like at night, which occurs on a regular basis. ;)And as for the land requirements needed for solar farms, I'll dig up the number of thousands of square miles needed based on a study that I read when I get a chance to.On edit: The largest solar farm will be 80MW peak and occupy 640 acres - 1 square mile.The US electricity consumption for 2005 was 3,816,000,000 MWh.Assuming 365 days of sunlight at peak output for 12 hours/day, you'd still need 11890 square miles of solar panels to meet US' 2005 demand. Now, if we convert to electic automobiles, we'll need to start building our houses on pontoons in the ocean because there won't be enough land left for houses. ;)Check my math though, I'm doing this while working.

Assuming you're right, that's an area around 110 miles by 110 miles, to put that in perspective, the total area of the US is around 3.8 million square miles, so you'd have to cover maybe, being generous and say we need 3 times as much area for access roads, power lines, electric cars etc, 1% of the total land mass of the US. And that assumes you want to get all power from solar, which is by no means sensible.As for solar only being effective in hotter climbs, I've just come back from holiday in Orkney, staying in a cottage where the main water heating was by solar energy, and perfectly adequate (ok it's summer but still, the wind gets up quite a lot in winter so it balances out).

I would be very concerned about the damage sandstorms could and would do to the mechanisms and moving parts in both solar screens which turn to angle toward the sun and wind turbines which are finely balanced blades. I can envision the havoc caused by the fine sand from every sand storm which came by. The maintenance in such an environment would be cost prohibitive.

Everyone knows that the ice sheet on Greenland is melting. But new research shows it is disappearing much faster than previously thought. The findings could mean that ocean levels are also rising more quickly.The dimensions of this frosty giant go way beyond human imagination. With a surface area spanning some 1.7 million square kilometers (656,000 square miles), a view of Greenland's ice above the Sermeq-Kujalleq glacier near Ilulisat makes it seem endless. The idea that this sheet of ice, which is up to three kilometers thick in parts, is melting seems absurd in the extreme.Were Greenland to lose all of its ice, sea levels would rise some seven meters higher than today's levels. Such a scenario will not become reality overnight -- indeed the process could last hundreds of years. But new results from a team of Dutch researchers suggest that conservative estimates as to the speed with which the ice is melting should be shelved. According to the study, the rate at which Greenland's ice is melting has accelerated substantially in recent years.There are, strictly speaking, two parallel processes responsible for the ice's retreat. On the one hand, rising temperatures melt the ice on land while warmer ocean currents eat away at the glaciers that jut out into the ocean. A research team led by Michiel van den Broeke from the University of Utrecht reported in the most recent edition of the journal Science that the two processes are contributing equally to the disappearance of the ice sheet.Losing Weight According to the new report, Greenland lost an estimated 1,500 gigatons (one gigaton is equal to 1 billion tons) of ice from the year 2000 to 2008. "That is at the upper end of recent estimates of Greenland mass loss using various other methods," van den Broeke told SPIEGEL ONLINE. Between 2006 and 2008, the loss in weight totaled 273 gigatons per year, he said. The scientists are convinced their results are accurate because they arrived at their numbers using two fundamentally different methods -- both of which returned the same conclusion. On the one hand, they monitored the movement of the ice which they fed into a regional computer model. For a second data source, they used the Grace observation satellites, which measure the Earth's gravitational field. In the period between 2000 and 2008, the dwindling glaciers have been responsible for the sea level rising by an average of about half a millimeter per year. However, during the last three years of observation, the value rose to 0.75 millimeters per year. According to the researchers, these results could indicate that the sheet of ice is melting at an accelerated rate.A Warming Arctic: Greenland's Ice Sheet Melting Faster than Ever - SPIEGEL ONLINE - News - International

Everyone knows that the ice sheet on Greenland is melting. But new research shows it is disappearing much faster than previously thought. The findings could mean that ocean levels are also rising more quickly.The dimensions of this frosty giant go way beyond human imagination. With a surface area spanning some 1.7 million square kilometers (656,000 square miles), a view of Greenland's ice above the Sermeq-Kujalleq glacier near Ilulisat makes it seem endless. The idea that this sheet of ice, which is up to three kilometers thick in parts, is melting seems absurd in the extreme.Were Greenland to lose all of its ice, sea levels would rise some seven meters higher than today's levels. Such a scenario will not become reality overnight -- indeed the process could last hundreds of years. But new results from a team of Dutch researchers suggest that conservative estimates as to the speed with which the ice is melting should be shelved. According to the study, the rate at which Greenland's ice is melting has accelerated substantially in recent years.There are, strictly speaking, two parallel processes responsible for the ice's retreat. On the one hand, rising temperatures melt the ice on land while warmer ocean currents eat away at the glaciers that jut out into the ocean. A research team led by Michiel van den Broeke from the University of Utrecht reported in the most recent edition of the journal Science that the two processes are contributing equally to the disappearance of the ice sheet.Losing Weight According to the new report, Greenland lost an estimated 1,500 gigatons (one gigaton is equal to 1 billion tons) of ice from the year 2000 to 2008. "That is at the upper end of recent estimates of Greenland mass loss using various other methods," van den Broeke told SPIEGEL ONLINE. Between 2006 and 2008, the loss in weight totaled 273 gigatons per year, he said. The scientists are convinced their results are accurate because they arrived at their numbers using two fundamentally different methods -- both of which returned the same conclusion. On the one hand, they monitored the movement of the ice which they fed into a regional computer model. For a second data source, they used the Grace observation satellites, which measure the Earth's gravitational field. In the period between 2000 and 2008, the dwindling glaciers have been responsible for the sea level rising by an average of about half a millimeter per year. However, during the last three years of observation, the value rose to 0.75 millimeters per year. According to the researchers, these results could indicate that the sheet of ice is melting at an accelerated rate.A Warming Arctic: Greenland's Ice Sheet Melting Faster than Ever - SPIEGEL ONLINE - News - International
