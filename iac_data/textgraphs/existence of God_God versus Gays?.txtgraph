A GRIEVING father has won a nearly $US11 million ($11.8 million) verdict against a fundamentalist church that pickets military funerals in the belief that the war in Iraq is a punishment for the US's tolerance of homosexuality.Albert Snyder sued the Westboro Baptist Church, based in Topeka, Kansas, for unspecified damages after members demonstrated at the March, 2006, funeral of his son, Marine Lance Corporal Matthew Snyder, who was killed in Iraq. Among the signs church members displayed at the funeral was one that read: "Thank God for Dead Soldiers".A federal jury in Baltimore on Wednesday first awarded $US2.9 million in compensatory damages. It later awarded $US6 million in punitive damages for invasion of privacy and $US2 million for causing emotional distress.Earlier, church members demonstrated outside the courthouse. Pastor Fred Phelps held a sign reading "God is your enemy", while his daughter and co-defendant, Shirley Phelps-Roper, stood on an American flag and carried a sign that read: "God hates ### enablers". Members of the group sang God Hates America to the tune of God Bless America.One of the defendants said the civil award was the first against the church, whose members have stirred outrage by picketing at funerals for service members killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, often carrying placards bearing virulent anti-gay slogans.The church maintains that God is punishing the US, killing and maiming troops, because the country tolerates homosexuality.Mr Phelps scoffed at the jury and the award. "It was a bunch of silly heads passing judgment on God," he said. The church would appeal, and he predicted that a higher court would overturn the award "in five minutes".In the lawsuit, Lance Corporal Snyder's family said it had suffered invasion of privacy and infliction of emotional distress."The fact of the matter is, a funeral's private," one of their lawyers, Sean Summers, said.The church reportedly has fewer than 100 members, and it is unclear whether the award will be collected. After the jury awarded the smaller compensatory damages, the District Judge, Richard Bennett, said that the size of that award "far exceeds the net worth of the defendants".In his closing arguments during the punitive damages phase, the plaintiffs' lawyer, Craig Trebilcock, described church members as bullies who "seek out those among us who are at the weakest point in our lives"."That's why they've gotten away with it," he said. Grieving families were too weak to fight back "until [Mr Snyder]."As a result of the pickets, several states have passed bills restricting protests at funerals or tightening existing limits, and legislators in more than a dozen other states are considering such measures.Ms Phelps-Roper said the verdict made her 50th birthday on Tuesday a happier one. It would help the church, many of whose members are from the Phelps family, get its message out, she said."We're making new signs: 'Thank God for $US10.9 million'. Listen to that amount. It's so laughable," she said. "It was all I could do not to laugh. You guys think you can change God?"The Washington Post, Associated Press

These people sound more like a cult than religion.They should be declared a public nuisance and the police should be called whenever they picket any funeral. What about respect for the dead? In my view they should have a law banning pickets and demonstration within sight of graveyards.

This does not mean that I think that they do not have to take responsiblity for the speech. With freedom comes responsiblity. The law suit for pain and suffering, I think is just.Oh so many law suits to plan. Because with freedom of religion and religious speech comes responsiblity. This case now sets Precedent, that if I find religious speech hurtfull, or the actions of religious groups trying to fight gay people, marriage, or gay rights, I could sue for pain and suffering.God bless Fred Phelps for giving fundies and religion a black eye. :) Fred Phelps is the one of the best things ever that could happen for gay rights.

Now, Mae. Think about it. The motivation for Phelps and company's pickets is his hatred of "homosexuality," and his insistence that "God hates f&gs." He claims America is doomed for being too accepting of gay people. This issue IS about gays. Phelps is not picketing because he hates dead soldiers or grieving families, although his pickets certainly do show disrespect for grieving families and their lost loved ones, no doubt. I'm curious why YOU don't say anything about respect for gay people, who are the real targets of Phelps and his gang of nuts. Phelps started out by picketing the funerals of gay men, and when that didn't garner him enough attention, he switched tactics and began picketing the funerals of troops. The troops and their families are just a tactic for him; they are not the point of his attacks. This is just a tactic for Phelps to draw attention. Whether religion is a good thing or not is a debatable question, and I think it depends on which forms of religion we are talking about. Phelps claims to be adhering to "the book." Different Christians interpret "the book" differently.

Easyrider, this is not "yet another study".This is an old study that has been REPEATEDLY DISPROVEN as employing false techniques...Critique of "Obituary Study" by the Paul Cameron GroupTheir conclusion – that homosexual men and women have a shorter life span than heterosexual men and women – provides a textbook example of the perils of using data from a convenience sample to generalize to an entire population.Death Notices and Obituaries Most city newspapers include a section containing death notices for community residents. These notices – which can carry a small fee for printing – typically list the name, age, address, and survivors of the deceased, along with information about funeral or memorial services. Funeral directors often assist the loved ones of the deceased in submitting such notices.Gay community newspapers do not have sections of death notices. When the AIDS epidemic began to claim the lives of so many gay and bisexual men in the 1980s, however, many gay newspapers began to print obituaries. Except in the case of prominent community figures, these obituaries are typically written by (or based on information from) the loved ones of the deceased.Assuming that the deceased person wasn't famous, an obituary appears in a gay community newspaper only if (1) a loved one or friend notifies the newspaper about the death (and, in many cases, writes the obituary) and (2) the editor decides to print the obituary.Consequently, many gay men and lesbians who die never have an obituary in a gay community publication. Here are just a few examples of who is left out of gay newspapers' obituaries.* * gay men and lesbians who were not involved in the gay community*  * gay men and lesbians who were in the closet about their sexual orientation*  * gay men and lesbians whose loved ones or family didn't want their homosexuality to be known*  * gay men and lesbians whose loved ones or family simply didn't think of sending an obituary to a gay community newspaper*  * gay men and lesbians whose loved ones did not write an obituary for some other reason (e.g., they were too grief stricken)*  * gay men and lesbians who died without leaving anyone to write an obituary for a gay publication (e.g., those whose loved ones and relatives died before them).An accurate estimate of the life span of gay men and lesbians would have to count such people. By restricting their analysis to obituaries in gay newspapers, however, the Cameron group systematically excluded them from the sample.Internal Inconsistencies The inadequacy of the Cameron group's approach is evident from internal inconsistencies within their own data. Compare the data about lesbians reported in their obituary study, for example, to data from their so-called national survey.In their obituary study, the Cameron group claimed that the average lesbian life-span is similar to that of gay men who do not have AIDS ("under 50 years" versus "mid-40s," respectively). But if this is true, and if obituaries are indeed a valid source for this type of data, the ratio of gay male obituaries to lesbian obituaries should be about the same as the ratio of gay men to lesbians in the population.From their survey data, the Cameron group has claimed to know the number of gay men and lesbians in the population. If we believed their numbers, we would set the ratio of gay men-to-lesbians at about 1.6-to-1 (or approximately 2.6-to-1 if bisexuals are omitted).But the ratio of gay male-to-lesbian obituaries in the Cameron group's study is quite different – approximately 6-to-1 if AIDS and violent deaths are excluded, 32-to-1 if they are included.Thus, at least one data set has to be wrong. Either the obituaries data do not include a representative sample of lesbians, or the Cameron group's population estimates based on their survey data are invalid.An observer with training in research methodology would most likely conclude that both sets of data are fatally flawed.The 2005 article explicitly mentions the "study" was done by Paul Cameron.I don't know if you realize it or not, but Paul Cameron is renowned as an anti-gay liar. There are only two people whose work I think should be rejected as a matter of automatic recognition of a faulty source. Paul Cameron is one of those people.He has just been busted too many times for lying...# On December 2, 1983, the American Psychological Association sent Paul Cameron a letter informing him that he had been dropped from membership. Early in 1984, all members of the American Psychological Association received official written notice that "Paul Cameron (Nebraska) was dropped from membership for a violation of the Preamble to the Ethical Principles of Psychologists" by the APA Board of Directors.5 Cameron has posted an elaborate argument about his expulsion from APA on his website, claiming that he resigned from APA before he was dropped from membership. Like most organizations, however, APA does not allow a member to resign when they are being investigated. And even if Cameron's claims were accepted as true, it would be remarkable that the largest professional organization of psychologists in the United States (and other professional associations, as noted below) went to such lengths to disassociate itself from one individual.# At its membership meeting on October 19, 1984, the Nebraska Psychological Association adopted a resolution stating that it "formally disassociates itself from the representations and interpretations of scientific literature offered by Dr. Paul Cameron in his writings and public statements on sexuality."6# In 1985, the American Sociological Association (ASA) adopted a resolution which asserted that "Dr. Paul Cameron has consistently misinterpreted and misrepresented sociological research on sexuality, homosexuality, and lesbianism" and noted that "Dr. Paul Cameron has repeatedly campaigned for the abrogation of the civil rights of lesbians and gay men, substantiating his call on the basis of his distorted interpretation of this research."7 The resolution formally charged an ASA committee with the task of "critically evaluating and publicly responding to the work of Dr. Paul Cameron."At its August, 1986 meeting, the ASA officially accepted the committee's report and passed the following resolution: The American Sociological Association officially and publicly states that Paul Cameron is not a sociologist, and condemns his consistent misrepresentation of sociological research. Information on this action and a copy of the report by the Committee on the Status of Homosexuals in Sociology, "The Paul Cameron Case," is to be published in Footnotes, and be sent to the officers of all regional and state sociological associations and to the Canadian Sociological Association with a request that they alert their members to Cameron's frequent lecture and media appearances."8# In August, 1996, the Canadian Psychological Association adopted the following policy statement: The Canadian Psychological Association takes the position that Dr. Paul Cameron has consistently misinterpreted and misrepresented research on sexuality, homosexuality, and lesbianism and thus, it formally disassociates itself from the representation and interpretations of scientific literature in his writings and public statements on sexuality.# Cameron's credibility was also questioned outside of academia. In his written opinion in Baker v. Wade (1985), Judge Buchmeyer of the U.S. District Court of Dallas referred to "Cameron's sworn statement that 'homosexuals abuse children at a proportionately greater incident than do heterosexuals,'" and concluded that "Dr. Paul Cameron...has himself made misrepresentations to this Court" and that "There has been no fraud or misrepresentations except by Dr. Cameron" (p.536).9Paul Cameron Bio and Fact SheetSorry, but you quoted yet another example of anti-gay attack which compromised scientific integrity and honesty.

In addition to the group of physicians who presented their findings to Parliament in a referenced brief last week (see LifeSiteNews.com coverage Same-Sex ‘Marriage’ a Health Risk Doctors Warn Parliamentarians ), two other doctors have approached LifeSiteNews.com to submit evidence but requested anonymity based on fear of retribution from homosexual activists.The doctors noted that they are concerned for individuals practicing dangerous homosexual sex practices but also for society in that the normalization of such sex practices through same sex ‘marriage’ legislation will result in a major added burden on health care.“Legalization of same sex marriage by the government would give the false message that homosexual sex practices, such as anal intercourse, as long as ‘practiced safely’, are not endangering the health of the partners,” said Dr. C.Providing rather explicit details which she felt the public must be aware of, she explained, “Anal intercourse causes abrasions of the relatively fragile rectal wall, especially in the receptive partner.

I cannot either biologically give birth or become pregnant. I am 54 years old. I am a parent, however. Most lesbians of reproductive age can become pregnant and give birth. Most gay men of reproductive age can be biological fathers. Many adults of any sexual orientation can be adoptive parents. The intention of marriage is not necessarily to begin a family with children. Older people frequently marry long past the years when they may have raised children. It's dangerous to suggest that only people who are able to bear children biologically should be permitted to marry. You would then be excluding millions of people from marriage who are permitted to marry now. When you pretend to be fair in excluding gay people from equal treatment under the law by dreaming up nonsensical rationalizations for this exclusion, you end up advocating unfair treatment for lots of people, not just gay people.

I would think the percentage of sterile men or women in a hetero marriage who can never have kids is probably pretty close to the % of people in the general population who are gay. So I don't think your point is valid Winny.

That's not reality. It will never happen. All you are saying is that it takes a male and a female to reproduce in nature. What does marriage have to do with it? One could have reproduction without any marriage, without love. Would the fact that the couple reproduced mean their marriage is safe and good, and they will never be unhappy and seek a divorce? Marriage must perform functions other than putting a penis in a vagina and hoping the egg fertilizes, and the fertilized egg implants.

Marriage is about reproduction and raising of children. It is about parents, it is about children. That is the reason for it. It is a about family and about society.It is the sanctioned way by society to reproduce in a society, to breed and raise children and imbue them with the values and customs of society.That is why a so called "marriage" where reproduction is an impossibility by normal means it is not really a marriage in the traditional sense. It is an aberration, a parody but not the real thing. Why don't you call it something else? why the pretense that is a normal marriage? No matter what you say, normal people (heterosexuals) will tolerate what you do, I do but to call it 'marriage'? No way JoseOf course some married couple are infertile and some do not wish to have children. But at least each member is of the opposite sex.

Then you said, oh, but marriage is fine for infertile heterosexual couples and for heterosexual couples who choose not to have children. Which contradicts your earlier point.

Once again I will post the rules I could except if marriage is trully about children.1 If marriage is limited to a man and a women they need to submit proof of fertility to get a license.2 they must have a child within a year for the liscense being grated or the license must be surrendered3 there can not be any divorce the couple must remain together for the child's welfare.4 once the children are grown or if the child dies then the license must be surrendered.5 only breeding age men and women will be permitted licenses.6 proof of consummation, by video or Affidavit of 3 Witnesses must be kept on file at the court house.7 the license must be renewed, much as a driver license is, with tests of parental fitness every 2 years. If found unfit the license is surrendered along with the children.8 No one may have children with out a marriage license.I could live with this my sense of equality would be sated since there would also be heterosexuals excluded from marriage.

<flush>God doesn't accept illicit gay sex sin.And what did Jesus try to tell carnal sinners? REPENT? Where's the repentance?So don't give me that "God accepts gay marriage, etc." garbage. That's the liberal left chanting that, not God.Doctors Say Legalizing Same-Sex Marriage Will Give False Impression Gay Sex is SafeOTTAWA, February 18, 2005 (LifeSiteNews.com) – The looming legalization of same-sex marriage has pushed several doctors to begin speaking out on the harmful medical consequences of homosexual sex. In addition to the group of physicians who presented their findings to Parliament in a referenced brief last week (see LifeSiteNews.com coverage Same-Sex ‘Marriage’ a Health Risk Doctors Warn Parliamentarians ), two other doctors have approached LifeSiteNews.com to submit evidence but requested anonymity based on fear of retribution from homosexual activists.The doctors noted that they are concerned for individuals practicing dangerous homosexual sex practices but also for society in that the normalization of such sex practices through same sex ‘marriage’ legislation will result in a major added burden on health care.“Legalization of same sex marriage by the government would give the false message that homosexual sex practices, such as anal intercourse, as long as ‘practiced safely’, are not endangering the health of the partners,” said Dr. C.Providing rather explicit details which she felt the public must be aware of, she explained, “Anal intercourse causes abrasions of the relatively fragile rectal wall, especially in the receptive partner. The penetration of E.coli, always present in the stool, and other bacteria, viruses and parasites penetrate through such lesions into the deeper body tissues. This leads to the suppression of the immune system of such individuals even if there is no exposure to HIV. The immune suppression increases the risk to develop certain cancers, opportunistic infections, to which otherwise one would be resistant, and other health problems including the risk of premature death.”Information on the health risks of gay sex is available from the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association (GLMA). A survey by members of the GLMA released in August 2002 listed the main health problems affecting homosexual men. According to Christopher E. Harris, MD, GLMA President and Vincent M.B. Silenzio, MD, MPH, there are increased health risks for homosexual men.The most common health problems in homosexual men are:1. Increased incidence of infectious diseases - HIV/AIDS* - syphilis- gonorrhea- chlamydia - pubic lice - hepatitis A- hepatitis B- hepatitis C- anal papilloma2. Increased incidence of cancer especially- colon/rectal- prostate- testicular3. Increased incidence of eating disorders - bulimia- anorexia nervosa- obesity4. Increased incidences of other psychological problems- anxiety- depression- suicide5. Increased incidence of addiction problems especially - tobacco- alcohol- street drugs- amyl nitrates (poppers)See alsoPhysician Says Science of Medical Consequences of Homosexual Behaviour is Being Trumped by Political AgendaPhysician Says Science of Medical Consequences of Homosexual Behaviour is Being Trumped by Political Agendahttp://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2005/feb/05021811.html

So your conception of a "normal" woman is someone who has sex with men? For me to be "normal" by your standards would require me to go out and have sex with a man? Even though I have no desire to do this? How bizarre. I don't know what "normal" even means, but it's certainly not something I aspire to. "Normal" sounds to me like a synonym for bland, dull, uninteresting, like everyone else, lacking distinction, blah. Who wants to be blah? People differ from each other in many ways. Sexual orientation is just one form of variation among people. People's variations make them interesting. Variation makes life on this earth interesting. Why would you expect people to want to eliminate their positive characteristics that make them distinct and interesting?Same-sex marriage harms no one. Same-sex marriage serves to benefit families and children. There is every reason to legalize same-sex marriage and no good reason to ban it.

Why don't you investigate whether the claims are really true instead of relying on a light in your head, which may just be a bunch of stereotypes and prejudices lighting up?

Based on your posts, I suspect few women would want to have sex with you. But hey, maybe you have some good qualities that you haven't exhibited here yet. ;)

What about sheep? Maybe one that looks like a goat? (Little Prince reference) No but seriously just a sterotype. Should married couples who have children get divorced if one or both cannot/will not produce any more? Based on the rantings of the religious right 5000 - 10000 years of human social evolution dominated by male/female relationship as the bedrock of a stable morale society isn't doing to well. Would you say that overall world society is more or less stable than it was 500 years ago? Do you beleive that as a society we should not explore ways to improve our existance?A man/woman union is the traditional approach, most likely having to do with it being first the only option and later the only accepted option. Slavery, a flat earth, blood letting, turning a continent into a prison were all very popular and and within the range of normal, but were those things right and/or applicable to who and what we are today?

Depending on how you feel about same-sex marriage, the results of a Gallup poll released this morning might surprise you, or seem to state the obvious.The poll's big finding is that 57 percent of Americans currently oppose making same-sex marriages legal – essentially the same number as last year. And support for those marriages appears to have stalled at 40 percent, after peaking at 46 percent in 2007.But demographically, things get a bit more complicated: youngsters (18-to-29-year-olds) favor gay marriage 59 percent to 37 percent. Perhaps predictably, a majority of every older age group oppose same-sex marriage (with increasing margins; 66 percent of those past 65 oppose it). The obvious conclusion? The future belongs to same-sex marriage supporters, demographically speaking.From Gallup's release on the poll results:The lack of change in public opinion on same-sex marriage seen in the new USA Today/Gallup poll occurs in an environment in which an increasing number of states have taken steps to legalize such unions. Same-sex marriages are now legal in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maine, and Iowa, and will be legal in Vermont in September.On Tuesday, California's Supreme Court refused to add that state to the list, by upholding the Proposition 8 referendum, approved by voters, that banned same-sex marriage in the state. The referendum was put on the November 2008 ballot in response to an earlier court decision that allowed same-sex couples to legally marry in California.Among major demographic or attitudinal subgroups, self-identified liberals show the greatest support for legal gay marriage at 75% in the May 7-10 poll. By contrast, only 19% of conservatives think same-sex marriages should be legally valid.Just a slim majority (55%) of Democrats approve of gay marriage, but they are more likely to do so than independents (45%) and Republicans (20%).—Jeremy GantzThe Raw Story Majority of Americans oppose gay marriage

The change is coming, as older people like me die off and younger people become active voters. The change is coming faster than I had ever anticipated. Same-sex marriage is already a reality. It may not become a reality in all states in my lifetime, but it is a reality in more states now than I ever expected in so short a period. I think that when voters go back to amend the California constitution again, to once again legalize same-sex marriage there, the marriage equality side will win. The more publicity and exposure the issue gets, the more people think about it, and the more they realize that arguments against legalizing same-sex marriage make no sense. Btw, in 1967, the year that the Supreme Court struck down state laws barring inter-racial marriage, a Gallup poll showed that 72% of Americans surveyed opposed inter-racial marriage. A greater percentage of Americans today support same-sex marriage than supported inter-racial marriage in the year it was legalized nationwide.

If they are smart they will try to find some way to amend it that will make it harder to change it back again. As it stands, it's pretty easy to amend that constitution and another form of Prop 8 could just be put back into place after prop 8 is undone. They could craft a second amendment making it harder to amend it in the future, or something of the sort.

Since I don't live in California, I don't know enough about amending the California constitution to say more about this. It seems to me that changing the process for amending the state constitution might actually be a revision of the constitution, and this may have to go through the legislature. But I don't know. Meanwhile, there is an interesting story in the NYTimes today about the federal lawsuit being filed by the two lawyers who duked it out in Bush v. Gore back in 2000. They have teamed up to file a suit challenging the California constitutional marriage ban as a violation of the 14th amendment of the U.S. constitution. The article quotes lawyers and equality activists who have labored long for equal marriage rights. They are concerned that these two famous lawyers and their plaintiffs have jumped in at the wrong time to file a federal lawsuit. Here is a link to the article: http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/28/us/28marriage.html?hp
