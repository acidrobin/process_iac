ESPN Magazine Writer Chris Broussard's Comments

I wonder if people ever stop to think that when the bible was written homosexuality may have been a sin, but we have come to a new understanding of homosexuality that was not available at the time the bible was written. Understanding that the bible may have been inspired by god according to Christian belief, it is still the work of men who had little or none of the understanding we have today of the science of sexuality.Many of the assertions in the bible have been abandon or reconfigured as we learn more about the world we love in through science. Could it be possible that this is just another assertions that how been discovered by science to not make as much sense as it use to?It seems to me, and others, that we tend to come up with our assumptions than look and seek backing for them in the bible, what would happen if we reversed the process? WOuld out conclusions be the same? Myabe for some they would but others may realize that they use the bible to back their own assertions rather than using the bible to give them assertions and using life and science to back them and make them real.....Just a thought....

Also on that story...Hardaway apologized for his comments, which came a week after John Amaechi became the first former NBA player to say he was gay."As an African-American, I know all too well the negative thoughts and feelings hatred and bigotry cause," Hardaway said Thursday in a statement issued by his agent. "I regret and apologize for the statements that I made that have certainly caused the same kinds of feelings and reactions."I especially apologize to my fans, friends and family in Miami and Chicago. I am committed to examining my feelings and will recognize, appreciate and respect the differences among people in our society," he said. "I regret any embarrassment I have caused the league on the eve of one of their greatest annual events."http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/200...ks.ap/?cnn=yes

"he knows I believe he needs to change his lifestyle.""are saying I must change my entire belief system/religion"So, it's fine for Broussard to want others to change, but not for others to want Broussard to change? That's a pretty obvious double standard he's promoting there. If he wants to think that homosexuality is wrong and sinful, that's his right. If he wants to go about expounding on those beliefs, he can do that too. And if people want to think he's unenlightened for holding those beliefs, and they want to say so, then they have that right as well. Broussard is outright saying that he has a problem with anyone saying that his views aren't progressive or enlightened, and yet he clearly has no problem with saying that other people are immoral and sinners. I don't know exactly what "Those folks" have done, but if it's just talking, if it's just telling him that they think he's wrong, then he has no legitimate grounds for complaint. If you want to put your opinions out into the public sphere, than you have to deal with the fact that people may critisize them.For example:"That doesn't mean they're unenlightened. That just means their moral code doesn't fluctuate based on society's ever-changing standards."Enlightenment means to see the light, to come to a new awareness. Clinging to an old moral code tenaciously, despite anything that says you should be reexamining your position, is pretty much the epitome of unenlightenment. Refusal to even consider that you might be wrong, that your beliefs might not be correct, is unenlightened. If your thought process runs something like "My religion says X", and then stops, you are unenlightened. So those millions Broussard is talking about? Yeah, it's probably a safe bet that most of them aren't all that enlightened.

What he is saying is that the analogy is invalid...and he is correct.1)Michael Jackson is painting himself with bleach in an effort to look white.

Central to Enlightenment thought were the use and celebration of reason. For Enlightenment thinkers, received authority, whether in science or religion, was to be subject to the investigation of unfettered minds. In the sciences and mathematics, the logics of induction and deduction made possible the creation of a sweeping new cosmology. The search for a rational religion led to Deism; the more radical products of the application of reason to religion were skepticism, atheism, and materialism. The Enlightenment produced modern secularized theories of psychology and ethics by men such as John Locke and Thomas Hobbes, and it also gave rise to radical political theories. Locke, Jeremy Bentham, J.-J. Rousseau, Montesquieu, Voltaire, and Thomas Jefferson all contributed to an evolving critique of the authoritarian state and to sketching the outline of a higher form of social organization based on natural rights. One of the Enlightenment's enduring legacies is the belief that human history is a record of general progress.The noun Enlightenment has one meaning:Meaning #1: a movement in the 18th century that advocated the use of reason in the reappraisal of accepted ideas and social institutionsSynonym: Age of Reasonenlightenment IN BRIEF: The state of seeing or understanding clearly.Knowing other is wisdom, knowing yourself is enlightenment. — Lao Tzu (c.604-531 B.C.).Enlightenment Quotes: No one who has lived even for a fleeting moment for something other than life in its conventional sense and has experienced the exaltation that this feeling produces can then renounce his new freedom so easily. - Andre BretonIf I could define enlightenment briefly I would say it is the quiet acceptance of what is. - Wayne DyerI don't know Who -- or what -- put the question, I don't know when it was put. I don't even remember answering. But at some moment I did answer Yes to Someone --or Something --and from that hour I was certain that existence is meaningful and that, therefore, my life, in self-surrender, had a goal. - Dag HammarskjoldIn this world, which is so plainly the antechamber of another, there are no happy men. The true division of humanity is between those who live in light and those who live in darkness. Our aim must be to diminish the number of the latter and increase the number of the former. That is why we demand education and knowledge. - Victor HugoThe real meaning of enlightenment is to gaze with undimmed eyes on all darkness. - Nikos KazantzakisThe moment of truth, the sudden emergence of a new insight, is an act of intuition. Such intuitions give the appearance of miraculous flushes, or short-circuits of reasoning. In fact they may be likened to an immersed chain, of which only the beginning and the end are visible above the surface of consciousness. The diver vanishes at one end of the chain and comes up at the other end, guided by invisible links. - Arthur KoestlerEnlightenment must come little by little-otherwise it would overwhelm. - Idries ShahIn the Western philosophical tradition, enlightenment is seen as a phase in cultural history marked by a faith in reason, generally accompanied by rejection of faith in revealed or institutional religion.

Invalid! Error! Error! Good ole Michael actually has vitiligo, which causes a loss of pigment in the skin, making it lose its color. It was diagnosed by his dermatologist (he also has Lupus). You seem to have fallen for the old myth of him bleaching his skin.

"I'm a born-again, Bible-believing Christian (no, I'm not a member of the Religious Right). And I'm against homosexuality (I believe it's a sin) and same-sex marriage."LZ and I know where each other stand and we respect each other's right to believe as he does.I know he's gay, and he knows I believe that's a sin. I know he thinks I get my moral standards from an outdated, mistranslated book, and he knows I believe he needs to change his lifestyle. Still, we can laugh together, and play ball together.That's real diversity. Disagreeing but not being disagreeable.Since Amaechi came out, I've read lots of columns about being "progressive." The implication -- or outright assertion -- is that anyone who believes homosexuality is wrong is not progressive or enlightened.That's where this thing becomes problematic, because those who hold to that view are saying I must change my entire belief system/religion because of your belief system.Where's the diversity in that?Those folks don't want diversity. They want everyone to agree with their "enlightened" opinion.Look, I'll accept your right to have your own belief system and to live as you please, but I'm not changing mine. Diversity is not just accepting alternatives to what has long been perceived as normal, but it's accepting the significant number of people who hold to long-standing "traditional" beliefs as well.Millions of Christians who follow the Bible -- and Muslims who follow the Koran and Jews who follow the Torah, as well as many nonreligious Americans -- believe homosexuality is wrong.That doesn't mean they're unenlightened. That just means their moral code doesn't fluctuate based on society's ever-changing standards. As long as we're not being violent toward one another, as long as we can be civil, everything should be fine. We don't have to agree.And please don't compare being homosexual to being black. I consider that insulting to blacks for a number of reasons. The fact that some blacks make the comparison themselves only shows how crushed our racial esteem has become because of America's oppression (witness our insistence on calling ourselves the n-word).You can't hide your skin color, choose your skin color, change your skin color or switch your skin color back and forth. Some argue that you can't do that with your sexuality either, but there are many scientists on both sides of the genetic debate, and I believe a truly objective person would admit the biological evidence for homosexuality is far from definitive."More at ...http://insider.espn.go.com/espn/blog...roussard_chris

I don't get why either side thinks it matters much. There is evidence that many, many behaviors we see have genetic roots; including behaviors that are unacceptable to society. It is not like something being genetic necessarily matters one iota in terms of the morality the behavior associated with it. So it's just as strange that some feel proving gay-is-genetic will matter as it is strange that some feel that disproving it will matter. The moral issue of homosexual relations will go on regardless of the genetic debate, because quite frankly, one is not dependent on the other.

The evil side (religious right) cares because they contend it is a choice and hence one can change one's sexual orientation. If it is not a choice, the government has no business dealing with it. They compare it to alcoholism, criminality and any other nasty things that may volitionally be avoided. Any biological evidence negates that argument. The good guys only care because it proves the relionistas case invalid. The scientists care because it is fascinating science.That only leaves the nutjobs that maintain, choice or inherent trait, it is immoral and actually expect a major chunk of the population to remain celibate. That may be the looniest position of all.You don't understand why anyone cares? It isn't your life that is getting fooled with.

That's just not true. Even with your example of alcoholism, there is evidence that genetics plays a role. Biological evidence does not negate any argument there at all. Just because something is genetic doesn't mean there isn't freedom of choice. I'm simply saying that the genetic argument shouldn't matter either way because the moral issue exists independent of it.There's no need for getting defensive. I understand your life is "getting fooled" with. But we should be able to talk about logical merits here regardless of who's getting fooled with.

I think it does matter to the RR (although I agree it should not) because some have assumed in their hearts and minds that sin must always be a choice. That people who are gay CHOSE to be gay. That "gays will burn in hell", but if gays never chose to be gay, then what does that mean?That a "genetic" aspect would diminish their predispositions and lead them to question why God would make somebody genetically predisposed to "sin" in the first place.Also, I have repeatedly seen a pretense that issues of "civil rights protections" must always involve inherent or genetic attributes. Like if being black were a "choice", that would somehow mean it would be okay to discriminate against blacks because they could choose to be white.Pointing to religious civil rights protections often ends the conversation, but it seems that it ends the conversation but not their mistaken pretense.And on this front, it's a step to getting the RR to question their predispositions and question the basis of their conclusion of gay immorality.Also, from a secular morality front, there is that issue of discriminating against something innate being seen as more prevented than discriminating against something that is not innate.

I'm saying the analogy is invalid because it compares things which do not share similar characteristics regarding their connectability in an analogy. Skin color is definitely genetic...homosexuality is not.This is unrelated to genetics. The fact that I (or anyone else) can suppress bad habits does not mean that I do not want to practice them anymore. That does not make my previous actions genetically driven....and I have no idea why you can't immediately see that the analogy would be useless in your argument if people could choose the skin color. You'd be arguing that homosexuality is a choice.Do you need a tutor?Then please show a link to several of them.Please read above text one more time.No. You've not understood what I said. I don't know how to make it perfectly clear to you...the reason the skin color vs. homosexuality analogy is not valid is that one is in 100% of the cases studied a result of uncontrollable genetic inheritance and the other is generally not.Surely, you don't expect me to take your word for it...do you?...and I say it's 10% genetic and 90% choice...meaning that in 10% of the cases, the people can't change it and in 90% of the cases they can.I think it is very difficult, if not impossible to prove a negative.Pretty much my thoughts, too. Your relationship is not worthless...just different. Your relationship doesn't need to be recognized as a marriage. Don't make marriage worthless to the majority that wants to maintain what they have.Show some of it.Several professional papers with bibliograghies and credits, a NOVA special...about the same as it takes for me to believe that life in a jungle river depends of hippo dung. Show me some established FACTS!I believe I said I would change my view. I will change my view on the issue of whether homosexuality is genetic.Again is displayed a misunderstanding of analogies and connectability.Actually not.It should make a difference to you. If homosexuality is a genetic disorder, it should follow that we have more compassion toward those who have it. My current evaluation is that it is not genetic in 90% of the cases. That's an arbitrary number based totally on my personal experiences and observations throughout life.It's amazing how most of the gays on this forum think I am anti-gay. I am not.

I don't get why either side thinks it matters much. There is evidence that many, many behaviors we see have genetic roots; including behaviors that are unacceptable to society. It is not like something being genetic necessarily matters one iota in terms of the morality the behavior associated with it. So it's just as strange that some feel proving gay-is-genetic will matter as it is strange that some feel that disproving it will matter. The moral issue of homosexual relations will go on regardless of the genetic debate, because quite frankly, one is not dependent on the other.

I can understand this though, assuming its more about not wanting people to judge your penis rather than sharing a room with a dirty gay (though given the rest of the comments it wouldn't suprise me if it was more the latter). I think I'd feel a little awkward in a unisex shower room for the same reason.

And contrasting Chris Broussard's comments, a hate-filled response to the same NBA athlete coming-out ...Former Miami Heat superstar Tim Hardaway: "I hate gay people""The five time All Star was asked how he would deal with a gay teammate."First of all I wouldn't want him on my team," said Hardaway. "Second of all, if he was on my team I would really distance myself from him because I don't think that's right and I don't think he should be in the locker room when we're in the locker room."Le Batard took Hardaway to task, pointing out that his comments were 'flatly homophobic' and bigoted, but that only seemed to stir up the former point guard."Well, you know, I hate gay people," Hardaway said in response to Le Batard. "I let it be known I don't like gay people. I don't like to be around gay people. I'm homophobic. It shouldn't be in the world, in the United States, I don't like it."http://cbs4.com/local/local_story_045205258.htmlProfessional sports seems to be one of the last abodes of rampant and hateful homophobia as an acceptable thing.

No. I have merely dismissed the 'evidence' presented so far in this thread. Show me some real evidence.One written by a professional in the topic of the paper.

When I hear it coming only from members of the group that will benefit from such a revelation, I tend to disbelieve it.Where questions such as this are concerned, the only thing I can concede is that I was mistaken in believing it not to be true. Therefore, there is no circularism involved. If you present credible evidence that homosexuality is genetic, I will change my view (currently being that it is NOT). It's just that simple.I'm assuming you mean these points:On the first, I'm not familiar with the 'hundreds' of species that exhibit some form of homosexual behavior. Can you (or Mr Write) list them or provide a link to a source that lists them. I know of dolphins and one species of monkey. What are the others?On the second, I don't know that it's impossible to choose who you're attracted to. Can you present evidence of that...or is this statement supposed to suffice for evidence. Is it so just because you say so?On the third, I see nothing that connects with the argument. The "closet" may be built of shame.On the fourth, the testimony of gay people is not evidence. While all may say that they can't remember having a choice in the matter, it could still be that genetics had no part in their decision to identify as gay.On the last, a considerable of peer-reviewed scientific research has only been claimed here...it has not been presented. Present it!It has no derogatory connection to this conversation and is not a reflection of what I think of you. It simply means that I learned of the tremendous dependence upon hippo dung while watching a well researched NOVA program. Were it not for hippos pooping in the river, there would be no organisms eating that poop, no little fishes eating those organisms, no medium fishes eating the little fishes, no big fishes eating the medium fishes, no fish-eating birds eating fishes along the river.

I have moved no goalposts. I'm not insisting on a NOVA Special...just something that has the same type of evidence-backed statements. The only reason I mentioned NOVA is that their specials do not present opinions...they present well-studied FACTS.I just read one link (a Wikipedia thing..no less) proposed as proof of genetically driven homosexuality wherein the author states in his own conclusion that this is an invalid interpretation of his work.You are evidently still too wet behind the ears to understand what I am saying or to graduate beyond petty divergence.

I showed you a bunch. Did you ignore them? The first references twin studies. It even describes criticism of earlier studies, at least as far as the magnitude of the concordance.

If you truly believe that the NARTH website is a legitimate source of knowledge and in any way comparable to the kind of references I have provided, you and I have nothing to discuss. Our views of reality are too disparate.I shouldn't have said that information is dishonest and idiotic. That is an insult to liars and XXXXXX.

I don’t feel bad about stopping that interaction, it really isn’t debate.Folks like him and jyoshu just aren’t willing to admit they simply don’t like homos. I am sure they don’t have gay friends or interact with anyone gay in any real, human way. But, they do not want to see themselves as redneck ###-bashers – apparently they consider that uncool – so they try to intellectualize their indefensible positions. They fabricate these convoluted arguments, which get all the more mercurial as each point is effectively confronted, to justify pre-existing positions, so they can try to convince themselves they are not knuckle-draggers. They truly see themselves as reasonable guys! Whatever.What is amazing in these debates is what posters consider evidence. It really is as simple as being able to write a term paper, but perhaps that basic, if rigorous, scholarly skill escapes them. Prior to the availability of the enormous amount of data at our fingertips that is the Internet, people had to use libraries, where it was the librarians’ charge to screen out unreliable sources that purport to be objective. With the Net, we hear folks say, “Show me a link to back that up.” With great search engines, you can literally find “a link” that states ANYTHING. What makes it worse is the anti-science bias. While Jim’s source very loudly proclaimed its anti-gay position, and Jim thought it was OK that is was not “gay-friendly,” the implication being that scientific papers are inherently pro-gay, liberal and atheistic. The reality is that kind of politics (there are clearly academic and publishing politics, but they tend to balance out in the wash) is simply not a concern in scientific publications. The only reason science gets involved in politics is when is it attacked. This anti-intellectualism and opposition to real science, posing as an ostensible confrontation of political correctness, is what really saddens and scares me.

Yeah, don't feel to bad about stopping your debate with jimstrucking. I know from experience how frustrating and tiring it is to debate an opponent that constantly shifts goalposts with an almost religious fervor and beleives things like NARTH is a legitimate source for information. As I already intimated, you could riverdance naked in front of him while showing him the information, and he'd still not accept it or even admit that it has been given to him. I, too, recuse myself from this pointless debate with jims. To quote MrWriteLA:

Whoa there! I'm not even in your exchange with Jim. But since you've decided to pull me into this by using my name, I'll need to start responding. The reason I won't 'admit I don't like homos' is that you're wrong; I DON'T feel that way. I could care less about what you do or don't do, I see you no less or more than the next person. It's not about not-liking anyone, or liking them. Where the heck have I said I had gay friends? But so what if I do or don't? It wouldn't bother me if I did; they'd be my friend just like anyone else. You don't have a clue about me so why are you pulling me into your exchange with Jim, particularly on this exchange when I've stated that I have no problem with the idea that gay is genetic? Can you not READ? Can you not understand that I am NOT trying to prove to you that gay is not genetic? You're about as wrong about me as you claim I am about gays. Frankly, it sounds like you're just having a bad day here.

Your words have consistently expressed your intolerance of gays. To say you don't "care less" is in contrast with your strident anti-gay rhetoric. Just here, admitting you have no gay friends - that seems inconceivable to me. How can that possibly be? You must be deliberately keeping your friendships among straight folk for some reason. Stop pretending you are this reasonable and tolerant guy. Everyone has repeated posted that they don't buy that act. You really are just a few chapters and verses away from EZ. At least he proudly admits his bigotry.

FALSE!The "dissimilar characteristic" you are trying to state here is NOT THE ISSUE regarding the connectability in the analogy.Show me ANY PERSON who has promulgated a gay equality argument with an analogy that blacks and gays are similar in genetic aspects.ANYBODY...You know, it's funny that you make this claim, and then you link to a web-site that is titled "peoplecanchange".Would you mind explaining why you linked to that web-site if my argument "is unrelated to genetics"?Seems you want to have your cake and eat it too...I gave a reason why I saw it as irrelevant.EVEN IF being black were a choice, it would STILL be an invalid grounds for discrimination.Do you disagree?You didn't even bother to comment.On the flip side, you say "you have no idea why" but then COMPLETELY FAIL to explain any reason why black being a choice would be important here.You seem to be under the delusion that the black / gay comparison survives because being black is not a choice. Not true.In fact, I think you have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHY the analogy exists in the first place, and the grounds by which the analogy is made.If you LOOK at the arguments used in favor of black discrimination, and compare the arguments used in favor of gay discrimination, there is an AMAZING degree of overlap.Here, you claim "objects without similar characteristics", and then you COMPLETELY IGNORE THE SIMILARITY we are talking about in order to focus on a dissimilarity you want to talk about.By that technique, NO analogy would be valid. You could invalidate ANY analogy if all you had to do was point to a difference between the two.No. I have understood only PERFECTLY CLEAR what you have said.All you have done, in essence, is add "100%" to my statement. That's it.By the same ideology, ANY analogy between fish and birds could be invalidated because fish have gills. Birds have lungs. Fish have scales. Birds have feathers.Ergo, by your complete lack of comprehension and appreciation for what an ANALOGY is in the first place, you declare the analogy invalid.If somebody were to compare the migratory habits of birds and fish, ignoring the similarities, you would pipe up and say that it couldn't be done. No analogy could be used. Based on differences IRRELEVANT to the analogy.Surely I expected you to have a clue before you piped up...Since it has been abundantly clear that you don't even comprehend the point of comparison of the black / gay analogy in the first place, I apologize for my mistake and will correct for your lack of comprehension in the future...That is mind-numbingly simplistic, and without scientific basis.If you wanted to go that route, the amount of INDEPENDENT research on change would prove our "genetic" case.And on another note, just a few sentences ago, weren't you claiming that the capability to change was irrelevant to genetics??? emoticonXBanghead I can prove that the sun is not black by showing a picture of it where it is yellow.Likewise, if you can show ANY evidence from people showing how it is something other than genetic, that would be a start.I'll take it by your demure that you want to avoid that...

I'm saying the analogy is invalid because it compares things which do not share similar characteristics regarding their connectability in an analogy. Skin color is definitely genetic...homosexuality is not.This is unrelated to genetics. The fact that I (or anyone else) can suppress bad habits does not mean that I do not want to practice them anymore. That does not make my previous actions genetically driven....and I have no idea why you can't immediately see that the analogy would be useless in your argument if people could choose the skin color. You'd be arguing that homosexuality is a choice.Do you need a tutor?Then please show a link to several of them.Please read above text one more time.No. You've not understood what I said. I don't know how to make it perfectly clear to you...the reason the skin color vs. homosexuality analogy is not valid is that one is in 100% of the cases studied a result of uncontrollable genetic inheritance and the other is generally not.Surely, you don't expect me to take your word for it...do you?...and I say it's 10% genetic and 90% choice...meaning that in 10% of the cases, the people can't change it and in 90% of the cases they can.I think it is very difficult, if not impossible to prove a negative.Pretty much my thoughts, too. Your relationship is not worthless...just different. Your relationship doesn't need to be recognized as a marriage. Don't make marriage worthless to the majority that wants to maintain what they have.Show some of it.Several professional papers with bibliograghies and credits, a NOVA special...about the same as it takes for me to believe that life in a jungle river depends of hippo dung. Show me some established FACTS!I believe I said I would change my view. I will change my view on the issue of whether homosexuality is genetic.Again is displayed a misunderstanding of analogies and connectability.Actually not.It should make a difference to you. If homosexuality is a genetic disorder, it should follow that we have more compassion toward those who have it. My current evaluation is that it is not genetic in 90% of the cases. That's an arbitrary number based totally on my personal experiences and observations throughout life.It's amazing how most of the gays on this forum think I am anti-gay. I am not. I just state what I believe to be true. I'm actually more understanding of gay people than most think. My best friend is a lesbian.

I challenge you to show ANY scientific research which even hints that homosexuality is a choice.You have the gall to challenge the "genetic" aspect, and then toss out this lame attempt to back-door the idea that it's "choice"?

I bet!The difference is that your opposing viewpoint is a validly held opinion (as is mine) and your "scientific evidence" is invalid.Of course it's a legitimate source of knowledge. Your problem is that it debunks your claimed "evidence".Quite so! Reality remains the same though, regardless of our views of it. You have proved nothing except your own tenacity in holding on to a flawed analogy and a misguided conclusion drawn upon data that not only the author but others have shown to NOT support your argument concerning genetically driven homosexuality.Let's not be melodramatic.************************************************** ******Thank you for backing out. I asked you to do just that a few posts back. You tend to do nothing save parrot the sensible posters here rather than come up with challenging points anyway. Go grow a beard and come back swinging.************************************************** *****Somehow, I knew you'd post again.I do not recall either of us saying we don't like "homos" (as you have chosen to call yourself).How did you come to be sure that I have no gay friends? Search the forums and you will find several instances where I have revealed friendships with gays and lesbians. I repeat for you just one more time...my best friend is a lesbian.I am not into gay-bashing. I'd have to bash several friends if I were. What I am into is dispelling the ill-contrived opinion of many gays that there's some need to redefine marriage in order to guarantee equal rights for gay couples. This is simply NOT true. In arguing the position, you precipitate response based upon what you claim to be true. You claim an invalid analogy using blacks in the place of gays and I will point it out. You claim there is no choice in the matter, I will point to sources (whether you like them or not) that explain in no uncertain terms that that was never a logical conclusion to be drawn from the twin-studies or any other study made to date. There is no gay gene.I have fabricated nothing. As for getting mercurial, it is your side that brings up the hurdles (ie the bad analogy and the claim of genetic predisposition) that must be addressed in turn. Once we have settled the issues on these points, we can continue. Apparently I will have to come up with a more clear explanation of why the analogy doesn't fly. I don't see an impasse in the analogy issue. All I have to do is come up with an expanation you can undertstand. The genetics things is a bit more complicated. I contend (along with NARTH and at least one of the authors you cited) that a gay gene has not been found...yet you claim it exists. I have provided proof that it has not been found yet you blindly and without backup claim it has...so I think maybe we have reached an impasse here.My ability to reason based on precise logic has not diminished.Your idea that my argument is anti-intellectual or opposes real science is just as ridiculous as your apparent assertion that scientific studies should be affected by political correctness. That doesn't sadden or scare me ... it puzzles me....and NARTH is not anti-gay...they're just trying to promote the truth and clear the air regarding some false claims.************************************************** ****You got it!************************************************** ****You say in post #47 "I am sure they don't have any gay friends or interact..."...yet you say here that it is inconcievable that he has no gay friends. You are sure of something that is inconcievable? How does that work? LIke the analogy...it doesn't.************************************************** ***It is the only issue that invalidates its legitimate use in your argument. When you try to use the analogy in this thread, you are assuming the genetic cause of homosexuality exists as strongly as it does in the determination of skin color. This has not been proven. Do not claim something as evidence of your claim when the 'evidence' has not been proven.That's what has been happening here. You claim the analogy supports your cause...I say the analogy is invalid because skin color is 100% determined by genetics ( a proven fact )...homosexuality has not been proven to be 100% genetically imposed.I was referring to your immediately preceding statement...which I quoted. Read your quote that precedes my statement. The fact ex-gays may be just suppressing their desires, never changing to "heterosexual" at all is UNRELATED to genetics. I can suppress a bad habit, still want to partake of it and this means ABSOLUTELY NOTHING regarding whether the habit was inherited or chosen. You are pushing the "my genes made me do it" routine and I am pushing the "most people can change" routine. Life is great!There is no ground for discrimination against a law-abiding citizen.Oh, I completely understand why it was attempted.They've both been mistreated. This does not validate the analogy used in this thread.If the differences are indeed irrelevant to the analogy, they do NOT invalidate it. However, an analogy between birds and snakes regarding the laying of eggs is invalid except for the four or so species of snakes that do lay eggs (as does the coral snake) because all birds lay eggs, most snakes don't. Likewise, an analogy between birds and snakes regarding how they care for their young is invalid because of all the snakes...none of them nuture their young. An analogy between snakes and birds regarding variations in color IS valid because both exhibit a wide range of colorations. You have to consider the attributes of both entities when applying an analogy. The particular attribute in question for the analogy your side uses to support its argument is based on genetic determination. Skin color is a genetic thing...homosexuality has not been proven to be so. If and when it has, you are perfectly correct to use that analogy.Tell you what...we'll drop that issue until I can come up with a clearly understandable outline for its invalidness.I've already stated that those numbers are arbitrary guess on my part. It could be 20-80, 30-70, 40-60, 50-50 or something else. At this time, there is NO REASON to believe it is 100-0.No! I claimed it was UNRELATED to genetics.Proving that something does not exist is quite different from proving that something that does exist is not a certain color. That analogy ^^^^ won't work either. There is some evidence that it is not genetic in the links I posted.The links I posted suggest that it is a combination of things...just as I thoughtNowhere have I claimed it to be totally free of genetic influence. Neither have I claimed that it is all choice.

I explained why.You insist it would be important, yet upon being questioned you are incapable of explaining why....All you are doing is saying over and over that genetics is important to the analogy, saying it is your opinion that black being genetic and homosexuality's genetics being in dispute invalidates the analogy, while being thoroughly incapable of explaining why...< taps the mic >Is this thing on???I know what comment you were referring to.

I bet!The difference is that your opposing viewpoint is a validly held opinion (as is mine) and your "scientific evidence" is invalid.Of course it's a legitimate source of knowledge. Your problem is that it debunks your claimed "evidence".Quite so! Reality remains the same though, regardless of our views of it. You have proved nothing except your own tenacity in holding on to a flawed analogy and a misguided conclusion drawn upon data that not only the author but others have shown to NOT support your argument concerning genetically driven homosexuality.Let's not be melodramatic.************************************************** ******Thank you for backing out. I asked you to do just that a few posts back. You tend to do nothing save parrot the sensible posters here rather than come up with challenging points anyway. Go grow a beard and come back swinging.************************************************** *****Somehow, I knew you'd post again.I do not recall either of us saying we don't like "homos" (as you have chosen to call yourself).How did you come to be sure that I have no gay friends? Search the forums and you will find several instances where I have revealed friendships with gays and lesbians. I repeat for you just one more time...my best friend is a lesbian.I am not into gay-bashing. I'd have to bash several friends if I were. What I am into is dispelling the ill-contrived opinion of many gays that there's some need to redefine marriage in order to guarantee equal rights for gay couples. This is simply NOT true. In arguing the position, you precipitate response based upon what you claim to be true. You claim an invalid analogy using blacks in the place of gays and I will point it out. You claim there is no choice in the matter, I will point to sources (whether you like them or not) that explain in no uncertain terms that that was never a logical conclusion to be drawn from the twin-studies or any other study made to date. There is no gay gene.I have fabricated nothing. As for getting mercurial, it is your side that brings up the hurdles (ie the bad analogy and the claim of genetic predisposition) that must be addressed in turn. Once we have settled the issues on these points, we can continue. Apparently I will have to come up with a more clear explanation of why the analogy doesn't fly. I don't see an impasse in the analogy issue. All I have to do is come up with an expanation you can undertstand. The genetics things is a bit more complicated. I contend (along with NARTH and at least one of the authors you cited) that a gay gene has not been found...yet you claim it exists. I have provided proof that it has not been found yet you blindly and without backup claim it has...so I think maybe we have reached an impasse here.My ability to reason based on precise logic has not diminished.Your idea that my argument is anti-intellectual or opposes real science is just as ridiculous as your apparent assertion that scientific studies should be affected by political correctness. That doesn't sadden or scare me ... it puzzles me....and NARTH is not anti-gay...they're just trying to promote the truth and clear the air regarding some false claims.************************************************** ****You got it!************************************************** ****You say in post #47 "I am sure they don't have any gay friends or interact..."...yet you say here that it is inconcievable that he has no gay friends. You are sure of something that is inconcievable? How does that work? LIke the analogy...it doesn't.************************************************** ***It is the only issue that invalidates its legitimate use in your argument. When you try to use the analogy in this thread, you are assuming the genetic cause of homosexuality exists as strongly as it does in the determination of skin color. This has not been proven. Do not claim something as evidence of your claim when the 'evidence' has not been proven.That's what has been happening here. You claim the analogy supports your cause...I say the analogy is invalid because skin color is 100% determined by genetics ( a proven fact )...homosexuality has not been proven to be 100% genetically imposed.I was referring to your immediately preceding statement...which I quoted. Read your quote that precedes my statement. The fact ex-gays may be just suppressing their desires, never changing to "heterosexual" at all is UNRELATED to genetics. I can suppress a bad habit, still want to partake of it and this means ABSOLUTELY NOTHING regarding whether the habit was inherited or chosen. You are pushing the "my genes made me do it" routine and I am pushing the "most people can change" routine. Life is great!There is no ground for discrimination against a law-abiding citizen.Oh, I completely understand why it was attempted.They've both been mistreated. This does not validate the analogy used in this thread.If the differences are indeed irrelevant to the analogy, they do NOT invalidate it. However, an analogy between birds and snakes regarding the laying of eggs is invalid except for the four or so species of snakes that do lay eggs (as does the coral snake) because all birds lay eggs, most snakes don't. Likewise, an analogy between birds and snakes regarding how they care for their young is invalid because of all the snakes...none of them nuture their young. An analogy between snakes and birds regarding variations in color IS valid because both exhibit a wide range of colorations. You have to consider the attributes of both entities when applying an analogy. The particular attribute in question for the analogy your side uses to support its argument is based on genetic determination. Skin color is a genetic thing...homosexuality has not been proven to be so. If and when it has, you are perfectly correct to use that analogy.Tell you what...we'll drop that issue until I can come up with a clearly understandable outline for its invalidness.I've already stated that those numbers are arbitrary guess on my part. It could be 20-80, 30-70, 40-60, 50-50 or something else. At this time, there is NO REASON to believe it is 100-0.No! I claimed it was UNRELATED to genetics.Proving that something does not exist is quite different from proving that something that does exist is not a certain color. That analogy ^^^^ won't work either. There is some evidence that it is not genetic in the links I posted.The links I posted suggest that it is a combination of things...just as I thoughtNowhere have I claimed it to be totally free of genetic influence. Neither have I claimed that it is all choice.

I think the problem is that jim's appears to not know what an analogy is. He seems to beleive that an analogy means you say something like "blacks are being denied rights..." and then following it up with "just like when blacks used to be denied rights". According to his version of an analogy, you just have to repeat your first statement, not make any sort of actual comparison. It's rather sad when you think about it.

"I'm a born-again, Bible-believing Christian (no, I'm not a member of the Religious Right). And I'm against homosexuality (I believe it's a sin) and same-sex marriage."LZ and I know where each other stand and we respect each other's right to believe as he does.I know he's gay, and he knows I believe that's a sin. I know he thinks I get my moral standards from an outdated, mistranslated book, and he knows I believe he needs to change his lifestyle. Still, we can laugh together, and play ball together.That's real diversity. Disagreeing but not being disagreeable.Since Amaechi came out, I've read lots of columns about being "progressive." The implication -- or outright assertion -- is that anyone who believes homosexuality is wrong is not progressive or enlightened.That's where this thing becomes problematic, because those who hold to that view are saying I must change my entire belief system/religion because of your belief system.Where's the diversity in that?Those folks don't want diversity. They want everyone to agree with their "enlightened" opinion.Look, I'll accept your right to have your own belief system and to live as you please, but I'm not changing mine. Diversity is not just accepting alternatives to what has long been perceived as normal, but it's accepting the significant number of people who hold to long-standing "traditional" beliefs as well.Millions of Christians who follow the Bible -- and Muslims who follow the Koran and Jews who follow the Torah, as well as many nonreligious Americans -- believe homosexuality is wrong.That doesn't mean they're unenlightened. That just means their moral code doesn't fluctuate based on society's ever-changing standards. As long as we're not being violent toward one another, as long as we can be civil, everything should be fine. We don't have to agree.And please don't compare being homosexual to being black. I consider that insulting to blacks for a number of reasons. The fact that some blacks make the comparison themselves only shows how crushed our racial esteem has become because of America's oppression (witness our insistence on calling ourselves the n-word).You can't hide your skin color, choose your skin color, change your skin color or switch your skin color back and forth. Some argue that you can't do that with your sexuality either, but there are many scientists on both sides of the genetic debate, and I believe a truly objective person would admit the biological evidence for homosexuality is far from definitive."More at ...http://insider.espn.go.com/espn/blog...roussard_chris

I find it pretty funny that the ones that demand absolute scientific proof that homosexuality is genetic, are the same ones that blindly take the word of ancient, ignorant, superstitious people that the Bible is the word of God. The God of the Bible has not done one simple thing in the past 2000 years after being so involved with everything that happened on the earth during the times the Bible describes (well, he did put a stain on an office building here in Clearwater, Florida that looks like Mary in a shroud, I've heard of a stain on the floor of a subway station in Mexico City that 'looks' like Jesus).They know full well that nobody chooses to be gay.

Seriously. Genetic, hormonal, chemical, astrological, who cares? The bottom line is that you can't choose who you're attracted to; you can't choose to be striaght, gay, or bi, you simply are. It's really a silly debate, but sadly necessary to refute the "It's unnatural!!11!" folks. As if "natural" is even well defined or meaningful in this context. Perhaps that should be the refutation? Ignore the whole biological aspect and focus on the bad assumptions made in the accusation in the first place? Wearing clothes? Unnatural, but good. Hitting someone who makes you mad? Natural, but bad. Trying to attach any sort of meaningful value judgement to the term "unnatural" simply doesn't work, so why bother trying to decide if being gay is natural or not?

Is this your idea of liberal “tolerance”? If so it's not working. Liberal tolerance is not what it appears to be. It is a contradictory, partisan philosophical perspective with its own rigid set of dogmas. It assumes, for instance, a relativistic view of moral and religious knowledge. This assumption has shaped the way many people think about issues such as homosexuality, abortion rights, and religious truth claims, leading them to believe that a liberally tolerant posture concerning these issues is the correct one and that it ought to be reflected in our laws and customs. But this posture is often dogmatic, intolerant, and coercive, for it asserts that there is only one correct view on these issues, and if one does not embrace it, one may likely face public ridicule, demagogic tactics, and perhaps even legal reprisals. Liberal tolerance is therefore neither liberal nor tolerant.Open up your mind to other ideas, like Godly wisdom.

Yeah. Give Jyoshu a break. Because it's the GAYS we should be hammering and calling names like "immoral" and working towards insuring they continue to have less than equality! It's the GAYS' case we should be on!After all, isn't that what this whole message board section is about?It's THEM we need to ensure are subjugated to the closet...< end sarcasm >The issue is not "cowtowing to a politically correct mindset". Although I can understand why you want to pretend that is the issue.The issue is not just "having different ideas". The examples given are not about just having "different ideas".I can understand why you want to obfuscate this issue, but obfuscating the issue is part of the problem here. You are epitomizing the behavior that is being discussed.Ironic, huh?

Not quite. A circumstance bound method of interpreting morals into actions. As for religious knowledge, well that's obvious, everyone interprets religion differently, even you, whether you want to admit it or not. Apparently empirically based decisions are considered 'bad' to you. I find that very amusing. Again, I point you to Freakonomics where data guides decisions, not emotional appeals.Not really. The view is that many of the views are correct in the right situation. Applying ONE view ALL of the time REGARDLESS of the circumstances can be dangerous and hence as we try to mitigate the damage, we take action aganist the source of the danger. Furthermore, the view of absolutes uses public ridicule, demagogic tactics, legal reprisals and often violence to get what it wants. Absolutist extremism Islam is a perfect example of how a view that only one view is correct all of the time acts. It is amusing that the radicals of christanity are similar to the radicals of Islam.Depends on what you define as tolerance.

Blindly? That's horse pucky. You might want to study it sometime and open your eyes. As for scientific proof of homosexual genetics, that's a legitimate study. But science cannot replicate historical events or personal endeavors from antiquity. So your argument is a strawman.What would you know? Do you have his daily event log about what he's done or not done?You might rather consider the stain you've placed on your own soul with this juvenile, anti-Jesus bigotry.

I find it pretty funny that the ones that demand absolute scientific proof that homosexuality is genetic, are the same ones that blindly take the word of ancient, ignorant, superstitious people that the Bible is the word of God. The God of the Bible has not done one simple thing in the past 2000 years after being so involved with everything that happened on the earth during the times the Bible describes (well, he did put a stain on an office building here in Clearwater, Florida that looks like Mary in a shroud, I've heard of a stain on the floor of a subway station in Mexico City that 'looks' like Jesus).They know full well that nobody chooses to be gay.

They are literalists. Did you expect reason? What has always bothered me is that they expect people to buy a argument based on their faith on facevalue yet they don't do the same for other religions (real or otherwise). And worse, they don't seem to understand the problem there. C'mon. A 5 year old can see the logic contridiction, why can't they? Correction: The God of origin hasn't done anything since origin 15 billion years ago. Where God is now? Who's to say? But I would guess being a Deist and all that a letter it would send would be as follows:MemoTo: S**T I created 15 billion years ago.From: God (or whatever)Hi, as you can see I haven't been around for a long time. Frankly, I've been absent and the only reason i've sent you this message is to tell you to shut up. You're all so very loud. Please be quiet. And everything that has happened, happened without me. So stop blaming and stop crediting me. Now I might drop in a few billion years from now. Maybe. Don't count on it.

Flash forward about twenty-five years - San Francisco, CA - An activist Mayor, Gavin Newsom, taunts the State's voters and defiles both the rule of law and the sanctity of marriage as he cons thousands of "same-sex couples," including the corpulent Queen of crass herself, Rosie O'Donnell, into taking part in a number of mock weddings held in San Francisco's City Hall. Of course they weren't really married - but they sure seemed to have fun pretending.As a result of the concerted effort by liberals to mask the devastating effects of the gay lifestyle, many people are shocked to learn that the average life expectancy of a homosexual male is only about 45 years old - 30 years younger than that of a heterosexual male. One study determined that homosexual males have from between 20 to 106 sexual partners per year. It's no wonder that homosexual men account for over 50% of all hepatitis cases, and still account for over 50% of all AIDS cases despite the fact that they only make up 1-3% of the population. Homosexual men and women share a markedly increased risk of contracting nearly all forms of STD. The men frequently suffer from other sodomy related injuries, and are far more likely to be murdered (likely by another homosexual) than their heterosexual counterparts; this, due to the typically raucous and oft anonymous nature of the gay lifestyle. All of these things considered, and given that the cost to treat an AIDS patient averages nearly $350,000, the homosexual lifestyle shares responsibility, by no small measure, for this Country's skyrocketing health care costs. Fortunately, for those who wish to escape the homosexual lifestyle, there is support. A number of homosexual recovery organizations such as Exodus International and NARTH have helped thousands of people who have been addicted to homosexual behaviors, successfully leave the lifestyle. Many have gone on to have happy and fulfilled heterosexual marriages, to include the greatest of all blessings... children. But the militants don't want to hear it. In fact, they don't want you to hear it, and have proposed legislation to ban such recovery organizations claiming that any mention of homosexual recovery is "hate-speech." But it's predictable - any time anyone dare expose the aforementioned truths about the homosexual lifestyle, or criticize the homosexual lobby for its radical anti-marriage, anti-family agenda, there's an enormous backlash. It's an age-old tactic geared toward silencing one's critics. It consists primarily of the ad hominem atack - Homophobe! Hate-Monger! Bigot! Gay Basher!

Did you note the title of that propagandic article he quoted?"INTOLERANCE" WILL NOT BE TOLERATED! The Gay Agenda vs. Family Values1) I think all he did was go to a "conservative" web-site and search for an article that had "intolerance" and "gay" in it. Then posted it, pretending it meant something regarding anything.All it does is prove my earlier point in my very first response to him in this thread. He complains about people criticizing Jyoshu, but then fully supports criticizing gays in general. The sad part being that I see many of the same ol' lies in the article that he quoted that the anti-gays love to quote.And the article doesn't even have the courage to try and quote the "studies" directly. Not one citation...2) I always get a chuckle whenever the anti-gay right try to criticize others for something they excel at. Intolerance.We aren't asking that their rights be restricted. We aren't asking that their lives be limited in any way. (Although I notice the article includes blatant lies about THAT as well...)But it's OUR "intolerance" which needs to be criticized...3) You're right. He in no way answered my question.And you're also right in how Jyoshu's quote applies. It's the reason I put the quote in my signature line in the first place.I suspect the reason they really bugged him was that because deep down he KNOWS the truth behind them.(Ooops! Did I just insult Jyoshu by calling his quote the truth? emoticonXBanghead )

To respond to Easyrider's quoted article...Paragraph #1? Pure opinion / propaganda. About every fourth word is purely propaganda in action: activist, taunts, defiles, sanctity, cons, corpulent...We get you don't like gay marriage.My personal take on the situation is that Newsom did something courageous. He purposely broke a law to the question of the laws constitutionality to a head. To have the issue raised in court.Rosa Parks broke the law when she refused to ride in the back of the bus. It was an unjust law, and her actions brought the law to the courts to question it.And this starts the whole list of claimed facts with no substantiation.And gee. Doesn't this sound familiar as well...http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbo...eron_obit.htmlBarber is quoting Paul Cameron's work, demonstrating the fact that he has no problem quoting liars.Paul Cameron did research during the HEIGHT of the AIDS crisis where he took obituaries from "gay" publications, and compared to the national average, conveniently assumed to be "heterosexual"...The link above recounts the ridiculous inaccuracies in this technique.And it's well known amongst the scientific community that this technique is not accurate. The only conclusion one can reach by somebody still quoting such a "study" is that the person quoting it has no problem with duplicity.Another Paul Cameron study no doubt.A study in which he went to gay bars and gay bath houses to inquire about sexual partners.A bit like going to church to figure out how often people pray. It's not a representative sample.Around 47% of all people diagnosed with AIDS were probably infected with HIV through male-to-male sexual contact, while people exposed through heterosexual contact comprise around 17% of the total. Since the beginning of the epidemic, the number of heterosexual infections has increased dramatically. According to CDC estimates, heterosexual contact led to about one third of new AIDS diagnoses and one third of new HIV diagnoses in 2005.http://www.avert.org/usastatg.htmSo yes. Gays account for about half of all AIDS cases.But that's not the full story.The "half of all AIDS cases" means half of all the LIVING PEOPLE with AIDS.For NEW infections, it's a different story...Gays are improving their sexual habits, while straights are unfortunately picking up the slack. But this is overlooking another fact as well. The vast majority of gays do not have HIV or AIDS.Do the math for yourself. 5% of the population is gay. (Barber again plays with numbers when he tries to diminish the number to 1-3%.)About 300 million people, giving about 15 million gays.And doing the math we come out with about 3% of the gay population has HIV.Leaving 97% of the gay population without HIV.Should we condemn the entire 100% because of a disease that 3% has?PURE bullspit!1) Having sex with an infected partner is what causes STD risk.A straight man having unprotected sex with an infected prostitute has more risk from HIV than I do having unprotected sex with my monogamous partner.2) "frequently suffer"? "sodomy related injuries"? Another lie the religious right loves to spin.I have known NOBODY who has suffered from a "sodomy related injury".I have frequently looked for statistics on this, and never find any. If anybody can show me some, I would love to see them.When I take a shower in the morning, there is a possibility that I could slip and fall, cracking my head open and dying.The chance is so small, and easily mitigated by something like putting down a mat to improve traction.Likewise, the ACTUAL chance of sodomy injury is small, and can be made easier by a simple thing like lube...I would LOVE to see that substantiated with proof...But of course, none can be found anywhere in Barber's fiction work...Sigh. Another lie."helped thousands of people"?What ultimate b.s.!The VAST MAJORITY of people who attempt reparative therapy see no effect. In the end, they are still homosexual.Some see a temporary effect, much like somebody who tries something to quit smoking, and then starts up smoking again a couple of weeks later. But the reparative therapy groups count these as "successes".There are precious few independent studies of "reparative therapy" results. Primarily any claim of "success" will be coming from the reparative therapy groups themselves. Much like trusting a drug company to tell you what the effectiveness of their drug is, without an FDA to tell you the truth or to report the negative effects...From the available data, four studies reported a "success" rate during conversion therapy of 0.4%, 0.0%, 0.5 and 0.04%. That is, conversion therapy has a failure rate in excess of 99.5% during each study.http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_exod1.htmQuite frankly, I think any "therapy" organization SHOULD HAVE A LICENSE FOR PRACTICING.But WAYYYYY too many of these groups have none, and operate PURELY out of religious purview and reasoning.And don't get me wrong. If they want to operate out of religion, then they can do so as long as they DO NOT try to pretend it's "therapy" or "psychology" when it's not.People who use such organizations should know when it has no psychological training for personnel on the staff.Is that so hard?So Barber is doing BOTH LIES and PROPAGANDA now.We're not "anti-marriage". We like marriage so much we want to be a part of it.We're not "anti-family". We just want our own families to count too, whereas people like Barber want to see them illegal.Rrrriiiiggghhhhtttt....And what Barber did above was clearly not an ad hominem attack on gays, filled with blatant lies...< end sarcasm >This is the pot calling the silverware black!Especially considering at the end of his diatribe, Barber tosses out the "qveer" word...

This part really gave me a laugh: "far more likely to be murdered (likely by another homosexual)"? How about, far more likely to be murdered by christonazi bigots who constantly spew hatred and lies about gays? I'd really like to see how they came to that conclusion, and I bet if anyone were to do a study, they'd find hate crimes ending in murders by "christians" to be a far more prevelant cause of death among gays than other homosexuals.The most hilarious part was: "due to the typically raucous and oft anonymous nature of the gay lifestyle". I'd hate to tell them, but there ain't nothing gays do that heteros don't (and believe me, my fiance and I have done all of them). I know many hetero couples who often are more "raucous" in their "lifestyle" than most gays I know.

It was an unjust law, and her actions brought the law to the courts to question it.And this starts the whole list of claimed facts with no substantiation.And gee. Doesn't this sound familiar as well...http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbo...eron_obit.htmlBarber is quoting Paul Cameron's work, demonstrating the fact that he has no problem quoting liars.Paul Cameron did research during the HEIGHT of the AIDS crisis where he took obituaries from "gay" publications, and compared to the national average, conveniently assumed to be "heterosexual"...The link above recounts the ridiculous inaccuracies in this technique.And it's well known amongst the scientific community that this technique is not accurate. The only conclusion one can reach by somebody still quoting such a "study" is that the person quoting it has no problem with duplicity.Another Paul Cameron study no doubt.A study in which he went to gay bars and gay bath houses to inquire about sexual partners.A bit like going to church to figure out how often people pray. It's not a representative sample.Around 47% of all people diagnosed with AIDS were probably infected with HIV through male-to-male sexual contact, while people exposed through heterosexual contact comprise around 17% of the total. Since the beginning of the epidemic, the number of heterosexual infections has increased dramatically. According to CDC estimates, heterosexual contact led to about one third of new AIDS diagnoses and one third of new HIV diagnoses in 2005.http://www.avert.org/usastatg.htmSo yes. Gays account for about half of all AIDS cases.But that's not the full story.The "half of all AIDS cases" means half of all the LIVING PEOPLE with AIDS.For NEW infections, it's a different story...Gays are improving their sexual habits, while straights are unfortunately picking up the slack. But this is overlooking another fact as well. The vast majority of gays do not have HIV or AIDS.Do the math for yourself. 5% of the population is gay. (Barber again plays with numbers when he tries to diminish the number to 1-3%.)About 300 million people, giving about 15 million gays.And doing the math we come out with about 3% of the gay population has HIV.Leaving 97% of the gay population without HIV.Should we condemn the entire 100% because of a disease that 3% has?PURE bullspit!1) Having sex with an infected partner is what causes STD risk.A straight man having unprotected sex with an infected prostitute has more risk from HIV than I do having unprotected sex with my monogamous partner.2) "frequently suffer"? "sodomy related injuries"? Another lie the religious right loves to spin.I have known NOBODY who has suffered from a "sodomy related injury".I have frequently looked for statistics on this, and never find any. If anybody can show me some, I would love to see them.When I take a shower in the morning, there is a possibility that I could slip and fall, cracking my head open and dying.The chance is so small, and easily mitigated by something like putting down a mat to improve traction.Likewise, the ACTUAL chance of sodomy injury is small, and can be made easier by a simple thing like lube...I would LOVE to see that substantiated with proof...But of course, none can be found anywhere in Barber's fiction work...Sigh. Another lie."helped thousands of people"?What ultimate b.s.!The VAST MAJORITY of people who attempt reparative therapy see no effect. In the end, they are still homosexual.Some see a temporary effect, much like somebody who tries something to quit smoking, and then starts up smoking again a couple of weeks later. But the reparative therapy groups count these as "successes".There are precious few independent studies of "reparative therapy" results. Primarily any claim of "success" will be coming from the reparative therapy groups themselves. Much like trusting a drug company to tell you what the effectiveness of their drug is, without an FDA to tell you the truth or to report the negative effects...From the available data, four studies reported a "success" rate during conversion therapy of 0.4%, 0.0%, 0.5 and 0.04%. That is, conversion therapy has a failure rate in excess of 99.5% during each study.http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_exod1.htmQuite frankly, I think any "therapy" organization SHOULD HAVE A LICENSE FOR PRACTICING.But WAYYYYY too many of these groups have none, and operate PURELY out of religious purview and reasoning.And don't get me wrong. If they want to operate out of religion, then they can do so as long as they DO NOT try to pretend it's "therapy" or "psychology" when it's not.People who use such organizations should know when it has no psychological training for personnel on the staff.Is that so hard?So Barber is doing BOTH LIES and PROPAGANDA now.We're not "anti-marriage". We like marriage so much we want to be a part of it.We're not "anti-family". We just want our own families to count too, whereas people like Barber want to see them illegal.Rrrriiiiggghhhhtttt....And what Barber did above was clearly not an ad hominem attack on gays, filled with blatant lies...< end sarcasm >This is the pot calling the silverware black!Especially considering at the end of his diatribe, Barber tosses out the "qveer" word...

If my mayor was competent, educated, fisically conservative and had high levels of efficency and accountability he could be teabagging hookers on a monthly basis and I wouldn't care.Some of us place good governance and competency above what one does in their private lives. Others like EZ would rather have a highly moral incompetent XXXXX who regularly screwed things over and sold people out. emoticonXGood

This part really gave me a laugh: "far more likely to be murdered (likely by another homosexual)"? How about, far more likely to be murdered by christonazi bigots who constantly spew hatred and lies about gays? I'd really like to see how they came to that conclusion, and I bet if anyone were to do a study, they'd find hate crimes ending in murders by "christians" to be a far more prevelant cause of death among gays than other homosexuals.The most hilarious part was: "due to the typically raucous and oft anonymous nature of the gay lifestyle". I'd hate to tell them, but there ain't nothing gays do that heteros don't (and believe me, my fiance and I have done all of them). I know many hetero couples who often are more "raucous" in their "lifestyle" than most gays I know.

From what I hear, gay porn is pretty boring (not that I'm not disgusted). Ez should watch some straight porn if he wants to see some pretty ridiculous ****.
