In a recent issue of Science, there was an essay regarding the old peppered moth case for natural selection. If you remember, the story involves pollution due to heavy industry blackening trees. Moths that were darker, and therefore more camouflaged against the darkened trees, were less likley to be eaten by predatory birds and go on to reproduce. This was though the explanation as to why the number of dark peppered moths within the population had increased over time, a prime example of Darwinian natural selection.Here is the article.

His mother can recall the exact moment: It was late summer, and he caught his first butterfly--a red admiral resting on a white chrysanthemum--with his bare hands. From that point on, he was hooked. At night when other children were in bed, the young Majerus roamed the English countryside tending his moth traps. Now 50 and in his 25th year of teaching evolutionary genetics at the University of Cambridge, Majerus still runs his moth traps most nights.Majerus's research has focused on sexual selection, sex-ratio manipulation, and the evolution of melanism (the darkening of body color) in various moths, butterflies, and ladybirds. But over the past few years, half of his working life has been occupied by one controversial species, the peppered moth, Biston betularia, and an infamous study that's been attacked by both evolutionary biologists and anti-evolutionists.Through his research, Majerus found himself embroiled in the scientific debate over the evolutionary forces behind melanism in the peppered moth. Experiments by British lepidopterist Bernard Kettlewell in the 1950s claimed to show that bird predation, coupled with pollution, was responsible for a color shift in the moth population. But problems with Kettlewell's methodology led some scientists to doubt his conclusions. Majerus was not the first to point out the flaws, but by doing so, he inadvertently set off a wave of anti-evolutionist attacks. While acknowledging that Kettlewell made mistakes, Majerus believes Kettlewell was right in his conclusions and has taken it upon himself to prove it.Easy prey? Critics challenged the view that the moth population grew darker because birds were more likely to see and devour light individuals.CREDITS: M. MAJERUS (photo caption)As Majerus shows off some of the roughly 100,000 peppered moth pupae he'll rear for his latest experiment, it's clear that he's prepared to go to great lengths to make his case. Once the moths begin to emerge in May, Majerus begins a daily grind. He releases them at dusk and gets up at dawn to observe their fate: counting how many are plucked from their resting places by birds, and how many survive to see another night. He will continue this routine into August, as he has done for the past three summers. All he needs, he reckons, is another 2 years' worth of data--a total of some 4000 moth observations--to settle the controversy over whether bird predation is the major selective force in favoring one color form of the peppered moth over another.Small and unobtrusive, the peppered moth doesn't look like the star in an evolutionary drama. But the rise and fall of the almost-black melanic form (carbonaria) in tandem with changing pollution levels has become the most famous example of evolution in action. Through his pioneering experiments, Kettlewell claimed to have demonstrated that melanic peppered moths were more common in industrialized areas because they escaped the attention of predatory birds when resting against soot-blackened, lichen-free bark. Because more of the darker ones survived to produce the next generation, he argued, entire populations grew darker.But doubts emerged over Kettlewell's methodology in recent decades as researchers failed to replicate some of his results. His predation experiments were chiefly criticized for their artificiality: He placed the moths on exposed parts of trees in broad daylight, when they don't normally fly, rather than allowing them to settle naturally; he released them in large numbers, thereby inflating moth densities and possibly creating a magnet for predatory birds; and he used a mixture of lab-reared and wild-caught moths without checking to see whether they behaved the same way. Majerus summarized these criticisms in a book on the evolution of melanism in 1998 and stated that the simplified textbook story of the peppered moth was inaccurate, while asserting that Kettlewell's conclusions were qualitatively sound. Majerus had no idea at the time what a furor his book would cause.Jerry Coyne--a highly respected evolutionary geneticist at the University of Chicago--concluded in his review of Majerus's book in the 5 November 1998 issue of Nature that "for the time being, we must discard Biston as a well-understood example of natural selection in action, although it is clearly a case of evolution." Coyne's words carried weight, and the anti-evolutionists were quick to twist them into an argument against natural selection itself. "Coyne might have just thought he was stirring things up. ... As it happened, he was the lightning conductor," observes Mark Ridley, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Oxford. Coyne thought the flaws in Kettlewell's experiments were sufficient to cast doubt on the idea that bird predation was the agent of natural selection in this case, although he says his "biological intuition is that predation is probably a major cause."Majerus dismisses most critics of the bird predation hypothesis as being people who write about the peppered moth without having a "feel for the organism." Many biologists start with theories and then test them in the field. Majerus takes the opposite and less fashionable approach: "There's another way of doing science, which is first find your organism and look at it incredibly closely, for a long time, in great detail and see what questions it asks you," he says.Colleagues describe Majerus as a brilliant natural historian and a great communicator. He's made numerous appearances on radio, on television, and in the popular press, and he's on the circuit as an after-dinner speaker. "He doesn't have to try very hard to get a lot of people interested in what he's saying," says former graduate student Matt Tinsley. "Mike likes having a small crowd of students around him and telling stories."Moth man.

PROFFITT/SCIENCE (photo caption)It's a talent Majerus hopes to put to good use in defending the reputation of Kettlewell and the peppered moth in a road show, which he aims to take around Britain--and possibly the United States--later this year. He is motivated by growing concern over attacks on Kettlewell's character, most notably writer Judith Hooper's scathing account of the men behind the peppered moth story in her 2002 book Of Moths and Men: The Untold Story of Science and the Peppered Moth, which helped fuel an anti-evolutionist campaign to remove Biston from school textbooks. "A lot of [the campaign] is pointed at the peppered moth as being the example that Darwinism is debunked," says Majerus, who wants to make a public stand against teaching creationism and "intelligent design" in biology classes. "To have people believe the biology of the planet is controlled by a Creator, I think that's dangerous."After decades of moth-watching, Majerus is convinced that Kettlewell was right and that bird predation is the primary agent of natural selection on the peppered moth. "But that can never be enough," he says, "because I'm also a scientist. ... We're miles beyond reasonable doubt, but it's not scientific proof."Majerus's experiment is designed to avoid the mistakes Kettlewell made when comparing the proportion of typical and melanic peppered moths that escape the attention of predatory birds. He's releasing a small number of moths, at night, and letting them choose their own hiding places within specially designed mesh sleeves, which he removes at dawn. Like Kettlewell, he's using a mixture of lab-reared and wild-caught moths, but his design allows him to test for potential differences between the two. Majerus is determined to get "a definite answer" on the bird predation issue.Although Majerus expects to confirm Kettlewell's conclusions, he claims not to care which way the results go: Any findings, he thinks, would make a splash by settling the controversy. But peppered moth expert and evolutionary geneticist Bruce Grant of the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, doubts that Majerus will silence the critics. "To do the job the right way is going to be too labor-intensive and it's just not worth it. ... Right now, I think there are other things that need doing more."Time is running out for studying the melanic peppered moth, which, with declining pollution levels, is expected to make up only 1% of the British peppered moth population by 2019. And for Majerus, there are other fish to fry: "I don't want to get stuck with peppered moths for the rest of my career," he says, but he doesn't see his bug obsession waning anytime soon.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Notice that they said that the number of dark peppered moths is decreasing along with a decrease in pollution levels.Would any creationists like to challenge anything about this article or the concept?

New peppered moth stuff

To apathy:Call me crazy, but I still don't see any evolution in the peppered moths!! We had light and dark moths before the industrial revolution, we now still have light and dark moths. The only thing that has changed is the population ratio, assumably by *natural selection*. Natural selection is not proof of evolution by any means. Creationists recognise it and accept it as it goes in nicely with the creationary model. Natural selection is basically the death of a particular type of animal if they are unsuited to the environment. In a given environment (e.g. a very cold region), some (e.g. the long-haired dogs) will be more likely to survive, and so pass on their information, than others. Natural selection can favour some sets of information above others, and can eliminate some of the existing information in the population, but it can't create any new information. An example, consider the cold environment mentioned above. We take a population of both long, short and medium, haired dogs to this environment. Over time, very short time, the population will only consist of the long haired dogs as the short and medium haired dogs would freeze and be wiped out by the cold conditions. So, as a result, the population as a whole has lost the information for making short haired dogs and has not gained any new information. What did we have when we first took the dogs to the environment? Dogs (varying in hair sizes). What did we get after a short amount of time? Dogs (only the long hair size). There is no evolution occuring here, we had dogs before, dogs after. The only difference is that the gene for making short hair has been eradicated from the population by natural selection -- that is it. This is the essense of natural selection - and goes in nicely with the Biblical account of our origins, i.e. variation within a kind and that kind's have the ability to only lose information - not gain it.So even if the peppered moth case was really true, and not a fraud, it still would not be evidence for evolution as opposed to creation. Anyone who says other wise, does not really know what they are talking about unless new genetic information is somehow being added to the moth's total DNA content, i.e. their genome, in which case you might have a point.Would any creationists like to challenge anything about this article or the concept? His method appears to be good, i.e. using observations and experimental data, as well as repeatability. He is using the scientific method (in reverse as he is collecting the observations and experimental data and then will draw a conclusion based on the evidence and possibly his own bias. This is yet to be determined, however. Can you keep us informed of his progress? Just to finish off:Majerus's research has focused on sexual selection, sex-ratio manipulation, and the evolution of melanism (the darkening of body color) in various moths, butterflies, and ladybirds.  I do not know all that much about peppered moths, just the story and why it is a fraud and even if it was not, why it does not support evolution over creation. But perhaps the darkening of teh body colour can be explained by the varriation within a kind?

Also another example put forward is a bacteria that can only sustain itself by eating Nylon. The theory goes - nylon is a recent invention therefore this bacteria must have eolved recently.What it suggests however is that a portion of an existing population would have died if not for nylon... the bug has to have nylon, or it will die.It is akin to looking at a portion of the human population who would die from heart-trouble. But thankfully we've now got artificial hearts, therefore this portion can survive. They are not a new species of human, but live only because of a recent invention.

Hello, Nu Leader.Nor was the peppered moth example ever meant to "prove" evolution. One important part of the theory of evolution is the hypothesis that natural selection is the major driving force behind it. So, the peppered moth observations were meant to show that natural selection can have a significant effect on the relative frequency of genotypes.Incidentally, I am interested in your comment that natural selection is consistent with creationism. It was Darwin who first proposed that natural selection can be the major force driving the evolution of species. Creationists pretty much tried to discredit natural selection for over a century. It was only after scientific evidence was presented that showed decisively that natural selection was, indeed, a major contributor to evolution that creationists were finally forced to accept it.I would be interested in know who was the first creationist to finally accept that natural selection is a real phenomenon, and when they accepted it.

Almost all textbooks on evolution include the peppered moth as the classic example of evolution by natural selection.http://www.clcoc.org/news/peppered.htm"The peppered moth, Biston betularia (L.), is one of some 20,000 moth species found in the United Kingdom. It became a famous example of evolution by means of natural selection. after the Industrial Revolution. The typica variety of the moth is white with black speckles and is a striking lichen mimic."http://wiki.cotch.net/wiki.phtml?title=Peppered_mothFor years the story of the peppered moth, Biston betularia, has provided one of the best-known examples of natural selection in action.http://www.millerandlevine.com/km/evol/Moths/moths.htmlAlthough I failed High School biology I do remember that the peppered moth was given to us as an example of evolution at work. And it didn't show anything about the frequency of genotypes, because the population has been producing the same moths. If all you can show that a moth population changes colour, then again, then back again how is this anything remotely like evolution?It is still being taught...http://www.bethtfiloh.com/biology9pepperedmoth.htmBut it doesn't explain much."Most biologists, however, believe that natural selection is responsible, though no one knows what traits are being selected or what factors in the environment are doing the selecting."http://www.arn.org/docs/wells/jw_pepmoth.htmAnother look into this is given at...http://www.talkdesign.org/faqs/moonshine.htmAll that has been observed is that the population changed colour. They don't even know why. Despite this, misleading statements such as ..."The peppered moth (Biston betularia (L.)) is a temperate species of night-flying moth notable for its evolution of industrial melanism."http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Peppered-mothare continually spread. (http://www.millerandlevine.com/km/evol/Moths/moths.html) Cited above argues quite well that we still don't know why - all an evolutionist can say is 'it happened', and 'it happened by evolution'.It is akin to Darwin giving examples of 'natural selection' by referring to how man breeds animals. In other words, his evidences for natural selection comes from non-natural, purpose driven selection.Darwin said "There is no reason why the principles which have acted so efficiently under domestication should not have acted under nature. In the survival of favoured individuals and races, during the constantly-recurrent Struggle for Existence, we see a powerful and ever-acting form of Selection."http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/Origin/origin_15.htmlThe phrase 'survival of the fittest' was not even Darwin's. It was urged on him by Wallace, the codiscoverer of natural selection, who hated 'natural selection' because he thought it implied that something was doing the selecting. Darwin coined the term 'natural selection' because had made an analogy with 'artificial selection' as done by breeders, an analogy Wallace hadn't made when he developed his version of the theory. The phrase 'survival of the fittest' was originally due to Herbert Spencer some years before the Originhttp://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolphil/tautology.htmlAnd this sort of thing continues today in modern textbooks."From time to time, attacks on neo-Darwinism are mounted, usually by persons who either see evolutionary theory as antireligious or who basically misunderstand Darwin's theory. One attack, entitled "Darwin's Mistakes," by Tom Bethell, was published in Harper's magazine.Bethell began by pointing out that Darwinian theory is a tautology rather than a predicative theory. (The term tautology means a statement that is true by definition.)* That is, evolution is the survival of the fittest. But who are the fittest? Obviously, the individuals who survive. Thus, without an independent criterion for fitness, other than survival, we are left with the statement that evolution is the survival of the survivors. This indeed is a tautology. But it is possible to assign independent criteria for fitness. Darwin wrote extensively about artificial selection in pigeons, in which the breeders' choice was the criterion for fitness. (Many novel breeds of pigeon have been created this way.) Artificial selection has been practiced extensively by plant and animal breeders. Here too, survival is not the criterion for fitness, productivity is."Robert H Tamarin, (1996) "Principles of Genetics" (5th ed), p571.Where has it been shown? How is it used to make predictions about species chances of survival for the future?

Hi Ursus maritimus:Nor was the peppered moth example ever meant to "prove" evolution. One important part of the theory of evolution is the hypothesis that natural selection is the major driving force behind it. Some sources appear to conflict this point, but if you say so. I agree about your second point. Was this peppered moth not hailed as an "example of evolution in action"? If so, this implies that it is proof of evolution.So, the peppered moth observations were meant to show that natural selection can have a significant effect on the relative frequency of genotypes. Okay, I see where you are getting at. This can be easily demonstrated and proved in the environment that it works today. I agree with you on this point, well done. Today, no informed creationist would deny natural selection. In fact, this along with mutations essentially destroys the belief of molecules to man evolution as they both have no possible way of acquiring the massive amounts of new genetic information required for evolution to be a valid explanation for our origins.I am interested in your comment that natural selection is consistent with creationism. It was Darwin who first proposed that natural selection can be the major force driving the evolution of species. I thought that it was a creationist who first talked about natural selection and saw it as a way of slowing down the effects of the Curse that God placed on His whole creation (i.e. by getting rid of mutations - beneficial mutations however aren't as readily removed from a population as they help a creature survive in a particular environment), after Adam and Eve sinned and rebelled against God. If what you say about creationists of past trying to disprove natural selection is indeed true, then this is a healthy part of science. As new evidence comes along, the theory or model must be adjusted accordingly to account and explain for that particular evidence. I would be interested in know who was the first creationist to finally accept that natural selection is a real phenomenon, and when they accepted it.I don't know his name, but I'll research it for you and tell you in a week or so.NOTE: When I say beneficial mutations, I am not talking about a gain of new genetic information to the genome. The organism can survive in the environment by a loss of genetic information i.e. the loss of a function, for example the loss of wings of a beatle on a windy island helps it to survive. If they had wings, they may be blown into the ocean and drown. Over time, you may get a population of wingless beatles - the adaption would be mutation by natural selection. Not evolution. Which also fits beautifully with the creation account.

Wow, make up your mind. Either populations change over time (evolve) or they don't. Would your wingless beetles be able to produce wings again if they were somehow beneficial again? You are starting to sound like Darwin and his finches.

Also another example put forward is a bacteria that can only sustain itself by eating Nylon. The theory goes - nylon is a recent invention therefore this bacteria must have eolved recently.What it suggests however is that a portion of an existing population would have died if not for nylon... the bug has to have nylon, or it will die.It is akin to looking at a portion of the human population who would die from heart-trouble. But thankfully we've now got artificial hearts, therefore this portion can survive. They are not a new species of human, but live only because of a recent invention.

As Mach pointed out, you (Montalban) are arguing with yourself here.You stated that "bacteria needing nylon to survive" is put forth as evidence for evolution. Then you said that an alternate view was that there are some bacteria that need nylon to survive.Anyway, an actual alternate view is that the experiments performed to determine whether the bacteria could survive on nylon alone could not have been exhaustive. There may still be a natural substance on which the bacteria survives. It may even be similar to nylon, but it has yet to be discovered. This is a big maybe, though.

Please, I beg you, stop trying to jam the world into your "creation" account through reason. You just won't get anywhere through reason, if your first choice is to believe the bible (any religious works) as truth, and go from there. What you just said is "[adaptation] would be mutation by natural selection, not evolution"First, the adaptation refers to the adaptation of the species. A population of wingless beetles survives. The missing wings is the mutation, and isn't caused by anything other than a mutation, it's not a result of their being winds, or there being a god, it's just a mutation in the gene code.The gene for the wings can dissappear into the endless gulf of other discarded mutations since those organisms that carry it will most likely die off before reproductive age. It can also be left in the DNA sequence, unused, and not active, unless some other mutation activates it. ( A large percentage of our DNA seems to be unused garbage code).When this happens, your species evolved. What is your point, that beetles can evolve? Yes, they do. All life on earth seems to. Yet you don't think it's due to evolution? Mind-boggling. Who is telling you evolution is "bad" or "wrong"? Only if you arrive at that conclusion WITHOUT religion, can you even begin to have a discussion on it.Evolution in life only requires:DNA replicationMutationsA natural environment (that is, what we see here on earth, a complex system)timeWhich of these do you feel is "incorrect"?

That wouldn't be friendly.How do you define evolution? If you don't see any, then you aren't using the definition used by evolutionary biologists. The question is who should define the vocabulary of evolutionary biologist, evolutionary biologists or creationists?Actually, we didn't. The first record of a melanic form was in 1848. Presumably other melanic individuals had appeared before this, both in Biston bebularia as well as other moths. We know that a similar mutation occucrred in other moths North America some years after the 1848 record of the B. betualria.There are actually several alleles of the gene responsible for color that form a dominence hierarchy with the fully black morph (called carbonaria) as the top dominant and the typical as recessive. The intermediate forms are referred to as insularia. They are uncommon. At any rate, by 1895, 98% of observed B. betularia in industrialized areas were carbonaria.Exactly. That the change in moth color was due to natural selection was first posed in about 1896 by J.W. Tutt. The funny thing is that as pollution increased, the moths turned black, and then as the pollution was cleaned up, they turned white again. carbonaria have become pretty scarce.Of course not. No evolutionary biologist ever claimed that it was. Evolution is a change in the alle frequency in a population over time - like in the case of the peppered moths. Over about 150 years the dark allele increased to almost the entire population and then it decreased again. That is evolution. It is quite apparent that natural selection was the probably cause. You see, no one has proposed another explanation that has stood up to examination. Majerus is trying to verify that the evolution really was the result of predation by birds. It seems a reasonable hypothesis but Majerus had several quibbles with Kettlewell's methodology even though he believes the hypothesis to be correct.Not many creationists accept it. Your later comment that it was a creationist who first proposed natural selection is in error. Natural selection was one of Darwin's theories, also formulated independently by Alfred Russel Wallace.No, it's not. Natural selection is the differential reproductive success of those individuals with advantageous characteristics.What are you talking about? Please define information. What does "new" information have to do with natural selection or evolution? Evolution is NOT defined by evolutionary biologists as an increase in information.So I ask again, please define information in a meaningful way as it applies to DNA and the genome of an organism.Are you sure? What about animals that had a combination of both long and short hair. Such fur would function more efficiently as insulation that either long or short alone.So what? The allele frequency, even in your example has still changed. A change in an allele frequency in a population over time is, by definition, evolution. What did you think that evolution was?What bible tract did you get that from. Evolution does not require that dogs turn into something else. That is a strawman.Right. The frenquecy of the alles have changed over time.Well, since you have natural selection completely wrong, it must not go too well with the Biblical account. By the way, now you have introduced another word that has no meaning in the context. What is a "kind." Please be specific so that I will be able to recognize a "kind." Please show why a "kind" only has the ability to lose information.It isn't a fraud. Why would you say that? And it isn't evidence for evolution, it is an observation of evolution. The allele frequency of the moths changed (twice) over time. The most reasonable explanation seems to be that it was the result of natural selection. Natural selection is one of several mechanisms of evolution.I suspect that it is actually you who has no idea what you are talking about. Explain this to me. There is a population of moths that are peppered. All of the moths in the entire population are peppered. Then one day, a black moth appears. Investigation shows that it is because of a new allele that has arisen in the moth population. So something new that wasn't there before has now been found. How is that not new information in the genome of peppered moths?Not sure how you can tell that since very little is mentioned about his methods.In reverse? The scientific method begins with an observation. Then an hypothesis is proposed that will explain the observation. Then a prediction is made that must be true as a consequence, if the prediction is correct. Then methods are devised to test the prediction. What is described in the paper is the last step. Majerus already has his hypothesis and his prediction and is accumulating the data that will support them.You seem to feel that scientists care about "creation" more than they do. Neither Kettlewell nor Majerus mentions creation or even takes it into account. But you have believed creationists who probably don't know as much as you. Kettlewell's work was not a fraud. He did the best he could with what he had and presented his work in peer reviewed literature. His work has nothing to do with creation. But it seems that creationists want to believe that all science is permanent and never changing. Thus, when re-evaluation of Kettlewell's work is done and flaws are pointed out, creationists loudly proclaim fraud and a victory for creation. Funny that it wasn't "creation scientists" who pointed out the flaws and it wasn't "creation scientists" who publicized them. It was done by two evolutionary biologists who didn't even mention creation.But we already have a perfectly good explanation. It is an observation of evolution that exactly matches the definition. By the way, there is no doubt that the color differences are caused by alleles of a single gene. The chanage in the frequencies in those alleles over 150 years is, by definition, evolution. The cause may or may not be natural selection (no one has proposed another mechanism) caused by bird predation (no one has proposed another cause.)Don't forget to give meaningful definitions of "information" and "kind." Don't forget to explain why the addition of a new allele to the genome of a population is not new information.

Really? Can you cite those sources? I am sure that you will be citing the literature rather than creationist web sites.No it doesn't. Changes in allele frequencies in a population over time were observed. That is an example of evolution. Evolution isn't something that is "proved." It is observed. Populations of organisms change over time due to the changing frequiencies of genetic make up. That is observed. Evolutionary biology tries to explain the reasons for the observed evolution. In the case of the peppered moth, natural selection due to the predation of birds has been proposed.I disagree. How can an observation be "meant" to show a conclusion? The statement of the proposition is muddled. A change in the frequency of particular alleles was observed. The most logical mechanism of that change is natural selection - that is, as the environment changed, certain phenotypes showed a differential reproductive advantage in a given environment. That means that in polluted industrial areas, the dark morph had a reproductive advantage. In unpolluted rural areas, the light morph had the advantage. It wasn't "meant to show" anything. It was a conclusion drawn from the data. The conclusion was the the mechanism in play was natural selection.Proof is a matter of math and booze. So, if you agree with Ursus maritimus, do you agree with me?Then 99% of creationists are not informed as far as I can tell. It seems that your position is that "informed" creationists are neo-Darwinists, fully accepting of the theories of evolution.What are you talking about? I thought we were talking about changes in allele frequencies and differential reproductive success, and you barf out some nonsense about information and molecules to man. What does that mean? How is that applicable to evolutionary theory? Are you a parrot or can you actually define information. Are you talking about Shannon information? Yaukey information? What do you mean when you say "information."Nope. It was Darwin. There are letters in which Darwin proposed his theory to friends as early as 1844. Several of the leading scientists of Darwin's day were aware of his theory.But why isn't there any actual "creation science" ever done? The problem is that only when creationists realize that they look like fools do they adjust "creationism" to accommodate science. After 30 years, creationists realized that the millions of species on earth today could not possibly be crammed onto a little ark. So they "accepted" natural selection and variation in "kind" to solve the problem. The problem isn't that 36 species of cat evolved from a pair of the cat kind. The problem is that it happened at rates that boggle the mind of an evolutionary biologist. Dogs/wolves/coyotes/jackels are just as bad.My bet is that it won't be natural selection.I see. Then you are attempting to define evolution out of existance. By your definition (not that of evolutionary biologists) evolution requires an increase in information. An unsupported creationist argument. Define information in a meaningful way. Please apply your definition to genetics and show why all genetic changes are a decrease in information.Except that your picture is balderdash. I presume that you mean beetle, since a Beatle is one of the fab four. The wingless beetles of which you speak actually have wings. You seem to speak from ignorance of science while you accuse others of speaking of ignorance of creationism. Let me explain. When disected, the beetles of which you speak have fully formed wings under the fused wing covers (which are themselves modified wings in beetles). It seems that time, in an evolutionary sense, has not been sufficent to make your "wingless" beetles wingless. Since the wing covers are fused, the underlying wings are useless. In another environment that would not be an advantage.This makes perfect sense in an evolutionary scenario. Wingless (or fused wing cover) beetles in my back yard get snapped up by the anole and the geckos. But the winds in my yard are rarely more than can be handled by any insect (only once in over 20 years - huricane Alicia). And when that is the case, they go to ground and hang on.By the way, mutations don't happen by natural selection. The very statement is utter nonsese. You are demonstrating your ignorance of biological science. Mutations (of various types) are changes in the genetic makeup of an individual. If those changes are in gonads that produce gametes, then they may be passed on to offspring. Mutations are one source of genetic variability in a population. It is that variability that is acted upon by other evolutionary mechanisms to change a population over time.Both mutation and natural selection are mechanisms of evolution. Mutation increases genetic variability, while natural selection tends to reduce it. There are other mechanisms (sexual selection (-), gene flow (+), recombination (+), genetic drift (-)). The very statement, "mutation by natural selection" shows ignorance of the subject. Please try to inform yourself of the topic before you speak in the future.I don't mean to be unfriendly, but you have accused others of being ignorant of creationism when they were actually more informed than you. I presume that you are willing to admit your own ignorance of evolutionary biology.

"We must have logical evidence for belief."Thomas Henry HuxleyMach, you are the same writer are you not who, whilst questioning my sanity claimed that height could not, and could be measured?Then a man who needs an artificial heart to survive is a new species of man. That is the analogy I gave, and you ignored.In both cases; human and bacteria, before the advent of a human product, a particular group of individuals from each larger group would die off.BUT along come a man-made invention that allows those certain portions to live on which otherwise would have died. In once case - nylon, the other, the artificial heart. You call this evolution.Nor is it 'natural selection' at work either, as in both cases the thing that enabled them to survive was not natural. What you have advanced as a proof of evolution actually proves what? Natural what? I suppose people with cochlear implants are new species too because they've learnt to hear.Another view of this nylon-eating-bug is given..."Finally, Mr Cerutti is out of date about this new nylon digesting ability allegedly from a frame shift. New evidence shows that the ability was due to plasmids [e.g. K. Kato, et al., ?A plasmid encoding enzymes for nylon oligomer degradation: Nucleotide sequence analysis of pOAD2?, Microbiology (Reading) 141(10):2585?2590, 1995.] In fact, more than one species of bacteria have the ability, residing on plasmids. This suggests that the information probably already existed, and was just passed between different types of bacteria." "All that would be needed to enable an enzyme to digest nylon is a mutation causing loss of specificity in a proteolytic (protein-degrading) enzyme. This may seem surprising? How would a loss of information create a new ability? Answer: enzymes are usually tuned very precisely to only one type of molecule (the substrate). Loss of information would reduce the effectiveness of its primary function, but would enable it to degrade other substrates, too. Since both nylon and proteins are broken down by breaking amide linkages, a change in a proteolytic enzyme could also allow it to work on nylon. If this process were continued, the result would be a general enzyme with a weakly catalytic effect on the hydrolysis of too many chemicals to be useful where much selectivity is required. To put it into perspective, acids and alkalis also catalyze many hydrolysis reactions, but they also lack specificity. Indeed, an inhibitor of a protein degrading enzyme also inhibits the action of the nylon degrading enzyme"http://www.answersingenesis.org/home...e7-24-2000.aspTalkorigins gave their usual doubletalk"Whilst this particular case does not "prove" evolution, it is consistent with, and supportive of, the theory of biological evolution."Why do they say this? Because it's still a bacteria. It's not like it suddenly became a large multi-cellular organism. But it might just prove that this bug was so well designed that it can cope with newer situations. One site does say that it, the bacteria, had the capability already within it of change ? not resultant in ?mutations?, but more like switching on previously dormant apparatus. http://members.tripod.com/aslodge/id89.htmOne poster on another forum summed the problem up like this..." In order for species to advance there would have to be a net information gain, which isn't the case with nylon eating bacteria.The bacteria gained the ability to digest nylon, therefore was able to survive in a new environment. Two distinct advantagesBut, the bacteria lost its ability to survive in its old environment, eat its former diet and suffered a 98% loss in efficiency. Three disadvantages.So by taking two steps forward and three steps backward, where is the net gain? If nylon eating bacteria was "proof" of evolution, we would still be pond scum, but with the ability to digest whatever happened to become the primary food source."http://www.christianforums.com/t52336

And well he should have ignored it. Your analogy is nonsense.Can you state that in English? What does that mean?What does a mutation have to do with a heart transplant? What are you smoking?Certainly not. Why would you make such a remark? While a mutation that allowed a bacteria to metabolize nylon waste products is most certainly an example of evolution, heart transplants (artificial or otherwise) aren't. It is an ignorant assertion to claim that they are.Science doesn't offer proof. Are you so ignorant? Much less can science offer "proof" of evolution by means of organ transplants. The idea is simple minded at best.since it seems to be important to you, why don't you offer "proof" that evolution doen't happen. Other creationists have already admitted that it does in this thread.

I'm not trying to participate in gang debate, but well..The population of "people with heart trouble" would only be in jeopardy if the heart trouble made it more difficult to reproduce. If reproduction is not hindered then there is much less chance of dying off.Just helping something live doesn't affect evolution unless it affects the ability to reproduce viable offspring. If there was no nylon before the 1940s and there is an organism that can survive by eating NOTHING else, what does that tell you? There could not have been a population of nylon-eating bacteria before 1940. This is a new population that did not exist before. This is retarded. A species would be defined by the genome, not which organs work the way they are supposed to or not.None of these alternate views go outside the framework of evolution. They all use poor wording, though, and try to lead one to some conclusion about "information" or something.

[quote=Montalban]Then a man who needs an artificial heart to survive is a new species of man. That is the analogy I gave, and you ignored. [quote=Archilochus]And well he should have ignored it. Your analogy is nonsense.Just saying it is, doesn't make for an argument. All analogies have dissimilarities, but they do have similarities to make them analogies. You've just dismissed mine. I believe the similarities are great enough to make it a good analogy. Rather than state a 'just-so' statement as you do, I will explain why...[quote=Montalban]In both cases; human and bacteria, before the advent of a human product, a particular group of individuals from each larger group would die off. [quote=Archilochus]Can you state that in English? What does that mean?Welcome back Ungerdunn.You have two general populationsa) One humanb) One bacteriaIn both cases a small portion of that population was always being born/coming into being that would die off due to a defect.in population a) because some were born with a faulty heartin population b) because some were unable to process their normal diet.Then along comes man-made inventions.One - the artificial heartthe other - nylons.Now in population a) those with faulty hearts can live and in population b) those unable to process their food now have a new food stuff.You deem one case to be evolution, but not the other.That's assuming that there was a mutation in the bug that allowed them to take on the new source. One of the sites I cited suggested that they already had an inherent ability to do that. All it took was the right man-made invention to come along to prevent them dying out. All important to this is a man-made intervention made survival possible. If it weren't for nylons, they'd keep on dying. What was 'natural' about the selection? It was the product of Intelligence, even though the result was not foreseen that allowed these nylon bugs to live.Well Ungerdunn, already the abuse.Good for them. There are many different theories of evolution and many accommodate deism. I take it you had a point?I am used to it.I think dying of heart trouble would cause some difficulties in reproduction. However you assume that the bug population did not produce offspring for some many years before the advent of nylon; that a portion of them would die off because they needed what nylon contains.Just helping something live doesn't affect evolution unless it affects the ability to reproduce viable offspring. There was a population of the bug before the production of nylons. However, the members of the population that needed nylon died off before the advent of nylon. Just as the population of humans that needed insulin, heart devices, anti-cancer drugs etc. died off before the advent of modern technologies. There is no evidence to suggest that the bug was not producing these nylon-dependent versions before nylon; and that they weren't all dying prior to nylon.A genome does not contain all the material that is necessary to account for the creature. But otherwise, you've lost me on this retort. I don't know what it is your driving at.Interesting 'just-so' statement.Do you think it is a mutation if you use a pre-existing apparatus? Or is it a mutation if you change to suit a change in the environment?

And well he should have ignored it. Your analogy is nonsense.Can you state that in English? What does that mean?What does a mutation have to do with a heart transplant? What are you smoking?Certainly not. Why would you make such a remark? While a mutation that allowed a bacteria to metabolize nylon waste products is most certainly an example of evolution, heart transplants (artificial or otherwise) aren't. It is an ignorant assertion to claim that they are.Science doesn't offer proof. Are you so ignorant? Much less can science offer "proof" of evolution by means of organ transplants. The idea is simple minded at best.since it seems to be important to you, why don't you offer "proof" that evolution doen't happen. Other creationists have already admitted that it does in this thread.

Really? Can you cite those sources? I am sure that you will be citing the literature rather than creationist web sites.No it doesn't. Changes in allele frequencies in a population over time were observed. That is an example of evolution. Evolution isn't something that is "proved." It is observed. Populations of organisms change over time due to the changing frequiencies of genetic make up. That is observed. Evolutionary biology tries to explain the reasons for the observed evolution. In the case of the peppered moth, natural selection due to the predation of birds has been proposed.I disagree. How can an observation be "meant" to show a conclusion? The statement of the proposition is muddled. A change in the frequency of particular alleles was observed. The most logical mechanism of that change is natural selection - that is, as the environment changed, certain phenotypes showed a differential reproductive advantage in a given environment. That means that in polluted industrial areas, the dark morph had a reproductive advantage. In unpolluted rural areas, the light morph had the advantage. It wasn't "meant to show" anything. It was a conclusion drawn from the data. The conclusion was the the mechanism in play was natural selection.Proof is a matter of math and booze. So, if you agree with Ursus maritimus, do you agree with me?Then 99% of creationists are not informed as far as I can tell. It seems that your position is that "informed" creationists are neo-Darwinists, fully accepting of the theories of evolution.What are you talking about? I thought we were talking about changes in allele frequencies and differential reproductive success, and you barf out some nonsense about information and molecules to man. What does that mean? How is that applicable to evolutionary theory? Are you a parrot or can you actually define information. Are you talking about Shannon information? Yaukey information? What do you mean when you say "information."Nope. It was Darwin. There are letters in which Darwin proposed his theory to friends as early as 1844. Several of the leading scientists of Darwin's day were aware of his theory.But why isn't there any actual "creation science" ever done? The problem is that only when creationists realize that they look like fools do they adjust "creationism" to accommodate science. After 30 years, creationists realized that the millions of species on earth today could not possibly be crammed onto a little ark. So they "accepted" natural selection and variation in "kind" to solve the problem. The problem isn't that 36 species of cat evolved from a pair of the cat kind. The problem is that it happened at rates that boggle the mind of an evolutionary biologist. Dogs/wolves/coyotes/jackels are just as bad.My bet is that it won't be natural selection.I see. Then you are attempting to define evolution out of existance. By your definition (not that of evolutionary biologists) evolution requires an increase in information. An unsupported creationist argument. Define information in a meaningful way. Please apply your definition to genetics and show why all genetic changes are a decrease in information.Except that your picture is balderdash. I presume that you mean beetle, since a Beatle is one of the fab four. The wingless beetles of which you speak actually have wings. You seem to speak from ignorance of science while you accuse others of speaking of ignorance of creationism. Let me explain. When disected, the beetles of which you speak have fully formed wings under the fused wing covers (which are themselves modified wings in beetles). It seems that time, in an evolutionary sense, has not been sufficent to make your "wingless" beetles wingless. Since the wing covers are fused, the underlying wings are useless. In another environment that would not be an advantage.This makes perfect sense in an evolutionary scenario. Wingless (or fused wing cover) beetles in my back yard get snapped up by the anole and the geckos. But the winds in my yard are rarely more than can be handled by any insect (only once in over 20 years - huricane Alicia). And when that is the case, they go to ground and hang on.By the way, mutations don't happen by natural selection. The very statement is utter nonsese. You are demonstrating your ignorance of biological science. Mutations (of various types) are changes in the genetic makeup of an individual. If those changes are in gonads that produce gametes, then they may be passed on to offspring. Mutations are one source of genetic variability in a population. It is that variability that is acted upon by other evolutionary mechanisms to change a population over time.Both mutation and natural selection are mechanisms of evolution. Mutation increases genetic variability, while natural selection tends to reduce it. There are other mechanisms (sexual selection (-), gene flow (+), recombination (+), genetic drift (-)). The very statement, "mutation by natural selection" shows ignorance of the subject. Please try to inform yourself of the topic before you speak in the future.I don't mean to be unfriendly, but you have accused others of being ignorant of creationism when they were actually more informed than you. I presume that you are willing to admit your own ignorance of evolutionary biology.

It isn't a bug. It is a bacterium. And yes, there was a mutation (a frame shift) that allowed them to use the new source.So you don't know what a frame shift mutation is?But these bacteria don't survive otherwise. Do you actually have any idea as to how bacteria reproduce? How can a strain of bacteria survive if an essential requirement for survival is lacking. You seem slow so I'll tell you. It can't.There was no man-made intervention. The particular bacterium in question don't survive at all without nylon waste products. It nylon didn't exist, then there is no possibility that some population existed that was just waiting for nylon to be developed. The bacteria do not survive outside of an environment produced by the waste products of the manufacture of nylon. There may be other bacteria that live in the same environment, but they do not metabolize the waste products of the manufacture of nylon.[/quote]Wouldn't it have been nice if you had actually educated yourself before you spoke? It it weren't for nylon, they wouldn't exist. There was no strain of bacteria that was limping along, all but dying out for lack of nylon waste. The bacteria in question do not exist without nylon. Educate yourself before you speak. Even if this particular frame shift mutation had occurred on a daily basis, the bacteria would not have been viable. Only when this particular mutation occurred in waste products from the production of nylon was this frame shift mutation viable.Well, in a new environment an organism evolved to adapt to that environment. A new gene allowed the organism to take advantage of previously unused energy sources. Since It wasn't planned, or even expected, by humans, it happened for natural reasons.You're kidding, right? Let me see if I have this right. Because humans designed nylon a random frameshift mutation is a bacterium that allows it to metabolize certain waste products of the manufacture of nylon is also a product of design and therefore evidence for your god.What are you talking about? What abuse? It seems that you are unable to differentiate disagreement with your ill formed ideas with abuse. If you are unwilling to educate yourself as to the basics of the topic and your illiterate ideas are characterized as "simple minded", that isn't abuse. It is an honest opinion of your less than informed assertions. If you aren't mature enough to debate, perhaps you should reconsider your decision to participate on a discussion board.I see. Then you aren't able to do so. I thought as much. However many theories of evolution you want to invent, all of them have to do with the common descent of all life. You just don't know why.

Really? So you didn't read any of the links that refer to it as a nylon 'bug'? But rather than ask me - what I meant by the term, you just tell me what you think I was thinking.Now really. Even here you've been shown what I meant by it, by me stating it, by me referencing it by that term. It's hard to admit you failed even when you were making a That's not what I said. I didn't say that talkorigins coined it, or give it currency. I said that they had no problem with it. When retorting AIG that made no reference to it being termed a 'bug'. There is a difference albeit a subtle one for some. The poster introduces the term saying that AIG have an article about a nylon bug. Talkorigins, don't have a problem with it, because they don't refute the term used, but rather AIGs article. They obviously understand what is important and don't want to be petty by arguing over a rather insignificant point. In American terms; they let it 'slide'. I believe that is the correct expression. Therefore they had no problem with the term. Only you do.If that is what happened, then why not set it forward?Humans did intervene, even if they didn't mean too by providing a new source of food.[/quote]You say I am.That's an incredibly novel usage of the term 'natural'.No, you suggested that I was trying to promote my version of God (which is synonymous with the idea that I am promoting 'God' in absolute terms). AIG is a Protestant site and in religious terms Orthodox class them as heretics or schismatics (that is subject for another debate which you're welcome to take part in). Therefore I am not promoting my God through someone else's idea of my God. It is illogical to do so. It is equally remarkable that you suggest that a citation from one site means that I accept absolutely everything they believe. I am not debating the totality of AIG's vision of God/ nature/ the world, I am referencing a specific rebuttal of the debate at hand. It is just confusion to suggest I am making a much larger argument. I can't possibly know everything that AIG publishes, and therefore can't possibly be held to believe everything that they publish, anyway. Accepting this style of argument it is easy enough to suggest the reverse is true; that you reject AIG's ideas about the nylon bug because you refuse to believe in particular things. However, I won't make that kind of argument because it is illogical. I can see that you believe that if I put forward one thing in means a hundred other things are also put forward.[quote=Archilochus]Science doesn't offer proof. Are you so ignorant? [quote]You tread a fine line. Even a rhetorical question is loaded with assumption. However there are proofs in science. What way are you using 'proof'? Although I've been over this before; evolution is 'true' because of the evidences etc. etc.That's not true. I am not insulted by you saying here that I'm unable to distinguish between retort and abuse. Saying I am wrong is one thing. Using words such as pathetic etc are different. It is an insult, if it is insulting and it is, unless you can explain how you meant it in another fashion. It is an absolute strawman to engage in someone in insulting terms and then come up this argument of yours. Saying 'how pathetic' leaves exceptionally little lee-way for true debate. You use a word which is condescending; in that you say it evokes pity; that my argument is couched in the terms of 'pathos'.Not how only a small fraction of your argument is based on the actual nylon bug. I have no more at present to say on this as it speaks for itself. But I am not leaving these debates, in toto.

Montalban -- How would you define the term 'natural'?Humans cannot separate ourselves from 'nature' because we are a part of 'nature.' Beavers fell trees... is that natural? Gophers dig holes in the ground... is that natural? Humans manufacture nylon... is that natural? Of course, they are all 'natural.' We are biological creatures who use or manipulate the environment to suit our own needs, just like any other biological creature. Certainly it is evident that in many cases we have a greater impact on the physical world around us than other biological creatures, but the concept is the same. Anything we do is 'natural.'

Really? So you didn't read any of the links that refer to it as a nylon 'bug'? But rather than ask me - what I meant by the term, you just tell me what you think I was thinking.Now really. Even here you've been shown what I meant by it, by me stating it, by me referencing it by that term. It's hard to admit you failed even when you were making a That's not what I said. I didn't say that talkorigins coined it, or give it currency. I said that they had no problem with it. When retorting AIG that made no reference to it being termed a 'bug'. There is a difference albeit a subtle one for some. The poster introduces the term saying that AIG have an article about a nylon bug. Talkorigins, don't have a problem with it, because they don't refute the term used, but rather AIGs article. They obviously understand what is important and don't want to be petty by arguing over a rather insignificant point. In American terms; they let it 'slide'. I believe that is the correct expression. Therefore they had no problem with the term. Only you do.If that is what happened, then why not set it forward?Humans did intervene, even if they didn't mean too by providing a new source of food.[/quote]You say I am.That's an incredibly novel usage of the term 'natural'.No, you suggested that I was trying to promote my version of God (which is synonymous with the idea that I am promoting 'God' in absolute terms). AIG is a Protestant site and in religious terms Orthodox class them as heretics or schismatics (that is subject for another debate which you're welcome to take part in). Therefore I am not promoting my God through someone else's idea of my God. It is illogical to do so. It is equally remarkable that you suggest that a citation from one site means that I accept absolutely everything they believe. I am not debating the totality of AIG's vision of God/ nature/ the world, I am referencing a specific rebuttal of the debate at hand. It is just confusion to suggest I am making a much larger argument. I can't possibly know everything that AIG publishes, and therefore can't possibly be held to believe everything that they publish, anyway. Accepting this style of argument it is easy enough to suggest the reverse is true; that you reject AIG's ideas about the nylon bug because you refuse to believe in particular things. However, I won't make that kind of argument because it is illogical. I can see that you believe that if I put forward one thing in means a hundred other things are also put forward.[quote=Archilochus]Science doesn't offer proof. Are you so ignorant? [quote]You tread a fine line. Even a rhetorical question is loaded with assumption. However there are proofs in science. What way are you using 'proof'? Although I've been over this before; evolution is 'true' because of the evidences etc. etc.That's not true. I am not insulted by you saying here that I'm unable to distinguish between retort and abuse. Saying I am wrong is one thing. Using words such as pathetic etc are different. It is an insult, if it is insulting and it is, unless you can explain how you meant it in another fashion. It is an absolute strawman to engage in someone in insulting terms and then come up this argument of yours. Saying 'how pathetic' leaves exceptionally little lee-way for true debate. You use a word which is condescending; in that you say it evokes pity; that my argument is couched in the terms of 'pathos'.Not how only a small fraction of your argument is based on the actual nylon bug. I have no more at present to say on this as it speaks for itself. But I am not leaving these debates, in toto.

Hey, BootfitterThe problem seems to be lack of adequate background. In a post somewhere on these boards, Montalban mentioned that he had flunked high school biology. Doesn't it seem strange that he would involve himself in discussions of biological science when he lacks the knowledge to pass a 10th grade course? Not only that, he also admitted that he hasn't even read On The Origin of Species. And yet he argued that "survival of the fittest" was central to Darwin's theories. He wasn't even aware that Darwin opposed the phrase as representative of his theory and only used it in the 4th edition of "Origins." Is it any wonder that he is confused by my use of the word "natural" in natural selection. Moreover, he offers links to sites such as "Answers in Genesis" as evidence to support his position.It seems to me that Montalban has been swayed by the unfounded opinions of the ignorant because they tell him what he wants to hear. It isn't as if he has the knowledge to evaluate the information that he hears in the light of science. It seems that he has freely admited that it is not the case. Don't get me wrong. I don't have any axes to grind with those who have difficulty in understanding what science is an how it operates. My freshman roommate realized early on in Biology 101 that he had a problem. He didn't understand the subject, probably because he wasn't interested. So I took it upon myself to tutor my roommate. It helped me because we reviewed all of the information before every test, and I was required to comprehend the information enough to explain it to my roommate. He passed through sheer power of will and memory.One wonders if Montalban had paid attention in biology class, or undertook to read some basics of evolutionary biology, if he would know that Darwin proposed two forms of "selection," artificial selection and natural selection. Artificial selection is, of course, the breeding of domestic animals where the breeding stock is intentionally "selected" by the breeder for certain desired traits. Anything else is natural selection, where there is differential reproductive success in a particular environment.Montalban seems to think that because mankind produces pollutants that affect other organisms that it is somehow "intervention" by mankind. Then I guess the pollution of the environment by rodents who spread the hantavirus by feces, urine and saliva is "intervention" by rodents.Lest I be accused of being abusive, let me offer this definition of my meaning:Ignorant 1 : destitute of knowledge or education; also : lacking knowledge or comprehension of the thing specified2 : unaware, uninformedIn that sense, it appears to me that Montalban is ignorant of science in general, and evolutionary biology in particular. Since he has admitted that he was unable to pass 10th grade biology, that is not an evaluation of his character but an observation drawn from his own statement.One wonders why one would choose to argue a topic about which one lacks knowledge.

Hey Archilochus! I note that you've dropped the complaint about the use of the word 'bug', and even the attempt to re-work talkorigins onto your side. Apology accepted. I also note that you've dropped the illogical argument that a debate over the nylon bug equates to me pushing for the belief in Orthodoxy. Apology accepted there too. But hey, let's not argue about the issue of the bug anyway, lets just spend a bit of time in debating about each other...Just a small point; it wasn't a 10th grade course. You are applying American educational practices to Australian. It was in Year 12, or 6th form in the old terminology. Yes I am not ashamed of this. I state too where I have not read a book. Honesty, I believe is the best policy.Funny you, a person who has only just 'joined' would know this....and the following notions....It seems Ungerdunn has resurfaced.Which is quite a slight of hand, and rather boring as you've presented this same nonsense three times already, and all I have to do is point out that Darwin, in the 6th edition argued in favour of using a tautology. It is quite remarkable that you would state your argument again and again and again, only for me to have to cut-and-paste it (I've saved it, because so predictable are you)."But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer, of the Survival of the Fittest, is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient." from the 6th edition of "Origin of the Species"http://www.literature.org/authors/da...hapter-03.htmlIs it honest to present such argument again and again, and also to re-visit this forum after being banned, using another username? There is probable reason to believe you also posted before that as Lurch, and as such was banned under that name, too. A three-times 'bannee', and you still come back and pedal the same stuff.It is clear Darwin says he preferred a tautology, and embarrassing to his apologists, this is in a later work than the one you cite.'Natural' suggests through nature. Natural selection is without 'purpose'. Man can give something purpose and can reason, and even if man acts purposefully and achieves an accidental ends, this does not underlie the fact that man acts with purpose. For you to suggest that nature, acting through random means is the same as man acting through non-random means is to attribute to nature purpose which is the antithesis of natural selection.Are you suggesting nature has a purpose? Or, a higher intelligence akin to man's? (see below before commenting)And of course the uberman is not subject to such things. (keep going)Oh please. Your whole purpose is to push your own ideas. It is naive in the extreme to suggest this. (just a little further, still got to wade through your ad hominem's first)This is relevant, how? No, don't bother answering.I studied pre-history at university. I have quoted a number of times on this forum from the text; now somewhat dated; owing to my age. "In search of Ourselves" by Poirier.But that's irrelevant too. The issue isn't what we've studied, but what we understand.Ah-ha, here we are.Are you saying that an accidental breeding undertaken by man is natural?Darwin says that even when man did it by accident, it was artificial..."Hence it must be assumed, not only that half-civilized man succeeded in thoroughly domesticating several species, but that he intentionally or by chance picked out extraordinarily abnormal species; and further, that these very species have since all become extinct or unknown. So many strange contingencies are improbable in the highest degree."http://www.literature.org/authors/da...hapter-01.html"Man has an aim or an end in view; `natural selection' can have none."*E. Russell, The Diversity of Animals, (1962), p. 124.It has 'no' purpose. Man has purpose, if he builds a city, that is purposeful. If he builds a bomb, and is accidentally killed by it, it is not 'natural' causes.No, the pollution caused by man is not natural in this case. Tell me what is 'natural' about nylon? Does it bio-degrade? It was introduced into 'nature' not by nature, but by man.It is akin to going down to the ocean, rescuing an injured penguin, and feeding it. It's survival was by you providing it with food. That is what man did with nylon. Likewise, when man invented nylon he didn't know all the uses it could be turned into, however the act of it's production was purposeful. That he accidentally discovered other uses for it does not make these 'natural'.SO? You lack knowledge about the Darwin's ideas with regard to 'survival of the fittest' and you claim to have read the book! Reading it hasn't empowered you at all. What is worse, is that you continually bring this argument back to light with some new or different poster. And I have to embarrass you by citing from Darwin's 6th edition again and again. It is not fun for me to do so, but I must because somehow you must believe that you can convince people with your 'just-so' statements based on your dogmatic belief in Darwin, despite the evidence from the man himself.It is in fact why I don't mind admitting I've never read the book, because I still understand what Darwin meant when he says he thinks a tautology to be a superior term.There was no 10th grade biology course. I passed 10th grade science (which was general science and included biology). This is only a minor point, as I failed biology two years later, but it is you making assumptions based on the limits of your own experience, and expecting that the Australian educational system follows the same pattern as in America. It might seem petty, but hey, you wanted to argue over the term 'bug' and then didn't concede when I showed that you were wrong. It also goes to the level by which you extrapolate ideas from a limited number of facts.[/quote]One wonders why one would choose to argue a topic about which one lacks knowledge.[/quote]You assume that one only gains knowledge from formal learning? Obviously people in the USA didn't speak a word of language until school -where formal teaching begins! But anyway, what have we learnt so fara) you argue about the meaning of 'bug' have been shown that talkorigins don't have a problem, but you still argued until you realised that you were wrong, you don't admit you're wrongb) you argue about the idea that I am pushing Orthodoxy by quoting from a non-Orthodox Christian site, argued this for a while, then withdrew, again not admitting you were wrongc) you argued (again) about survival of the fittest from Darwin, but select an earlier edition, and we've already been over this several times, I continually quote the 6th ed that shows Darwin preferred a tautology, yet you don't admit you're wrong, even though Darwin says he finds the tautology 'superior'd) you use words that are insulting like 'pathetic' and argue that it's not an insult, even if it does insult, and have yet to show how it was meant in a constructive manner, I guess 'sorry' doesn't appear in the lexicone) you apply assumption of schooling curriculum from America to Australia and make a strange emotive appeal based on an idea that is suggestive that you believe that the only education a person gets in the subject is a formal one.ANDall of this because you don't wish to argue over the nylon bug issue itself. In short, rather than argue the issue, you try all sorts of ad hominem, of which I'm only to happy to respond to.In summary you make a number of very small points which when refuted you might try and drag out for one more post before dropping, with no admission you were ever wrong.You make connections of lines of thought -such as a dispute of one thing equals support of anotherYou make ad hominem, and use insults, then deny that they are insults, even though you recognise I was insulted, and still can't provide how you meant them in a non-insulting wayANDthen you appeal for support from other posters by use of devices of emotional rhetoric.I believe that about covers all the 'points' that you tried to make. :)

I just want to point out that usage of the word "bug" is common when referring to bacteria. Unfortunately it's also common to refer to viruses as bugs, as well as any "microbe".And common usage of the word "natural" precludes man's involvement.Although man cannot be separated from nature, in common usage the word natural is opposite to artificial, which means that man had a hand in it.That we alone in the animal kingdom (or in life altogether) are the sole possessors of "purpose" is quite doubtful. When a bird makes its nest, it does so for a purpose. When dogs pack up, they do it for a reason, a purpose. When monkeys groom each other, there is a purpose for doing so.We as humans, (in my opinion which is contrary to montalban's) are not "above" nature as we cannot be separated from it. We are bound within it.

This is true. It could be argued that it is improper use, but it has gained such general currency, and English is a living language.I agree with you here on the later part of your statement.Perhaps I might disagree with you here. A dog's purpose, I believe is different from man's. A tree branch can have a natural 'purpose' in the sense you use, but we humans could for instance use it as a weapon, creating a purpose in addition to that which was natural.Maybe I worded my tract badly.I am not sure if I agree with you here, for I believe that man is 'natural' in that we are biological, physical, material, etc. But we have, I believe, a 'nature' that transcends the material world.It most probably falls out side the scope of the current debate, though your comments are most welcome.

Ah, you mean we are the only ones to use tools. Not exactly, there are a few species of birds that use twigs or stones as tools.http://www.pigeon.psy.tufts.edu/psych26/birds.htmhttp://news.nationalgeographic.com/n..._owl_poop.htmlhttp://www.birdwatchersdigest.com/bw.../bird_beh.htmlor apes that use toolshttp://wvwv.essortment.com/primatesmammal_rrtr.htmNow we are most definitely the most sophisticated tool users in the animal kingdom, hell, on earth. We can also look at a potential tool and work out how it may be modified to further our purposes. This is because we have the most sophisticated brain. We have the cerebral cortex, which is believed to be where our reasoning ability resides. But, I think that when another animal sees a potential tool, it must determine how to go about using it to reach its goal. This implies some sort of reasoning to me, some sort of higher decision-making process. (higher than fight or flight, do i eat this or not, etc.)Orangutans will pick up a tree branch and pick off twigs to stick into anthills and retrieve ants. This is tool modification and optimization in a primitive form. None of this indicates that man has a higher purpose. It merely indicates that man has a more sophisticated brain.I'm not sure what you mean when you say that we transcend the physical world, but, yeah, it's probably another debate.I will say that there has never been any kind of scientific evidence for the supernatural (but that may be a limitation of science).

That may be true but that is not the point. Montalban's scientific competence is in question. He has demonstrated before that he had difficulty grasping scientific topics. After all he failed biology, not as a child as I assumed, but two years later, when he should have been mature enough to grasp the concepts. I was not sure that Montalban understood that his "nylon bug" was a bacterium, so I pointed out the obvious to him. His response was that Talk Origins approved of that use, when in fact, the reference came from Answers in Genesis. The Talk Origins author actually never called it a bug, but in fact pointed out that it was a bacterium - in fact two species of bacteria. Somehow correcting the questioner, as I corrected him, becomes approval to Montalban.Certainly pathogens of many kinds are sometimes referred to as bugs by the vulgar masses. But Montalban tries to represent that he is discussing science and still consults his "Little Golden Dictionary" for the definitions of scientific terms. That just isn't sufficient. More than once Montalban has quoted his little dictionary to support his misunderstanding. Pathetically, the definition that he proposes is not that used by biological scientists.How sad that he admits that he lacked the understanding to pass a basic course in biology, and yet he has now miraculously gained the knowledge to challenge 150 years of biological science science.Let me point out some other examples of Montalban's understanding of debate. He began using the word "evolutionary" as a noun. When it was pointed out to him that the word is an adjective, he claimed that because it was used in the title of a book, as in "Evolutionary Biology", that it was a noun, since book titles are nouns. He never did respond to the retort that therefore, "on", "the", "of", "by", "means", are all therefore nouns because they are all used in the title of the book, "On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection."Montalban doesn't understand science, he doesn't understand biology (by his own admission), and he has demonstrated his lack of understanding of the English language. I wonder if he also failed English along with biology. He is offended when his lack of understanding of English is pointed out since he says that it is his "native language."So now Montalban claims that I "dropped" my objection to his use of the word "bug." Not true. I pointed out that Talk Origins didn't "approve" the word, since the author didn't use it. Talk Origins correctly discussed a bacterium and made no approval of the word "bug." I didn't apologize. Montalban is a liar on two counts.I also didn't argue that Montalban was "pushing" for his belief in "Orthodoxy." I stated that he was representing his ignorance of science as evidence of his god. He continues to do so. I didn't apologize. Montalban is a liar.Montalban tells us this of his fail of biology. I would be. I never failed a course, not even in earning my degrees in biology. And yet you assume that you are able to instruct me because of your belief in bronze age mythology.I am disgusted by your lies and misreprestations. Your posts are abusive and insulting. And that doesn't even take into account your ignorance of the topic that you are discussing. You flunked biology and you presume that you can instruct a degreed biologist. By the way, I also have a degree in linguistics, so your "I know my native language" argument doesn't hold water.

I didn't say that they 'approved' it. I said they had no problem with it. If they had a problem they, like you, would have made an issue of it; perhaps saying "Although it's commonly referred to as a nylon bug, it's actually..." but they didn't qualify the term used, they accepted it without comment. Therefore they had no problem with it.You have spent an inordinate amount of time upon this when several citations use it, I've used it, another poster uses it. But you're right, everyone else is wrong... even the good professionals at talkorigins need to be called into question by you.Another ad hominem based on such a generalisation.Again you assume that I undertook a particular type of course by claiming that it was 'basic'. You continually add information to what I said.Have we been over this before? The name of something is a noun.Yes again I warn you, questioning someone's grasp of something as basic is insulting.Using the reference I gave, show me where talkorigins don't approve of the use of the word 'bug'.Yes, I noted that.I assume you believe you are not being insulting here either.But your accusation is still illogical. It is akin to me saying that you pushing for evolution is evidence of atheism. No where did I say my argument meant approval for God. You seem to equate any argument against materialist evolution as an argument for Christianity. Where is the connection between the two - only you repeat a 'just-so'.A repeat of an illogical conclusion here.That an argument I make about the nylon bug equates to an argument for God, there is in fact no connection I've made, only you make it.Why I think you believe that I am insulting is that I would dare to argue with you. That is not abusive. Unless you can come up with specific incidents of an insult, other than the fact that I 'dare' to argue against you.You assume that just because you have a degree, in either biology or linguistics or whatever, that you can't be wrong.Yet despite all this 'learning' you make arguments about Darwin, even when Darwin's own words disagree with you! You make a big deal about the word 'bug' when a site such as talkorigins has no problem with it.

I'm not trying to participate in gang debate, but well..The population of "people with heart trouble" would only be in jeopardy if the heart trouble made it more difficult to reproduce. If reproduction is not hindered then there is much less chance of dying off.Just helping something live doesn't affect evolution unless it affects the ability to reproduce viable offspring. If there was no nylon before the 1940s and there is an organism that can survive by eating NOTHING else, what does that tell you? There could not have been a population of nylon-eating bacteria before 1940. This is a new population that did not exist before. This is retarded. A species would be defined by the genome, not which organs work the way they are supposed to or not.None of these alternate views go outside the framework of evolution. They all use poor wording, though, and try to lead one to some conclusion about "information" or something.

To Ursus maritimus:I would be interested in know who was the first creationist to finally accept that natural selection is a real phenomenon, and when they accepted it.Keeping true to my word - that I would find out who - I am back. The Christian Creationist who expounded the idea of natural selection before Darwin did is called Edward Blythe. You can read more about him and his contribution, as well as the history behind Darwin's natural selection idea, at the following link: Darwin and the search for an evolutionary mechanism.As for Christians attacking natural selection, it has been revealed to me that this may not have happened to the extent that you are implying. Some uniformed Christians, however, may have reacted to this idea, as the mere suggestion of it being the mechanism Darwin posulated for his evolutionary theory would have probably cast it in bad light. Rather, what was alleged to have occured with the help of this "mechanism", evolution of the molecules to man type was vehemently attacked, e.g. the Evolution Protest Movement of Great Britain led by John Ambrose Fleming.

Hello, Nu Leader.Nor was the peppered moth example ever meant to "prove" evolution. One important part of the theory of evolution is the hypothesis that natural selection is the major driving force behind it. So, the peppered moth observations were meant to show that natural selection can have a significant effect on the relative frequency of genotypes.Incidentally, I am interested in your comment that natural selection is consistent with creationism. It was Darwin who first proposed that natural selection can be the major force driving the evolution of species. Creationists pretty much tried to discredit natural selection for over a century. It was only after scientific evidence was presented that showed decisively that natural selection was, indeed, a major contributor to evolution that creationists were finally forced to accept it.I would be interested in know who was the first creationist to finally accept that natural selection is a real phenomenon, and when they accepted it.

To Mach:First, the adaptation refers to the adaptation of the species. A population of wingless beetles survives. The missing wings is the mutation, and isn't caused by anything other than a mutation, it's not a result of their being winds, or there being a god, it's just a mutation in the gene code.Yes, the mutation causes the "missing wings". This now diversifies (or splits up) the original beetle population into two groups, i.e. beetles with and without wings. By natural selection, over relatively short periods of time, the beetles with wings will be wiped out and drown. Hence, the adaption is mutation by natural selection. Just a short way of putting mutation diversifies original population, and than natural selection then gets rid of those creatures who cannot survive in a particular environment (i.e. the beetles with wings) and thus leave the wingless beetles. Sorry if I didn't make that clear.The gene for the wings can dissappear into the endless gulf of other discarded mutations since those organisms that carry it will most likely die off before reproductive age. It can also be left in the DNA sequence, unused, and not active, unless some other mutation activates it. ( A large percentage of our DNA seems to be unused garbage code).The original population had the information for wings. The mutation *destroyed* the information for making wings, i.e. it has been erased from the genome of that particular beetle. If that beetle gets together with another beetle that has lost the information for making wings, they will produce wingless beetles. IMHO, the only way for this wingless population of beetles to get back to how it was originally, i.e. beeltes with wings, is if the information for creating wings was introduced from another beetle population that already has the information for making wings. The wingless beetles themselves could not produce off-spring with wings as they do not have the genetic information with the instructions on telling the creature how to make wings. When you say that it can also be eleft in the DNA sequence, do you mean kind of like a "carrier"? Assuming that you are right with this particular characteristic, this is still not evolution. The genetic information is already still there for making wings. No new information (DNA) has been introduced into the beetle's genome.All life on earth seems to. Yet you don't think it's due to evolution? Mind-boggling. Who is telling you evolution is "bad" or "wrong"? Only if you arrive at that conclusion WITHOUT religion, can you even begin to have a discussion on it.All life changes and varries, yes. But one kind of creatures do not and has not been observed changing, or evolving into a different kind, such as a reptile into a bird. Who is telling me that evolution is wrong? Common sense and the evidence. I can see where evolution (molecules to man type) is wrong, such as the fact that evolution has no way of making new genetic information (DNA) and adding it to the genome. Your last part is quite interesting... Recently in the latest edition of "Creation Magazine" they had a little cartoon of two soldiers. In each of the slide are written the words: "It would be foolish ... for a soldier ... to remove his armour and weapons ... before a battle..." On the next slide, the soldier in uniform says: "...Next throw down your sword!" The word "FOOLISH!" is written in the bottom corner. In the very next slide, a man says "Sure we can talk about Earth's origins, but let's leave the Bible out of it." The other man holding the Bible says "Ok, no problem!" The word FOOLISH! is also written in the lower right hand corner.You are correct that I am arriving at my position with religion, i.e. Christianity. But you too are arriving at your position through the religion of atheism and the belief that evolution is true and has been proved. See, molecules to man evolution explains how everything now (i.e. the evidence), including the fossils and so on, originated. It is a belief system about the past, a religion. Both creation and evolution are *belief systems* about the past based on many assumptions. If I assume that evolution happened, then yes, I can see how you come to your conclusion. But if you were a Christian Creationist, you could easily see how all the evidence matches exactly what we would expect if the Bible were the Truth which it claims it is.You said that you can prove any of the following listed below; so, can you prove to me that mutations or any other evolutionary process can actually be seen to increase the amount of genetic information (DNA) to the genome or total DNA content of a creature? You may be wondering why I am asking this, I am questioning whether or not molecules to man evolution can proceed. If evolution cannot account for new DNA being added to the genome, it is a dead stick and not a good explanation for our origins.

Please, I beg you, stop trying to jam the world into your "creation" account through reason. You just won't get anywhere through reason, if your first choice is to believe the bible (any religious works) as truth, and go from there. What you just said is "[adaptation] would be mutation by natural selection, not evolution"First, the adaptation refers to the adaptation of the species. A population of wingless beetles survives. The missing wings is the mutation, and isn't caused by anything other than a mutation, it's not a result of their being winds, or there being a god, it's just a mutation in the gene code.The gene for the wings can dissappear into the endless gulf of other discarded mutations since those organisms that carry it will most likely die off before reproductive age. It can also be left in the DNA sequence, unused, and not active, unless some other mutation activates it. ( A large percentage of our DNA seems to be unused garbage code).When this happens, your species evolved. What is your point, that beetles can evolve? Yes, they do. All life on earth seems to. Yet you don't think it's due to evolution? Mind-boggling. Who is telling you evolution is "bad" or "wrong"? Only if you arrive at that conclusion WITHOUT religion, can you even begin to have a discussion on it.Evolution in life only requires:DNA replicationMutationsA natural environment (that is, what we see here on earth, a complex system)timeWhich of these do you feel is "incorrect"?

To pnac=ww3:Wow, make up your mind. Either populations change over time (evolve) or they don't. Would your wingless beetles be able to produce wings again if they were somehow beneficial again? You are starting to sound like Darwin and his finches.The original population diversified into two groups, one with and one without wings. The group without wings has lost the information for making wings, i.e. the mutation has destroyed the information. The information has been erased from the genome. The beetles would be able to produce wings again if the information for making wings could be found from another place in the population, e.g. say more beetles with wings flew to this island and had little baby beetles with a non-winged beetle. The off-spring would then produce wings. But that wingless beetles could not form beetles with wings, because it does not have the information for doing so (or the DNA). It had been wiped out by that mutation. I hope that you can understand this. This is not only an example of natural selection - a natural process - but is consistent with the Bible in when it says things stay true to their kind.

The group without wings has lost the information for making wings, i.e. the mutation has destroyed the information. The information has been erased from the genome. But you conveniently ignore Archilochus' post becuase it destroys your position, wingless beetles do NOT lose the information for making wings.In fact, they still retain their wings but the wings are contained under the fused wing shields. No information is lost, a new mutation has caused the wing shields to fuse together so the information is not erased from the genome.The beetles would be able to produce wings again if the information for making wings could be found from another place in the population, e.g. say more beetles with wings flew to this island and had little baby beetles with a non-winged beetle. Again, not true. Another mutation that would unfuse the wing shields could result in flying beetles once again, so your claim is wrong. But that wingless beetles could not form beetles with wings, because it does not have the information for doing so (or the DNA). It had been wiped out by that mutation. I hope that you can understand this.  Wrong, the information was never wiped out, the beetles wings are merely physically closed off by a new mutation that fuses the wing coverings.This is not only an example of natural selection - a natural process - but is consistent with the Bible in when it says things stay true to their kind. Yes, it's natural selection combined with a new mutation adding information to the species, but I don't understand how it's consistant with your erroneous claims or the bible.....

To Archilochus:Even though you can't answer me, I have decided to answer your argument before I leave and do some serious study for my HSC exam. How do you define evolution? If you don't see any, then you aren't using the definition used by evolutionary biologists. The question is who should define the vocabulary of evolutionary biologist, evolutionary biologists or creationists?You are hot on the trail of the basis of our argument. I believe that there are three stage to the overall theory of evolution:1. Astronomical evolution, explains how the universe originated by natural means, including the supposed big bang.2. Chemical evolution, explains (or tries to anyway) how life could arise from lifeless chemicals naturalsitically.3. Biological evolution, explains how a single-celled creature could evolve into the range of creatures we observe today by naturalistic means (evidence for this: transitional forms - if I am wrong, then why is the transitional fossil argument still used by many evolutionists?).You could even have (4):4. Geological evolution, explains how all the geological features came to be.You see, I look at the overall or big picture, while many of you evolutionists only focus on the one very small part (namely half of the biological evolution) of a theory much larger than you think. Evolution is basically a naturalisitic way of explaining how everything could come into being without the need for a Creator God. This is the reason why many people believe it - because evolution justifies atheism. It justifies the immoral life that many people live.Regardless of whose definition we use, evolution must account for the increase of new, previously unseen, genetic information (DNA) being added to change a reptile into a bird and so on, for evolution to be a half decent explanation as to account for our origins. Unless this can be illustrated, evolution is nothing more than a dead stick - it just simply doesn't work. You will have to look at the big picture to understand my point.Actually, we didn't. The first record of a melanic form was in 1848. Presumably other melanic individuals had appeared before this, both in Biston bebularia as well as other moths. We know that a similar mutation occucrred in other moths North America some years after the 1848 record of the B. betualria.That's not true according to the textbook claim: "Before the industrial revolution, *most* of the moths were *light*. This was because the *dark* forms resting on light tree-trunks were more easily spotted, and thus eaten, by birds. When pollution darkened the tree trunks, the *light* forms then had less camouflage, so they were preferentially eaten by birds, and the *dark* forms became dominant in the population.I'll let you chose if there were light and dark peppered moths before and after the industrial revolution. No evolutionary biologist ever claimed that it was. Evolution is a change in the alle frequency in a population over time - like in the case of the peppered moths. Over about 150 years the dark allele increased to almost the entire population and then it decreased again. That is evolution. It is quite apparent that natural selection was the probably cause.  Only that many textbooks the over the whole world have used this famous example as “proof of evolution”. Many evolutionists have used this same argument. Not many creationists accept it. Your later comment that it was a creationist who first proposed natural selection is in error. Natural selection was one of Darwin's theories, also formulated independently by Alfred Russel Wallace.On the contrary, most, if not all creationists accept natural selection. And no, my comment on the creationist who proposed natural selection before Darwin is not in error. His name is Edward Blythe.No, it's not. Natural selection is the differential reproductive success of those individuals with advantageous characteristics.Have you read my definition and yours? Your definition is almost exactly the same as mine, just concentrating on different parts of it. I said that natural selection is the death of creatures that are unable or unfit to survive in an environment. Your definition is that those creatures with survival advantages and characteristics will survive. They are exactly the same. In some cases, however, natural selection may totally wipe out a certain type of animal from a given environment without “choosing” any animals to survive. Natural selection involves the death of creatures that are unfit to survive in an environment, which is what I commented on. Obviously, those creatures that survive in that environment must have some survival advantages. You just reworded my definition…What are you talking about? Please define information. What does "new" information have to do with natural selection or evolution? Evolution is NOT defined by evolutionary biologists as an increase in information. So I ask again, please define information in a meaningful way as it applies to DNA and the genome of an organism.New information applies to my definition of evolution, i.e. molecules to man evolution. You see, everything is supposed to have come from some single-celled creature that supposedly came from some primeval sea, a.k.a. lifeless chemicals. Now for things to evolve, or become more complex, massive amounts of genetic information, or DNA, must be added to a creature’s genome (the total DNA content). Therefore, evolution must provide a mechanism that provides a way for new genetic information, DNA, to be added to the genome. Currently, mutations, natural selection and no other evolutionary process cannot account for this. Information is the DNA, or I should say that DNA is a very complex information system. When I say an addition of new information, I mean more letters or more DNA added to the overall total DNA content.Are you sure? What about animals that had a combination of both long and short hair. Such fur would function more efficiently as insulation that either long or short alone.So what? The allele frequency, even in your example has still changed. A change in an allele frequency in a population over time is, by definition, evolution. Yes I am sure. Long fur will insulate the dog a lot better than medium fur will. You do not have to be a scientist to figure that one out. The example given would be natural selection only, not evolution. Evolution is not needed to explain such an event, as natural selection clearly accounts for it. Natural selection should not be confused with the term evolution. Once again, noting the difference in our definitions of evolution and how you are not looking at the big picture.What bible tract did you get that from. Evolution does not require that dogs turn into something else. That is a strawman.No, I don’t think so. Let me explain, evolution (the big picture) involves a certain kind of animal turning into a different kind of animal, e.g. a reptile turning into a mammal for example. The above was to prove that natural selection does not add any new information to the genome and thus, that natural selection is not a friend of evolution (remembering the big picture).Well, since you have natural selection completely wrong, it must not go too well with the Biblical account. By the way, now you have introduced another word that has no meaning in the context. What is a "kind." Please be specific so that I will be able to recognize a "kind." Please show why a "kind" only has the ability to lose information.As shown above, our definitions were essentially the same. In some cases, a kind is like a family. Hopefully the site Variation, information and the created kind should be able to answer this question. God created all things in “Kinds” – a supergiant group. For example, we believe that all bears came from the one kind, while all dogs, including wolves, dingos, and domestic dogs came from one dog kind.It isn't a fraud. Why would you say that? And it isn't evidence for evolution, it is an observation of evolution. The allele frequency of the moths changed (twice) over time. The most reasonable explanation seems to be that it was the result of natural selection. Natural selection is one of several mechanisms of evolution.It is a fraud because these moths never even rested on tree trunks in the daylight! Dead moths were glued or pinned onto trees to provide impressive photography. The ONLY reason is natural selection. Evolution is not needed. We observe all of this happening – it is an observation of natural selection – not of evolution, be sure to remember the big picture (i.e. molecules to man evolution). All of the observations that we see today can be explained without creation and evolution! Neither are needed in the explanations. The peppered moths can be explained by natural selection – which is a separate thing on its own and should not be confused with evolution. If you observe something, then that observation becomes evidence for your theory. For instance, take the model of the solar system. It has been observed that the planets and the Earth orbit around the sun (heliocentric model), not everything orbiting around the world (geocentric model). This observation proved that everything did not orbit around the Earth, but every planet orbited around the sun. Thus, this observation would provide devastating evidence for the geocentric model and powerful evidence for the heliocentric model. Thus the observation of evolution becomes evidence for evolution.I suspect that it is actually you who has no idea what you are talking about. Explain this to me. There is a population of moths that are peppered. All of the moths in the entire population are peppered. Then one day, a black moth appears. Investigation shows that it is because of a new allele that has arisen in the moth population. So something new that wasn't there before has now been found. How is that not new information in the genome of peppered moths?Well, there were light and dark peppered moths before anyways. Assuming that you are correct, the loss of information (i.e. a mutation) could have started up a recessive gene that may produce a black peppered moth. Recessive genes come into action is the primary gene is not present. But I think you will find that the peppered moths have come in two varieties before the industrial revolution.Not sure how you can tell that since very little is mentioned about his methods.Because the article mentioned quite a bit about the observations that he was conducting. These are very important in the scientific method.In reverse? The scientific method begins with an observation. Then an hypothesis is proposed that will explain the observation. Then a prediction is made that must be true as a consequence, if the prediction is correct. Then methods are devised to test the prediction. What is described in the paper is the last step. Majerus already has his hypothesis and his prediction and is accumulating the data that will support them.Once again came from the article:“Many biologists start with theories and then test them in the field. Majerus takes the opposite and less fashionable approach: "There's another way of doing science, which is first find your organism and look at it incredibly closely, for a long time, in great detail and see what questions it asks you," he says.”But we already have a perfectly good explanation. It is an observation of evolution that exactly matches the definition. By the way, there is no doubt that the color differences are caused by alleles of a single gene. The chanage in the frequencies in those alleles over 150 years is, by definition, evolution. The cause may or may not be natural selection (no one has proposed another mechanism) caused by bird predation (no one has proposed another cause.)You said that the colour changes are caused by a single gene. This further goes to imply that a mutation could disable the primary gene and activate the recessive gene. This is of course IMHO. What you classify as evolution, I call “variation within a kind”. You aren’t working off the big picture idea.

Presumably other melanic individuals had appeared before this, both in Biston bebularia as well as other moths. We know that a similar mutation occucrred in other moths North America some years after the 1848 record of the B. betualria.There are actually several alleles of the gene responsible for color that form a dominence hierarchy with the fully black morph (called carbonaria) as the top dominant and the typical as recessive. The intermediate forms are referred to as insularia. They are uncommon. At any rate, by 1895, 98% of observed B. betularia in industrialized areas were carbonaria.Exactly. That the change in moth color was due to natural selection was first posed in about 1896 by J.W. Tutt. The funny thing is that as pollution increased, the moths turned black, and then as the pollution was cleaned up, they turned white again. carbonaria have become pretty scarce.Of course not. No evolutionary biologist ever claimed that it was. Evolution is a change in the alle frequency in a population over time - like in the case of the peppered moths. Over about 150 years the dark allele increased to almost the entire population and then it decreased again. That is evolution. It is quite apparent that natural selection was the probably cause. You see, no one has proposed another explanation that has stood up to examination. Majerus is trying to verify that the evolution really was the result of predation by birds.

Neither Kettlewell nor Majerus mentions creation or even takes it into account. But you have believed creationists who probably don't know as much as you. Kettlewell's work was not a fraud. He did the best he could with what he had and presented his work in peer reviewed literature. His work has nothing to do with creation. But it seems that creationists want to believe that all science is permanent and never changing. Thus, when re-evaluation of Kettlewell's work is done and flaws are pointed out, creationists loudly proclaim fraud and a victory for creation. Funny that it wasn't "creation scientists" who pointed out the flaws and it wasn't "creation scientists" who publicized them. It was done by two evolutionary biologists who didn't even mention creation.But we already have a perfectly good explanation. It is an observation of evolution that exactly matches the definition.

Don't forget to explain why the addition of a new allele to the genome of a population is not new information.

To Demon38:But you conveniently ignore Archilochus' post becuase it destroys your position, wingless beetles do NOT lose the information for making wings.In fact, they still retain their wings but the wings are contained under the fused wing shields. No information is lost, a new mutation has caused the wing shields to fuse together so the information is not erased from the genome.The whole wingless beetles can be summarised below of which I got Has evolution really been observed? (summary article) For example, beetles losing their wings. A particular winged beetle type lives on large continental areas; the same beetle type on a small windy island has no wings.What happened is easy to imagine. Every now and then in beetle populations, there might be a mutational defect which prevents wings from forming. That is, the 'wing-making' information is lost or scrambled in some way.The damaged gene (a gene is like a long 'sentence' carrying one part of the total instructions recorded on the DNA) is then going to be passed to all that beetle's offspring, and to their offspring, as it is copied over and over. All these descendant beetles will be wingless.If a beetle with such a wingless defect is living on the Australian mainland, for example, it will have less chance to fly away from beetle-eaters, so it will be more likely to be eliminated by 'survival of the fittest' before it can leave offspring. Such so-called 'natural selection' can help to eliminate (or at least reduce the buildup of) such genetic mistakes.However, on the windy island, the beetles which can fly tend to get blown into the sea, so not having wings is an advantage. In time, the elimination of all the winged ones will ensure that only those of this new 'wingless' variety survive, which have therefore been 'naturally selected'.It would be nice if you could provide evidence for this...I must also confess, that I have been on Google and found no mention of anything about wingless beetles having fully formed wings beneath their "fused wing shields". Another site states the following:"Today, there is a small handful of cases in which a genetic mutation has helped a creature to survive better than those without it. These types of mutations are referred to as “beneficial mutations.” But even these beneficial mutations do not improve the code in DNA: rather than adding any meaningful information, they destroy it. For example, Darwin pointed to a case in which a genetic mutation caused flying beetles on a small desert island to lose their wings (the “wing-making” information in the DNA was lost or scrambled in some way). However, due to this loss, the beetles had a better chance of survival because they were less likely to be blown into the sea. Thus, the mutation was “beneficial” to the beetle population because it helped them to survive better in their environment. This shows how even a beneficial mutation can be damaging to the DNA code; in this case the mutation involved a loss or corruption of the information (or genes) for making wings."In either case, my argument still stands - the mutation has lost information and natural selection has also resulted in a loss of information from the population's original genome. ASSAUMING that you are true, the mutation has caused a loss of the information for the wings to form properly, and hence, result in the wings being fused. Hence, information is lost or erased.Again, not true. Another mutation that would unfuse the wing shields could result in flying beetles once again, so your claim is wrong. News flash: there has been no mutation that has thus far resulted in a gain of any genetic information to the genome. As such, all mutations result in a loss of genetic information. Thus another mutation would not aid the beetle's cause and unfuse the wing shields - it would make it worse. I still don't believe you on this point.Wrong, the information was never wiped out, the beetles wings are merely physically closed off by a new mutation that fuses the wing coverings.Assuming that you are correct of which I am not convinced until you provide some evidence. Not that I don't trust you, but I would like to have evidence. Yes, it's natural selection combined with a new mutation adding information to the species, but I don't understand how it's consistant with your erroneous claims or the bible.....The mutation has resulted in a loss of information to the species. It has lost the information for making the wings properly - not gained any new information as you claim. The fact that natural selection and mutation does not provide any more new information to the genome ensures that creatures stay "true to their kind" as the Bible says in Genesis 1.

These types of mutations are referred to as “beneficial mutations.” But even these beneficial mutations do not improve the code in DNA: rather than adding any meaningful information, they destroy it. For example, Darwin pointed to a case in which a genetic mutation caused flying beetles on a small desert island to lose their wings (the “wing-making” information in the DNA was lost or scrambled in some way). However, due to this loss, the beetles had a better chance of survival because they were less likely to be blown into the sea. Thus, the mutation was “beneficial” to the beetle population because it helped them to survive better in their environment. This shows how even a beneficial mutation can be damaging to the DNA code; in this case the mutation involved a loss or corruption of the information (or genes) for making wings."In either case, my argument still stands - the mutation has lost information and natural selection has also resulted in a loss of information from the population's original genome. ASSAUMING that you are true, the mutation has caused a loss of the information for the wings to form properly, and hence, result in the wings being fused. Hence, information is lost or erased.Again, not true. Another mutation that would unfuse the wing shields could result in flying beetles once again, so your claim is wrong. News flash: there has been no mutation that has thus far resulted in a gain of any genetic information to the genome. As such, all mutations result in a loss of genetic information. Thus another mutation would not aid the beetle's cause and unfuse the wing shields - it would make it worse. I still don't believe you on this point.Wrong, the information was never wiped out, the beetles wings are merely physically closed off by a new mutation that fuses the wing coverings.Assuming that you are correct of which I am not convinced until you provide some evidence. Not that I don't trust you, but I would like to have evidence. Yes, it's natural selection combined with a new mutation adding information to the species, but I don't understand how it's consistant with your erroneous claims or the bible.....The mutation has resulted in a loss of information to the species. It has lost the information for making the wings properly - not gained any new information as you claim. The fact that natural selection and mutation does not provide any more new information to the genome ensures that creatures stay "true to their kind" as the Bible says in Genesis 1.

From the link:This was pretty much my understanding of how natural selection was viewed before Darwin.Nonetheless, I think that my point still stands. Darwin proposed that natural selection is responsible for the diversification of species. This pre-Darwin concept denies this. My understanding is that anti-evolutionists refused to accept that natural selection could have led to the diversification of species. Until recently, when they realized that evolutionary theory could help out in their how-many-animals-could-fit-on-the-ark dilemma; now they suddenly take an idea from evolutionary science and propose that suddenly all the present species could "micro-evolve" from a few ancestral "kinds" on the ark.

To Ursus maritimus:I would be interested in know who was the first creationist to finally accept that natural selection is a real phenomenon, and when they accepted it.Keeping true to my word - that I would find out who - I am back. The Christian Creationist who expounded the idea of natural selection before Darwin did is called Edward Blythe. You can read more about him and his contribution, as well as the history behind Darwin's natural selection idea, at the following link: Darwin and the search for an evolutionary mechanism.As for Christians attacking natural selection, it has been revealed to me that this may not have happened to the extent that you are implying. Some uniformed Christians, however, may have reacted to this idea, as the mere suggestion of it being the mechanism Darwin posulated for his evolutionary theory would have probably cast it in bad light. Rather, what was alleged to have occured with the help of this "mechanism", evolution of the molecules to man type was vehemently attacked, e.g. the Evolution Protest Movement of Great Britain led by John Ambrose Fleming.

What happened is easy to imagine. Every now and then in beetle populations, there might be a mutational defect which prevents wings from forming. That is, the 'wing-making' information is lost or scrambled in some way. We don't have to imagine anything, merely observe what goes on in nature.The wing making information is NOT lost, the beetles still retain their wings, they are just trapped under fused wing covers. From here:http://wiki.cotch.net/index.php/Unus...elling_beetles You are proven wrong by reality, do more research next time.The damaged gene (a gene is like a long 'sentence' carrying one part of the total instructions recorded on the DNA) is then going to be passed to all that beetle's offspring, and to their offspring, as it is copied over and over. All these descendant beetles will be wingless. And of course, this isn't the case at all, the beetles still retain their wings, they don't lose them through a 'damaged gene'. Really, did you do any research whatsoever or just make this nonsense up!Such so-called 'natural selection' can help to eliminate (or at least reduce the buildup of) such genetic mistakes. No genetic mistake at all in this case, mutations can add or subtract genetic information.It would be nice if you could provide evidence for this... I've now done so......I must also confess, that I have been on Google and found no mention of anything about wingless beetles having fully formed wings beneath their "fused wing shields".  Try entering "flightless beetles with wings", I found a couple of sites right off the bat that explains them. Or you could look at a book on beetle anatomy...In either case, my argument still stands - the mutation has lost information and natural selection has also resulted in a loss of information from the population's original genome. ASSAUMING that you are true, the mutation has caused a loss of the information for the wings to form properly, and hence, result in the wings being fused. Hence, information is lost or erased. No, you are wrong, simple as that, you can't weasel out of it now. You claimed that these beetles lost the genes to produce wings, this is not the case, their flighlessness is NOT due to a "loss of genetic information'.News flash: there has been no mutation that has thus far resulted in a gain of any genetic information to the genome. As such, all mutations result in a loss of genetic information. Thus another mutation would not aid the beetle's cause and unfuse the wing shields - it would make it worse. I still don't believe you on this point. This is rubbish! Whether you believe me or not doesn't matter, once again, reality doesn't depend on what you believe! We have observed gains in genetic 'information', mutations can add or subtract characteristics. All mutations don't remove genetic information as you so incorrectly claim. The mechanisms for increasing the size of the genenome are known and have been observed. Gene duplication can increase the size of the genome and point mutations can change the function of the new copy. Again, this has been observed, look it up if you have the guts, it completely invalidates your ridiculous claim.The mutation has resulted in a loss of information to the species. It has lost the information for making the wings properly - not gained any new information as you claim. The fact that natural selection and mutation does not provide any more new information to the genome ensures that creatures stay "true to their kind" as the Bible says in Genesis 1. Lost the information for making wings properly??!! Let's see the evidence! It still retains the information for making wings, but since the wings are never utilized, because of the fused wing covers, they atrophy, this has nothing to do with the 'loss of information to make the wings properly'. Your arguement is falsified.

To Demon38:But you conveniently ignore Archilochus' post becuase it destroys your position, wingless beetles do NOT lose the information for making wings.In fact, they still retain their wings but the wings are contained under the fused wing shields. No information is lost, a new mutation has caused the wing shields to fuse together so the information is not erased from the genome.The whole wingless beetles can be summarised below of which I got Has evolution really been observed? (summary article) For example, beetles losing their wings. A particular winged beetle type lives on large continental areas; the same beetle type on a small windy island has no wings.What happened is easy to imagine. Every now and then in beetle populations, there might be a mutational defect which prevents wings from forming. That is, the 'wing-making' information is lost or scrambled in some way.The damaged gene (a gene is like a long 'sentence' carrying one part of the total instructions recorded on the DNA) is then going to be passed to all that beetle's offspring, and to their offspring, as it is copied over and over. All these descendant beetles will be wingless.If a beetle with such a wingless defect is living on the Australian mainland, for example, it will have less chance to fly away from beetle-eaters, so it will be more likely to be eliminated by 'survival of the fittest' before it can leave offspring. Such so-called 'natural selection' can help to eliminate (or at least reduce the buildup of) such genetic mistakes.However, on the windy island, the beetles which can fly tend to get blown into the sea, so not having wings is an advantage. In time, the elimination of all the winged ones will ensure that only those of this new 'wingless' variety survive, which have therefore been 'naturally selected'.It would be nice if you could provide evidence for this...I must also confess, that I have been on Google and found no mention of anything about wingless beetles having fully formed wings beneath their "fused wing shields".

I see. Then what you are claiming is that creationists are the ones who should define the vocabulary to be used by evolutionary biologists. Would it then be ok for atheists to define the vocabulary of Christianity?You are confused. Stelar evolution only means change. It has nothing to do with reproductive organisms. Your misunderstanding and incorrect effort to group physical processes of change under the "theory of evolution" is incorrect.Nope. Chemical evolution has nothing to do with life. It has to do with changes that chemicals undergo when combined under certain conditions. The science of the origin of life is called abiogenesis. Life is a precondition of evolution. If you wish to claim that "POOF - my god did it" is the source of that life, then that doesn't argue for or against evolution.[quote]3. Biological evolution, explains how a single-celled creature could evolve into the range of creatures we observe today by naturalistic means (evidence for this: transitional forms - if I am wrong, then why is the transitional fossil argument still used by many evolutionists?).[/qote]While you claim to be seeing the big picture, you actually have a very restricted idea of evolution. Evolution is a change in the frequencies of alleles in a population over time. Unless you can apply that to the big bang, changes in chemicals, and even the origin of life, you are not talking about evolution. You are trying to apply your misunderstanding the the science of biology. You are demanding that you should be able to define what biologists mean by the vocabulary they use.Yet another application of a different meaning of the word in an effort to group everything in science that you don't understand and won't accept under one word.No. You aren't looking at the big picture. You are lumping what you don't like under one word without understanding any of it.Now you are being insulting. Evolution makes no statments about your god. For that matter, neither does cosmology, astronomy, chemistry, physics or geology.Wouldn't it be nice if you actually made an effort to learn what you are talking about. My bet is that I am as moral as you. One of the most respeted biological authors of our day is a devout Christian. How rude and insulting for you to claim that only your version of Christianity is correct. How pompous can you be?Great. Then define information. If it is unseen, how do you know that it didn't increase. Isn't it necessary that there should be a way to quantify informatiion before you can make claims as to whether it has or has not increased? Again, evolution doesn't account for the origin of life, only the origin of the changes in the heritable characteristics that are observed in populations of living organisms.My bet is I know more about it than you do. I am aware of the "big picture" because I know that evolutionary biology doesn't apply the the origin of the universe. Please explain how the origin of the universe applies to genetic information. Why does a change in a population of organisms require an increase in information?Actually, it is quite correct. You misunderstand. The text book was trying to make it simple so that you would understand. The text book wasn't simple enough. The first record of carbonaria was in 1848. The discussion you quote was trying to explain quite simply, so that you might understand why the change took place. There is no record of anyone ever seeing a carbonaria before 1848. It is probably a safe assumption that an occasional mutation caused some to be born from time to time, but they were not able to reproduce to the extent that they were ever noted before 1848.I only know what history tells me. Cite the books. As far as I know, the evolution of the peppered moths is used as an example of natural selection. You don't seem to have understood. Again, cite the books. None I ever used ever claimed that it was proof of evolution. No. Not even you actually accept natural selection. You don't understand it enough to know what it is. By the way, Edward Blythe was a Lamarkian. That is not Darwin's theory.Which demonstrates your failure to see the big picture.No. That's not what I said. I said that natural selection is differential reproductive success. I said that those organisms that possessed advantageous characteristics would tend to reach reproductive age more frequently and therefore they will tend to produce more offspring, while those with disadvantageous characteristics will tend to produce fewer offspring. As a result, the heritable characteristics of the population will change over time.They are not. Read carefully. Try to look at the big picture rather than limit your thinking to such a narrow concept.No. I used the same definitions I have been using since my undergraduate days when I took my first course in evolutionary biology. You have a rather naive grasp of an important mechanism of evolution.Then you don't actually have a definition of information that is meaningful. I didn't think you did. By the way, increase in the amount (i.e., more letters) of DNA has often been observed. The mechanisms of evolution account for it quite nicely.Now please try again an define information in a way that is meaningful to DNA.And a combination of both long and short hair will insulate better than both. That is why so many animals of the Arctic have a combination of both long and short hair. By the way, short wooly hair is a better insulator than long straight hair.As I pointed out, you don't understand what either evolution or natural selection are. Evolution is a change in the relative frequencies in inheritable characteristics in a population over generations. If the number of long haired animals became more frequent in the population, then evolution has occurred. Natural selection may (or may not) be the mechanism that caused the change.Evolution doesn't explain the event. The event is an example of evolution - a change in the frequency of alleles in a populatioin over time. The explanation may or may not be evolution by natural selection. You merely asserted that based on your imagined case.Certainly not. Natural selection is but one of the mechanisms that cause evolution.Once again noting how you think that you should be the one to define what evolutionary biologists mean by the words they use. You want to lump all of science that you find in disagreement with you religion under one term, without making an honest effort to understand any of it.It doesn't matter what you think. You are wrong simply because you have learned your "evolution" from creationists.No, it doesn't. The big picture of evolution is that it is the observed change in the heritable characteristics in populations of organims over generations. In cases where populations become fragmented, the separate (reproductively isolated) segments of the population will accumulate genetic differences. The longer they are separated, the more likely it will be that they will be unable to interbreed if united. This is observed. The result is the establishment of separate species.What is information? Natural selection is one of the most important mechanisms of evolution. You see, there is no requirement in evolutionary theory that there be an increase in information. Someone lied to you and you didn't know enough to realize it. You just took it because it is what you wanted to hear.Not sure how this remark defines "kind," but nevertheless I have shown that it isn't true. It is your misunderstanding of the theory.Then you are just throwing around words without knowing what they mean. Instead you give me a link to a page of pseudoscience. Are those the ones who lied to you?Do you have any evidence for that? And still, I don't know what you mean by kind.You believe that? Based on what? Please define a "kind" in such a way that they can be recognized without error. Exactly what are the genetic limits that prevent bears and dogs from being of the same "kind?" Please be specific - you may reference scientific literature, but you must present some actual evidence of a real barrier in the mechanics of genetics and offer solid data about how this barrier works. Otherwise, you are postulating your conclusions. If you are going to make nebulous references to "information", please do not fail to offer a specific definition.How do you know? Kettlewell was testing the idea the white moths were more visible to birds in polluted areas and visa versa. He showed that that is indeed true.But no one ever claimed that they were glued on the trees for any other reason that to show the protective coloration. Why is that a fraud? Wouldn't it be better that you actually learned the facts rather than allowing someone else to dupe you with this misinformation.Not needed? It is evolution. The collor of the moths is genetic - caused by 2 alleles of a single gene. The frequencies of those alleles were observed to change in the populations of moths over many generations. It is by definition, evolution.But above you were claiming that it was a fraud. Kettlewell was trying to show that the moths changed color because of natural selection, i.e., the predation of birds. It can't be observed and a fraud at the same time. Kettlewell wasn't trying to "prove" evolution. He could see the evolution.Actually, creation explains nothing. Evolution is an observation that is explained by theories that explain why populations of animals change. One explanation is the theory of natural selection.I wish you would pick a horse and ride it. It can't be a fraud and an explanation at the same time. The evolution observed is explained by natural selection.You don't know how science works either, do you?It has? Silly me. I thought that it was the conclusion made from an analysis of lots of data and measurements. You have a faulty understanding of science.You simply have no idea what you are talking about. Please, who made these observations and where were they published?Again I have to correct you. Dark moths were not observed before 1848. Similar mutations have been observed in other species of moths both in Europe and in the United States. Merely claiming that there was no change is ducking the question. You didn't bother to inform yourself of the facts and now you return to your incorrect assertion again and again after having been informed of your error.You have again asserted the question without thought and without informing yourself. The first melanic was observed in 1848. A similar mutation has been observed in other species since. In all cases, the dark allele is the dominant. So the question is, in a population that had no dark forms in which a dark form arises by the mutation of a dominant dark form, how is the addition of a new allele not an increase in information. Please (I ask once again) define information as it applies to genetics and DNA. Please try to make sense this time.Nope. And since the melanic form is the dominant allele, your point is moot.The article said very little about his observations and almost nothing about his methods.Don't those science writers make things so clear for you people who have no idea of what science is or how it works?Actually, what is tested is the hypothesis. It is tested by making a prediction of a necessary observation and then devising a test of the prediction. Only when the hypothesis is supported should it be called a theory.And you don't have any picture. You have no idea of what recessive really means, do you. Actually, since the first observation of a black peppered moth in 1848, several other mutations have caused other variations of color in peppered moths. They are intermediate between the typica and the carbonaria, but they are extremely rare. These alleles form a hierarchy of dominence in which the carbonaria is the full dominant, and the typica is fully recessive.Please define "kind." Please define "variation." Please explain the origin of this "variation in kind."

Well, good luck with your upcoming exams emoticonXGood However, I'd like to respond to one of your points directed at Archilochus who is now on a permanent forum vacation.Well, evolutionists are focusing on small parts of the theory for a reason.In my experience I have met very few atheists who use evolution as a reason to justify their viewpoint on life. Quite to the contary, most of the major objections to religion are based on philosphical issues and the confrontational nature of monotheistic belief systems.In case you have not read the Origin of the Species, evolution is not an idea that was concieved to explain life without the need for supernatural involvement. It is an attempt to explain patterns in nature relating to the characteristics and structures of living things.Like the majority of science, it works with what can be measured, modelled and tested- the only reason this issue is so contentious here is because our subject matter-explaining life, and particularly human life- was traditionally a subject where beliefs (ie. Genesis as the story of creation in Christianity) were the only explaination that was permitted/available.Ever strike you as funny how no Creationists ever kick up a fuss about dentistry? what about metallurgy? or maybe even aerodynamics? All based on scientific principles, just like evolution and other sciences that study issues relating to the history and age of the universe we live in.So to come back to my first statement, evolutionists are focusing on the details in these discussions because that is what typically is attacked by anti-evolutionists. These details are explained and defended because they have not just be imagined out of thin air- they are based on testing, observation and analysis.Now if those, such as Young Earth Creationists, were actually to the point about their objection to evolution- it is wrong because it is seen to exclude God, undermine the Bible and the very morals it encourages we could cut to the chase and debate the real point of contention here.But instead, time after time we see "Archeopteryex is not a transitional fossil" and "burial mechanisms of fossils during the flood" and so on. These are direct attempts to contradict the fine detail of careful and painstaking scientific research- are you really surprised the details are so vigourously defended?To finish with lets consider your final point on morality- do you really believe people are immoral by default if they are not a Christian? I invite you to consider immorality in Christians and moral atheistists before you respond.

I am mildly surprised to find that you accept the principle of natural selection. I am astonished to learn that you believe this process adds no "information".The "information" added is about how to survive changed circumstances. If you are unhappy about the peppered moth, try the Polar Bear. The fossil record is remarkably complete, and the mechanism of the evolution of the Polar Bear from the Brown Bear remarkably clear.We are up to our eyeballs in "intermediate fossils", yet along comes a Creationist to ask: "Where is the intermediate fossible which should be there between 1027 and 1028? Clearly evolution is a fraud!"IzzyemoticonXBanghead

To apathy:Call me crazy, but I still don't see any evolution in the peppered moths!! We had light and dark moths before the industrial revolution, we now still have light and dark moths. The only thing that has changed is the population ratio, assumably by *natural selection*. Natural selection is not proof of evolution by any means. Creationists recognise it and accept it as it goes in nicely with the creationary model. Natural selection is basically the death of a particular type of animal if they are unsuited to the environment. In a given environment (e.g. a very cold region), some (e.g. the long-haired dogs) will be more likely to survive, and so pass on their information, than others. Natural selection can favour some sets of information above others, and can eliminate some of the existing information in the population, but it can't create any new information. An example, consider the cold environment mentioned above. We take a population of both long, short and medium, haired dogs to this environment. Over time, very short time, the population will only consist of the long haired dogs as the short and medium haired dogs would freeze and be wiped out by the cold conditions. So, as a result, the population as a whole has lost the information for making short haired dogs and has not gained any new information. What did we have when we first took the dogs to the environment? Dogs (varying in hair sizes). What did we get after a short amount of time? Dogs (only the long hair size). There is no evolution occuring here, we had dogs before, dogs after. The only difference is that the gene for making short hair has been eradicated from the population by natural selection -- that is it. This is the essense of natural selection - and goes in nicely with the Biblical account of our origins, i.e. variation within a kind and that kind's have the ability to only lose information - not gain it.So even if the peppered moth case was really true, and not a fraud, it still would not be evidence for evolution as opposed to creation. Anyone who says other wise, does not really know what they are talking about unless new genetic information is somehow being added to the moth's total DNA content, i.e. their genome, in which case you might have a point.Would any creationists like to challenge anything about this article or the concept? His method appears to be good, i.e. using observations and experimental data, as well as repeatability. He is using the scientific method (in reverse as he is collecting the observations and experimental data and then will draw a conclusion based on the evidence and possibly his own bias. This is yet to be determined, however. Can you keep us informed of his progress? Just to finish off:Majerus's research has focused on sexual selection, sex-ratio manipulation, and the evolution of melanism (the darkening of body color) in various moths, butterflies, and ladybirds.  I do not know all that much about peppered moths, just the story and why it is a fraud and even if it was not, why it does not support evolution over creation. But perhaps the darkening of teh body colour can be explained by the varriation within a kind?

Welcome Izzy. I hope you will stick around to add some diversity of ideas so that the discussion might evolve.You would be even more surprised if you knew how he defined natural selection. If you really want a surprise, check out how Montalban can't distinguish between natural selection and artificial selection.And I'm sure that your astonishment would grow if you could get Nu Leader to define information. From other discussions it is evident that Nu leader confuses information with meaning.Ah ha! Someone who understands the application of information theory to biological organisms. By the biological specific definition of information, the genome of any organism is information about the environment in which it lives.Way back when I was an undergraduate my professor of evolutionary biology told us about a careless zoo keeper that put polar bears and brown bears in the same pen during a remodeling. The result was a litter of hybrid offspring. It seems that polar bears and brown bears are perfectly interfertile. Not only that, it has been shown that the offspring are also interfertile with either species. DNA analysis has been able to distinguish brown bears from polar bears except in the case of the brown bears of the ABC islands. They are indistinguishable from polar bears.And yet, even if a brown bear where white or a polar bear were brown, they are so obviously different in morphology that they would be classified as separate species. The differences go far beyond color.And yet, even though creationists ask for detailed lists of every creature in transition over a period of several million years, I have never found a single creationist who can trace his ancestors back to Adam, a period of only about 6,000 years. The best I can do is to trace my ancestors back to the 1600s.

I am rather passionate on this subject. My mother died at the age of 58 in 1963, after several years of declining health.After working through specialist after specialist we finally were given an explanation which made sense, and has since been confirmed in many other cases.I could have said "Penicillin" killed my mother, but this would be inaccurate. After WWII penicillin was the "wonder drug", dispensed for all sorts of things, in fairly moderate dosages. It was many years before we learned that a modest dosage kills off MOST of the bacteria, leaving behind a bunch of tough little survivors who continue to breed.The doctor explain that colonies of bacteria had evolved within my mother's both that nothing available at the time could totally exterminate.The offfical cause of death was emphysema, a bit surprising since she had never smoked a cigarette in her life."Survival of the fittest" in this case means the penicillin-resistant bacteria."Evolution" means the creation of new populations, immune to the wonder drug. "Increase in information" means the reduction in the "noise" of the penicillin-susceptble genes, and a consequent increase in useable information.Go back and read your Shannon if you doubt it.Will some creationist point out the errors in the above? But if you do, make sure you protect your identity.After all these years it still hurts.IzzyemoticonXBanghead

The result was a litter of hybrid offspring. It seems that polar bears and brown bears are perfectly interfertile. Not only that, it has been shown that the offspring are also interfertile with either species. DNA analysis has been able to distinguish brown bears from polar bears except in the case of the brown bears of the ABC islands. They are indistinguishable from polar bears.And yet, even if a brown bear where white or a polar bear were brown, they are so obviously different in morphology that they would be classified as separate species. The differences go far beyond color.And yet, even though creationists ask for detailed lists of every creature in transition over a period of several million years, I have never found a single creationist who can trace his ancestors back to Adam, a period of only about 6,000 years. The best I can do is to trace my ancestors back to the 1600s.

Then you are probably a bit older than I. My mother was 45 in 1963, the year I entered the Army. My mother will be 86 next month and we have a party planned with her older sister, nieces, grand nephews, grandchildren, and great grand children.I am so sorry for your early loss. My father died at 73 from complications after a "successful" surgery. It was still difficult.I certainly hope that you mean as opposed to those strains that were not immune to penicillin.And we are still trying to keep ahead of the evolution of bacteria (or bugs, as Montalban calls them).No. It is an increase in resistant genes and therefore an increase in information.I have read Shannon and I like my version better.I'm not sure that your comment will encourage any sort of discussion. Certainly no one is glad because your mother died so young. Not even creationists are likely to be gleeful.Certainly it does.

I am rather passionate on this subject. My mother died at the age of 58 in 1963, after several years of declining health.After working through specialist after specialist we finally were given an explanation which made sense, and has since been confirmed in many other cases.I could have said "Penicillin" killed my mother, but this would be inaccurate. After WWII penicillin was the "wonder drug", dispensed for all sorts of things, in fairly moderate dosages. It was many years before we learned that a modest dosage kills off MOST of the bacteria, leaving behind a bunch of tough little survivors who continue to breed.The doctor explain that colonies of bacteria had evolved within my mother's both that nothing available at the time could totally exterminate.The offfical cause of death was emphysema, a bit surprising since she had never smoked a cigarette in her life."Survival of the fittest" in this case means the penicillin-resistant bacteria."Evolution" means the creation of new populations, immune to the wonder drug. "Increase in information" means the reduction in the "noise" of the penicillin-susceptble genes, and a consequent increase in useable information.Go back and read your Shannon if you doubt it.Will some creationist point out the errors in the above? But if you do, make sure you protect your identity.After all these years it still hurts.IzzyemoticonXBanghead

My mom can only trace her family back a few generations. By the time we get to the clan that lived in Ohio in the middle of the 19th century, the records get very confusing and very incomplete. By creationist logic, we must then accept that my ancestors, white Americans, were specially created in North America by God.

Welcome Izzy. I hope you will stick around to add some diversity of ideas so that the discussion might evolve.You would be even more surprised if you knew how he defined natural selection. If you really want a surprise, check out how Montalban can't distinguish between natural selection and artificial selection.And I'm sure that your astonishment would grow if you could get Nu Leader to define information.

There's a difference between these tests.Accipitridae, (and you by implication that you've not picked it up and called him to task) are mixing up the ancestory of individuals - giving a list of every single member of a family, to that of a species by species account. The difference is both of scale, and testability; written records aren't as long lasting as biological ones. You should be able to use science for whole species ancestory; after-all scientists can tell us with confidence that chimps are near relations, gorillas relations a bit further removed etc. Or, should we question those that tell us chimps are near relations?

Do you know what an analogy is? I guess not since you failed to understand Darwin's analogy between artificial selection and natural selection.Actually, creationists often haul out their Bibles and claim that the geneologies in Genesis are somehow evidence of a young earth. And yet, none of them can trace their ancestors back more than a couple of hundred years. Somehow ancient nomads could trace their ancestry for thousands of years and today, with detailed record keeping, few people can do the same.The problem with creationism is that it can't be tested at all. It's funny to hear a creationist talk about testability.[quotet=Montalban]You should be able to use science for whole species ancestory;[/quote]Why? It seems that you didn't understand the question. Creationists demand that specific organisms be pointed in the transition between species. Creationists demand to see the fossils of specific ancestral species.So now you are going to lecture us on phylogenetics.Pardon me if I laugh.

Yes, one requires a pen and paper, the other years of research, technology, and knowledge base.I'd like to know "why" we should be able to do this?Do you think we can collect DNA samples from every species in history?Do you think science is to the point yet where we can actually do this, and/or compare things with that degree of certainty? You agree that weather is based on physics, yet we cannot yet predict the weather much better than 50/50..why? Doesn't science work?Of course it does. But it doesn't make up answers to problems that are still being worked on. I know, I know, christianity DOES make up the answers and present them all in a single tome that seems to change yet is irrefutable, but I digress...The real question here is "why do scientists tell us our nearest related species is the chimpanzee"? Should you first understand WHY they make this claim, before you start to question the claim? Wait, I know...you'd answer "no, because it disagrees with the bible so it's GOT to be wrong". Did they make this claim to tick you off? Surely not. Did they like the findings? Maybe, maybe not. It's not as cool as being forged by a god. But hey, humility isn't for every human either is it?Showing the statistically difference in the DNA of one species vs another isn't very hard Montalban. It's basically just getting a super-set of DNA code from one species, then comparing the similarity to another. The closer the match, the closer the relation. Because we cannot describe the universe in complete mathematical detail yet, we don't tell a heart-surgeon her methods are suspect because they are based on science...Humility Montalban...being able to admit there are things unknown to humans and that we aren't some god's chosen species. Please read my sig again, it might start to sink in one of these times. I urge you to leave irrational land and join the humans in the struggle of life.-Mach

Yes, I'm commenting here on one, I'm pointing out why it's not a good one.Not at all. I understand that he is using one thing to illustrate another. It's not a good analogy as one set of circumstances is natural, the other is not.Yes, this seems to be a valid criticism. How is the inability of creationists to show lineage a defence for science not being able to do it?That's a different issue. You're getting side-tracked. Ursus is defending science's inability to show lineage, by saying that strict Biblicists can't do it either. Science operates on different means of testing.You mean I can't criticise science when it can't be tested by science?Why? It seems that you didn't understand the question. Creationists demand that specific organisms be pointed in the transition between species. Creationists demand to see the fossils of specific ancestral species.[/quote]Do they? I thought you had me as one, now they're a different group to me, so when I raise issues of lineage, that can't be answered, your defence is that that's not 'the' question. And even though you can't answer either mine or 'theirs', you still argue about something.Am I?You'd find that funny. You set up a different argument, suggest what I might say, find that funny, and laugh. Self-amusement aside, it would help for you to actually answer a question I raised, rather than one you assume that I might. I would like to know why you have confidence in the science of phylogenetics which you seem both to support, and also to recognise how inadequate it is - by comparing it to biblical lineages.What I would like to raise is that phylogenetics is always good for a laugh, where is Neanderthal Man placed now? It's been classed as a different species, a different sub-species, et al.By the way, on another note if I were a poster such as you I'd point out the mistake you make in re-quoting my words and make it as if this is something you do all the time. And no matter what you say, I'll point out that the 'adult' thing to do would have been to say thank you for pointing it out. He who lives by the cheap-shot, dies by the cheap-shot.
