Is it natural?

In conjunction, and continuing from the above post I present this.It seems that not only do evolutionists put forward examples of artificial selection as evidence of natural selection, they also present purpose as randomness.A good example is the Typing Monkeys scearnio"Attempts have been made to support evolution by appealing to mathematics to justify long ages. For example, Nobel prize winner, George Wald, wrote, "Time is the hero of the plot. Given enough time anything can happen - the impossible becomes probable, the improbable becomes certain." (1)Thomas Huxley ("Darwin's Bulldog") used this technique in Oxford, in 1860, while debating Samuel Wilberforce. He stated that if monkeys randomly strummed typewriter keys for a long enough time, then sooner or later Psalm 23 would be printed out. Huxley used this argument to demonstrate that life could have originated on Earth by chance. (2)Julian Huxley (1887-1975) repeated this analogy to 'prove' that long periods of time could allow impossible evolution to occur. In his analogy, given enough time, monkeys randomly typing on typewriters could eventually type out the complete works of Shakespeare. (3)Stephen Hawking used the monkey story in 1988. He proposed that if there was a horde of typing monkeys, then "very occasionally by pure chance they will type out one of Shakespeare's sonnets." (4)When all these outlandish statements were made "... no evolutionary scientist or mathematician who knew better raised a single objection." (5) So as a result, these statements have convinced many people that 5 billion years is enough time for life to evolve on Earth."http://www.unmaskingevolution.com/20-typing.htmDawkins continues this hypothesis in his novel "The Blind Watchmaker"Dawkins provides an easy-to-understand computer simulation of the principle of selection from random mutations using the example of a "monkey typist." The monkey's first efforts on the typewriter produce the following random string of characters:WDLMNLT DTJBKWIRZREZLMQCO PDawkins now "breeds" from this incomprehensible starting point a litter of "progeny" in each one of which a letter is randomly changed to any other letter (with a space counting as a letter). Of all the offspring, only one is kept for continued breeding; the one whose letter sequence matches more closely, however, slightly, the Shakespearean phrase:METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASELAfter forty-one generations of "breeding," the random initial phrase "evolves" into the target phrase: "METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL."Dawkins, The Blind Watchmaker, 47-8.quoted athttp://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/2000/PSCF9-00Larson.htmland"A potential source of confusion is the idea of evolution having a "target;'' we have normally combined this activity with others, such as Selection in Action, to address this. Cumulative SelectionOne of the most frequent arguments one hears against the theory of evolution is that complex forms and behaviors simply couldn't have evolved by ``random chance'' alone. The point we must often get across to students is that evolution does not, in fact, work this way; change is cumulative. Richard Dawkins, in his book The Blind Watchmaker, dispels the myth of random chance by using the very metaphor that opponents of evolution often turn to: the monkey at the typewriter. This program models his suggestion that, were a monkey allowed to type random letters, he would produce a work of Shakespeare very quickly if letters he happened to type in the right places were preserved with each attempt. With this program, students type in a phrase of their choosing and observe how long a random phrase takes to ``evolve'' into their target phrase. Below are some sample investigations..."http://www.geocities.com/jscarrie/sf0/bill.htmlHowever, the problem is that these proposals rest on the anti-evolutionary idea of 'purpose'."When I observe that Richard Dawkins was unable to write a computer program that simulated his linguistic thought experiment, I did not mean that the task at hand was difficult. It is impossible. Mr Wadkins commends the discussion in Keen and Spain's Computer Simulation in Biology as a counterexample; it is no such thing. What Keen and Spain have done is (to) transcribe Dawkins's blunder into the computer language BASIC. Here are the steps that they undertake. A target sentence is selected "BASIC BIOLOGICAL MODELLING IS FUN". The computer is given a randomly derived set of letters. The letters are scrambled. At each iteration, the computer (or the programmer) compares the randomly derived sequence with the target phrase. If the arrays - sequences on the one hand, target phrase on the other - do not match, the experiment continues; if they do, it stops.There is nothing in this that is not also in Dawkins, the fog spreading from one book to the next. The experiment that Keen and Spain conduct is successful inasmuch as the computer reaches the target; but unsuccessful as a defense of Darwinian evolution. In looking to its target and comparing distances, the computer is appealing to information a biological system could not possess.The point seems to be less straightforward than I imagined, so let me spell out the mistake. Starting from a random string, suppose the computer generates the sequence BNDIT DISNE SOT SODISWN TOSWXMSPW SSO. Comparing the sequence with its target, it proposes to conserve the initial "B". But why? The string is gibberish. Plainly, the conservation of vagrant successes has been undertaken with the computer's eye fixed firmly on its future target, intermediates selected not for what they are (gibberish, after all), but for what they will be (an English sentence). This is in violation of the rule against deferred success. Without the rule, there is nothing remotely like Darwinian evolution. What the computer has in fact done is to match randomly selected items to a template, thus inevitably reintroducing the element of deliberate design banished from the Darwinian model."David Berlinski; "Letters: David Berlinski and Critics" in Dembski, W. A. (ed) "Uncommon Dissent: Intellectuals who Find Darwinism Unconvincing", p304Another of his analogies is equally illuminating in debunking Dawkins (et al)"I imagine this story being told to me by Jorge Luis Borges one evening in a Buenos Aires cafe.His voice dry and infinitely ironic, the ageing, nearly blind literary master observes that "the Ulysses," mistakenly attributed to the Irishman James Joyce, is in fact derived from "the Quixote".I raise my eyebrows.Borges pauses to sip discreetly at the bitter coffee our waiter has placed in front of him, guiding his hands to the saucer."The details of the remarkable series off events in question may be found at the University of Leiden," he says. "They were conveyed to me by the Freemason Alejandro Ferri in Montevideo."Borges wipes his thin lips with a linen handkerchief that he has withdrawn from his breast pocket."As you know", he continues, "the original handwritten text of the Quixote was given to an order of French Cistercians in the autumn of 1576."I hold up my hand to signify to our waiter that no further services is needed."Curiously enough, for none of the brothers could read Spanish, the Order was charged by the Papal Nuncio, Hoyo dos Monterrey (a man of great refinement and implacable will), with the responsibility for copying he Quixote, the printing press having then gained no currency in the wilderness of what is now the department of Auvergne. Unable to speak or read Spanish, a language they not unreasonably detested, the brothers copied the Quixote over and over again, re-creating the text but, of course, compromising it as well, and so inadvertently discovering the true nature of authorship. Thus they created Fernando Lor's Los Hombres d'Estado in 1585 by means of a singular series of copying errors, and then in 1654 Juan Luis Samorza's remarkable epistolary novel Por Favor by the same means; and then in 1685, the errors having accumulated sufficiently to change Spanish into French, Moliere's Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme; their copying continuous and indefatigable, the work handed down from generation to generation as a sacred but secret trust, so that in time the brothers of the monastery, known only to members of the Bourbon house, and rumor has it, the Englishman and psychic Conan Doyle, copied into creation Stendhal's The Red and the Black and Flaubert's Madame Bovary; and then as a result of a particularly significant series of errors, in which French changed into Russian, Tolstoy's The Death of Ivan Illych and Anna Karenina. Late in the last decade of the 19th century there suddenly emerged, in English, Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest, and then the brothers, their numbers reduced by an infections disease of mysterious origin, finally copied the Ulysses into creation in 1902, the manuscript lying neglected for almost thirteen years and then mysteriously making its way to Paris in 1915, just months before the British attack on the Somme, a circumstance whose significance remains to be determined."I sit there, amazed at what Borges has recounted. "Is it your understanding, then," I ask, "that every novel in the West was created in this way?""Of course," replies Borges imperturbably. Then he adds: "Although every novel is derived directly from another novel, there is really only one novel, the Quixote."David Berlinski; "The Deniable Darwin" in Dembski, W. A.

Quite right. I am not sure that supernatural is the word I would choose, but its close enough. This magic computer program that the good doctor came up with is a thing of wonder and bafflement. It would be equally possible to write a program that disproves the whole concept but, of course, no one would be interested in that.

(emphasis mine - Montalban)You have done it! The chief concern here, for advocates of materialistic evolution for 'natural selection' is the use of the word 'guided'. A huge array of posters on these threads believe that natural selection 'just happened' through mechanistic means - without the 'need' for guidance. One poster said that natural selection has made God's presence microscopic, another doesn't believe in God at all; that evolution happened through its own means. And yet they and people more eminent such as Dawkins continually use the language of intelligent design in order to argue for unguided mechanistic processes! (It is a nonsense akin to them arguing for 'natural selection' by using 'artificial selection' models)That is what is so amusing about Dawkins' model. To randomly gain the correct sentence, complete without errors, from the starting point of a code that is a complete jumble... that is to get from WDLMNLT DTJBKWIRZREZLMQCO P to METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL (the examples he uses), Dawkins and others quickly realised the phenomenal odds against this (hence 'mount improbable). They circumvented this by use of a clever trick...He says that during the random selection of letters, if a correct letter is chosen, such as the initial "M" (that will form part of the METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL phrase), then we use the program to 'fix' that letter in place, and then continue with the random selection process until another or other correctly placed letters are selected. This process makes it mathematically more probable to gain the target phrase (METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL) then just attempting to get the whole phrase in one foul swoop. The whole point of Berlinski's critique is there is nothing in nature to do such selection. The computer program works because we have a 'target' to compare the jumble with. There is no 'target' in nature, nor does nature do comparison.Nature doesn't look at a mutation and go "Okay, this is of no benefit now, but the sequence of genetic code in the middle of a larger code would be of benefit down the track, so we'll hang onto those and keep searching through random sequences through the others". It doesn't do this, because proponents of natural selection rule out 'ends'... other than survival, and survival simply come about because organisms survive (hence the tautology of "Survival of the Fittest" which Darwin himself felt was a superior phrase to "Natural Selection"). There is nothing in nature to fix the 'correct' coding sequences (baring in mind some ultimate target), and during further mutations the 'correct' code could also be affected, thus again undermining the belief that one can move from one organism to another by a mechanistic and gradual process.Further, there is no comparison by nature. Nature doesn't say "web feet really work well, we'll keep mutating this species until it attains them."They; Berkinski and others believe in evolution and believe that a 'guiding hand' or intelligence may be somewhere at work properly fixing the correct codes and thus allowing one species to evolve into other species. They believe that mechanistic evolution is just too improbable. Hence he provides an amusing analogy of an evolving series of books... which though they contain more letters in their code, are less complex things than living organisms. If you believe in a theistic evolution then fine, but I am not arguing against you on this (at this time :) ) I'm arguing against those who believe that we came about solely through materialistic means; the materialists such as Mach et al.The idea of materialism has been around for a long time, and has likewise been debunked for a long time; but still some people want to keep with it because they don't believe in God; they need to explain things through a godless process.Cicero saidAt this point must I not marvel that there should be anyone who can persuade himself that there are certain solid and indivisible particles of matter borne along by the force of gravity, and that the fortuitous collision of those particles produces this elaborate and beautiful world? I cannot understand why he who considers it possible for this to have occurred should not also think that, if a countless number of copies of the one-and-twenty letters of the alphabet, made of gold or what you will, were thrown on the ground, it would be possible that they should produce the Annals of Ennius, all ready made for the reader"De natura deorum, II.xxxviiquotedJames Barham "Why I am Not a Darwinist", in Dembski, W.

"They believe that mechanistic evolution is just too improbable."Ah... do they now. You see, Berkinski et al seem to have a limited comprehension as to what causes life to change in space and time.Where they see improbability I see inevitability- life, in whatever form we care to discuss, is vying to survive against a whole battery of challenges. Some of those challenges confront it on a short term basis- the need for food, suitable environmental conditions in which to survive and so on. Others may be an issue over a longer period of time- the need to find a mate and reproduce, can it survive annual changes in local climates. Ultimately, life has to be able to adapt to the longest term changes- like a major shift in underlying climatic conditions or local topography.And so on- we can consider a whole host of changes that confronts life at various times over different timescales. What is clear from such consideration is the never ending need for life to able to adapt- the Earth is a dynamic and forever changing place (even the very ground beneath you now is transient in nature) and environments have changed dramatically over the course of this planets history. If life were still and static it would never have come to be in the first place. If it can not adapt to a new challenges quickly enough- well just think of all the examples we have of life that is extinct.So I really cannot see why Berkinski and his peers find natural evolution, or whatever you care to call it improbable- the driving forces are there to see if you are inclined to learn about them.What I really find improbable is the notion of an omnipotent supernatural enitity outside of the physical universe somehow being able to comprehend and interact with the life in ours- and even to have the desire to do so!

(emphasis mine - Montalban)You have done it! The chief concern here, for advocates of materialistic evolution for 'natural selection' is the use of the word 'guided'. A huge array of posters on these threads believe that natural selection 'just happened' through mechanistic means - without the 'need' for guidance. One poster said that natural selection has made God's presence microscopic, another doesn't believe in God at all; that evolution happened through its own means. And yet they and people more eminent such as Dawkins continually use the language of intelligent design in order to argue for unguided mechanistic processes! (It is a nonsense akin to them arguing for 'natural selection' by using 'artificial selection' models)That is what is so amusing about Dawkins' model. To randomly gain the correct sentence, complete without errors, from the starting point of a code that is a complete jumble... that is to get from WDLMNLT DTJBKWIRZREZLMQCO P to METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL (the examples he uses), Dawkins and others quickly realised the phenomenal odds against this (hence 'mount improbable). They circumvented this by use of a clever trick...He says that during the random selection of letters, if a correct letter is chosen, such as the initial "M" (that will form part of the METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL phrase), then we use the program to 'fix' that letter in place, and then continue with the random selection process until another or other correctly placed letters are selected. This process makes it mathematically more probable to gain the target phrase (METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL) then just attempting to get the whole phrase in one foul swoop. The whole point of Berlinski's critique is there is nothing in nature to do such selection. The computer program works because we have a 'target' to compare the jumble with. There is no 'target' in nature, nor does nature do comparison.Nature doesn't look at a mutation and go "Okay, this is of no benefit now, but the sequence of genetic code in the middle of a larger code would be of benefit down the track, so we'll hang onto those and keep searching through random sequences through the others". It doesn't do this, because proponents of natural selection rule out 'ends'... other than survival, and survival simply come about because organisms survive (hence the tautology of "Survival of the Fittest" which Darwin himself felt was a superior phrase to "Natural Selection"). There is nothing in nature to fix the 'correct' coding sequences (baring in mind some ultimate target), and during further mutations the 'correct' code could also be affected, thus again undermining the belief that one can move from one organism to another by a mechanistic and gradual process.Further, there is no comparison by nature. Nature doesn't say "web feet really work well, we'll keep mutating this species until it attains them."They; Berkinski and others believe in evolution and believe that a 'guiding hand' or intelligence may be somewhere at work properly fixing the correct codes and thus allowing one species to evolve into other species. They believe that mechanistic evolution is just too improbable. Hence he provides an amusing analogy of an evolving series of books... which though they contain more letters in their code, are less complex things than living organisms. If you believe in a theistic evolution then fine, but I am not arguing against you on this (at this time :) ) I'm arguing against those who believe that we came about solely through materialistic means; the materialists such as Mach et al.The idea of materialism has been around for a long time, and has likewise been debunked for a long time; but still some people want to keep with it because they don't believe in God; they need to explain things through a godless process.Cicero saidAt this point must I not marvel that there should be anyone who can persuade himself that there are certain solid and indivisible particles of matter borne along by the force of gravity, and that the fortuitous collision of those particles produces this elaborate and beautiful world?

Guidance by humans in the blind Watchmaker does not stop it being a reasonable analogy for his idea that no higher intelligence is in evolution but it can produce . In the analogy the guidance by humans represents natural selection. You could represent the rules of natural selection as set of equations with random elements that contained no human ingenuity instead but I don't see it as a crime to use a human forced to act under restrictions to represent that has nothing to do with humans. I will show youYou could describe electrons as things that hate other electrons but like positive charges. If some electrons see other electrons coming at them down a wire they will also move down the wire to avoid them. If it means going through a circuit an powering a light globe to do the electrons will still flow if the circuit is complete. Now lets think about whats happening, each indivual electron hates large group of electrons coming towards it but to get out of the way it will have to get closer to other electrons (those punks). So if you increased the cross sectional area of the wire then the resistance will decrease. What about a double adaptor? All it does is let the current go through two different circuits. Now if there are two light globes will they both glow half as bright? No. Why because the resistance is halved and there will be twice as much total electron flow. A lot of laws in electric circuit theory made sense to me when I imagined I was an electron going through a wire and how happy I would be going down a wire. Electrons are not happy but I still had an analogy that gave me answers so I was happy. I would have been better off being told that voltage is joules per coloumb so the voltage drop between circuits must be the same.

You seem to have trouble creating working links. Here is a corrected link to your quote. Darwin, Charles. On the Origin of Species - 6th Edition. Chapter 1 - Variation Under Domestication.Do a find on, "Hence it must be assumed" to see the quote in context.Your intent might be misinterpreted by some who have not read "Origin" and are unfamiliar with Darwin thoughts. To the uninformed, your claim about what Darwin said could easily be misinterpreted to mean that even accidental changes to the environment by man that cause evolutionary change in populations is "artificial selection." Of course, you couldn't have meant that, since that is clearly not what Darwin was talking about. The context of the quote that you cite makes that clear. The whole context of the quote is in the chapter on Variation Under Domestication. Darwin does not discuss accidental changes to the environment in that chapter. That certainly would be more confusing than profitable in a chapter in which Darwin was attempting to explain the basics of his theory with examples from domestic animals, especially pigeons. It is abundantly clear that Darwin was referring to the selection by man of breeding stock since he remarks that in the domestication of a species man "...intentionally or by chance picked out..." characteristics. Of course, by use of the word "chance", Darwin meant characteristics that existed in the individuals of the breeding stock that were selected for other reasons, i.e., intentionally.I'm not sure what you mean. Your quotes from dictionaries certainly give no indication of any bluring. I'll give you another definition acceptable to biologists. Natural selection is the process by which organisms well adapted to their environment survive to produce offspring while those more poorly adapted may not. In this way, particular combinations of genes are propagated differentially.B suggests no such thing. B suggests that the change is a result of adaptation to the environment.That's ridiculous. The purpose imposed by man is what makes it artificial in the first place. You have the idea expressed in the definition backwards. It isn't that natural selection operates on the same principles as artificial selection, but the reverse. The principles are that differential reproductive success will have an effect on the gene pool of the species.Of course an explanation of artificial selection would talk about purpose. I'm not sure how that is meaningful to the discussion. And of course, mention of eugenics is irrelevant to natural selection.Strange that you seem to miss the meaning of your own quotes. Of course the phrase, "survival of the fittest" is a tautology. But you ignored an important part of your own quote, "Thus, without an independent criterion for fitness, other than survival,..." And of course, Darwin did most certainly express other criterion besides survival. Let me help clarify for you. Survival is not the sole requirement, or even the most important requirement. It should be quite clear to even the most muddled thinker that reproduction is required. In fact, reproduction is the most important requirement. Survival is necessary only long enough for an organism to reproduce, and if an organism doesn't reproduce, it is an evolutionary dead end no matter how long it survives. You see, as was mentioned in your definitions and in comments, natural selection is differential reproduction. Natural selection is not a tautology. Only the phrase, "survival of the fittest" reduces to a tautology.Again, I'm not sure what you are talking about. Can you give some examples? Of course a popular phrase applied to one evolutionary mechanism may reduce to a tautology when expressed without adequate criterion. But what about mutually exclusive theory? Certainly it is possible that two theories may be mutually exclusive before some mechanism is understood enough for us to determine which is correct. There are still answers that we don't have.Anyway, please give some examples. It isn't very instructive when you just drop off with some throw-away comment given without evidence or support.Where did you get that idea? Artificial selection was never proposed as evidence but rather as a more familiar illustration of the principles and mechanisms of evolution.Another assertion without offering any evidence as to why you are correct. None of the quotes you give offer purpose as randomness.It is bizarre to see someone calculate the odds that something will happen after it has happened. It is even more bizarre to see that someone read all of those quotes and apparently missed the context in which they were presented. Certainly none of them were meant to present purpose as randomness. You seem to have missed to point of your own quotes.Later Montalban says:As was pointed out in some of your own quotations, survival is not an 'end' of natural selection. Natural selection is the differential reproductive success of organisms with more favorable suites of characteristics. It is a statistical tendency. Individual organisms may work to survive, but they also work to reproduce. That's as close as it gets to "purpose." And as you know, Darwin's favored term was natural selection. He never used the phrase "survival of the fittest" without also making a reference to natural selection. The opposite is not the case. Since Darwin's time "survival of the fittest" has been rejected by evolutionary biologists because it is such a poor representation of the extent of the theory.

At its most basic definition "selection" means "pick out the individuals who will reproduce." (In the context of evolution.)If there are some individuals that did not reproduce before they died, then they were not selected.If some individuals were able to reproduce, then they were selected.The problem of natural and artificial then boils down to what your definition of those words are. In the context of evolution, I would make "artificial" represent the type of selection where humans had a role in determining which individuals reproduced or not.In the case of animal breeding, this becomes quite obvious. A man picks two animals to breed, and the rest do not breed. This is artificial selection.In the case of something like a nylon bug, humans did not determine which individuals reproduced or not, nature did. This is natural selection.

A very good statement of what I was trying to say in my previous post. But even these statements don't go far enough. An example can be found in [b]The Beak of the Finch[b] by Jonathan Weiner. It is the story of the research done by Peter and Rosmary Grant into the 2 species of Darwin's finches found on a single, small island in the Galapagos. Over those 20 years they learned to recognize every bird on the island by sight. They managed to capture and tag every bird on the island in those 20 years. Two of those birds were the longest lived of any of the birds on the island. They evaded capture for 5 years. They also failed to produce a single offspring that survived long enough to reproduce. Although these two birds were the "fittest" for survival that the Grants observed in 20 years, they were both evolutionary dead ends because none of their offspring survived to reproduce.Or what your mis-definition of those words are.Right. The Dictionary of Modern Biology says that artificial selection is, "The directed selection of specific genetic traits by humans in wild or domesticated organisms including agricultural crops and livestock. It was the observation of this phenomenon that allowed Charles Darwin to originate an analogy leading to the concept of natural selection."So artificial selection isn't an example of natural selection and it isn't "proof" of either natural selection or evolution. It was an observation that formed the basis of an analogy that allowed the formation of an hypothesis. Any confusion between the two seems to be caused by a lack of careful reading for comprehension.Exactly. Any claims to the contrary are certainly caused by a lack of understanding of the topic. It was the environment in which these microbes lived that was the selecting factor. That the environment was altered by humans is irrelevant since they did not do so for the purpose of breeding bacteria that were able to metabolize waste products from the production of nylon.

In dealing with several posters on the issue of the 'Nylon Bug' it seems that there exists some confusion over the difference between 'Natural selection' and 'Artificial Selection', not least caused by confusion amongst web-resources.Darwin and other earlier theorists seemed able to differentiate between natural and artificial selectionDarwin says that even when man did it by accident, it was artificial..."Hence it must be assumed, not only that half-civilized man succeeded in thoroughly domesticating several species, but that he intentionally or by chance picked out extraordinarily abnormal species; and further, that these very species have since all become extinct or unknown. So many strange contingencies are improbable in the highest degree."http://www.literature.org/authors/d...chapter-01.html"Man has an aim or an end in view; `natural selection' can have none."*E. Russell, The Diversity of Animals, (1962), p. 124.But this line seems blurred in the quest for evidence of 'natural' natural selection.Different on-line dictionaries deal with Natural Selection in different ways...Example 'a'Natural SelectionA natural process resulting in the evolution of organisms best adapted to the environment.http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary.aspExamples 'b'1. natural selection Author: Susan A.Hagedorn Definition: The differential survival and reproduction of organisms with genetic characteristics that enable them to better use environmental resources.http://biotech.icmb.utexas.edu/searc...pe=normal&def=Definition of natural selection :The process in nature whereby one genotype leaves more offspring than another genotype because of superior life history attributes ( fitness)such as survival or fecundity.http://www.everythingbio.com/glos/de...ural+selectionnatural selectionThe hypothesis that genotype-environment interactions occurring at the phenotypic level lead to differential reproductive success of individuals and hence to modification of the gene pool of a population.http://www.mblab.gla.ac.uk/~julian/dict2.cgi?4346Both deal with the change of organisms. 'A' suggests only that which occurs 'naturally', whilst 'B' suggests change affected by any cause; natural or artificial.Interestingly enough one of those above also states...1. artificial selection Definition: The selective breeding by humans towards a desired trait in a plant, animal, or other organism which is of value (usually economic) to the humans. The process operates on the same principles as natural selection.http://biotech.icmb.utexas.edu/search/dict-search.mhtmlBut man has a purposeful process. This would mean 'nature' also has purpose in it's 'selection' process.Another just saysDefinition of artificial selection :Selective breeding.http://www.everythingbio.com/glos/de...cial+selectionAgain, an emphasis on purpose is given by the following[u[The Hutchinson Dictionary of Science[/u]"artificial selectionIn biology, selective breeding of individuals that exhibit the particular characteristics that a plant or animal breeder wishes to develop. In plants, desirable features might include resistance to disease, high yield (in crop plants), or attractive appearance. In animal breeding, selection has led to the development of particular breeds of cattle for improved meat production (such as the Aberdeen Angus) or milk production (such as Jerseys)."http://www.highbeam.com/library/doc0...R%3AResult&ao=Eugenics The study of improving a species by artificial selection; usually refers to the selective breeding of humans.http://public.ornl.gov/hgmis/externa...erm_action.cfmIt seems some people can't help wishing purpose on evolution. Which is why, in order to give examples of Natural Selection, a textbook will state"Bethell began by pointing out that Darwinian theory is a tautology rather than a predicative theory. (The term tautology means a statement that is true by definition.)* That is, evolution is the survival of the fittest. But who are the fittest? Obviously, the individuals who survive. Thus, without an independent criterion for fitness, other than survival, we are left with the statement that evolution is the survival of the survivors. This indeed is a tautology. But it is possible to assign independent criteria for fitness. Darwin wrote extensively about artificial selection in pigeons, in which the breeders' choice was the criterion for fitness. (Many novel breeds of pigeon have been created this way.) Artificial selection has been practiced extensively by plant and animal breeders. Here too, survival is not the criterion for fitness, productivity is."Robert H Tamarin, (1996) "Principles of Genetics" (5th ed), p571.Evolution it seems can contain tautology, mutually exclusive theory, and redundant terminologies.

Precisely. I learned that definition more than 30 years ago and I have never met, either in person or on the internet, a biologist who disagreed. Of course, my first course in evolutionary biology had genetics as a prerequisite. That, along with other basic courses had laid the ground work so that I was able to understand the statement. I understood what an allele is. I understood what frequency meant. I knew the meaning of the word population. Finally, I was clear that time meant over generations.I think that if Montalban is anything, he is opportunistic. Someone (Ungerdunn I think) pointed out to him that the phrase, "survival of the fittest" reduces to a tautology. As seems to be his bent, Montalban generalized that fact to claim that somehow evolution is a tautology. As I mentioned in a previous post, without further criterion, "survival of the fittest" is a tautology. But Darwin did offer further criterion in chapter after chapter years before he acquiesced to use the phrase. Certainly Montalban has read "Origin" since he quotes it. How is it that he missed chapter 2? How is it that he failed to understand Darwin's meaning in chapter 1?But I will concede that "Origin" is not an easy read. Understanding requires a command of English beyond the ordinary, as well as an understanding of biological science at a graduate level. Darwin was not addressing a popular audience, even though his book became popular. Darwin was addressing the naturalist of his day - what came to be called biologists in our day. English grammar and usage has evolved since Darwin's day and biology has advanced. When one considers the importance to evolutionary theory of what Darwin said (even without the misunderstandings of the uneducated), it is a matter of historical significance only. Darwin's theories have been supported or falsified many times over. For the most part, his theories have been supported. He was wrong on some minor points. Essentially, a quote from Darwin without reference to some meaningful publication since is quite meaningless.Like you, I have no idea what that is supposed to mean. Certainly, the leading edge of any field of scientific research may yield mutually exclusive hypotheses. After investigation, we hope that we will gain enough knowledge to support one or the other. One certainly hopes that Montalban isn't referring to natural selection vs. artificial selection as mutually exclusive theories. That would demonstrate a most profound level of ignorance.Well, I'm not seeing it in anything that Montalban has presented. I don't doubt that it may be possible. I can't think of an example, but I accept the possibility that there may be redundant terms. Since both terms carry the same meaning for me, I am not even aware that they exist. I can see how it would be confusing for the uneducated. I can understand how the use of such terms might be a matter of preference or education for any given biologist. More than once another biologist and I have hashed out such terms, only to find that we were talking about the same thing. But such redundancy is so trite that I can't remember specific examples.My response tends towards, "so what?"I suspect that he is arguing to preserve his faith. His faith gives him a sense of security. He is saved and you are not. In the back of his mind he sees that his faith is nothing more than the mythology of an ancient people, and he feels the need to support it with science.And of course, the sea of Montalban's assertions as science, the sea of Montalban's out of context quotes, or the sea of Montalban's misrepresentations of what others have said. It seems that Montalban knows the "TROOTH" and won't be discouraged with facts. Sadly, Montalban knows what he believes and reality seems to be irrelevant.

I just skimmed at looked for the point..is it the end statement? I see so many debate points that I wonder if they are placed there just to prevent the writer from getting pinned on any one topic..but that's just a guess.Back to the specific point:Evoluition: Change in allele frequency in a population over time.So....where is your tautology, mutually exclusive theory, and redundant terms? I'm not seeing it there.Or are you arguing vs. some definition of evolution that you haven't yet presented? Let's see some bullet items to debate, not the sea-of-montalban's-ideas :) :)emoticonXHoho -Mach

I believe you've missed the point. He's not against evolution; change of species over time into other species. He in fact, from what I can gather, does indeed believe in evolutionHe's arguing that it didn't come about through materialistic processes.

"They believe that mechanistic evolution is just too improbable."Ah... do they now. You see, Berkinski et al seem to have a limited comprehension as to what causes life to change in space and time.Where they see improbability I see inevitability- life, in whatever form we care to discuss, is vying to survive against a whole battery of challenges. Some of those challenges confront it on a short term basis- the need for food, suitable environmental conditions in which to survive and so on. Others may be an issue over a longer period of time- the need to find a mate and reproduce, can it survive annual changes in local climates. Ultimately, life has to be able to adapt to the longest term changes- like a major shift in underlying climatic conditions or local topography.And so on- we can consider a whole host of changes that confronts life at various times over different timescales. What is clear from such consideration is the never ending need for life to able to adapt- the Earth is a dynamic and forever changing place (even the very ground beneath you now is transient in nature) and environments have changed dramatically over the course of this planets history. If life were still and static it would never have come to be in the first place. If it can not adapt to a new challenges quickly enough- well just think of all the examples we have of life that is extinct.So I really cannot see why Berkinski and his peers find natural evolution, or whatever you care to call it improbable- the driving forces are there to see if you are inclined to learn about them.What I really find improbable is the notion of an omnipotent supernatural enitity outside of the physical universe somehow being able to comprehend and interact with the life in ours- and even to have the desire to do so!

Again, it's not the point. There are many who don't deny evolution, they believe it was guided. Showing examples of guidence - through artificial selection supports this theory
supports
Guidance by humans in the blind Watchmaker does not stop it being a reasonable analogy for his idea that no higher intelligence is in evolution but it can produce . In the analogy the guidance by humans represents natural selection. You could represent the rules of natural selection as set of equations with random elements that contained no human ingenuity instead but I don't see it as a crime to use a human forced to act under restrictions to represent that has nothing to do with humans. I will show youYou could describe electrons as things that hate other electrons but like positive charges. If some electrons see other electrons coming at them down a wire they will also move down the wire to avoid them. If it means going through a circuit an powering a light globe to do the electrons will still flow if the circuit is complete. Now lets think about whats happening, each indivual electron hates large group of electrons coming towards it but to get out of the way it will have to get closer to other electrons (those punks). So if you increased the cross sectional area of the wire then the resistance will decrease. What about a double adaptor? All it does is let the current go through two different circuits. Now if there are two light globes will they both glow half as bright? No. Why because the resistance is halved and there will be twice as much total electron flow. A lot of laws in electric circuit theory made sense to me when I imagined I was an electron going through a wire and how happy I would be going down a wire. Electrons are not happy but I still had an analogy that gave me answers so I was happy. I would have been better off being told that voltage is joules per coloumb so the voltage drop between circuits must be the same.

I'm amazed how you and he would have denied this, when I've continually shown the following quote"But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer, of the Survival of the Fittest, is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient." from the 6th edition of "Origin of the Species"http://www.literature.org/authors/da...hapter-03.htmlDarwin's words show that you have no credibility.Actually he is, and he's posted on this thread.It is a pity that you're unwilling to debate, but endeavour a smear campaign as you did on the Science and Math posts.

Then you've defined it by the tautology. Survival of those that surviveIf you can show me how nature 'determines' something, I'd like to know.Nylon was developed by man, an unintended consequence of this is the nylon bug lives; that is not natural selection; unless you wish to posit a theory that any unintentional destruction of a species by man is likewise 'natural'.
attacks
At its most basic definition "selection" means "pick out the individuals who will reproduce." (In the context of evolution.)If there are some individuals that did not reproduce before they died, then they were not selected.If some individuals were able to reproduce, then they were selected.The problem of natural and artificial then boils down to what your definition of those words are. In the context of evolution, I would make "artificial" represent the type of selection where humans had a role in determining which individuals reproduced or not.In the case of animal breeding, this becomes quite obvious. A man picks two animals to breed, and the rest do not breed. This is artificial selection.In the case of something like a nylon bug, humans did not determine which individuals reproduced or not, nature did. This is natural selection.

You seem to think one example is the norm.Firstly I am not saying that this chapter is about natural selection. It is about artificial. I am suggesting that Darwin recognises as artificial selection something that is selected by man on purpose, or by chance. The whole issue about the Nylon Bug that I'm talking about here is whether the accidental outcome of an artificial event is 'natural'. I would say that it is not. When man designed nylon, they didn't have all the purposes in mind. Nylon is used for a huge number of things. One of these is food for a bug. Man didn't intended this but his interference; in introducing it, has allowed this to happen. It is therefore not 'natural'. Thus Darwin himself classes as artificial either the purposeful selection process by man, or where man changes things by chance.Thus if you have two animals (a male and a female) of different stock, and you put them on a farm together, and the male accidentally gets into the pen with the female and voila, you get an offspring that you think is groovy, then this is artificial selection; the whole process of bringing them to the same property can not be ignored.The key to Darwin's idea of artificial selection is the following" but that he intentionally or by chance picked out extraordinarily abnormal species"He picked something out with intent, or by accident.http://www.literature.org/authors/da...hapter-01.htmlThis is further re-enforced by such terms as"...it must be assumed that at least seven or eight species were so thoroughly domesticated in ancient times by half-civilized man, as to be quite prolific under confinement."(Ibid)That man in a less than fully civilized state; by this he means quite un-learned and barbaric (given his Victorian values) was able to breed species - that is without any great scientific presumptions at all.[quote=Montalban]But this line seems blurred in the quest for evidence of 'natural' natural selection. And how does this compare to your ideas on artificial selection?The definition says in both natural and artificial cases a 'selection' is given. In one, obviously we agree that selection is purposeful how then are the analogous as the definition suggests when there is no 'purpose' in selection processes of nature?[quote=Montalban]It seems some people can't help wishing purpose on evolution. Which is why, in order to give examples of Natural Selection, a textbook will state... Which Darwin thought was a superior phrase.Which, as stated, Darwin thought was in fact a better phrase, or 'more accurate'..."But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer, of the Survival of the Fittest, is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient." from the 6th edition of "Origin of the Species"http://www.literature.org/authors/da...hapter-03.htmlMutually exclusive theories;I cut and paste from another thread...What must now seem a long time ago (1986), I did a course at university called 'Pre-history'. Our textbook wasPoirier, F E, "In Search of Ourselves: An Introduction to Physical Anthropology", (to which I will be referring specifically to p346ff unless otherwise stated).As to the ascent of man (though it says 'descent'; itself a loaded term), there were many different theories then that had currency. Each followed scientific method, and each had its fair share of evidences to support it.My textbook stated that each of the following;the Unilinear School;the Polyphyletic School'the Preneanderthal School; andthe Presapiens Schoolwere all valid possibilities to the pathway our ancestors took. This seemed ludicrous to me (then, and still), that each mutually conflicting theory would be accepted (as long as it doesn't involve God). And yet people can say that the evidence points to a conclusion... that is a Godless process took place. Then these people have the hide to laugh at religious people as if they have 'truth'. What 'truth'? It's all up in the air.That is, so long as a materialistic process is described, based on the evidences, it was presented. The problem? There are three other theories that also fit that limited bill, and they exclude each other. So you have someone saying something like "Evolution is based on evidences"... but this then becomes meaningless if you've got evidences that can be interpreted to several different totally conflicting ideas.How are these theories mutually conflicting?Generally, because they each propose a different pathway or series of pathways for human evolution. "Various possibilities have led to various interpretations... Variation of these theories are endless; they are constantly being revised and rejected." p346 (Ibid)Specifically, for instanceThe Unilinear School diagram goesJava Man - Neanderthal - ModernsThe Polyphyletic School starts off with an unknown ancestral group and immediately branches into four distinct forks (which I'll term here for convenience 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd')'a' goes Java - Solo - Wadjak - Australians'b' goes Peking - Upper Cave - Mongoloids'c' goes Rhodesian - Boskop - Africans'd' goes Tabun - Skul - Cro-Magnon - EuropeansThat is, simply, one (the Unilinear) has a single route for all forms of man, another (the Polyphyletic) has many different and separate routes.

OHHHHH. You mean the things YOU wrote about evolution contains those things. That's arguing against something other than evolution, now isn't it Montalban? Wiggle out of it please, post 20 pages of quotes and links and new terms to debate...but KEEP MISSING THE TARGET.Wait, where is the tautology? Maybe...allele frequency? Shoot, no that's not it. How about, "Change in"....nope not one either. Where is the mutually exlusive theory? Is "population over time" mutualy exclusive? Nope.You see, when you summarize, you have to make your thoughts more clear and refined, and then we can address your issue(s) efficiently. Not this big word scramble and quote fest that leaves your points scattered all over.

Here's another Monty classic. Please read this folks, it's another strawman captured in slow motion footage:"evolution is true" Please refrain from arguing against this nonsensical strawman. You cannot pass this off yet again in another post."Evidence for evolution points to evolution" is a hollow claim you say. So you are good at making up phrases, then debating against them. You're doing it yet again.All evidence points to evolution, would be a more accurate statement. Your addition of the word "evolution" at the beginning is another not-so-deft manuever to confuse the sleeping reader.While interestingly enough, religion with it's...oh...word of mouth evidence only, no other verifiable evidence at all, is more along the lines of your "hollow claim"...wouldn't you say?

I'm amazed how you and he would have denied this, when I've continually shown the following quote"But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer, of the Survival of the Fittest, is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient." from the 6th edition of "Origin of the Species"http://www.literature.org/authors/da...hapter-03.htmlDarwin's words show that you have no credibility.Actually he is, and he's posted on this thread.It is a pity that you're unwilling to debate, but endeavour a smear campaign as you did on the Science and Math posts. I would advise you read the above quote before talking again :)

Not following you. Natural Selection isn't a tautology. It is a term used to describe the fact that not all genetic lines will keep going, some will die out, become extinct. The ones that don't die out keep producing individual organisms that tend to reproduce and so on. That's it. Nothing more, nothing less. The term is used to describe that process.I fail to see a tautology. Saying "those genetic lines that are still going have survived" is a tautology.Saying "those genetic lines that are still going were part of a larger set, all of which are not still going" is not a tautology.The latter is what is described by the term "natural selection."Nature determines what color the sky is, at what temprature water boils, how fast you fall from an airplane, the length of the day on earth, how hot the sun is, what your farts smell like, and everything else in the universe that humans don't determine (and even those).I'm sorry, but your definition of natural selection is simply not the generally accepted definition, then. When man causes the extinction of a species, his actions determined which individuals would reproduce (none of them). This would be, by definition, artificial selection, if you will. Ah, wait, you said "unintentional." Then it would be a case of natural selection.The usage of the words "natural" and "artificial" in this context infer that they actually represent "non-intelligent" vs "intelligent" action (unintentional vs. intentional.)Since the extinction of a species was unintentional that would be natural selection..........

Then you've defined it by the tautology. Survival of those that surviveIf you can show me how nature 'determines' something, I'd like to know.Nylon was developed by man, an unintended consequence of this is the nylon bug lives; that is not natural selection; unless you wish to posit a theory that any unintentional destruction of a species by man is likewise 'natural'.

I don't think I did. I made a brief overview of circumstances that cause life to change- all phenonenon that occur within the natural world. This is what Berkinski said was "improbable"- the influence of the physical world on the life that inhabits it.So, why the need to invoke the intangible, unmeasurable and unquantifable?A model of evolution based on trying to explain the physical adaptation of life based on metaphysical "influences" or what ever you would care to call it is nothing to do with Evolution.Oh and Waxy, well said emoticonXGood

I believe you've missed the point. He's not against evolution; change of species over time into other species. He in fact, from what I can gather, does indeed believe in evolutionHe's arguing that it didn't come about through materialistic processes.

An adult, polite answer would have been, "thank you." However, the evidence is that you seem to have trouble in creating working links.Actually, that is the logical result of your claims.Duh. So you are suggesting that Darwin meant exactly what he said? How bizarre.You're mixing language. Darwin specifically mentioned picking out characteristics intentionally or by chance. He didn't talk about accidents and he was not discussing accidental effects on the environment by man.But you say a lot of things that are pretty silly.One of the "purposes" of nylon, even though it man didn't have this purpose "in mind" is as food for a bug? So therefore, even though man wasn't aware of the existence of this microbe (it's still not a bug - and it would seem that since you are trying to discuss science you would make an effort not to sound like a 5th grader) it is still selection by man. In other words, no purpose, no intent, and not even any knowledge of the microbe.Man didn't introduce it.Right. And there was no purposeful selection in the case of the microbes that live in the waste products of the production of nylon.No wonder you flunked biology. Of course, what you are now discussing has nothing to do with anything that Darwin said. Of course, you would have to read and understand what Darwin said to comment. You just make things up and claim that Darwin said it.There you go again telling us what is the key to Darwin. You haven't read Darwin and you flunked a high school course in biology but you can tell us the key.I can assure you that you have not given the "key" to artificial selection according to Darwin. Furthermore, you again introduct the word accident. It seems that you failed to understand your own quote. Darwin didn't say anything about accident. Darwin used "artificial selection" to mean the intentional breeding of domestic animals. His intent was not that changes in the growth of bacteria as a result of the accumulation of feces was artificial selection.It is clear that you fail to grasp how analogy works as an instructional device. I already explained this to you once but it seems that you are having trouble grasping the meaning.As for the rest of your response, what is your point? As I said, as theories develop there are sometimes several hypotheses proposed that explain the observed data. So what if opposing hypotheses exist? That's how science works - formulate and test predictions that are the necessary consequence of the hypothesis.You object to the fact that none of these theories propose, "god did it." How is that supposed to be tested. You see, it really doesn't matter what observation you may make, "god did it" shuts off any search for knowledge. Those who propose that "god did it" is a scientific answer are bad scientists with weak faith.

Yes if that was your sole intent; not presuming that one mistake is evidence for creating links. You have evidence of one instance. And you make it a norm. You don't need to thank me for pointing this out to you :) (using a plura form - links, suggesting more than one, but showing evidence from one instance)Do you even know what you're debating now?What do you think 'by chance' means?Do you still have a problem with the word 'bug'?I suggest you visit Close_slave_Can's debate about 'creationists' using silly word games.So far you guys do several.One is the 'bug' issue. Talkorigins have no problem with the term 'bug', why do you?Another is you want to make one link error an example of many.You sound very much like a poster who I've dealt with before. Here's a little 'honesty test'. Have you posted here before under another Username?But getting back to the 'by chance' a contemporary of Darwin said"In the fields of observation, chance favours the prepared mind." - Louis PasteurYou can get results you don't expect - 'by chance' or 'by accident'If you just decide one day to feed pigs with a new but cheaper feed and they get bigger, and produce bigger young - would you call that outcome 'by chance' or 'by design'?Where do you think nylon came from? How did nylon enter the world?Such 'selection' can not be divorced from man's presence. Nature didn't 'select' anything in this case without the advent of man.[quote=Montalban]Thus if you have two animals (a male and a female) of different stock, and you put them on a farm together, and the male accidentally gets into the pen with the female and voila, you get an offspring that you think is groovy, then this is artificial selection; the whole process of bringing them to the same property can not be ignored. This is information you gained before you joined the forum?Further question, this is a retort?You mean to say that when I quote Darwin I'm making up his words?I find your debate highly enlightening up to this point. I introduce the words of Darwin, and quote from him and others. You just rebut with attempts at ad hominem, point scoring, suppositions/just-so. If you think you can construct a retort, with reference to 'evidence', you've yet to show that you can/will.[quote=Montalban]The key to Darwin's idea of artificial selection is the following" but that he intentionally or by chance picked out extraordinarily abnormal species"He picked something out with intent, or by accident. Did I say that this is the key to Darwin? Nope. I suspect what you're thinking of is when you were here last, under a now banned alias, when I was debating over 'survival of the fittest' being the key to Darwinism. Here I'm arguing about what is or isn't 'natural' in examples given of selection. Sorry you've mixed the arguments up.Again, what do you think 'by chance' means?You can go about a cross-breeding exercise, expecting a particular outcome, get another, but are happy with that. It came about 'by chance' or 'by accident', as it wasn't your intended outcome, but the outcome could not have come without your actions. If you have an alternate meaning, then introduce it, don't be afraid. But it's harder to do then just repeat mantras such as 'You're wrong". :) It takes actually coming up with ideas.Yes, you do make such at the man debates, and saying, as Waxy did prior, that it was all said somewhere else is highly enlightening.Touché :)It is upon these types of hypothesise that evolution is taught as having happened. People are told 'man evolved from lower forms... theory based on the evidence', but on closer inspection the evidences point to so many different things that the theory of evolution seems utterly useless if all it says, at the end of the day, that evolution 'happened'.Not at all. Intelligent Design theorists have no such problem of being 'shut off' from the pursuit of knowlege, far from it; your version is more shut off, because if it were true that God did act, you can't recognise it, they can. Their search for scientific truths are able to accomadate an answer that lies outside the constrictions of materialism. It is at the end of the day a 'just-so' argument writ large.a

You've said exactly the same thing! The second sentence is still saying "those that survive survive"And Darwin thought the tautology "Survival of the fittest" (which you in effect use in your second example), which is a tautology was a better way of describing "Natural Selection"I think you miss out on the nature of the word 'determine' which describes an action of thought.v. de·ter·mined, de·ter·min·ing, de·ter·mines v. tr.To decide or settle (a dispute, for example) conclusively and authoritatively.To end or decide, as by judicial action.To establish or ascertain definitely, as after consideration, investigation, or calculation.

(see post #1)So a species can be naturally poisoned by lead? I take it then that global warming is a natural phenomena; industrial pollution is natural, etc.I believe that if it's by man, and regardless of intent, it's not 'natural'.See above.Of all on your side, your debates are the least abusive (more precisely they have zero abuse).

In conjunction, and continuing from the above post I present this.It seems that not only do evolutionists put forward examples of artificial selection as evidence of natural selection, they also present purpose as randomness.A good example is the Typing Monkeys scearnio"Attempts have been made to support evolution by appealing to mathematics to justify long ages. For example, Nobel prize winner, George Wald, wrote, "Time is the hero of the plot. Given enough time anything can happen - the impossible becomes probable, the improbable becomes certain." (1)Thomas Huxley ("Darwin's Bulldog") used this technique in Oxford, in 1860, while debating Samuel Wilberforce. He stated that if monkeys randomly strummed typewriter keys for a long enough time, then sooner or later Psalm 23 would be printed out. Huxley used this argument to demonstrate that life could have originated on Earth by chance. (2)Julian Huxley (1887-1975) repeated this analogy to 'prove' that long periods of time could allow impossible evolution to occur. In his analogy, given enough time, monkeys randomly typing on typewriters could eventually type out the complete works of Shakespeare. (3)Stephen Hawking used the monkey story in 1988. He proposed that if there was a horde of typing monkeys, then "very occasionally by pure chance they will type out one of Shakespeare's sonnets." (4)When all these outlandish statements were made "... no evolutionary scientist or mathematician who knew better raised a single objection." (5) So as a result, these statements have convinced many people that 5 billion years is enough time for life to evolve on Earth."http://www.unmaskingevolution.com/20-typing.htmDawkins continues this hypothesis in his novel "The Blind Watchmaker"Dawkins provides an easy-to-understand computer simulation of the principle of selection from random mutations using the example of a "monkey typist." The monkey's first efforts on the typewriter produce the following random string of characters:WDLMNLT DTJBKWIRZREZLMQCO PDawkins now "breeds" from this incomprehensible starting point a litter of "progeny" in each one of which a letter is randomly changed to any other letter (with a space counting as a letter). Of all the offspring, only one is kept for continued breeding; the one whose letter sequence matches more closely, however, slightly, the Shakespearean phrase:METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASELAfter forty-one generations of "breeding," the random initial phrase "evolves" into the target phrase: "METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL."Dawkins, The Blind Watchmaker, 47-8.quoted athttp://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/2000/PSCF9-00Larson.htmland"A potential source of confusion is the idea of evolution having a "target;'' we have normally combined this activity with others, such as Selection in Action, to address this. Cumulative SelectionOne of the most frequent arguments one hears against the theory of evolution is that complex forms and behaviors simply couldn't have evolved by ``random chance'' alone. The point we must often get across to students is that evolution does not, in fact, work this way; change is cumulative. Richard Dawkins, in his book The Blind Watchmaker, dispels the myth of random chance by using the very metaphor that opponents of evolution often turn to: the monkey at the typewriter. This program models his suggestion that, were a monkey allowed to type random letters, he would produce a work of Shakespeare very quickly if letters he happened to type in the right places were preserved with each attempt. With this program, students type in a phrase of their choosing and observe how long a random phrase takes to ``evolve'' into their target phrase. Below are some sample investigations..."http://www.geocities.com/jscarrie/sf0/bill.htmlHowever, the problem is that these proposals rest on the anti-evolutionary idea of 'purpose'."When I observe that Richard Dawkins was unable to write a computer program that simulated his linguistic thought experiment, I did not mean that the task at hand was difficult. It is impossible. Mr Wadkins commends the discussion in Keen and Spain's Computer Simulation in Biology as a counterexample; it is no such thing. What Keen and Spain have done is (to) transcribe Dawkins's blunder into the computer language BASIC. Here are the steps that they undertake. A target sentence is selected "BASIC BIOLOGICAL MODELLING IS FUN". The computer is given a randomly derived set of letters. The letters are scrambled. At each iteration, the computer (or the programmer) compares the randomly derived sequence with the target phrase. If the arrays - sequences on the one hand, target phrase on the other - do not match, the experiment continues; if they do, it stops.There is nothing in this that is not also in Dawkins, the fog spreading from one book to the next. The experiment that Keen and Spain conduct is successful inasmuch as the computer reaches the target; but unsuccessful as a defense of Darwinian evolution. In looking to its target and comparing distances, the computer is appealing to information a biological system could not possess.The point seems to be less straightforward than I imagined, so let me spell out the mistake. Starting from a random string, suppose the computer generates the sequence BNDIT DISNE SOT SODISWN TOSWXMSPW SSO. Comparing the sequence with its target, it proposes to conserve the initial "B". But why? The string is gibberish. Plainly, the conservation of vagrant successes has been undertaken with the computer's eye fixed firmly on its future target, intermediates selected not for what they are (gibberish, after all), but for what they will be (an English sentence). This is in violation of the rule against deferred success. Without the rule, there is nothing remotely like Darwinian evolution. What the computer has in fact done is to match randomly selected items to a template, thus inevitably reintroducing the element of deliberate design banished from the Darwinian model."David Berlinski; "Letters: David Berlinski and Critics" in Dembski, W. A. (ed) "Uncommon Dissent: Intellectuals who Find Darwinism Unconvincing", p304Another of his analogies is equally illuminating in debunking Dawkins (et al)"I imagine this story being told to me by Jorge Luis Borges one evening in a Buenos Aires cafe.His voice dry and infinitely ironic, the ageing, nearly blind literary master observes that "the Ulysses," mistakenly attributed to the Irishman James Joyce, is in fact derived from "the Quixote".I raise my eyebrows.Borges pauses to sip discreetly at the bitter coffee our waiter has placed in front of him, guiding his hands to the saucer."The details of the remarkable series off events in question may be found at the University of Leiden," he says. "They were conveyed to me by the Freemason Alejandro Ferri in Montevideo."Borges wipes his thin lips with a linen handkerchief that he has withdrawn from his breast pocket."As you know", he continues, "the original handwritten text of the Quixote was given to an order of French Cistercians in the autumn of 1576."I hold up my hand to signify to our waiter that no further services is needed."Curiously enough, for none of the brothers could read Spanish, the Order was charged by the Papal Nuncio, Hoyo dos Monterrey (a man of great refinement and implacable will), with the responsibility for copying he Quixote, the printing press having then gained no currency in the wilderness of what is now the department of Auvergne. Unable to speak or read Spanish, a language they not unreasonably detested, the brothers copied the Quixote over and over again, re-creating the text but, of course, compromising it as well, and so inadvertently discovering the true nature of authorship. Thus they created Fernando Lor's Los Hombres d'Estado in 1585 by means of a singular series of copying errors, and then in 1654 Juan Luis Samorza's remarkable epistolary novel Por Favor by the same means; and then in 1685, the errors having accumulated sufficiently to change Spanish into French, Moliere's Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme; their copying continuous and indefatigable, the work handed down from generation to generation as a sacred but secret trust, so that in time the brothers of the monastery, known only to members of the Bourbon house, and rumor has it, the Englishman and psychic Conan Doyle, copied into creation Stendhal's The Red and the Black and Flaubert's Madame Bovary; and then as a result of a particularly significant series of errors, in which French changed into Russian, Tolstoy's The Death of Ivan Illych and Anna Karenina. Late in the last decade of the 19th century there suddenly emerged, in English, Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest, and then the brothers, their numbers reduced by an infections disease of mysterious origin, finally copied the Ulysses into creation in 1902, the manuscript lying neglected for almost thirteen years and then mysteriously making its way to Paris in 1915, just months before the British attack on the Somme, a circumstance whose significance remains to be determined."I sit there, amazed at what Borges has recounted. "Is it your understanding, then," I ask, "that every novel in the West was created in this way?""Of course," replies Borges imperturbably. Then he adds: "Although every novel is derived directly from another novel, there is really only one novel, the Quixote."David Berlinski; "The Deniable Darwin" in Dembski, W. A. (ed) "Uncommon Dissent: Intellectuals who Find Darwinism Unconvincing", pp281-282

Lordy! This nonsense about "natural" and "artificial" selection has gone on too long.Are not human beings part of nature, and part of the environment?Species survival is about the interaction between the population and the environment within which it resides.Man is part of the environment.Most of the "breeding" of the last thousand years has been pure luck. It was only late in the 19th century that we realised that we could intervene in the reproductive process, but of course most of the interventions failed.If we really need to make a distinction we should talk about _deliberate_ intervention, including GM, which is clearly one form of evolution.Of all of the millions, or billions of life modifications we have seen, the number of deliberate modifications is so small as to be statistically insignificant.Please do not bring up extinctions. No one has ever successfully set out to extinguish a life form. All of the extinctions have been accidental: the moa, the passenger pigeon, the dodo. The last dodo died, not to eliminate the species, but to fill a hungry stomach.If we were capable of deliberate extinction we would not be bothere with cockroaches or cane toads.Yes, evolution is a tautology. "Survival of the fittest" means that the fittest survive.Anyone who argues with a tautology is unfit to survive.IzzyemoticonXBanghead

You seem to have trouble creating working links. Here is a corrected link to your quote. Darwin, Charles. On the Origin of Species - 6th Edition. Chapter 1 - Variation Under Domestication.Do a find on, "Hence it must be assumed" to see the quote in context.Your intent might be misinterpreted by some who have not read "Origin" and are unfamiliar with Darwin thoughts. To the uninformed, your claim about what Darwin said could easily be misinterpreted to mean that even accidental changes to the environment by man that cause evolutionary change in populations is "artificial selection." Of course, you couldn't have meant that, since that is clearly not what Darwin was talking about. The context of the quote that you cite makes that clear. The whole context of the quote is in the chapter on Variation Under Domestication. Darwin does not discuss accidental changes to the environment in that chapter. That certainly would be more confusing than profitable in a chapter in which Darwin was attempting to explain the basics of his theory with examples from domestic animals, especially pigeons. It is abundantly clear that Darwin was referring to the selection by man of breeding stock since he remarks that in the domestication of a species man "...intentionally or by chance picked out..." characteristics. Of course, by use of the word "chance", Darwin meant characteristics that existed in the individuals of the breeding stock that were selected for other reasons, i.e., intentionally.I'm not sure what you mean. Your quotes from dictionaries certainly give no indication of any bluring. I'll give you another definition acceptable to biologists. Natural selection is the process by which organisms well adapted to their environment survive to produce offspring while those more poorly adapted may not. In this way, particular combinations of genes are propagated differentially.B suggests no such thing. B suggests that the change is a result of adaptation to the environment.That's ridiculous. The purpose imposed by man is what makes it artificial in the first place. You have the idea expressed in the definition backwards. It isn't that natural selection operates on the same principles as artificial selection, but the reverse. The principles are that differential reproductive success will have an effect on the gene pool of the species.Of course an explanation of artificial selection would talk about purpose. I'm not sure how that is meaningful to the discussion. And of course, mention of eugenics is irrelevant to natural selection.Strange that you seem to miss the meaning of your own quotes. Of course the phrase, "survival of the fittest" is a tautology. But you ignored an important part of your own quote, "Thus, without an independent criterion for fitness, other than survival,..." And of course, Darwin did most certainly express other criterion besides survival. Let me help clarify for you. Survival is not the sole requirement, or even the most important requirement. It should be quite clear to even the most muddled thinker that reproduction is required. In fact, reproduction is the most important requirement. Survival is necessary only long enough for an organism to reproduce, and if an organism doesn't reproduce, it is an evolutionary dead end no matter how long it survives. You see, as was mentioned in your definitions and in comments, natural selection is differential reproduction. Natural selection is not a tautology. Only the phrase, "survival of the fittest" reduces to a tautology.Again, I'm not sure what you are talking about. Can you give some examples? Of course a popular phrase applied to one evolutionary mechanism may reduce to a tautology when expressed without adequate criterion. But what about mutually exclusive theory? Certainly it is possible that two theories may be mutually exclusive before some mechanism is understood enough for us to determine which is correct. There are still answers that we don't have.Anyway, please give some examples. It isn't very instructive when you just drop off with some throw-away comment given without evidence or support.Where did you get that idea? Artificial selection was never proposed as evidence but rather as a more familiar illustration of the principles and mechanisms of evolution.Another assertion without offering any evidence as to why you are correct. None of the quotes you give offer purpose as randomness.It is bizarre to see someone calculate the odds that something will happen after it has happened. It is even more bizarre to see that someone read all of those quotes and apparently missed the context in which they were presented. Certainly none of them were meant to present purpose as randomness. You seem to have missed to point of your own quotes.Later Montalban says:As was pointed out in some of your own quotations, survival is not an 'end' of natural selection. Natural selection is the differential reproductive success of organisms with more favorable suites of characteristics. It is a statistical tendency. Individual organisms may work to survive, but they also work to reproduce. That's as close as it gets to "purpose." And as you know, Darwin's favored term was natural selection. He never used the phrase "survival of the fittest" without also making a reference to natural selection. The opposite is not the case. Since Darwin's time "survival of the fittest" has been rejected by evolutionary biologists because it is such a poor representation of the extent of the theory.

You're a funny man, Waxy. I provide evidence, you provide an assertion. Do you know the difference? Just because some one somewhere else made the same assertion, you presume to think that you can post misrepresentations of Darwin. If you actually had evidence, you'd have posted it.I look forward to another post of yours with 'just-so' assertions :)

Lordy! This nonsense about "natural" and "artificial" selection has gone on too long.Are not human beings part of nature, and part of the environment?Species survival is about the interaction between the population and the environment within which it resides.Man is part of the environment.Most of the "breeding" of the last thousand years has been pure luck. It was only late in the 19th century that we realised that we could intervene in the reproductive process, but of course most of the interventions failed.If we really need to make a distinction we should talk about _deliberate_ intervention, including GM, which is clearly one form of evolution.Of all of the millions, or billions of life modifications we have seen, the number of deliberate modifications is so small as to be statistically insignificant.Please do not bring up extinctions. No one has ever successfully set out to extinguish a life form. All of the extinctions have been accidental: the moa, the passenger pigeon, the dodo. The last dodo died, not to eliminate the species, but to fill a hungry stomach.If we were capable of deliberate extinction we would not be bothere with cockroaches or cane toads.Yes, evolution is a tautology.

Really? Are you denying that evolutionists use the 'random monkey' example?There were many typewritters around since, according this, 1714"The patent for the first typewritter was given to Henry Mill in 1714 but it had so many problems and was not able to be used. From there came William Burt in 1829 with the same idea to make a system of moving keys to be printed on paper; his as well was unsuccessful. Finally in 1868 with much researching and playing around with ideas of past inventors Christopher Latham Sholes invented the American typewritter.

Yes, we are. We also have elements that are super-natural; viz, a soulThank you. I agree it was by pure luck. But it was still 'artificial', that's what Darwin meant when he said 'or by chance.' The odd thing is you're now arguing the same argument I am - you better watch out, or the other evolutionists will take you to task - actually this is highly unlikely because they're not about genuine debate; just shouting down the opposition.How about the Dodo? Ooops, you mention that next...The Dodo became extinct after the arrival of man on its home island. Accidental or not, man caused it, 'by chance'.TautologyLogic.

No. I very carefully explained to you the very simple meaning of the phrase used by Darwin. It is just a simple English sentence. Not very difficult to understand. But somehow you miss what he meant.No I haven't had any problems before. I have called you no names. To say so is a lie. All I do is point out your errors, your failure to understand your own quotes, and how you rarely actually make a reasoned argument. I always explain in great detail why you are wrong. But for some reason you don't seem to understand the meaning of simple English. There was no ad hominem. Do you understand what that means? I don't think so.But I didn't question your intelligence. A simple understanding of what my words would make that clear. You fail to understand Darwin's words. It isn't the first time. You tell us what is at the heart of Darwin's theory without having read Darwin. You didn't even know that Darwin didn't coin the phrase. You didn't know what I meant by tautology. Clearly, you have difficulty in understanding simple language. That is not an insult but an observation from your writing.For example, you claimed that words like "on" and "the" are nouns. Surely no one who understands English grammar and syntax would ever make such claims.

In dealing with several posters on the issue of the 'Nylon Bug' it seems that there exists some confusion over the difference between 'Natural selection' and 'Artificial Selection', not least caused by confusion amongst web-resources.Darwin and other earlier theorists seemed able to differentiate between natural and artificial selectionDarwin says that even when man did it by accident, it was artificial..."Hence it must be assumed, not only that half-civilized man succeeded in thoroughly domesticating several species, but that he intentionally or by chance picked out extraordinarily abnormal species; and further, that these very species have since all become extinct or unknown. So many strange contingencies are improbable in the highest degree."http://www.literature.org/authors/d...chapter-01.html"Man has an aim or an end in view; `natural selection' can have none."*E. Russell, The Diversity of Animals, (1962), p. 124.But this line seems blurred in the quest for evidence of 'natural' natural selection.Different on-line dictionaries deal with Natural Selection in different ways...Example 'a'Natural SelectionA natural process resulting in the evolution of organisms best adapted to the environment.http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary.aspExamples 'b'1. natural selection Author: Susan A.Hagedorn Definition: The differential survival and reproduction of organisms with genetic characteristics that enable them to better use environmental resources.http://biotech.icmb.utexas.edu/searc...pe=normal&def=Definition of natural selection :The process in nature whereby one genotype leaves more offspring than another genotype because of superior life history attributes ( fitness)such as survival or fecundity.http://www.everythingbio.com/glos/de...ural+selectionnatural selectionThe hypothesis that genotype-environment interactions occurring at the phenotypic level lead to differential reproductive success of individuals and hence to modification of the gene pool of a population.http://www.mblab.gla.ac.uk/~julian/dict2.cgi?4346Both deal with the change of organisms. 'A' suggests only that which occurs 'naturally', whilst 'B' suggests change affected by any cause; natural or artificial.Interestingly enough one of those above also states...1. artificial selection Definition: The selective breeding by humans towards a desired trait in a plant, animal, or other organism which is of value (usually economic) to the humans. The process operates on the same principles as natural selection.http://biotech.icmb.utexas.edu/search/dict-search.mhtmlBut man has a purposeful process. This would mean 'nature' also has purpose in it's 'selection' process.Another just saysDefinition of artificial selection :Selective breeding.http://www.everythingbio.com/glos/de...cial+selectionAgain, an emphasis on purpose is given by the following[u[The Hutchinson Dictionary of Science[/u]"artificial selectionIn biology, selective breeding of individuals that exhibit the particular characteristics that a plant or animal breeder wishes to develop. In plants, desirable features might include resistance to disease, high yield (in crop plants), or attractive appearance. In animal breeding, selection has led to the development of particular breeds of cattle for improved meat production (such as the Aberdeen Angus) or milk production (such as Jerseys)."http://www.highbeam.com/library/doc0...R%3AResult&ao=Eugenics The study of improving a species by artificial selection; usually refers to the selective breeding of humans.http://public.ornl.gov/hgmis/externa...erm_action.cfmIt seems some people can't help wishing purpose on evolution. Which is why, in order to give examples of Natural Selection, a textbook will state"Bethell began by pointing out that Darwinian theory is a tautology rather than a predicative theory. (The term tautology means a statement that is true by definition.)* That is, evolution is the survival of the fittest. But who are the fittest? Obviously, the individuals who survive. Thus, without an independent criterion for fitness, other than survival, we are left with the statement that evolution is the survival of the survivors. This indeed is a tautology. But it is possible to assign independent criteria for fitness. Darwin wrote extensively about artificial selection in pigeons, in which the breeders' choice was the criterion for fitness. (Many novel breeds of pigeon have been created this way.) Artificial selection has been practiced extensively by plant and animal breeders. Here too, survival is not the criterion for fitness, productivity is."Robert H Tamarin, (1996) "Principles of Genetics" (5th ed), p571.Evolution it seems can contain tautology, mutually exclusive theory, and redundant terminologies.

My response, included this quote, which is what it was in response to. Evolution most certainly doesn't "contain" these things, given the widely accepted definition of evolution that I posted..and that you've read countless times on this same forum. So no, I'm not mixed up.I am "curious" however, why you're now saying that you are arguing that a tautology is a tautology? It seems...misleading the way you try to broaden the tautology of one phrase, to all of evolution, as seen in your statement "evolution contains tautology".Again, I think it's lack of clarity, possibly intential lack of clarity, in favor of casting doubt on the theory of evolution. Which of course, isn't being debated in science, on the whole. It is being debated by religious people, but that's to defend a dogma, not to understand the world through rational belief.-Mach

He said it is a tautology. I said it contains amongst other things, tautology, mutually exclusive arguments etc. I have already detailed where the tautology lies;with Darwin's use of "Survival of the Fittest" which he claimed was a better term than "Natural Selection", and I've already stated where the mutually exclusive theory lies; with different ideas with regards the ascent of man.Therefore I suspected, as it turns out, wrongly, that you had mixed me up with this other poster; because I've already stated my case - although you've argued thata) it's too large/complex/full of citations andb) that you give a particular definition of evolution and say that it of itself contains no tautology in the wording thereof...But in short, you argument rests on the wording of a definition. Not the theory as a whole.I still don't understand why you don't take him to task as what he has said is more severe a criticism of evolution; saying it is rather than contains.Not at all. The theory of evolution contains many many things.I understand that many people who are against evolution are religious. But I was pointing out that many people who argue against it, who aren't religious, get labelled as fundamentalist anyway.I've no where else to post this at the moment, but I'd still like to use it :)Note also this false statement from a ""Survival of the fittest" is a poor way to think about evolution. Darwin himself never used the phrase. What Darwin said is that heritable variations lead to differential reproductive success. This is not circular or tautologous. It is a prediction which can be, and has been, experimentally verified [Weiner 1994]."http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA500.htmlThis is quite clearly wrong as Darwin did use it in the 6th ed of Species.

Evolution most certainly doesn't "contain" these things, given the widely accepted definition of evolution that I posted..and that you've read countless times on this same forum. So no, I'm not mixed up.I am "curious" however, why you're now saying that you are arguing that a tautology is a tautology? It seems...misleading the way you try to broaden the tautology of one phrase, to all of evolution, as seen in your statement "evolution contains tautology".Again, I think it's lack of clarity, possibly intential lack of clarity, in favor of casting doubt on the theory of evolution. Which of course, isn't being debated in science, on the whole. It is being debated by religious people, but that's to defend a dogma, not to understand the world through rational belief.-Mach

Well survival of the fittest was not Darwins term- although he may of used it it the later editions of the Origin. The phase was actually coined by Herbert Spencer in 1851.Weiner could be forgiven for his statement- if he had read the first edition of the Origin (regarded as being the best version as it contains no responses to critiscsms that were levelled at the preceeding editions) he would not have come across it under Darwins name.It is moot really, as natural selection is the term that is used in this context today.

He said it is a tautology. I said it contains amongst other things, tautology, mutually exclusive arguments etc. I have already detailed where the tautology lies;with Darwin's use of "Survival of the Fittest" which he claimed was a better term than "Natural Selection", and I've already stated where the mutually exclusive theory lies; with different ideas with regards the ascent of man.Therefore I suspected, as it turns out, wrongly, that you had mixed me up with this other poster; because I've already stated my case - although you've argued thata) it's too large/complex/full of citations andb) that you give a particular definition of evolution and say that it of itself contains no tautology in the wording thereof...But in short, you argument rests on the wording of a definition. Not the theory as a whole.I still don't understand why you don't take him to task as what he has said is more severe a criticism of evolution; saying it is rather than contains.Not at all. The theory of evolution contains many many things.I understand that many people who are against evolution are religious. But I was pointing out that many people who argue against it, who aren't religious, get labelled as fundamentalist anyway.I've no where else to post this at the moment, but I'd still like to use it :)Note also this false statement from a ""Survival of the fittest" is a poor way to think about evolution. Darwin himself never used the phrase. What Darwin said is that heritable variations lead to differential reproductive success. This is not circular or tautologous. It is a prediction which can be, and has been, experimentally verified [Weiner 1994]."http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA500.htmlThis is quite clearly wrong as Darwin did use it in the 6th ed of Species.

Yes, I am aware of this. It was one of the false arguments of another poster that he 'taught' me this fact. It is a painful memory that you want me to re-live :)The fact is Darwin chose it. Said previous poster tried all manner of arguments to get Darwin off the hook...a) someone else coined itb) someone else convinced him to use itc) it had gained popular currencyetc.Abrogation of responsibility aside, Darwin clearly states it is a superior term. Darwin I accept, makes mistakes. The person I was debating has no such concession to this uber-man.Excepting that Darwin used it.I accept that.My reason for raising this is because said poster continues to deny that Darwin said that it was superior - he claimed that I was beaten in an argument somewhere else, at another time. Waxy only re-invigorated this debate by stating that I'd been so defeated. post 22 of the current thread being an example of this now cross-thread slanging match. You have innocently walked into the midst of a much larger fight.

Oh, I just got in the post "African Exodus: The Origins of Modern Humanity" by Stringer and McKie - it has one of the theories on the ascent of man.I'm waiting for antoher book, containing a theory that says something quite the opposite; they are mutually exclusive theories. Earlier this year in debating Mizmaxx on this issue I was still relying on the mutually exclusive theories that I'd been taught in Pre-History at university (back in the mid 80s).Many of those theories have fallen by the way-side, but now new ones have arisen in their place, still posing the same problem for all who believe in evolution - because they all can't be right.I shall hope that this book is written in a manner easily digestible by a biology failure :)

Lordy! This nonsense about "natural" and "artificial" selection has gone on too long.Are not human beings part of nature, and part of the environment?Species survival is about the interaction between the population and the environment within which it resides.Man is part of the environment.Most of the "breeding" of the last thousand years has been pure luck. It was only late in the 19th century that we realised that we could intervene in the reproductive process, but of course most of the interventions failed.If we really need to make a distinction we should talk about _deliberate_ intervention, including GM, which is clearly one form of evolution.Of all of the millions, or billions of life modifications we have seen, the number of deliberate modifications is so small as to be statistically insignificant.Please do not bring up extinctions. No one has ever successfully set out to extinguish a life form. All of the extinctions have been accidental: the moa, the passenger pigeon, the dodo. The last dodo died, not to eliminate the species, but to fill a hungry stomach.If we were capable of deliberate extinction we would not be bothere with cockroaches or cane toads.Yes, evolution is a tautology. "Survival of the fittest" means that the fittest survive.Anyone who argues with a tautology is unfit to survive.IzzyemoticonXBanghead

Still, it does not mean that Weiner had read it under a title Darwin wrote emoticonXAngel .They may not be 100% "right" in their entirity but I imagine they each contain truth. Thats no big deal- thats the way science works- construction of a model that fits the observations etc. best. As one of my lecturers said to me once it is extremely difficult, sometimes impossible, to "prove" something; however you can eliminate the unlikely and unsubstanciated.Thats the way things work in science- even more so in a field where new data about the history is being found every year (such as human evolution). Each model has to be borne in mind of new discovery- does it stand the test of time? if it does it is a good model, if not it needs to adapt.Finally, when you say they can't all be right we will see which fits the data best. However, all are in absolute agreement that homo sapiens and ancestors are related and have evolved over time under the influence of natural selection.

Actually, it is quite evident that you were unaware of that fact from your posts. You were instructed by another poster about facts of your own argument. I can understand why the memory should be painful. Sadly, even though you seem to have learned something, you still deny that you have done so.But he didn't. Spencer did and Darwin was convinced to use it because it had become popular among the unwashed masses.Said poster tried to instruct you in the history of the case. All three points are correct. Spencer coined it, Wallace convinced him to use it specifically because it was being popularly referred to by that phrase. Sadly, you don't seem to grasp the meaning of any of it.Yes. Because the phrase (not term) was in popular use, not because it was a more accurate representation of the theory. Moreover, not scientific theory can be adequately represented by some title.Are you not aware that Darwin is dead? Why the use of the present tense?That's a lie. "The person" you were debating stated on several occasions that Darwin was wrong about some things. I'm wondering, what kind of sentence was that? It actually seems to be the product of an illiterate or a drunk.[snip]Meaningless, incomprehensible drivel.[/snip]No you don't. That fact has been pointed out to you by "a certain poster" on more than one occasion. So now you agree that it is Darwin's term (natural selection) that is used today while Spencer's term (survival of the fittest) has been rejected. It seems that Darwin's original term is what has been used for more than 100 years.That's not true. Why can't you tell the truth? I lying acceptable to you? The reasons why Darwin made such a statement were explained to you on more than one occasion. Did you have a problem in understanding simple English? "Said poster" never denied that Darwin made such a remark. Your statement is a bold faced lie, certainly in an effort to make you seem rational.But you have been defeated on every occasion. You argue from a position of ignorance. You admit that you flunked a basic course in biology and yet claim exertise in biology.Post #22? Then you are claiming that you have read Darwin's works? At least you must have read "Origins." So "slanging" is pointing out the you claim expertise on what Darwin meant without actually having read Darwin? At least you show that you don't understand Darwin - it is written in English, after all. I suspect that you find Darwin most difficult. I am an native speaker of English and I have degrees in language, linguistics, and biology. I have written scientific papers and yet I find Darwin a difficult read. But I have read a lot of Darwin, a lot about Darwin, and volumes on Darwinism and neo-Darwinsim. But you know better since you cut and paste short, out of context quotes.Or is it that you don't understand? I think that may be the case.

Wow! I read the book 8 years ago. It's still on my bookshelf. Stringer is one of the leading authorities on Neandertals.Wolpoff? Stringer states the majority opinion. But that is not your problem. You want science to be the absolute truth. To a creationist any scientific theory, once stated, must be the absolute and never changing truth. An objection to two mutually exclusive scientific theories only demonstrates the scientific illiteracy of the objector.Did you flunk that course too? You seem to think that a scientific theory somehow represents the absolute truth rather than a good explanation of observed facts. Only scientific illiterates equate scientific theory with truth. Scientific theories are tested explanations of observed facts. They are subject to revision or rejection upon further testing.Certainly true. We no longer believe that the earth is the center of the universe. We no longer believe that the earth was once flooded enough to cover the higest mountain. We no longer believe that the earth is immovable. Many, many theories have fallen by the wayside. And, of course, new ones have arisen. That is how science works. But science has gone well beyond questioning that the earth is 4.5 billion years old, or that the universe is 13.7 billion years old, or that all life is descended from a common ancestor. Before you are actually accepted as something more than a nutcase, you need to present tested data that contridicts scientific theory. When you do, your theory will be accepted. If your data is conclusive, then your theory will replace the previous theories. If your data is tenusous, then more than one theory will exist.But they aren't claimed to be "right." They are claimed to be reasonable and tested explainations for observed data. They are means to suggest further hypotheses that can be tested. Science is a process of learning. You seem to want it to be "TRUTH".Essentially, if you can show me that the earth does not orbit the sun, I'll accept it. If you can show me that the earth is 7 weeks old, I'll accept it. The problem is that you can't. Science isn't cast in stone (as is religion). Science is a process of learning about our natural universe. Religion is not.The argument against the fact that scientific theories change as we gain more knowledge is stupid in the extreme. Let me offer an analogy. Suppose that the air conditioner in my car fails. I take it to a competent mechanic that I trust. His initial assement is that the the compressor has failed. Later he calls me at work to inform me that the problem is a $5 high/low compression switch. Should I insist that he replace the $500 compressor? The creationist would replace the compressor.No. As I remember, it isn't. You stand a tinker's chance in understanding the book. Moreover, since you don't even seem to be able to comprehend how mutually exclusive scientific theories can exist, your chances of understanding either book are nil.How sad that you were unable to pass a basic course in biology and yet you profess biological expertise.

So Darwin was convinced to use it, but didn't? It's an illogical argument. Why can't you just put this argument to rest and accept that Darwin did use the phrase. - Or are you now suggesting that Wallace, or Grommit, or whomever surreptitiously inserted the phrase, and added Darwin's words saying he endorsed it? It's a new definition of 'used' you have. Darwin somehow didn't use the phrase -according to you, but it appeared in his books. He should have sued for defamation.You seem to think that if you change your UserID but keep the same arguments, no one will be the wiser.one - a defence of Darwin over the use, regardless of who suggested it; everyone else is to blame, but Darwin - Darwin used it! It's a simple enough point. Regardless of Wallace convincing him to use it, Darwin used it. I don't understand why you'd persist to deny this when it's in Darwin's book, unless it was an editorial mistake. Despite all your claims to having read Darwin you still leap logic by saying that he didn't use the phrase, when he did, in his book. 30 years of teaching it - your claim, has not allowed you to admit that.two - a 'that's a lie' response. If you had an reason not to insult, you'd bother with posting references. But you don't.three - an argument that I've been debated somewhere else over a point some other time - if you want to reference where you or someone else trounced me on the 'noun' debate, do so. I've challenged you time and again to put up your argument. You don't.four - a question over understanding EnglishYou seem obsessed to an un-healthy point of using the same insulting language over and over again. It is why you are so easy to spot. No other poster resorts to the same set of insults. I've got a mind to set up a profiling task on you.I don't know what exertise in biology is, but I don't claim it. Show me where I have! I don't even claim expertise in it, either.The reason I don't mind admitting my failure in Biology is because it has not hampered me in any way in debating you time and again - and that is why you continue to make the same 'just-so' arguments - because it's all you've got. If you had an idea about where you believe I've been defeated - reference it.

It is a strange and circular logic. And it gives people the self-belief that they are open-minded, whereas religious people hold onto dogma like a terrier.

I'm wondering. What do we call someone who debates feverishly on scientific theories, yet admittedly does not understand the concepts they are arguing against? Is it productive to debate something that you don't understand the concepts of when it's a fairly involved theory based on scientific evidence?What if you convinced someone NOT to believe in it, but you did so using falsifiable reasons, since you aren't an expert and might not know any better?Irresponsible, is one such word, that comes to mind.-Mach

No I didn't miss it, I was hoping you'd actually put forward an argument against what I said, not what you think I said. See what I actually said was the tautology. Then make your argument.Note Post 30He said evolution is a tautology.I said that Darwin preferred a tautology to "Natural Selection"You may have mixed up who it is you're arguing against.

Why don't you just come out and say what you mean instead of this convoluted post.

I'm wondering. What do we call someone who debates feverishly on scientific theories, yet admittedly does not understand the concepts they are arguing against? Is it productive to debate something that you don't understand the concepts of when it's a fairly involved theory based on scientific evidence?What if you convinced someone NOT to believe in it, but you did so using falsifiable reasons, since you aren't an expert and might not know any better?Irresponsible, is one such word, that comes to mind.-Mach

Montalban is convinced of the following scenario and he has never come close to questioning it. People that don't embrace God need a solid justification for their ethics and beleifs. They want their ethics to be fully backed up by a dogma and justified by a certain way of looking at the world so they embrace evolution not realising it is a tautology that just makes an obviously statement that things that are good at surviving survive. Evolutionists want to claim their ethics are better than everyone elses so they call their theory of evolution "true science" and claim that their true science is the only form of logical thought.

One more time...TAUTOLOGY....Tautology has been used to define evolution. I have repeatedly quoted from Origin of the Species (6th edition) where Darwin used a tautology and claimed it was a better way of describing Natural Selection.MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE THEORIES....The ascent of man by various models which are mutually exclusive;I stated thethe Unilinear School;the Polyphyletic School'the Preneanderthal School; andthe Presapiens Schoolwhich I'd been taught, then gave more modern examples...I stated...I will have to get some books on the latest conflicting theories. Such as "Race And Human Evolution: A Fatal Attraction "by Milford Wolpoff, University of Michigan and Rachel Caspari, University of Michigan "Race and Human Evolution is a far-ranging account by leading researchers in the field that describes the latest scientific evidence and the conflicting theories about human evolution." http://www.perseusbooksgroup.com/perseus-cgi-bin/searchthis is also interesting...http://www.chineseprehistory.org/beard.htmThere's also the afro-centric model

No, it hasn't. The phrase, "survival of the fittest," is not a definition of evolution. Even Darwin used the phrase to refer only to natural selection. That is clear to anyone who has actually read Darwin. Isn't it a bit pathetic that after all of this discussion you are still unable to distinguish the process of evolution from one of the mechanisms of evolution.You have repeatedly misquoted Darwin out of context without understanding what he was talking about. It seems that you are again having a problem in understanding the language. Go back and read the paragraph slowly. In fact, Darwin didn't say that "survival of the fittest" was a better way of describing natural selection (no need to capitalize - it isn't holy dogma but just the name given to a scientific theory. It seems that it is frequently necessary to instruct you in English syntax and grammar). Here is the whole paragraph that you don't seemed to have grasped.Notice that Darwin didn't say that the term was better but specifically linked it to comparisons with artificial selection.But it doesn't matter anyway. The phrase has been rejected by evolutionary biologists because is is so misrepresentative of natural selection. Your original argument was that the phrase was at the heart of evolutionary theory. Nope. You didn't even know that Darwin didn't coin the phrase or that it does reduce to a tautology until it was pointed out to you.And you still haven't answered the question, so what? So what that Darwin was convinced to use the term by Wallace (something else that you didn't know until informed on this board). What does that have to do with the modern theories of evolution? Darwin is a matter of little more than historical interest. What exactly is your point? I suspect you will duck this question.Let's see:The Unilinerar School is fundamentalist creationism. That is pseudoscience based on religious mythology.The Polyphyletic School is obviously wrong since humans are all a single species.The other two are just assertions on your part of apparent lines of thought that you didn't seem to understand. Why do you consider your high school course in social anthropology meaningful to evolutionary theory? So what if there are conflicting theories? I guess we must reject Newton, Einstein, and Bohrs since each had a conflicting theory of physics.You continually pop off with assertions that show your inability to understand what you have read, or you assumptions about what you haven't read, you admit your inability to actually pass an elementary course, and you never get to the point.

You can't help yourself in making these sorts of attacks, which is why, despite repeated warnings about your rudeness, and repeated bannings, you still re-enter the debate, make the same generalised mud-slinging attacks, and then get kicked out again.First you say he didn't use the term, now he did. Please make up your mind. It's like your userID, you have so many of them. But you're so easy to spot because your choice of language is so predictable.What a laugh. Where did you get the idea that I quoted these from a high school text? And, are you arguing that they weren't taught as science, or that they were? It's hard to tell form your dismissal of them. At least when you re-enter these boards under another Username, it would help if you can keep track of what was said.Where'd you get the idea that the Unilinear School is fundamental creationism?

Amazilia also argues several other things at once...That "Survival of the Fittest" doesn't really matter any more, even if it is a mistake, but that it wasn't, because Darwin never used it, or but only in a certain context, besides he was forced/urged to use it by Wallace, and besides that, he didn't coin it.And he accuses me of not understanding English! And that I don't understand English, because I never passed Biology!He makes some off-handed dismissal of several schools of thought that were used to describe possible ways that man evolved. He even accuses one of being a creationist notion! I'd like to see him prove that.He should read...Poirier, F E, "In Search of Ourselves: An Introduction to Physical Anthropology"which he alluded was both a book on Social Anthropology, and a high school text!

You can't help yourself in making these sorts of attacks, which is why, despite repeated warnings about your rudeness, and repeated bannings, you still re-enter the debate, make the same generalised mud-slinging attacks, and then get kicked out again.First you say he didn't use the term, now he did. Please make up your mind. It's like your userID, you have so many of them. But you're so easy to spot because your choice of language is so predictable.What a laugh. Where did you get the idea that I quoted these from a high school text? And, are you arguing that they weren't taught as science, or that they were? It's hard to tell form your dismissal of them. At least when you re-enter these boards under another Username, it would help if you can keep track of what was said.Where'd you get the idea that the Unilinear School is fundamental creationism? Do you have any citations, or did you just suppose it is?You continually pop off with assertions that show your inability to understand what you have read, or you assumptions about what you haven't read, you admit your inability to actually pass an elementary course, and you never get to the point. So what if there are conflicting theories in any science? How exactly do you think that science progresses?[/quote]Why do you think we should reject Newton? (or, why do you think I should?)I know you have no problem with mutually exclusive theory, that's why you can argue simultaneously that Darwin both used the phrase, and that he didn't. You're not alone in this, Mach both argues that the field of exobiology is science, and science-fiction.

While you see the need to not only debate him on points, then post an expose about your ideas of his capability, I'm still curious why you like to discuss why a tautology is a tautology. How does the phrase "survival of the fittest" change in any way, what evolution is, the evidence that supports it, and the fact that there simply is no strong evidence for any other mechanism by which humans have come to be, on earth?I ask because I assume you must think there is some relevance to the discussion of creation vs evolution. There might not be, that's OK too, I'd just like to make sure we don't put words in your mouth.-Mach

Amazilia also argues several other things at once...That "Survival of the Fittest" doesn't really matter any more, even if it is a mistake, but that it wasn't, because Darwin never used it, or but only in a certain context, besides he was forced/urged to use it by Wallace, and besides that, he didn't coin it.And he accuses me of not understanding English! And that I don't understand English, because I never passed Biology!He makes some off-handed dismissal of several schools of thought that were used to describe possible ways that man evolved. He even accuses one of being a creationist notion! I'd like to see him prove that.He should read...Poirier, F E, "In Search of Ourselves: An Introduction to Physical Anthropology"which he alluded was both a book on Social Anthropology, and a high school text!

Yes, how silly of me to debate him on 'points'. I should debate him on .... what?And here you are again criticising one side, and not the other. He was insulting; you remained stony silent.Because he denies that Darwin ever used it. Darwin did. Small point but he entered into all sorts of highly spurious rationales rather than accepting this point (again you were stony silent on this)What is evolution?What is evidence?Well that would be a first time.But why ask now, after several days, after he's gone by the wayside, after he made the claim again and again and again? You made no statement while he was claiming this false claim? Why your sudden interest in digging all posts I've responded too?
