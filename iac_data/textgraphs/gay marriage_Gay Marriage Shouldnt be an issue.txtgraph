Gay marriage shouldn't be an issue. Marriage is a religious ceremony. If we have separation of church and state then the state shouldn't have anything to do with marriage. Giving tax breaks and insurance breaks to those who are married is not right. Why should the government care about your marriage? That is too much government interference. So yea marriage should be between a man and a women but the government shouldnt have any say in that anyway. So if two gays what to say they are married nothing should stop them although I believe they're not.

Marriage is also legally binding. Tax breaks? Ever hear of the Marriage Penalty?

I have done some reading on the marriage penalty and there might be some truth to what your saying although you do get insurance breaks. I still say that marriage should be a religious ceremony of two people and the government should have no agenda in the matter. here is a site you should look at. http://moneycentral.msn.com/content/Taxes/P48908.asp

This past Saturday, my partner and I had a commitment ceremony or wedding if you say care to say.....In my state it is not legally bindingm we did it anyway.....it was more about the emotional commitment two people make to each other in the presence of their friends and family. I tried so hard not to, but when the celebrant asked me to repeat after him, with the vows I wrote my self.....I tried and tried and tried, but couldn't speak. I was too moved by the moment and all I could do was cry....I love my partner with all my heart....So I wanted to get through, I thought about our taxes (didn't work). So thought about everyone in their underware.....contrary to popular opinoin that doesn't work either.....I managed to get the words out (don't know how) just did!This marriage is just as perfect to us, and those that were our witnessess.....as any heterosexual wedding......The rest of the night was blur, between 50 people wanting my attention and me being really buzzed on white wine.....oh my oh my.......I was pretty shocked!Marrige is what you decide it is, regardles if the gov was to see it....I am now married.....like it or not.

I like bassman but i disagree with him on some issues. I really think marriage is between a man and a women but whos to stop homosexuals from making any kind of bonding commitment. The government cannot control your life or anything. Personally I dont want the government involved in my marriage when I have one. Thats great that you and your partner have a relationship like that and have made a bond. I do not think homosexuality is a choice because I cannot choose to not be arroused by women. If i wanted to be arroused by men i couldnt so therefore it is not a choice.

Thank you I think you seem to understand the point how many gays and lesbians feel about their sexual orientation.I agree with you get government out of the marriage business all together; then we would all be equal. Since the government is in the marriage busisness then they should extend the contract to all couples of consenting adults no matter their sex. As it stands now gay couples have no legal protection against the families of the other partner, even with a will, they could still take your home, keep you from your partner, have you arrested if you show up at the funeral, take your children. In a disaster, such as katrina, gays and lesbians have no rights to find, retrieve, or even ask about their dead partner. Marriage offers legal protections against people who hate you and would do you harm.The wierd thing is they only see gay men as disgusting many straight men, I know, love to watch lesbians and their sexual exploits. Also there isn't one biblical scripture the talks about lesbians or lesbianism being a sin.

And did you ever hear that it's not always a penalty but sometimes a benefit? And did you know that if it would be a penalty, you're free to simply not file your taxes jointly, which results in no penalty at all? And certainly with respect to insurance, there are many benefits bestowed by marriage, as cmitch06 pointed out.This of course doesn't factor in the countless other benefits of marriage, such as naturalization, food stamps, veteran's benefits, housing benefits, greater ability to take out a loan, visitation rights, property rights, etc.

actually, marriage is the government's concern. marriage has a lot of legal attachments, such as change of surname, identity, income status, etc. the same argument could be made about the government interferring with private employment. these things are regulated by the government because its in the government benefits from nuclear families, as it benefits from an employed workforce. the govrnment offers rewards and incentives for these things, but also expects participants to play by the governemt's rules in turnconcerning homosexual marriage, allowing this type of legal union also raises the question of multiple partner marriages, or marriage of siblings/close family. the issue of legality will inevitably come up, and the word "marriage" becomes more of a "legal partnership (with sexual benefits lol)". it could potentially be a very tangled web, and that has nothing to do with biblical rhetoricin the case of marriage, for instance, it is recognized that the family takes the surname of the husband. in a gay union, where you either have 2 husbands, or no husbands, this is a serious issue for the government. there are lots of other considerations that must be ironed out from a legalistic standpoint before the concept of gay marriage can be really pushed forwardwith that said, i think gay-marriage lobbies and activists are wasting a lot of time and resources by even entertaining the religious aspect of marriage. as far as marriage is concerned, the church is optional. in fact, the only reason why most weddings are held in a church is because of tradition. there really is no logical need for the church to be the authority on marriage. particularly for gay unions, its not as though the gays hope that god blesses their marriage. gays usually have contempt for the bible-based churches, particularly because the bible clearly speaks of homosexuality as an abomination. yet the very gays are making every effort to get the church's approval? this makes no sense to meif gays drop the war against religion and focus their efforts on where it really counts, i.e., the legal aspect, then their cause would advance a lot more, imo

I think part of the reason they pander to religion even though they hate it is that they know that they have little choice. Religion is a very powerful influence on our culture. If most of religion is against something, it's pretty much a given that society is going to be against it, at large. Religion has also been the catalyst for many of the major social changes in history. Many of the black civil rights leaders came out of evangelical churches. I think gays would love to see that happen with their movement, but for the most part it hasn't because church people usually recognize the differences between these two movements.

exactly, and right here is where we need to break the influence of religion from society. its much harder than it sounds, but it can be done, and i believe it will be well worth the effortfirst of all, religion appeals to the emotions. the less facts and information, the better. interestingly enough, political campaigns follows this exact formula. what this county needs is a mental rennaisance. that way they will form the habit of thinking critically and looking for facts, rather than being swayed by emotional string-pulling. and i think the time and generation is just right for such a revolutionfrom an emotional level, people want to believe that god exists because they want to think theres a higher authority for right and wrong. realistically, right and wrong has been always determined by people, even when its under the guise of coming from god. this is key. not an easy pill to swallow, but vitalonce people learn to question everything, and not see any single individual as an absolute authority on anything (also born out of the concept of god), more facts will be revealed, more intelligent decisions will be made, and issues like gay marriage will be fought in the right arena

Why does anyone taking someones last name have anything to do with the governments business. I understand why the government has to take some part if theres no legal document stating that your married then if something happens to your partner then you have no say so. I guess although I would like less government action in my personal life. If they want to have civil unions that is perfectly alright with me. Because I understand that it must hurt really bad to love another person and just because its not socially acceptable you can't have that person say what happens to you if you were on life support or something.

I think bassman may be alittle closed minded. I agree with him on alot of issues which is gotten me called closed minded. The only way to not be able to grasp the concept that you have no choice in what you find attractive is to be closed minded. God destroyed the kingdom of Sodom and Gomorrah because of violence and rape not because they were raping guys. Anything you can say about how the bible condems homosexuality goes out the window.

While indeed marriage was once a religious ceremony, it is fairly clear that ceremony has been taken away from the religion and added as an American tradition, so to speak. I know of someone who once proposed that we get rid of marriage altogther and give everyone civil unions except for thos acknowledged by the church. As feasible as that may be, marriage is too rooted in our American culture. For that reason it is best to truly offer rights to everyone as our constitution so rightly protects.

So if two gays what to say they are married nothing should stop them although I believe they're not.

That was put nicely. No argument here. Maybe marriage should be taken out and give everyone civil unions. And if you wanted to be considered married it can be your religious ceremony

A case could be made that it is society that influences religion. I take the Anglican church as an example. It does comitment ceremonies for same-sex couples(in Vancouver), has a gay bishop from the U.S. It has women as priests. It has done this within western society, but it's really causing problems with the African congregations who feel they can't accept it because of their society. In Canada, the largest Prostestant denomination, the United Church of Canada, performs gay marriages. The Anglicans in Canada are having a serious and respectful discussion on the matter. Candian society is very accepting of gay people and has instituted equal marriage for same-sex couples.In the U.S. the United Church of Christ recently came out in favour of same-sex marriage. This was perhaps influenced by changes within American society.

Some believe that is a problem with translation and interpretation. For example in Romans, the reference was to acts involving idol worship, and acts which went against someone's personal nature. For example the men were really hetersexual, but they performed same-sex sexual acts, acts which went against their heterosexual nature. I have a bit of a problem with the notion that God could give people up to sexual things. What control does God have here to give up? Makes one a little squeemish. Is that really how you want to see your God?As for Corinthians, in its original Greek, Paul didn't use the commonly understood Greek term for male homosexuals of that period, so it is open to interpretation what he meant. He could have been merely referring to immoral or exploitative relationships. If he were condeming homosexuals specifically, he would have surely used the term. Also, your version, the NIV, I believe, uses the term "homosexual offenders". That doesn't refer to all homosexuals. For example, if we saw the term "heterosexual offenders", we wouldn't take that to refer to all heterosexuals, only to the bad among that group.

We don't just benefit from what is often considered the common, nuclear family. We benefit from families with adopted children, step children, families with no children at all. No it does not.Prove it will come up, and also prove it will come up as a result of same-sex marriage.Marriage is that now.You're right, it has nothing to do with the Bible. It has everything to do with the slippery slope logical fallacy, which we've discussed in the forum ad nauseum. It only shows that those opposed do not have an argument. You know the prospect of incest and polygamy is much less socially acceptable than gay marriage, so you try to erroneously tie polygamy and incest to gay marriage in people's mind to strike fear in them, and hope their logical reasoning can be replaced by irrational fear.

I would argue that you are not very bright and refuse to use your mind. The christian religion is based on Christ not on mens interpretation of what God wants. When Jesus came he showed the Pharisees and men of God how wrong they were and he would come back today and show the same thing because men get it wrong. Jesus never condemed homosexuality. He never condoned capital punishment either. Those both seem to be the natural thoughts of hetero sexual males. Who A. Embraced the natural feelings toward people who murder. B.

If it referred to sexual offenders in general it would have said so. To say that these are all mistranslations is a bit of a stretch and seems as if you are trying to twist words into making it say what you wish it to say. It just is what it is. I would argue that you have not refuted what it says in the Bible. Christians believe the Bible is the Word of God. Jesus happens to be God. To say that Jesus did not say everything would not be accurate. The Bible is very clear on the issue of homosexuality and I would say that if one can not see this then how can they say they know God?On a side note, I would hope in the future you would refrain from calling me "not very bright". I tend to give one warning as many know.

Some believe that is a problem with translation and interpretation. For example in Romans, the reference was to acts involving idol worship, and acts which went against someone's personal nature. For example the men were really hetersexual, but they performed same-sex sexual acts, acts which went against their heterosexual nature. I have a bit of a problem with the notion that God could give people up to sexual things. What control does God have here to give up? Makes one a little squeemish. Is that really how you want to see your God?As for Corinthians, in its original Greek, Paul didn't use the commonly understood Greek term for male homosexuals of that period, so it is open to interpretation what he meant. He could have been merely referring to immoral or exploitative relationships. If he were condeming homosexuals specifically, he would have surely used the term. Also, your version, the NIV, I believe, uses the term "homosexual offenders". That doesn't refer to all homosexuals. For example, if we saw the term "heterosexual offenders", we wouldn't take that to refer to all heterosexuals, only to the bad among that group.

And the term "XXXXX" has had a different meaning too, that doesn't mean it is not often used to refer to gay people. Plus, he used the term you are talking about even though he had already talked about 'loose morals' in the passage by saying 'sexually immoral'. It's unlikely he would be redundant.I wish that were the case.
attacks
Well, the term Paul used referred to having loose morals. That's way too broad. He didn't use some other term that specifically referred to homosexuals. Mine is indeed a compelling argument. Bashing the bad things, they use it for, not the good things.

That's exactly what it is.I've always thought it was kind of odd that some gay people, who otherwise could care less about the Bible and God, will go out of their way to engage in interpretive and hermaneutic gymnastics to avoid standard interpretations about homosexual behavior. I don't understand why they don't just go ahead and simply disagree with the Bible as they do in so many other cases. Do they really think they are going to convince Christendom to abandon centuries of standard Biblical understanding, common sense, and basic translation by arguing the Bible is gay-sex friendly? Of all the arguments the gay lobby engages in, this one is the one that I find most bizarre. It's one where many people who have not cared a bit about the Bible (even attacking it at times) suddenly try to make it their ally or become instant Biblical scholars and try to overturn pretty much mostly all of Biblical scholarship on this subject over time. It just seems to me it would be easier, and certainly more consistent with their other positions on things, to simply take issue with the Bible and disagree with it.

Hmm, after reading this, my question is as follows: exactly what does the term Paul used mean? Is it nothing more than another word for "homosexuals"? Or does it not actually mean "homosexuals" at all? If not, then Jyoshu's comparison to the word "XXXXX" is inappropriate, for the word "XXXXX" does refer to homosexuality.It seems to me that you suggested the word Paul used means "homosexual offenders". Is that correct? If so, then it appears to me very certain that the Bible was mistranslated three or four times, despite your skepticism of that possibility. Is the mistranslation so important with that meaning? Perhaps not, I really just mean to say that the fact that the Bible was translated in the same fashion three or four times doesn't mean that it was mistranslated the same way each of those times. Let's figure out what the word actually means, then determine the correct translation for ourselves.That being said, I remember reading a few times that the word Paul uses does not refer to homosexuality at all, but merely "indecent acts" or something along those lines. I also remember reading that Paul used this same word in other places in the Bible at times when he most certainly was not referring to homosexuality. If these things are true, then it does not appear likely to me that Paul was referring to homosexuality, for although Jyoshu is right that an English-speaker means the same thing if he uses "XXXXX" instead of "gay", he likely does not mean the same thing if he uses "indecent acts" instead of "homosexuality".Now, I'm not certain of the accuracy of what I've written above, and I do not believe I retained the sources in which I read this, so perhaps we can look together to determine whether what I've said is correct or not.Some sources I came up with in a random Google search are:http://www.gaysouthafrica.org.za/hom...lity/bible.asphttp://www.truluck.com/html/six_bible_passages.htmlhttp://www.whosoever.org/bible/corin.htmlhttp://www.whosoever.org/bible/tim.htmlThe whosoever links above seem to me the most informed on the topic, though I would not mind another opinion.People with believe structures and religions far different than yours claim to know God, if you are a true follower of Christianity, should you not suspect that those of completely different religions are incorrect about their relationship with God before you suspect a fellow Christian who holds a single difference in opinion about the teachings of the Bible?I should just mention here that this is a debate, and such insults will happen. If they do, it is appropriate to point them out, as you have done. However, I would not mind if you left out the threat about only giving one warning; such threats should not be necessary in a debate between the two of you, both of whose intentions seem good.

Why does anyone taking someones last name have anything to do with the governments business. I understand why the government has to take some part if theres no legal document stating that your married then if something happens to your partner then you have no say so. I guess although I would like less government action in my personal life. If they want to have civil unions that is perfectly alright with me. Because I understand that it must hurt really bad to love another person and just because its not socially acceptable you can't have that person say what happens to you if you were on life support or something.

attacks
We don't just benefit from what is often considered the common, nuclear family. We benefit from families with adopted children, step children, families with no children at all. No it does not.Prove it will come up, and also prove it will come up as a result of same-sex marriage.Marriage is that now.You're right, it has nothing to do with the Bible. It has everything to do with the slippery slope logical fallacy, which we've discussed in the forum ad nauseum. It only shows that those opposed do not have an argument. You know the prospect of incest and polygamy is much less socially acceptable than gay marriage, so you try to erroneously tie polygamy and incest to gay marriage in people's mind to strike fear in them, and hope their logical reasoning can be replaced by irrational fear.

It strikes me that anyone arguing for gay marriage but not the examples you give are not really arguing for equality at all, but simply for the line to be drawn in a different place. The real issue in the marriage debate, when it's all boiled down, is whether marriage is to be broadened or not. The only way someone can make a consistent, non-hypocritical argument in favor of equality when it comes to marriage is to talk of extending marriage to ANY sort of arrangement that could ever come up, such as the one in your example. Otherwise, we're really just talking about moving the line a bit, which still wouldn't be equality.

With the presentation of a different source by Jyoshu, claiming that the words of the Paul do indeed indicate homosexuality. This being the case, we must determine which source is accurate and which is not. Being a supporter of gay rights, I will attempt to find flaws in Jyoshu's source (Gudel).The first quote that Jyoshu listed deals primarily with arguments not presented in this thread, and the first paragraph of the second quote more reiterates those arguments than anything else. So I will begin with where Jyoshu's author starts justifying his opinion, in the second paragraph of the second quote.The sources this author uses here are interesting to note. The first important one, source 35 suggests that every virtually every Greek Lexicon has understood those words to be referring to homosexuality. However, if you note the sources at the bottom, you can see that this claim comes from a book by John Bowers called Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality.Although I was not able to find the text of this book, I did find this website:http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/index-bos.htmlIt claims that in that book, Boswell "proposes that homosexuals were accepted before the 13th century, and then intolerance sets in." Furthermore, it is the same source (source 34) that Jyoshu's author used above to reference the argument that the Bible does not actually oppose homosexuality. In such a book, the claim that just about every Greek Lexicon understands those words to refer to homosexuality likely comes with an explanation of how that does not truly indicate the intentions of the Bible. That explanation appears to have been left out of Gudel's writings, and although it will take one of us purchasing the book to figure this out for certain, I wonder if Boswell points out that because of lack of information about this word, just about every Greek Lexicon today bases that translation off of the common translations used in the Bible, not on the fashion that it would actually have been used at the time.I will have to think about purchasing Boswell's book.The second importan sources here, sources 36 and 37, come from A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature, which, by the sound of it, based its translations on the common Biblical translations at the time, not on the fashion in which the Greek would have used them. This is further evidenced in the fact that it lists "sodomite" in one of its definitions, for surely the Greek would not have had a word for a city which did not exist in their mythology.A very good analysis of this can be found in the essay here:http://www.tms.edu/tmsj/tmsj3h.pdfThis essay is written by James Young, and it argues that Paul was indeed referring to homosexuality. However, it also provides a more complete and balanced summary of the arguments of his opponents, including Boswell. I find the arguments provided by his opponents, especially Boswell, to be more compelling than the arguments against them listed by Young himself.I urge you to read Boswell's interpretation of the word on pages 3-6 of that article. He provides a very compelling argument suggesting that Paul created this term because he had no other appropriate way of referring to male prostitutes.Young in retaliation points out the relation to the passages in Leveticus described above, and he suggests that Paul created the word as something the Greek would easily recognize, however it does not seem likely to me that Paul would create a new word to describe something for which the words to describe it already existed.Anyhow, I hope that article is helpful.

Do you still make this claim? Have I not stated numerous times that we argue for equality, but only when equality makes sense? Have I not explained that equality is appropriate in the case of same-sex marriage because there are no harms of same-sex marriage? The idea that anyone who argues in support of same-sex marriage must also argue in support of incestuous marriage or be hypocritical is absurd and untrue. It is absolutely possible to believe that same-sex marriage is a good thing while incestuous marriage is not. You might as well be saying that "it is hypocritical to believe in opposite-sex marriage but not every form of marriage." I am amazed that you still state what you have after all the conversations we've had. No one here wants equality if there's a good reason for denying it. But no one has provided that good reason.That being said, I am still interested in your answer to unkerpaulie. I believe you have used it as an opportunity to call gay rights supporters hypocritical, which is fine (except that I disagree), but can you name a good reason that society should deny incestuous marriage?

But if you are going to do something which someone else doesn't like, and you tell them you will, isn't that the definition of a threat? Ah, regardless, I hardly think that's necessary. A single insult, nor even a few insults, are worth nothing more than a request to have a debate without insults.I am not trying to argue against 24 times, I am trying to argue against a single time. In the future, I do not plan on arguing against all 24 times at all. I will brush off every reference to homosexuality in the Old Testament with the single acknowledgement that the Old Testament mandates murder, and as such, you either accept that you must murder people of different faiths, or you do not accept the Old Testament. As you put it, "it is what it is, and you either believe it or you don't."Well, I'm absolutely trying to make the Bible say what I want it to say. But that doesn't mean I'm wrong; maybe I've got very good reasons backing me. We should expect that every person, every translator of the Bible, made it to say what he wanted it to say, or at least what he thought it should say. Is it simply the first person to do that who gets the everlasting interpretation, or is that original interpretation not up for discussion?We should expect that this discussion be initiated by those who want it to be something different; that doesn't mean we should write them off as incorrect.Well, I'm not really a Christian. But I do enjoy a good debate, especially one where I believe myself to be on moral side. You may believe the Bible holds all of the answers, and you just have to find them, but maybe you have to do a little more work to find those answers than you think. I recommend starting by looking at the quote in my signature.

jaxian, again, what exactly do you think will be achieved by trying to prove that paul was not speaking out against homosexuals? paul spoke out about dozens of activities as abominations, including gamblers, revelers, adulterers, prostitutes, fornicators and extorters. yet why is it that there is so much doubt that paul could have possibly included homosexuals? do you see the gamblers or partiers or fornicators looking through tons of greek and hebrew translations to show that paul didnt mean there activities werent sinful? why is it that in society we can all agree that the bible against all these things, yet nobody gives a damn about that, yet when homosexuality is included, we all become bible scholars?listen, you will NOT find anything in the bible that suggets that homosexuality is ok. you will find plenty instances in the bible where murder, mutilation, torture and slavery were endorsed. but homosexuality? forget it.the solution is simple. do what all the other gamblers, revelers, adulterers, prostitutes, fornicators and extorters are doing. leave the bible alone, acknowledge that homosexuality is indeed a sin as far as the bible is concerned, and just go about your business. society has accepted gambling, partying, prostitution, fornication and extortion as questionable but "ok if it feels ok", dispite what the bible says about it. what is the deal?

Do you still make this claim? Have I not stated numerous times that we argue for equality, but only when equality makes sense? Have I not explained that equality is appropriate in the case of same-sex marriage because there are no harms of same-sex marriage? The idea that anyone who argues in support of same-sex marriage must also argue in support of incestuous marriage or be hypocritical is absurd and untrue. It is absolutely possible to believe that same-sex marriage is a good thing while incestuous marriage is not. You might as well be saying that "it is hypocritical to believe in opposite-sex marriage but not every form of marriage." I am amazed that you still state what you have after all the conversations we've had. No one here wants equality if there's a good reason for denying it. But no one has provided that good reason.That being said, I am still interested in your answer to unkerpaulie. I believe you have used it as an opportunity to call gay rights supporters hypocritical, which is fine (except that I disagree), but can you name a good reason that society should deny incestuous marriage?

Then what may lead to incest and polygamy is the fact that marriage is a legal institution, is that what you are saying? If so, these things may come up equally as a result of straight legal marriage or gay legal marriage or interracial legal marriage, or legal inter-faith marriage or legal marriage with legal divorce, etc. It doesn't relate specifically to gay legal marriage at all. I was saying this is how many people attempt an argument against gay marriage, by attempting to incite fear by spouting off a parade of horribles that have nothing to do with the issue of gay marriage. What if straight people are married and winged green monkeys come flying out of everyone's derriere in the future? What will you do then? Demonstrate how gay marriage specifically relates to incest and incestuous marriage and polygamy. This is the gay rights forum, not the incest forum.

a married couple as the head of a home is considered a nuclear familyit already has. the question of legality is what this whole issue is about. marriage is a legal instituation, how could legality NOT come up. yes it iswhoa... hold up... are you saying that only because gay marriage is less unacceptable that incestuous relations, that its ok to grant gay marriage but not sibling marriage?? if the incestuous society begin to parade and protest, until society accepts them on the level that they accept gays now, what will you say then? on what grounds should we discriminate against 2 siblings wanting to get married, particularly if they believe they truly love each other, or if they believe that they were born with that attraction? this is classic hypocracy. if 2 siblings want to love each other in their private lives, how is that any business of yours? and what does irrational fear have to do with anything? do you have an irrational fear of an incestuous or polygamous lifestyle? based on what?give me one reason why society shouldnt accept an incestuous relation between two consenting adults

This is a debate forum, and I post here with the intent of having an enjoyable debate. Further, promoting the belief that homosexuality is acceptable, in whatever fashion, increases the chances of equal rights being granted under the law, which I believe is not currently the case.So what reason is there that I should not participate in a Biblical debate? If nothing else, I (and hopefully the others involved) have enjoyed the debate.In order to suggest that we grant rights to some people which we deny to others, we must show some sort of harm in granting those rights. In the case of incestuous marriage, there are two arguments which I can imagine against incestuous marriage. The first involves the increased chance of having retarded children. One might suggest that this reason does not apply to incestuous couples who do not have children, however the response would be that by legalizing any form of incestuous marriage, we are putting incestuous relationships sexual on the same legal level as other forms of relationships, and in doing so, we are failing to reinforce the idea that having children via incestuous sex is wrong. If the harm of having a child via incestuous sex could be shown to be so great that it warrants denying the rights of incestuous couples to be recognized under our law, then it might be said that it is immoral not to discriminate against incestuous couples in such a fashion.Another possible reason for denying incestuous marriage stems from the increased ability of one family member to abuse his or her relationship with another family member in order to convince that family member that the love they share should be turned into a sexual relationship. To present a more simple example, a father may teach his daughter that she is to engage in sex with him. It might not be difficult to see how various other family relationships could be abused in the same fashion as the father-daughter relationship.The only comparison I can imagine being made between the two is that the AIDS virus or some other STD is more easily transmitted through homosexual sex, and the discouragement of this is similar to the discouragement of bearing retarded children. The problem with such an argument is that homosexual sex is not the action which causes AIDS; promiscuous sex is that action. Same-sex marriage, when implemented should serve as a discouragement for promiscuous sex among gay people, and perhaps the lack of recognition of same-sex unions has played a part in the increased rates of AIDS among gay people in the first place. Alternately, recognition of incestuous unions would increase the rate of incestuous children born if anything. This increase would debatably constitute a harm, however the possible decrease in AIDS from legalizing same-sex marriage must undoubtedly be considered a benefit.This all being said, I freely admit that I am no expert on the issue of incestuous relationships. I suggest these as possible reasons one might argue against it formed out of the small amount of thought I've garnered toward incestuous marriage, however I would not be surprised to see either or both rendered illogical, nor would I be surprised if an expert opponent of incestuous marriage came up with some better argument.If these harms and all others presented are shown to be irrational, then I would see no reason why incestuous marriage should not be made legal. I invite any here to disagree with my reasons, in which case we should make incestuous marriage legal, so far none have done so. I invite any here to present some harm common across both incestuous and homosexual marriage, but not across heterosexual marriage, which makes it impossible to support same-sex marriage while opposing incestuous marriage. Yet of course, no such harm has been suggested.

jaxian, again, what exactly do you think will be achieved by trying to prove that paul was not speaking out against homosexuals? paul spoke out about dozens of activities as abominations, including gamblers, revelers, adulterers, prostitutes, fornicators and extorters. yet why is it that there is so much doubt that paul could have possibly included homosexuals? do you see the gamblers or partiers or fornicators looking through tons of greek and hebrew translations to show that paul didnt mean there activities werent sinful? why is it that in society we can all agree that the bible against all these things, yet nobody gives a damn about that, yet when homosexuality is included, we all become bible scholars?listen, you will NOT find anything in the bible that suggets that homosexuality is ok. you will find plenty instances in the bible where murder, mutilation, torture and slavery were endorsed. but homosexuality? forget it.the solution is simple. do what all the other gamblers, revelers, adulterers, prostitutes, fornicators and extorters are doing. leave the bible alone, acknowledge that homosexuality is indeed a sin as far as the bible is concerned, and just go about your business. society has accepted gambling, partying, prostitution, fornication and extortion as questionable but "ok if it feels ok", dispite what the bible says about it. what is the deal?

You could make the argument that incenstuous marriages can be conducted without harm, just as you can argue that gay marriage can have no harm.My point still stands because other relationships CAN come about without harm if the parties give proper consent. Pedophilia is an exception to this, which is harmful. But you are simply wrong if you think polygamy cannot be conducted without harm, or incestuous marriages, for that matter. It is possible, sure. Nevertheless, two people could certainly enter into an incenstuous marriage without harm to anyone if they try hard enough.Not any reason you'd like, because the reasons I'd give are rooted in religion, just like my reasons for opposing gay marrriage.

The argument against incestuous marriage would have to be that incestuous marriage would, on a whole or on average, cause more harm than it would good; the argument would not be that it is impossible for an individual incestuous relationship to be harmless.As you know, regarding same-sex marriage, not only to I contend that same-sex marriage will cause less harm than good, I contend that it will not cause a single harm to our society in any fashion whatsoever.The argument against polygamous marriage may be similar to the incestuous argument, but it may also be one of impracticality.Ah, well... I think you understand already how I feel about writing one's own religion into laws, so I will not repeat it until another debate on the subject arises.

Right, but either way, since it is obvious a couple can definitely engage in this sort of relationship without harm, then the same arguements could be made to extend marriage to them too. So again, if you don't include them in your push for equality, then you are really simply only arguing to "move the line" a bit. One can rationalize either sort of relationship to be harmless.

thats not what im saying. what may lead to incestuous marriage is if siblings or related people who love each other and want to live together under the legal union of marriage. and what may lead to polygamous marriage is 3 or more people who love each other and want to live together under the legal union of marriage. do you see a pattern here?ooooh.. nice way to snake out of the issue... let me refresh your memorysince you brought it up, what exactly does the social acceptance of any type of "taboo" relationship have to do with their right to be legally married? is there a certain limit of "tabooness", and if youre past that limit then no marriage for you? and what fear are you talking about? i'm talking about people that love each other and want to tie the knot. how could that possibly strike fear in somebody? please....

It seems to me that even if that's the case, it doesn't weaken Gudel's argument. These are two different things to consider, not the same. Furthermore, it could be argued that for a source claiming homosexuality is permissible in the Bible to claim that just about every Greek Lexicon understands those words to refer to homosexuality only makes it that much harder for your side to refute--it could be seen as an admission from Boswell. How do you figure? Typically lexicons are based on numerous things, one definitely being writings in the original languages. (in this case, non-Biblical, but still Greek from the period.)Perhaps the lexicon simply translated the greek word for homosexual to "sodomite." (A common term earlier in the 20th century and before.) I don't see why this would reflect on the author's premise that most Greek Lexicons understand those words to refer to homosexuality.Heh, well I find Young to be more compelling. :) Paul may have just as easily wanted to use his own term for homosexuals to show in terminology that they are offensive by having homosexual behavior ("homosexual offenders"). Either way, I don't don't see Boswell's view any more compelling.I doubt there was a word in place that indentified both homosexual relations AND it's offensiveness, in one word. Maybe there was, but I doubt it.

With the presentation of a different source by Jyoshu, claiming that the words of the Paul do indeed indicate homosexuality. This being the case, we must determine which source is accurate and which is not. Being a supporter of gay rights, I will attempt to find flaws in Jyoshu's source (Gudel).The first quote that Jyoshu listed deals primarily with arguments not presented in this thread, and the first paragraph of the second quote more reiterates those arguments than anything else. So I will begin with where Jyoshu's author starts justifying his opinion, in the second paragraph of the second quote.The sources this author uses here are interesting to note. The first important one, source 35 suggests that every virtually every Greek Lexicon has understood those words to be referring to homosexuality. However, if you note the sources at the bottom, you can see that this claim comes from a book by John Bowers called Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality.Although I was not able to find the text of this book, I did find this website:http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/index-bos.htmlIt claims that in that book, Boswell "proposes that homosexuals were accepted before the 13th century, and then intolerance sets in." Furthermore, it is the same source (source 34) that Jyoshu's author used above to reference the argument that the Bible does not actually oppose homosexuality. In such a book, the claim that just about every Greek Lexicon understands those words to refer to homosexuality likely comes with an explanation of how that does not truly indicate the intentions of the Bible. That explanation appears to have been left out of Gudel's writings, and although it will take one of us purchasing the book to figure this out for certain, I wonder if Boswell points out that because of lack of information about this word, just about every Greek Lexicon today bases that translation off of the common translations used in the Bible, not on the fashion that it would actually have been used at the time.I will have to think about purchasing Boswell's book.The second importan sources here, sources 36 and 37, come from A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature, which, by the sound of it, based its translations on the common Biblical translations at the time, not on the fashion in which the Greek would have used them. This is further evidenced in the fact that it lists "sodomite" in one of its definitions, for surely the Greek would not have had a word for a city which did not exist in their mythology.A very good analysis of this can be found in the essay here:http://www.tms.edu/tmsj/tmsj3h.pdfThis essay is written by James Young, and it argues that Paul was indeed referring to homosexuality. However, it also provides a more complete and balanced summary of the arguments of his opponents, including Boswell. I find the arguments provided by his opponents, especially Boswell, to be more compelling than the arguments against them listed by Young himself.I urge you to read Boswell's interpretation of the word on pages 3-6 of that article. He provides a very compelling argument suggesting that Paul created this term because he had no other appropriate way of referring to male prostitutes.Young in retaliation points out the relation to the passages in Leveticus described above, and he suggests that Paul created the word as something the Greek would easily recognize, however it does not seem likely to me that Paul would create a new word to describe something for which the words to describe it already existed.Anyhow, I hope that article is helpful.

i'm not saying you shouldnt feel free to debate the bible. im just pointing out that the exercise is futile for 2 main reasons. first of all, history has already proven that being in agreement with the bible has very little correlation to being legal. if the legality of something relied on the bible, then fornication, gambling, prostitution, body tatooing and partying, to name a few, would all be illegal. second, regardless of how you translate the words of paul, or the old testament, you will always get the same thing. the bible is against homosexualityso, like i said, feel free to pursue the issuewrong based on what? there are many activities that put babies at risk of being born retarded, and many of them are legal. of course, medical institution warn against participating in such activities and educate the pregnant mothers about the risks. similarly, a warning about the risk of retarded inbred children could be displayed for the very same reason. but its not really grounds on which to make incestuous marriage illegalon the other hand, while it unadvisable to smoke during pregnancy, it is not illegal. i dont think there is any law that is established for the sole purpose of reducing the risk of birth defects (i could be wrong). would you say that it is also immoral not to discriminate against pregnant smokers as well?this could also be true of any relationship where one party also has any type of authority over the other, such as boss/employee or teacher/student. it doesnt make these types of relationships illegal, as long as both parties are of legal agei agree that an unmarried (or uncommited) person having sex is a bigger risk for the spread of aids than someone commited to one partner. and i agree that marriage, regardless of the union type, generally encourages people to stay with one partner. and homosexual sex doesnt inherently put one at a greater risk of getting an std. the risk is due to promiscuity, as you pointed out. with that said, i would agree that the legalization of incestuous marriage may likely mean the increase of inbred children with birth defects, you never could tell, but there may be a medical solution not far in the future to solve the problem. and if incestuous relations indeed become socially acceptable, then there would be a great effort to find such a solution (of course, all this is just speculation)well, i showed why i disagreed with your reasons, and also maintain that neither hetero, homo nor incestuous relations are any more harmful than any other type of socially acceptable activity that are already legal.

Jaxian, let me also add this, which also supports my view that the phrase "homosexual offenders" was not put together by Paul to refer to offensive behavior BY homosexuals, but to refer to homsexual behavior in a way that notes it's offensiveness to Paul.http://www.bruderhof.com/articles/jc...m?format=print

What makes their argument disingenuous is that they conveniently leave out the fact that polygamy and incest both existed in marriage at one point (and in some instances, they still do. First cousins can marry in NY State, for example).Can any of them honestly explain how nixing gender requirements of the partners in a marriage act as a catalyst for adding the number of participants in a marriage, or how it relates (no pun intended) to marrying blood relations any more than marriage as it currently stands?. You'll asphyxiate before you get an answer.

I know this can be subjective, but it also involves logical debate. We can and do extend equality to one group, without extending it to other groups or all groups. If the only argument we have against extending equality to B is that we may in the future extend it to Y and Z, but we can't logically show how that will happen as the result of B, then we should give B equality. B should have the presumed right to that general principle of equality in a society that values that, if there are no logical arguments against it. Y and Z will have their own arguments for or against. Whatever those arguments are, and however successful or unsuccessful in terms of gaining equality, this doesn't make it wrong to extend equality to B. It doesn't show that giving equality to B caused in any way for Y and Z to get equality.

gay marriage will change the definition of marriage from "a legal union between a man and a woman" to "a legal union between any parties that love each other". if its ok for 2 people that love each other and want to tie the knot, then how could incest be a taboo? based on what?again with the double standard. gay marriage was considered just as much a taboo as incest or polygamy just a few years ago. being gay emerged from its taboo status through parades, promotional efforts, and, unfortunately, by spreading lies (i'll deal with that in another thread). however, incestuous people didnt go through the process of parading their lifestyle in front of the world and practically begging for approval from society. so incest is still deeper in taboo status than homosexuality. why is it ok to deny incestuous relations the right to marry on the grounds that it is considered taboo, but ok to approve gay marriage on the same grounds?

Remember, he doesn't want to talk about that. It's only a gay rights forum. Somehow gay rights is an island all to itself which could NEVER be used as precedent for any other sort of case of situation . . . Forget the fact that equality would only be equality if extended to all people. Forget the fact that we're not talking about just specifics but about marriage itself.

gay marriage will change the definition of marriage from "a legal union between a man and a woman" to "a legal union between any parties that love each other". if its ok for 2 people that love each other and want to tie the knot, then how could incest be a taboo? based on what?again with the double standard. gay marriage was considered just as much a taboo as incest or polygamy just a few years ago. being gay emerged from its taboo status through parades, promotional efforts, and, unfortunately, by spreading lies (i'll deal with that in another thread). however, incestuous people didnt go through the process of parading their lifestyle in front of the world and practically begging for approval from society. so incest is still deeper in taboo status than homosexuality. why is it ok to deny incestuous relations the right to marry on the grounds that it is considered taboo, but ok to approve gay marriage on the same grounds?

i see no reason why any two (or more) consenting adults should be denied the right to marriage, except in the case where it would be too legally complicated, and only if the legal issues are irreconcilable.

You tell me, why is it right to deny two consenting, biologically related adults the right of marriage?

Let me add only that this is not the argument presented by Boswell. In the link I provided, he suggests that the most likely interpretation of a combination of arseno- and koitai is "male sexual agent" or "male prostitute", a word which Paul would have needed to create, as there was no other appropriate word to describe one.
attacks
Jaxian, let me also add this, which also supports my view that the phrase "homosexual offenders" was not put together by Paul to refer to offensive behavior BY homosexuals, but to refer to homsexual behavior in a way that notes it's offensiveness to Paul.http://www.bruderhof.com/articles/jc...m?format=print

Well as far as two familial adults go, their children would have high chance of coming out handicapped. I suppose that's the reason that the relationships are looked down upon so much; is because they have a high chance of producing handicapped children.

I could attempt an argument in which I suggest that some people would certainly love to ban smoking/drinking while pregnant, and that the due to the increased numbers of psychological problems which occur in incestuous relationships, there is evidence that turing family bonds into something sexual causes more problems than some other relationship simply involving one member with authority. However, I am no expert on these arguments, and I likely would not get far, so I will just present them so you know that possible responses to your arguments might exist. I guess I will have to think more on incestuous marriage and read more opinions from others on it before I can form my own. The discussion we're having now isn't a bad start.But the point I'm interested in proving right now is that one does not need to support incestuous marriage just because he supports homosexual marriage. They are no more related than heterosexual marriage is related to incestuous marriage. And even if I could say with certainty that incestuous marriage is no more harmful than other activities which are currently legal, I can say that homosexual marriage is not harmful at all.

i'm not saying you shouldnt feel free to debate the bible. im just pointing out that the exercise is futile for 2 main reasons. first of all, history has already proven that being in agreement with the bible has very little correlation to being legal. if the legality of something relied on the bible, then fornication, gambling, prostitution, body tatooing and partying, to name a few, would all be illegal. second, regardless of how you translate the words of paul, or the old testament, you will always get the same thing. the bible is against homosexualityso, like i said, feel free to pursue the issuewrong based on what? there are many activities that put babies at risk of being born retarded, and many of them are legal. of course, medical institution warn against participating in such activities and educate the pregnant mothers about the risks. similarly, a warning about the risk of retarded inbred children could be displayed for the very same reason. but its not really grounds on which to make incestuous marriage illegalon the other hand, while it unadvisable to smoke during pregnancy, it is not illegal. i dont think there is any law that is established for the sole purpose of reducing the risk of birth defects (i could be wrong). would you say that it is also immoral not to discriminate against pregnant smokers as well?this could also be true of any relationship where one party also has any type of authority over the other, such as boss/employee or teacher/student. it doesnt make these types of relationships illegal, as long as both parties are of legal agei agree that an unmarried (or uncommited) person having sex is a bigger risk for the spread of aids than someone commited to one partner. and i agree that marriage, regardless of the union type, generally encourages people to stay with one partner. and homosexual sex doesnt inherently put one at a greater risk of getting an std. the risk is due to promiscuity, as you pointed out. with that said, i would agree that the legalization of incestuous marriage may likely mean the increase of inbred children with birth defects, you never could tell, but there may be a medical solution not far in the future to solve the problem. and if incestuous relations indeed become socially acceptable, then there would be a great effort to find such a solution (of course, all this is just speculation)well, i showed why i disagreed with your reasons, and also maintain that neither hetero, homo nor incestuous relations are any more harmful than any other type of socially acceptable activity that are already legal.

Marriage already is a legal union of two parties who love one another. It will change the definition to two persons, and end sex based discrimination. It will not extend to just any two or more(for your polygamy argument)parties who love one another.Yes, and it wasn't that long ago that inter-racial marriage was considered taboo as well.Well, sure, why wouldn't people who are gay, promote their being gay?That should be fun. I don't see how it emerged from taboo status through lies. It also emerged from unacceptability through acceptance from the rest of society. Are you saying gay people were and are clever enough to hoodwink the majority? Well, there we see your anti-gay prejudice, when you talk about gay people parading their "lifestyle", and suggest we who are gay are pathetically "begging" for approval.Those are not the only grounds we deny incestuous relationships, that wasn't my argument, and you suggested yourself that gay marriage is no longer taboo, and is increasing in acceptability in society. Both issues will have their own arguments for and against. We do not deny gay marriage on the basis that incest is taboo. We do not deny incest on the basis that gay marriage was or is taboo. We do not deny inter-racial marriage on the basis that incest is taboo.

Precisely. I think you've got it!Show me how gay rights could specifically be a precedent in a specific situation. Also show me, how that is a good reason to deny gay rights, because of what could possibly, there's at least some chance that anything could happen in the future.Forget your fricken false dilemma fallacy already.

Incest has a lifestyle?Seriously, have you ever been to a gay pride parade? There are so many different types of people there that you cannot honestly say with a straight face (pardon the pun) that there is one specific "lifestyle" represented by everyone there. From church groups to club kids, sports clubs to ravers, politicians to dykes on bikes, ehtnic groups to leathermen, which specific lifestyle is represented by EVERYONE there? There are even protesters that show up, as well as straight people. What is this lifestyle that is supposedly represented?Why should he (or any of us) have to answer that? Incestuous relationships have existed for a long time, even amongst straight marriage. Why is it that gay people wanting equal access to marriage have to answer that question, while traditionalists get a pass on it?

As far as I am aware, the risks incurred by inbreeding (once) are fairly small, and it is through generations upon generations that they rise.In contrast individuals possessing certain genes have an extremely high chance of producing handicapped offspring, far higher than that derived from incest, if this were a matter of preventing handicappedness they should be the first denied the ability to reproduce.The fact is the prevention of incest is largely a result of ingrained prejudices, just like those levelled against homosexual, or in the past, interracial relationships.I believe that is correct - selective advocates of an equal right for gay marriages, and opponents of other equally valid sorts of marriages are hypocritical in that they are half right, those who wish to bar everyone but a select group of straight relationships are consistent in that they are completely wrong.I don't think however it is hypocritical in the slightest to concentrate your efforts fully on a particular avenue at one time, for tactical reasons or simply because it is of most pressing concern to you personally.I don't think however

With your logic, you either have the right to bear arms, and if limit it, you are not for the right to bear arms. So by your logic, you are not for the right to bear arms. You don't have the right to bear arms. That example may seem a little extreme to some, but the reality is that nothing is so black or white. We do use reasons, and one of the things we look at is potential harm. There is no potential harm resulting from same-sex marriage. If we accept same-sex marriage, making it equal to heterosexual marriage, that is equality. What other general principle or what other term will we use to describe this? Should I specify everytime that it's equity with different sex or heterosexual marriage that I am talking about? Many movements have used that term of equality, arguing for equality only for their group. So why shouldn't they use the term? Could something totally unforseen possibly happen at some time in the future and a different group will take up the term? Of course that could happen, as anything is possible. Gay people and others in society, are now taking the term, the idea, the principle, and are appling it to gay people and gay rights. We should be dealing with that now. Unless someone would like to start a forum here on incest.

I think it's a heck of a lot easier case to make that WMDs are significantly more harmful than a pistol it is to make the case that incest marriages or group marriages are more harmful than SS marriages. The point is that you are the one now drawing distinctions between your marriage and other relationships.So now you are moving the goal posts. First it was harm now it's "potential harm." Any marriage could have potential harm. A gay person could hit his spouse, a straight person could also do so, or a sibling marriage could have a baby with birth defects. Listen to yourself--you are arguing the same way opponents of same sex marriage argue with terms like "potential harm."If only those two types or relationships have marriage, it certainly is NOT equality.I seem to remember that many of the civil rights activists of the 60s certainly did NOT argue that way. Martin Luther King made it pretty clear he was not just for freedom for the black race but for all races.I think deep down you agree with me that it's only equality if it's for everyone, esp. in cases where harm can't be proven as in these. It's hard for me to believe you don't see what I'm saying here. Why not just agree with that? You aren't going to lose face. No movement is perfect, and the facts are that your movement is really simply trying to move the boundaries a bit, not equality for all.

With your logic, you either have the right to bear arms, and if limit it, you are not for the right to bear arms. So by your logic, you are not for the right to bear arms. You don't have the right to bear arms. That example may seem a little extreme to some, but the reality is that nothing is so black or white. We do use reasons, and one of the things we look at is potential harm. There is no potential harm resulting from same-sex marriage. If we accept same-sex marriage, making it equal to heterosexual marriage, that is equality. What other general principle or what other term will we use to describe this? Should I specify everytime that it's equity with different sex or heterosexual marriage that I am talking about? Many movements have used that term of equality, arguing for equality only for their group. So why shouldn't they use the term? Could something totally unforseen possibly happen at some time in the future and a different group will take up the term? Of course that could happen, as anything is possible. Gay people and others in society, are now taking the term, the idea, the principle, and are appling it to gay people and gay rights. We should be dealing with that now. Unless someone would like to start a forum here on incest.

Maybe. It would also depend on the practices with the WMD and the pistol. Whether or not same-sex marriage is more or less harmful than incest or group marriages is not the case we are trying to make however. We are trying to make the case that same-sex marriage is or is not harmful.Yes, in response to others putting them together in some dubious way. We all draw those distinctions, gay or straight.Well, I was thinking like others when they say incest could potentially not be harmful if no one has a kid as a result. Like I said, with the other analogy, it doesn't matter what the weapon is, it depends on how it is used, the potential for how it is used. That's what I was thinking, when I mentioned "potential harm", it can either be harm or potential harm, which results. I'm not the one who really started going down that road. The potential harm of a gay spouse potentially hitting another gay spouse, does not occur because they are gay spouses, likewise with the heterosexual spouses. It is equality, because the two relationships are equal to one another in marriage.Sure, he was for the general priciniple of freedom to apply to all races. However he was not for freedom for everyone and everything, only as it applied to races(perhaps some other areas but not all areas). I think we who support same-sex marriage are very clear that we are fighting for freedom and equality of same-sex marriage, for all the non-heterosexual couples. We are not fighting for that to be applied to every possible thing either.Then I couldn't utter one syllable about freedom or equality or rights for any group at all, including the heterosexuals and gay people, those who have other aspects of their identities not related to sexuality, etc, without involving every possible group. If you are wanting me to agree that my movement is not about absolute equality and freedom for everything and everyone, yes that is true. Neither was King's like I said earlier, however he was able to talk about freedom. It's called gay rights because it is gay rights. When we refer to equal marriage, I'm sure we always say equal marriage for same-sex couples or for gay people. We do mean equity in marriage to what is available to the straight couples.

I think it's a heck of a lot easier case to make that WMDs are significantly more harmful than a pistol it is to make the case that incest marriages or group marriages are more harmful than SS marriages. The point is that you are the one now drawing distinctions between your marriage and other relationships.So now you are moving the goal posts. First it was harm now it's "potential harm." Any marriage could have potential harm. A gay person could hit his spouse, a straight person could also do so, or a sibling marriage could have a baby with birth defects. Listen to yourself--you are arguing the same way opponents of same sex marriage argue with terms like "potential harm."If only those two types or relationships have marriage, it certainly is NOT equality.I seem to remember that many of the civil rights activists of the 60s certainly did NOT argue that way.

But it's not JUST about same-sex marriage. It's about marriage, period. That's why the discussion of gay marriage can't take place in a vacuum--other forms of relationships also come up simply on the basis that this is ultimately a discussion about changing marriage.Either way, it's no more or less arguable for incest or polygamy than same-sex relationships.Right, just as in the other types of relationships.I guess you could say it would be "equality" if both white people and Japanese Americans had equal rights, but every other group in the country didnt, but I certainly wouldn't call that equality. It's not really equality for marriage to be a little less disciminatory (giving it to gays and straights). I know. That's what I point out--you aren't. So it's not really marriage as an institution of equality that you seek.But it's also about marriage as an institution. And that's why ultimately you are only arguing for the boundaries to be moved a bit. It's not really fairness, if fairness is the goal.

It's a discussion of changing marriage to include same-sex couples, not a discussion of changing marriage to include incest.Whether it is or it is not, isn't the issue. The issue is same-sex marriage.Yes, and no. Many risks in many different types of relationships. However, the potential would be there if the incest couple had a kid, to have birth defects, which is a harm that is the result of the incest itself. The hetero couple could have a kid with birth defects, but that wouldn't be the result of heterosexual activity in itself. This again, is a whole other diversion.We could have a debate about other groups receiving that equality. The fact that other groups don't have that equality, isn't a reason why Japanese Americans should not have it. We'd need better arguments if we are going to deny Japanese Americans equality. Sure, it would be equality from the perspective of the Japanese, if they had the same rights as whites. No, not equality from potentially everyone's perspective and circumstance. We can have those debates, but it shouldn't affect our debate on Japanese equality.No, not equality for everyone in every circumstance. This whole discussion involves more of an anarchist's definition of equality, I believe, or at least, closest to it. In that case, we wouldn't even require the institution of marriage. Therefore, yes, we are not a system of 100% equality, and marriage isn't either, as part of that system. I haven't been arguing for that type of "perfect" equality however.That's what this society is about. We debate each issue as it comes up, on its own basis, and we move a little bit at a time. Gay couples are currently seeking marriage. That's the debate.

That doesn't show that allowing legal same-sex marriage would indicate a lack of virtue. Perhaps alllowing legal same-sex marriage would indicate virtue. There may or may not be a God, and your God may not be another person's God. There is no proof that your particular God designed this concept of marriage for all of society to be between a man and a woman. Marriage is a human construct. This is a secular society. Now, your religious group can believe your God did design marriage to be only between a man and a woman, and practice it that way, within your religion. I didn't agree to be a part of your religion, nor to follow its rules, however. I don't believe in your God.

Actually Mr biblical traditionalist, the traditional biblical mariage for the average old testament man was several wives. Polygamy is the biblical norm but you wouldn't want that now would you. How many wives and mistresses did jacob have? How many wifes and Concubines did Solomon have? David had several wives inlcluding a same sex marriage with Jonathan KJV 1 samuel 18:1. "And It came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul and the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul." Soul knitting how special only people who get married are said to have knit souls. KJV 1 samuel 18:3 "then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul" They made a covenant how special that is a marriage. Knitting souls and covenants I think that quailfies as a marriage.Do not give us this modern "God and he designed marriage between a man and a woman" XXXX.

They use the excuse that Jesus set a side the dietary laws. Kjv mark 8:15 I personally don't buy this excuse; either Jesus freed us from all of leviticall law or none of levitical law.

I've wondered about that. Why aren't you kosher then? Christians don't follow most of the Levitical laws.

The book of Acts is clear on the New Testament dietary situation.As for Levitical Law, while the ceremonial and dietary laws have been made obsolete, the moral law has never passed away - i.e. murder, adultery, lying, gay sex, etc., are all still identified as sins in the New Testament.

Who does the Bible say Jesus is? GOD!! (John 1:1, 2 Peter 1:1, Titus 2:13, etc., etc.). As God, Jesus already gave the gay sex prohibition to Moses on homosexual sex (Lev. 18:22, 20:13). And since all Scripture is inspired by God / Jesus (2 Timothy 3:16), then it was also Jesus who inspired the admonitions against gay sex in Romans 1:26-27, I Corinthians 6:9-10, Jude 7, etc., and it is Jesus who inspired Romans 13:1-5 which provides a Biblical framework for capital punishment (whatever the state decides).

Can you clear something up? When Paul wrote that all scripture is inspired by God, he clearly couldn't have been refering to his own letters, since they weren't scripture. Does that mean that Paul's letters aren't inspired by God, or do you have some other justification for saying that they are?Straight forward question. Please, a straight forward answer.

You make absulutely no case foryourself. God also gave Moses an eye for an eye. When Jesus was on earth he defied this law. hmmm. So maybe Moses didn't have everything right. Because if he does God really contradicts himself. You need to decide if you are Jewish or Christian because Christians are diciples of Christ. Not of Moses or any other man. Most Christians get hung up on following these "manly rules of the bible" they dont even follow the basic rules that Jesus set aside. Its not hard to force strategic rules on people but for some it is very hard to turn the other cheek. It is very hard to love the sinner and hate the sin. It is very hard not to cast the first stone as if you have no sin.

You can't possibly take literally the teachings of Leviticus. Jesus himself took beef with Levititcus. I don't understand whats hard to get here. He was killed for blasphemy. And under the law of the Jews he was.

For you maybe. Not for many others. Many people such as myself see it as an issue about marriage, period.The potential for risk and harm is in any type of relationship. You are using the very same type of arguments that opponents of same sex marriage use when you say things like that.I think you missed the point of the analogy. The point is that it's not really equality if only two groups have it and no one else. So you are saying it's anarchy for anyone other than straights and gays to have marriage? I've heard the "anarchy" argument made against same-sex marriage. Again, you are using the same sort of arguments that opponents of same-sex marriage sometimes use.
attacks
It's a discussion of changing marriage to include same-sex couples, not a discussion of changing marriage to include incest.Whether it is or it is not, isn't the issue. The issue is same-sex marriage.Yes, and no. Many risks in many different types of relationships. However, the potential would be there if the incest couple had a kid, to have birth defects, which is a harm that is the result of the incest itself. The hetero couple could have a kid with birth defects, but that wouldn't be the result of heterosexual activity in itself. This again, is a whole other diversion.We could have a debate about other groups receiving that equality. The fact that other groups don't have that equality, isn't a reason why Japanese Americans should not have it. We'd need better arguments if we are going to deny Japanese Americans equality. Sure, it would be equality from the perspective of the Japanese, if they had the same rights as whites. No, not equality from potentially everyone's perspective and circumstance. We can have those debates, but it shouldn't affect our debate on Japanese equality.No, not equality for everyone in every circumstance. This whole discussion involves more of an anarchist's definition of equality, I believe, or at least, closest to it. In that case, we wouldn't even require the institution of marriage. Therefore, yes, we are not a system of 100% equality, and marriage isn't either, as part of that system. I haven't been arguing for that type of "perfect" equality however.That's what this society is about. We debate each issue as it comes up, on its own basis, and we move a little bit at a time. Gay couples are currently seeking marriage. That's the debate.

It's sad to me that there are people out there that can't think in terms of love between two friends that isn't sexual. To give gifts to people as David did to Jonathan and "love him as himself" doesn't mean it was sexual. It means he had a dear, close friend--a kindred spirit if you will. The Bible doesn't hesitate to say when couples had a sexual union--there are definite phrases it uses for that. It certainly doesn't say anything like that about these two men. Just because two men are close doesn't mean it's a sexual thing. To assume it by default is a very backwards way to think.
attacks
I believe Jonathan and David were definitely lovers because the evidence is literally available for everyone to read. The original Hebrew version is the icing on the cake!

But you said you believed in Christ. Christ Himself believed the Old Testament, otherwise He wouldn't have quoted it!! I think it's a lot better to simply be honest about the fact that the Bible is against homosexual relationships, rather than jump through twisting interpretive hurdles to try and pretend it doesn't. If you've done much Bible study and really looked into these matters rather than let religioustolerance.org tell you some obscure and unusual ways of interpreting, you must know this. Better to be honest about the Bible in that it's against homosexual relationships even if it means disagreeing with it, and let the chips fall where they may.

First off. This is Old Testament Text. Please tell me you don't really believe everything you read in the old testament because it is very hard to tell the exact meaning from it when you translate it from Hebrew to English. I mean I don't see the point in believeing anything from the Old Testament. The Ten Commandments and thats it really. Jesus was crucified for defying the Old Testament. We are Christians we should believe as Christ believed for he was the son of God. Anyhow here is a site I found that talks more in detail about how this passage could be translated. http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_bibh.htm

You are correct on this. There were two codes: a moral code and a ceremonial code. Things like eating shellfish were not the moral code--and these are the things that are often used to portray the OT law as 'outdated' by it's detrators. But Jesus made it clear that if anything, He was taking the law farther. The law said for instance, don't commit adultery. He said don't even do it in your heart. The moral code is still important.

I don't believe the bible is clear on the issue of homosexuality. Like I said when you translate from hebrew to english you have to do some guess work. But it is a scientific fact that a percentage of the animal population as well as the human population is homosexual. It is natural to think that something is wrong with the minority. If most people are this way and a few are that way they must be commiting a sin or doing something wrong. That is a natural feeling. I just don't get it. Everyone has a sexual preference. If you say that homosexuality is a choice then your saying everyone one is heterosexual. Why if you are attracted to women would you want to be attracted to men. In the bible where it says that a man shall not lie with a man as a women it is an abomination, you have to understand that women in this time period were looked at as lower than a man so to put yourself in a womens position or a position of submission was an abomination. I guess you could say that it is against homosexuality but its more about putting yourself in the postion of a women b/c of how low women were in society. I will continue to say that I have no control over my arousal and even if I chose to be with men I would still be aroused by women. Please just think about this logically instead of just quoting the bible because there other moral issues in the bible specifically in Leviticus that you can't take seriously.

For whom?No kidding, it is an issue about marriage, as I've agreed many times. What is your point?No, you know I was talking about a specific type of risk, specific to incest. However this is just a diversion.Well, yes it is for the groups that have equality. We are not limited to either a certain set number of groups, no groups, or every single group or individual to have equality within a society.No, I was saying the definition of total equality you are arguing, is similar to anarchy. Either, everything or nothing, in terms of laws, equality, classes, etc. We start off from that point without any laws, in anarchy. There are different types of equality. There is something between anarchy and authoritarianism, where there can and is equality. That's what our system is, where we debate and negotiate about every issue as it relates to freedom and equality as it comes up. The issue up for debate today is gay marriage. How so?How am I doing that?

This is irrelevant when it comes to what behavior the Bible condones or not. Surely you don't think genetics should be the determinant of morality.Again, does not speak to the Bible's clear position on homosexual behavior.I didn't say it was a choice. You are assuming I hold that view when I don't. Nevertheless, just because something feels right to someone doesn't mean that the behavior is moral, based on that fact alone. You are taking the position here that just because something is innate or feels right, that it's automatically ok. And there are plenty of examples in life and in the Bible where that's not the case with MANY issues. Either way, it's homosexual behavior, no matter what the motivation. The Bible clearly says it's wrong.So you think God's morality for mankind is determined by what you or others are aroused by? That's a very human-centric way of thinking.

You choose whether or not to be an alcoholic. So yes that is a sin. Over indulging and acting on any time of lust is a sin. If you are having purely a sex relationship with a women that is a sin. If you love someone with all your heart and make a bond with them whether or not its "legal" or not I feel is acknowledged by God.

O i get it. Its ok for heterosexuals to act out our lusts but its not ok for homosexuals I got ya now. And for those alcoholics they aren't born wanting to drink. They begin drinking socially and it turns into an addiction. Your saying that being an alcoholic is a genetic trait. I can maybe agree with that b/c if your father drank you might be alittle curious but you have to start drinking alittle before you become an alcoholic. Your choice to start made you that way.

I believe its more about the love you have for someone. Lusting for someone based no their appearance is a sin. I believe that rather or not your married under the law if you love someone and you make a bond with them , and you have sex with them but its out of the love you have for that person. Then you are not commiting a sin. But what i want to try to get a cross is that if gays are sinning they are commiting the same sin we all commit so who are we to judge. I guess you could say God did it to control population. But he could easily make it to where they had no sexual orientation.

First off, you're wrong about God "making people gay," because it just is flat-out false. God gave us a choice to either obey Him or disobey Him. And yes God did design the sexual relationship to be exclusive to the heterosexual marriage. It's based on the principle of "leaving and cleaving."

Ministers who are not right with God, who espouse modernist doctrine, who deny the essential tenents of the faith! No, cmitch, they do not fall within the pale of orthodoxy! And yes, the entire Word of God must be relevant to your life if you are truly saved. Every letter of it!

Bassman are you pronoucing that because I don't believe all the words from the mouth of men as well as those interpretors that I am not saved. The words of Jesus Christ are relavant in my life and If you ask Jesus Christ to save you he will. I will not allow myself to be scared into thinking that for me to be truly saved I have to believe every word of the bible. The word of God is relavant in my life. The words of Jesus Christ are relavant in my life and if you remember he did not condem homosexuality either. Therefore I will not condem it. If I am wrong which I believe I am not I still have the forgiveness of Christ that I was wrong. His life is a benchmark to where I would like to be.

It is very evident that more 'biblical scholars' think it is a sin according to the Bible. It is a hard case to say otherwise.

It goes along with the conservatives view of God to them; God is this angry Vengeful creature that has to be feared and obeyed or he will kill you.

Now its the fact that they are having sex out of marriage not that it is with a man. So let me get this straight. God only wants sex between men and women and he makes some people to be gay for no apparent reason just so they have to suffer and get none what so ever sexual satisfaction. They shouldn't even think of sexual satisfaction b/c that is just as much a sin. Well lets face it all of us sin and the way your saying it is that we should jump on gays for commiting the same sin we are guilty of commiting. Hmmm. Whoever is without sin cast the first stone. Heres a good one. If you and your partner pray to God and ask him to recognize them as a married couple. To him are they married.

hmmm, maybe you miss the point. He is to be respected. Everything he does his out of love, even if it is some kind of justice. I am not sure who thinks he is an angry dude.

Well, the real question is, are you going to abide by what the Bible says as a Christian (and agree it should be abided by) or is it ok to not obey the Bible just because someone desires to do differently? Is it to be obeyed, or are situational ethics called for? To answer your question--yes, that's exactly right. If you want to accept what theh Bible says. If not, that's your choice--no one is going to make you obey or acknowledge it.A gay person isn't BORN sexually desiring anyone either. There is evidence that in both cases, there is genetic disposition involved.Indeed! That's why it's probaby very hard for gay people who are trying to live a Christian life. They should be given a lot of support from other believers. Nevertheless, no matter why God has them living that burden, it doesn't mean they have a license to sin and live in ways everyone else can't.

O i get it. Its ok for heterosexuals to act out our lusts but its not ok for homosexuals I got ya now. And for those alcoholics they aren't born wanting to drink. They begin drinking socially and it turns into an addiction. Your saying that being an alcoholic is a genetic trait. I can maybe agree with that b/c if your father drank you might be alittle curious but you have to start drinking alittle before you become an alcoholic. Your choice to start made you that way. Homosexuality is quite different. You could be the first one ever in your family line to be gay. Also God cares just as much about your inner thoughts as he does your outer actions. As was quoted earlier on the forum Jesus said that thinking of and lusting for another women is adultery.

Rest assured, the interpretation that the Bible doesn't address homosexual behavior or make clear that it's wrong is the minority view, by a long shot. So much so that it's considered well out of the mainstream.I also find it noteworthy that you keep changing the terminology to fit what you want it to say. No one--not even the most 'conservative' person, claims the Bible condemns "homosexuality" (in the sense that it's an innate trait). The argument by those who take the mainstream view is that it's the homosexual behavior that is addressed in the Bible. It makes no sense that God would condemn someone for something they can't help: an innate trait or desire. We aren't talking about the nature aspect, but the behavioral one.

I know of numerous gay people that say they live great lives without living out their homosexuality in their actions. That would be hard if sex is a big deal in one's life, but if it's not and life is about other, more important things, it's not hard.For religious people, it's ultimately a matter of whether they will obey the Bible or not. If they choose not to, that's their choice. If they choose to, and go down this supposedly horrible, awful, torturous life emoticonXRolleyes of actually not having gay sex, then that's their choice. They should be free to do that if they want without you trying to interfere or contantly tell them they are wrong.

It's ridiculous to look at a book that is thousands of years old as the only source of information on sexuality, homosexuality, gender roles, politics and government, science, or almost any other topic.A commandment or religious dogma that gives orders to a gay person, is not understanding that gay person's sexuality. It's just giving an order to be obeyed. Why shouldn't a gay person act on his or her sexuality? Because the Bible says so, is the reason given. Could those who wrote the Bible understand sexuality and many of the other topics as we do today? No, they could not.We know that being gay is not just about behaviour. Gay people are not really straight people who act with bad behaviour, either. If you ask someone to not act gay, it's also going to make the person feel bad or guilty about his or her sexuality, which is what the action is based on. That sexuality is a part of a person, gay or straight, it's not just an action. Sexuality occurs in the brain. If your religion tells you this is just about behaviour, jyoshu or others, it is wrong. All the orders to obey don't change the fact that it is wrong. What kind of God expects his people to not learn and grow? Are we just to be spoonfed commandments and orders to follow for eternity, to never really understand ourselves or one another? Are we to only accept the information from one ancient book or from the right church, and we cannot explore beyond that?

I find it noteworthy how paradoxical that is. We are programmed to be one way and yet are condemned should we act in that natural capacity? That's pretty effed up if you ask me. Like Joe said... As long as we lead long, celibate, lonely lives, we're ok. Thanks for caring, but I think i'll stick with what I'm doing now.

It's not a matter of viewing it as a source of information--it's not like people are going to it for stats or something. It's about a moral way to live. It deals with the moral issue, not the scientific one. No one is making you abide by it anyway.Besides, you are looking at the Bible from a perspective that does not consider it a work of absolute truth. That's your prerogative to do that, but you must keep in mind that millions of people view the Bible different than you do.It doesn't tell me that "sexuality is about behavior." The Bible is not trying to be a science or biology textbook. It simply makes clear that same-sex relationships are wrong. It's that simple. No one is saying you're gayness is not innate. Look, no one is going to make you adhere to the Bible. But don't tell everyone else they shouldn't adhere to it either as that's their right.

One of my closest friends is a gay male but I have to say I am against gay marriage. Its in the old and new testament that is a sin. Im not saying that its a choice for most people but because something is natural, does that make it right? Fornication is a sin but I look at that is natural. If im in love with a man and he is touching me, my body wants to be with him. Thats natural but I think God made sex for man and wife because he wanted to spare us certain consequences. If everyone waited til they were married and no one committed adultry, there would be no std's, unwanted children etc. I just think if God made Eve the perfect partner for Adam, then marriage should honor that. He didnt make her and a man and made Adam choose. Our bodies were made to be pleasing to a man. We are the perfect partner for a man. We are all born into sin since the fall of man so thats why I believe that most gay people were probably born that way but what about thousands of ex gay christians who are now married with children? What do you say to them?

What about my religious beliefs, which say being gay, having gay sex, gay marriage is not a sin. Where is my religious freedom? Also we live in a secular society; why do I not get a say wether of not heterosexuals should be allowed to marry? Heterosexuals want to decide wether or not I should be allowed to marry the person of my choice while remaining free to marry the person of their choice.

See I keep going back in forth with the gay issue because after reading your post, I do understand where your coming from. I dont want to force my views down anyones throat and if u read my posts, u will see that ive had an abortion which I assume the vast majority of christians believe is murder and Im very glad it was legal. It was a sin but Im glad I had that right to make that sin because now Ive repented and been forgiven but yet also I dont have the same burden that I wouldve had. You know I guess after reading your post, im on the fence again about gay marriage. On one hand I do believe what I wrote and that women are the perfect partners for men and that is the way God intended. I do believe that but at the same time just like with my abortion, I believe people should have a choice and at the end of the day, their relationship with God is personal and its up to God to judge us all. If gay marriage is a sin then the gay people that marry will have to deal with that on judgement day and maybe its not up to us to regulate it.

sounds like a cool religion... never heard of it tho, unles you just made it up, which would be perfectly ok. i see you took my suggestion and made up your own religion after all. good for youtheres is much more to allowing gays to marry than religious reasons. in fact, religious reasons are probably the most insignificant. there are also quite a few legalistic issues that noone in the gay lobby seems to be paying attention to, but are detrimental to the advancement of gay marriage

i think being gay is ok, if thats how the person wants to be then let them. Its their life. Everyone has there true love and maybe the person they like same sex or not is the person they love then maybe they were made for each other. god should be the only one that judges and everyone else should just be cool about it.

I'm concerned as to why some gay people are adherring, by abstaining their entire lives, or for extrememly long periods. There are feelings involved. It's not just about following an order to never have sex. Most of us, gay or straight, are sexual beings. Are the gay people being pressured to abstain because of guilt, which would undeniably be related in some way to their sexuality? Are they expected to never have sex, just because they are told to, and it is believed by some that gay people can just do that without much trouble, or are gay people expected to struggle and be in pain with this for their entire lives? These are important questions which should be answered.
