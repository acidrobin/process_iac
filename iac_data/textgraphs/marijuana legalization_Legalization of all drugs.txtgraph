I support legalization of every drug. I'm sure most of you are young and have been fed XXXX like "Marijuana will kill you." Actually it does less damage to the brain then alcohol and it cannot kill you. It is impossible. It takes 20,000 joints in one sitting to overdose on marijuana. Alcohol however kills thousands of americans each year from alcohol poisoning. You know that idiot pothead. He didn't get dumb from pot, he got dumb from birth. Marijuana does not have long term effects on IQ. The only side effect is the lazy side effect. The day after a person tends to be more lazy however it is like a hang over..... it only lasts for a day. There is no reason why it should remain illegal.I also support all drugs being legalized because the drug war has failed. We spend billions each year on the drug war and I can call someone right now and pick up some crack. It is a failure. What we should do is make it government controlled and then spend the money to fight drugs on drug education. Flood the schools with ACTUAL info about how herion kills and how it breaks a person down. Tell the kids how you can die from one use of coke. Tell them the short term and long term effects of each drug. If we can educate our kids and even adults through an ad campaign about what drugs do to you then we could save far more people. Also allowing drugs to be regulated will lower the prices and effectively kill drug dealers and gangs off the streets. There are so many benefits to legalizing drugs. Anyone want to fight it? I have proof to back up what I say and also have the effects of each drug.

Legalization of all drugs

The drug war 'just say no' has failedJust say know is what we should be telling people.To be fair, on the cannabis front, it doesn't effect IQ but may effect memory, and 'that idiot pothead' is usually an idiot because he is stoned at the time. Also it can act as a catalyst, speeding up the onset of schizophrenia etc. in those with a tendency in such a direction.But compared to alcohol, there's no doubt its less socially and personally destructive.My only real quibble is that I would only provide highly addictive drugs in drop-in clinics for addicts, as people may take it under pressure or at times of emotional hardship and get hooked.

Recent studies apparently show that pot is more harmful than you say. One joint is said to contain more carcinogens than four tobacco cigarettes.I doubt your 20,000 joints theory.You have a simplistic argument going for pot. I can't agree that legalizing all drugs would be a good thing either. Programs in Holland have failed to produce significant if any benefits to society in general. The druggies seem to have benefitted by having arrest-free drug zones and access to whatever they want, but the cost of drugs still requires some income, something that most of them likely do not have other than from crime, begging or social programs.One "benefit" I see from legalizing drugs is that the users could be more easily identified.

You're an idiot who has obviously never worked ina first responder category. If you think that increasing the volume and social acceptance of drug use to the same level of alcohol will 'solve' anything, then you are just an idiot. You have obviously never seen whart drug abuse does to families and people's lives.

Legalizing all drugs would have catastrophic social impacts.Don't feed me that line about taxing it and using the money for rehab. We have taxed the XXXX out of tobacco and alcohol the last 100 years and the last time I checked alcoholism and lung cancer hadn't been erradicated.

Your are right about pot having 4 thimes the carcinogens then tobacco has. It does damage the lungs as anything that is smoked will. I was refering to brain damage. I'm sorry I wasn't more clear. Plus alcohol has many bodily harms as well. Such as the liver for one example but it effects more more body parts then pot does.The 20,000 joints theory is true. What the site did was take the average amount of THC in a joint then the amount needed to OD on THC and divided it. It came out to around 20,000 average joints. In other words no one has ever died from ODing on weed.As with Holland I have actually heard differently from many sources that crime is down and that the use of the drugs has gone down. I'm not sure where you got your info.

All I heard from your post was idiot over and over again. If you can't put together an arguement without using the the word idiot before you even get an answer then I believe you are the one that is lacking a brain power here.I have seen what drug use has done to families. Nice of you to ask by the way. Anyway I have seen it and I have seen that they can easily get their drugs any time they want. Your support of it being illegal is the definition of crazy. Doing something over and over again expecting different results.We spend billions of dollars every year on the drug war. Not to mention the HUGE amount of prisoners that are simply up on drug charges. Drugs would never become a social norm because many are very damaging to the mind and body. Plus we would have the money to push real education about them in schools and on TV and even force HUGE warnings in the places that sell them. We could do anything with the places that sell them because they would be government owned. Show pictures of each drugs result.... the possibilities are endless. Instead you support a system that spends billions of dollars with no results. Who is the idiot again?

Legalising them would increase use however. Most people can't get hard drugs easily. If they get hard drugs at all, it's still a lot harder to get hard drugs, than say alcohol.Then there's the risk factor. Most people aren't willing to take that and risk becoming embroiled with dealers.I don't particularly want an increase in hard drug use.-Wez

First of all, the government cannot increase the volume and social acceptance of a drug - only the market and society can do that. Government cannot even decrease the volume or social acceptance of drugs - despite the government's efforts, drug use has remained relatively constant. What hasn't remained constant is violent crime, which has gone up during the drug war as it did during alcohol prohibition.

I can get enough alcohol to get 100 people stumbling drunk in 3 minutes from where I sit. That is what I mean by volume. Nothing is served by increasing any type of abused substance to that level.In regards to the illegality of drugs, I am no champion of moral superioroty through the law. It is just a fact that anyone who thinks you make anything better by legilization has not got clue one about reality on the streets of this nation. People don't steal and commit crime to support their drug habits. They do it because they have one.

Holland hasn't legalised, its decriminalized. This allows drugs to remain in the hands of the dealers, keeping prices high. We need full legalization.The quantity of alcohol use rose during the Prohibition. Not proof that legalising drugs would cut use, but certainly a reason not to assume they'd rocket.

Last I checked, drug prohibition began much earlier than the 1980s. The '80s fall in violent crime is more likely a result of the legalization of abortion than it is a result of the "success of the war on drugs."

I disagree as all drugs being legalized would surely be a danger to society. As for weed, I think it should only be legalized if every other country (or most) does it. Why? Well, have you ever been to amsterdam? It sucks. I would hate to be like that.As for marijuana being bad for you..you sound like my friend who is a pot head. Let me be the first to say (since I know way to many weed addicts...side effect of liking DMB I guess) marijuana does do more damage then one might think. It WILL make you an idiot if you are a chronic user. I have seen a guy smoke up since 13 and it takes me 4 tries for him to actually understand a simple sentence I tell him. Then a marijuana addict will rationalize his/her behavior by saying things like "well atleast I don't do herion"...thats like a theft saying "atleast I don't steal at gunpoint"...i mean you are still stealing. As a side not, rationalization is a sign of addiction. I have worked with a few weed addicts too. I am glad companies drug test becuase of this. These fools look stoned 24/7 after awhile and are the worst employees on earth. Then you got the benefits of being a weed addict like all you can do is have weed addict friends because you don't have time for anything else. The marijuana addict will work, buy weed, smoke it, work to buy more. AND THEN, you get to the marijuana addict that decides to try crack because all drug addicts hang together and so someone will try to get you to try new stuff. Now you do crack...then herion...then you are dead. Good job stupid junky. You would be a fool to think marijuana isn't harmful. You would be a fool to think alcohol isn't either.

I've never been to Amsterdam.A friend of mine went and he liked it.I'd like to go someday.Hell, I'd just like to get my XXX anywhere, really.Come on, it won't make you an idiot.It will make you a lazy, forgetful slob if you let it.Nobody's saying that marijuana is health food, they're just saying as a drug it's no worse than certain currently legal drugs.He was probably an idiot to begin with then.He he, I guess I would definitely consider myself a weed addict. emoticonXClown Although, the addiction is more psychological than physical.If you smoke weed all the time and then stop for a week or so, you get really pissy and irritable, but that's about it.But no regular pot smoker sits around justifying why they do it, they just do it cuz they like it, nothing too complicated about it. We're all addicted to something. I had a tough time recently giving up coffee.It was interfering with my life. It was making me feel like XXXX, I couldn't sleep right, my bowels were out of whack, but I couldn't just stop cold turkey. I tried, but I got these really bad headaches and my whole body felt like XXX. It was hell at work, my head felt like it was going to explode and I was achy all the time. I had to gradually wean myself from it. Now I drink tea which has less caffiene but I still sometimes feel like I have to have it. Since I've cut down (I don't think I've really gotten totally over my caffiene addiction)I fell so much better. I have more energy during the day, I don't wake up half dead desperately needing a quad espresso. Maybe they just drink too much coffee.And you probably work with more "reefer heads" than you think.Now this is a totally inaccurate generalization.I don't think you actually realize the sheer numbers of people who smoke pot in this country, and I'm talking on a regular basis.I am certainly one of them. I have friends that do it and friends that don't.We all lead your typical normal life.Yeah, see this is the old "gateway drug" fallacy.If anything is a gateway drug, it's alcohol, so why is it still legal?If a drug can act as a "gateway" to other drugs, isn't that why it's illegal?So are people sitting around drinking alcohol all day, waiting for someone to come by with something "harder"? No, and the same is true for people who smoke pot. Oh, sure they may also do other things once and a while, but it wasn't simply because they tried that first joint. It's just a personality trait and a common one. If pot didn't exist, these people would be doing something else. The same with alcohol and cigarettes. If they didn't exist, people would find some other type of vice.Hell, one joint a day isn't going to kill anyone.But who drinks one beer a day? No one drinks beer like that, or not many people at all, anyway. People who drink beer (like me and you) will drink a few one day, and for a few reasons. I like good beers, like microbrews and we have a few good ones here, so I like beer for its flavor. I also like the fact that if I drink 24-48 oz. of the stuff I catch a nice buzz. I also like to buy good pot. It smells great, tastes great and gives you a nice mellow buzz.But alot of people will come home from work and drink 3-4 beers every single day. This has to add up to bad health. A glass of red wine though is supposed to be good for you. (That must be why I drink it so often. ;))Anyway, you're going way overboard with what marijuana does to people.It's truly less harmful than alcohol, it can only interfere with your life if you let it. The person who would do this would do it with anything. If pot didn't exist or alcohol didn;t exist, they;d find some way to screw up their lives. This doesn't mean that there aren't millions of responsible casual pot smokers who lead normal productive lives. You probably come into contact with tons of closet smokers and don't even realize it.

No one is saying alcohol is either...I would say both are not smart to use often...however, one beer is still better then smoking a bowl.Actually he wasnt or I wouldn't have used that example.I honestly have never not heard a pot smoker not rationalize his/her habit.lol, and you prove my point...rationalization for the win :)Well, I don't work with any "reefer heads" or pot smokers now...this was awhile back.I got a good idea. however, they do tend to stay with their own.Nah, it is a gateway in the fact that herion addicts and crack addicts are in the same room and are the same friends of yours that supply the marijuana. Would legalization help this? I dunno, but probably cause many other problems without everyone legalizing it.Rationalizing again :) It is It's truly less harmful than alcohol.[/QUOTE] Rationalizing again :) It is still worse then alcohol with one beer or even 2 beers a day (which is pretty much average for a person of non-college age). You have a guy drink a beer a day and a guy smoke up a day and see the difference in 50yrs...you will know which one is the weed addict. I've lost 2 friends to weed and my gf has actually had a friend get his head blown off so you probably won't convince me it is a good drug....however, like alcohol, it is impossible to convince someone addicted about how their addiction hurts them.

I've never been to Amsterdam.A friend of mine went and he liked it.I'd like to go someday.Hell, I'd just like to get my XXX anywhere, really.Come on, it won't make you an idiot.It will make you a lazy, forgetful slob if you let it.Nobody's saying that marijuana is health food, they're just saying as a drug it's no worse than certain currently legal drugs.He was probably an idiot to begin with then.He he, I guess I would definitely consider myself a weed addict. emoticonXClown Although, the addiction is more psychological than physical.If you smoke weed all the time and then stop for a week or so, you get really pissy and irritable, but that's about it.But no regular pot smoker sits around justifying why they do it, they just do it cuz they like it, nothing too complicated about it. We're all addicted to something. I had a tough time recently giving up coffee.It was interfering with my life. It was making me feel like XXXX, I couldn't sleep right, my bowels were out of whack, but I couldn't just stop cold turkey. I tried, but I got these really bad headaches and my whole body felt like XXX. It was hell at work, my head felt like it was going to explode and I was achy all the time. I had to gradually wean myself from it. Now I drink tea which has less caffiene but I still sometimes feel like I have to have it. Since I've cut down (I don't think I've really gotten totally over my caffiene addiction)I fell so much better. I have more energy during the day, I don't wake up half dead desperately needing a quad espresso. Maybe they just drink too much coffee.And you probably work with more "reefer heads" than you think.Now this is a totally inaccurate generalization.I don't think you actually realize the sheer numbers of people who smoke pot in this country, and I'm talking on a regular basis.I am certainly one of them. I have friends that do it and friends that don't.We all lead your typical normal life.Yeah, see this is the old "gateway drug" fallacy.If anything is a gateway drug, it's alcohol, so why is it still legal?If a drug can act as a "gateway" to other drugs, isn't that why it's illegal?So are people sitting around drinking alcohol all day, waiting for someone to come by with something "harder"? No, and the same is true for people who smoke pot. Oh, sure they may also do other things once and a while, but it wasn't simply because they tried that first joint. It's just a personality trait and a common one. If pot didn't exist, these people would be doing something else. The same with alcohol and cigarettes. If they didn't exist, people would find some other type of vice.Hell, one joint a day isn't going to kill anyone.But who drinks one beer a day? No one drinks beer like that, or not many people at all, anyway. People who drink beer (like me and you) will drink a few one day, and for a few reasons. I like good beers, like microbrews and we have a few good ones here, so I like beer for its flavor. I also like the fact that if I drink 24-48 oz. of the stuff I catch a nice buzz. I also like to buy good pot. It smells great, tastes great and gives you a nice mellow buzz.But alot of people will come home from work and drink 3-4 beers every single day. This has to add up to bad health. A glass of red wine though is supposed to be good for you. (That must be why I drink it so often. ;))Anyway, you're going way overboard with what marijuana does to people.It's truly less harmful than alcohol, it can only interfere with your life if you let it. The person who would do this would do it with anything. If pot didn't exist or alcohol didn;t exist, they;d find some way to screw up their lives. This doesn't mean that there aren't millions of responsible casual pot smokers who lead normal productive lives. You probably come into contact with tons of closet smokers and don't even realize it.

Still dumb to compare the two. Both are no good. Theft is better then murder...however a theif bragging because he didn't murder is a fool..Chris Rock actually did a funny skit on this.Stoner is not good, alcoholic is not good, herion addict is not good. You ask if I have evidence...yes, my own two eyes. Don't believe me then so be it, but there are many articles that say the effects of marijuana...at the very least it is like smoking. I stress very least.

Got evidence to back that up??I'm not sure how a stoner's worse than an alcoholic really.-Wez

So why did you say pot was worse than alcohol? Just because both are apparently bad, doesn't make one 'worse'. I'll point out that you compared the two first, so saying it's dumb to compare the two's shooting yourself in the foot.Link me to one saying weed 'addiction' is worse than alcoholism please. ...and 8 beers are imo worse than one joint. People tend not to smoke as many 'doses' of pot as they drink 'doses' of alcohol.By your own admission you haven’t 'hung out' with stoners for a while and you're making generalisations about them to people who do spend a lot of time with stoners?Heh? That's news to me. Most potheads I know smoke in parks, while heroin/cocaine addicts don't use their drugs in public for somewhat obvious reasons.Prove it then. If this is a fact, there will be research on the subject on the net somewhere comparing the effects of the two.In terms of addiction, alcohol is far worse than pot apparently.http://www.tfy.drugsense.org/tfy/addictvn.htmWhy do AA meetings exist then? If the addicts haven't been convinced their addiction is hurting them, why are they going to the meetings?-Wez

I am sorry if I were not clear....I said that 1 beer is better then 1 joint i believe. I said it would be bad to compare a stoner to an alcoholic as to which one is better.Didn't I just say it is dumb to compare the two?This obviously depends on the person. Both are not good...once again, a comparision is not gonna work. Whether you are an alcoholic or a weed-a-holic(not a real word) you will still mess up your health (which is a good reason we shouldn't have public health care).I mean't this in a more general sense then you took it because obviously a pot head is not going to spend 100% of his time with other pot heads. However, I must say that all my pot head friends spend an abornomal amount of time getting (or trying to get) high which sure is a pain in the a** if you wanna do something else...this is more of a problem with the friends of the pot head that don't smoke more then anything. I just think a coming together for drugs is probably not a healthy friend relationship as it depends on a drug.Try going to a concert, party, club, and see if the guy selling weed is on the opposite end of the guy selling coke....doubtful (unless it is second hand) as weed has no real value compared to coke and what not. The whole leads to something for a better high is pretty dependable..many crack heads will tell you that they wanted a better high but that doesn't mean every pot head will go to crack. HBO had a good special about this some time back.I don't recall talking about addiction..I believe I was talking about 1-2 beers as opposed to a bowl or somthing. If one drinks in moderation then they will be fine...there is not "moderation" for pot (unless you say a couple hits a week for a few years). http://www.valdosta.edu/aode/alcoholfacts.htmFinally, why do you compare it to alcohol anyway? Are you trying to say we should ban alcohol? Guess what, eating McDonalds every meal every day is probably worse then drinking alcohol...should we ban that or legalize everything? Well no. At some point (in a country) you gotta realize that this drug is no good to society. I still stand by my orginial statement that it would probably be ok to legalize if every other country did it.

Fair enough. However people don't have 1 beer. They tend to have more than one, sometimes 7+ (in England at least, where binge drinking seems to be more prominent than in other countries). On the other hand, people tend to not smoke more than 1 joint per 'session'. As such although 1 beer isn't as bad for you health as 1 joint (I think...), the amount of beers drunk per joint smoked is much higher.So you do still hang around with potheads.Everyone at the event will be exposed to the guy selling cocaine then, not just the people buying pot."A couple of hits a week for a few years" seem about right to me. I'd call that "moderate" pot use .Considering the % of the population that's used pot and the % of the population that use their lives only to smoke pot, I guess most people do use pot in moderation. No: legalise pot. Obviously if you're smoking £50 of pot a day, then it's going to be worse than a couple of beers a day. However I doubt most people who use pot, use anywhere near that amount a day. Considering the % of the population that's tried pot, and the % that has tried heroin, pot use seems to rarely lead ot heroin addiction. Heroin has a huge stigma attached to it, crack and cocaine a lesser one. Were pot use to inevitably lead to heroin addiction, I wouldn't want pot legalised, but clearly pot use rarely leads to heroin addiction, so I'm all for legalising it.Maybe, but nor is alcohol, or smoking. Those aren't banned however, and until there's some unrefutable proof of pot being worse than smoking or alcohol, wasting money trying to keep it illegal seems pointless to me.-Wez

I understand this. It is hard to compare with 1beer 1 joint as not all people have 1 beer and no one has one joint (it is normally passed and what not). Maybe a "responsible" beer drinker and a "responsible" pot smoker would be a better comparing tool? In that case I would say the same result would apply...but would probably come out as a little worse then a smoking to alcohol comparison.:/ If I have to. A lot of my high school/college friends went down that way and lots of times if we have a large number of people hanging around then the pot smokers will go off and come back a few hours later. I could give some examples to clear that up if you like.Yeah, but someone that doesn't want drugs won't be.I would say this is true. Most people try pot a few times maybe during college and then stop when they go into the real world. Legalizing would probably cause that trend to end.And you are right, it rarely does lead to herion or crack addiction, however, that is not my reason for keeping it illegal...I was just talking about why it is not exactly good for you. The reason to keep it illegal would be to not be like amsterdam. If every country did it then you wouldn't have a flood of people coming to the US to smoke up and make our country cr*p.Smoking is not bad for society anymore (in the US) as it only causes harm to the one that does it. Alcohol is kind of like pot in the way that you would have to legalize it or make it illegal...you would have to make it across the world for either one. Prohibition in the US caused higher organized crime because no other country had it...however, with weed, you can have the same thing...if we were the only ones to have it illegal (and once had it legal) then we would have the same situation. One other note, prohibition actually did work (in the sense of what it wanted to do) for those that know history...it just ended up causing other problems that were worse.

I'm about as far right as you can get politically. So far right that I don't believe that the government has any grounds for regulating substances that we want to ingest, smoke, snort or inject. Where I differ from those on the Left is I don't feel compelled to help the druggies who get themselves in over their heads. To me, if you jump in a lake with weights around your ankles, don't expect me to jump in after you. Want to spend your life stoned, fine. Just don't expect me to pay your medical bills when you get sick. "Die ****er!" As Scrooge once quipped "better to die and decrease the surplus population." :)

I support legalization of every drug. I'm sure most of you are young and have been fed XXXX like "Marijuana will kill you." Actually it does less damage to the brain then alcohol and it cannot kill you. It is impossible. It takes 20,000 joints in one sitting to overdose on marijuana. Alcohol however kills thousands of americans each year from alcohol poisoning. You know that idiot pothead. He didn't get dumb from pot, he got dumb from birth. Marijuana does not have long term effects on IQ. The only side effect is the lazy side effect. The day after a person tends to be more lazy however it is like a hang over..... it only lasts for a day. There is no reason why it should remain illegal.I also support all drugs being legalized because the drug war has failed. We spend billions each year on the drug war and I can call someone right now and pick up some crack. It is a failure. What we should do is make it government controlled and then spend the money to fight drugs on drug education. Flood the schools with ACTUAL info about how herion kills and how it breaks a person down. Tell the kids how you can die from one use of coke. Tell them the short term and long term effects of each drug. If we can educate our kids and even adults through an ad campaign about what drugs do to you then we could save far more people. Also allowing drugs to be regulated will lower the prices and effectively kill drug dealers and gangs off the streets. There are so many benefits to legalizing drugs. Anyone want to fight it? I have proof to back up what I say and also have the effects of each drug.

Idealy this MIGHT not be a bad solution...however, the risks to everyone else and the pain it would cause the rest of society would probably be greater.

I wonder if that's truly the case. Right now, mandatory sentences for drug traffickers is forcing prisons to let "real" criminals out early. Without druggies in prison, there will be plenty of room for hard criminals to serve their ENTIRE sentence.

I won't comment on the "minor" points if that's ok, and just cut straight to it.Why? That seems like a false-assumption to me.Can you prove that Amsterdam is going down the toilet because of legalising pot? I can't quite see it happening. Did pot use even greatly increase once pot was legalised?Pot is helping organised crime at the moment, as well as draining money from the government in trying to combat it. Legalising it would give the government money from taxes, save money from no longer trying to prohibit it and the overall use, if prohibition is anything to go by, wouldn't increase greatly.-Wez

Last I checked, drug prohibition began much earlier than the 1980s. The '80s fall in violent crime is more likely a result of the legalization of abortion than it is a result of the "success of the war on drugs."

I am of course speaking about hard drugs. What I mean is that if someone could function dependably and productively they could probably afford a drug habit as a simple budgeted item. The trouble is that your average tweeker and smackhead isn't normally a model of dependability and in the case of tweekers have very bad judgement. The drugs don't make them steal, the drugs make them so useless and undependable that theft is their own viable option for getting cash. Set your own hours and all that.....

So if a person becomes addicted to a drug, then they'll begin to steal and commit crimes?

But what do you base that assumption on?I went some time ago. However the same can be said for Reading. Got to some areas it's just shocking, while in others it's very nice.Maybe, but it's still draining money when it could be producing money.-Wez

Would legalization help this? I dunno, but probably cause many other problems without everyone legalizing it.Rationalizing again :) It is It's truly less harmful than alcohol.[/QUOTE] Rationalizing again :) It is still worse then alcohol with one beer or even 2 beers a day (which is pretty much average for a person of non-college age). You have a guy drink a beer a day and a guy smoke up a day and see the difference in 50yrs...you will know which one is the weed addict. I've lost 2 friends to weed and my gf has actually had a friend get his head blown off so you probably won't convince me it is a good drug....however, like alcohol, it is impossible to convince someone addicted about how their addiction hurts them.

Given that the title is leagalzing all drugs I'm not sure a comment on just marijuana is appropriate, but what the heck. I hear a lot of arguments about 'its not as bad' as this or that. Telling me that it isn't as bad, is hardly a good reason for leglization. What's in it for me? The guy that doesn't use it and agrees that our two major forms of legal substance abuse vice cause plenty of social decay. Spare me the tax it and use that money for re-hab and what not, because there is free rehab as far as the eye can see for tobacco and alcohol. I see no good reason for legilization, and honestly, it isn't all that illegal in major cities. It's a ticket and probably a drug class/fine in the metro area I live. Hardly the chain gang.

Given that the title is leagalzing all drugs I'm not sure a comment on just marijuana is appropriate, but what the heck. I hear a lot of arguments about 'its not as bad' as this or that. Telling me that it isn't as bad, is hardly a good reason for leglization. What's in it for me? The guy that doesn't use it and agrees that our two major forms of legal substance abuse vice cause plenty of social decay. Spare me the tax it and use that money for re-hab and what not, because there is free rehab as far as the eye can see for tobacco and alcohol. I see no good reason for legilization, and honestly, it isn't all that illegal in major cities. It's a ticket and probably a drug class/fine in the metro area I live. Hardly the chain gang.

If the legality of drugs isn't a major reason for use/ no use, then why make them illegal?-Wez

Good question. Maybe the government should legalise all drugs (hard & soft drugs ) and see what happens. Making alcohol illegal (prohibition) didn't work either.

Not if you work for my company. Random drug testing. Counciling after first failed test, gone after the second. No ifs, and or buts.No, I think that he's right on target.

Coffee was f-ing me up in a bad way.Sure about that?What? You don't know what you're talking about.But, generally pot smokers will hang out with other pot smokers to smoke pot.That doesn't mean they strictly hang out with them.I smoke it and have plenty of friends and acquaintances that don't.NOW YOU'RE SMOKING CRACK HERE DUDE.I'm sure there are some people that deal all kinds of things, but someone who regularly sells pot pretty much only sells pot. I'm not saying 100%of the time, but pot smokers don't go into some ghetto crackhouse to get their pot.Jesus, man, are you that out of touch?There's nothing to help, because what you said has no resemblance to reality.If someone is a junkie, they might also smoke pot, or if someone is a crackhead, they might also smoke pot, but the large majority of pot smokers DO NOT do heroin or smoke crack.Rationalizing?I guess so, since I'm trying to explain why it's silly for it to be illegal.But, guess what, you are rationalizing why beer is legal.And you're SO WRONG about drinking beer for 50 years.

It isn't a question of legality that I raise, it is one of pure volume. Alcohol does far more damage because there is far more of it. A great many of the problems you list haev their roots in substance abuse. Hardly a strong argument for increasing the volume of substances that can be abused.

So you think legalising drugs will increase the volume of substances ? What are you basing this on.Well, I live in Canada and pot was recently legalised (up to certain grams).There was a lot of pot when it was illegal and there is a lot of pot now that it has been legalised. There was a spike in usage right soon after it was legalised but now it seems to have settled itself out and basically the same number of people who smoked pot when it was illegal smoke pot now that it is legal.Even if the volume increases, people who are not into drugs are not going to do it.

Yeah, but once it is legalised, you start breaking down the stigma attatched to using it, which means more people will use it. A lot of people are against drugs now, because they are illegal. Make it legal, and in a few generations people may be just as likely to come home and do a few lines of coke as they are to have a few beers.Now, I'm all for letting people screw themselves up if they want to.

Actually, the crime to support the habit will drastically decline if it were legalized. Currently, the price of drugs is hugely inflated because of prohibition, and removing prohibition will cause a tremendous fall in the price of drugs. That means users will need less money to support their habits, which means they will not need to steal nearly as much.

That`s far from certain though since a drop in price would certainly increase consumption of the drug. The effect a drop in prices would have on the actual amount of money being used to purchase the drug cannot be theoreticly determined. So, you could just as well end up with higher individual consumption for user, more habitual and recreational users, more crime and petty theft and sky-rocketing costs for society in terms of law enforcement, health care, production- and productivity losses, and not to mention the personal tragedies.While this is not the only possible outcome, why on earth take the risk? Isn`t it enough to have legalised one of the most lethal drugs, alcohol? Do you really need another?

I don't think you quite understand why they steal in the first place. They steal because you average meth freak or heroin junkie is so completely screwed up by their given vice that they are incapable of functioning on a dependable schedule. Drugs are not that exspensive. Someone with a mediocre job could budget the exspense. Most meth users make their own. A heroin freak could get by on about 200 to 300 a month for their dope no problem, which is easily afforded if someone makes even just an ok living. They steal becaue they have no other options, making the drug legal won't make them productive or dependable, so if you haven't got a jopb anyway, whether the cost is $5 a day or $25 it is irrelvant.In addition there is a huge ammount of crime that occurs related to drug use that has zero to do with the illegality of the drug and everything to do with the fact someone takes it in the first place.I read one survey that 90% of the prison population in the US has a substance abuse problem. 90% of the inamtes are not there for drug possession charges. Once you end up hooked and have no way to support yourself a person starts a long slide down a very bad slope. For a lot of drugs, particulary the hard ones, there are no good treatment options.

Just because alcoho, is dangerous does not make marijuana any less dangerous. If I had thought it possible* to make alcohol illegal in my country, I would be all for it. It`s a terrible drug responsible for many deaths, tragedies and heavy costs upon the society and the average tax payer.None of this makes it any more sensible to make marijuana legal (or any other drug for that matter). Every drug (and poision, weapon or any other "dangerous" drugs that has potential external costs for society) has to be evaluated wether they should be legal or not on its own.

I agree, however, the discussion was that marijuana should be illegal because it impairs driving. It is fair to compare the effect of alcohol to marijuana if the assertion made is that both impair driving but only ONE is illegal. The argument fails, logically, since the negative effects of alcohol far exceed those of marijuana. Therefore, some other criteria needs to be used in order to legitimately ban one and not the other, IMO. I don't believe that the government of a free people has the right to restrict personal choices unless those choices demonstrably negatively affect others.A free people don't want nor need a nanny government. Society, IMO, doesn't get to make the call on my personal behavior until that behavior impacts others. See above.

This would only apply if the legal status of marijuana was squarely based on it`s implication for motor traffic. But as it is, it is certainly one reason why it should be illegal. The fact that alcohol also is dangerous in traffic does not alter this reason. As I said, only if one was interested in creating a benchmark, would any comparrison be fuitful. And this benchmark would have to be quite comprehensive and cover many aspects of the drug in order to serve any real purpose in this particular debate. Yes, I`ve come to understand that ;). Evidently I don`t agree, but that`s probably another discussion. But irregardless how you feel about the nanny state, the comparison between alcohol and marijuana is only frutifull in a debate on the (desired) legal status of marijuana if it is conducted across a broad range of costs and benefits. Not on isolated issues alone.

It is fair to compare the effect of alcohol to marijuana if the assertion made is that both impair driving but only ONE is illegal. The argument fails, logically, since the negative effects of alcohol far exceed those of marijuana. Therefore, some other criteria needs to be used in order to legitimately ban one and not the other, IMO. I don't believe that the government of a free people has the right to restrict personal choices unless those choices demonstrably negatively affect others.A free people don't want nor need a nanny government. Society, IMO, doesn't get to make the call on my personal behavior until that behavior impacts others. See above.

Actually the debate is about whether all drugs should be legal. This whole marijuana thing is a tangent. People started puttting out how marijuana doesn't effect dexterity or that people can perform as well as sober driver while stoned, and that is a load of hogwash.The argument that alcohol is legal and worse, does not provide a rational basis for the legilization of marijuana. At least the one comment about just wanting to be able to ingest whatever a person wants is more honest. The answer remains no however.I'm looking for someone to put forth a good reason to add another legal vice to the inventory of Americans given the two major ones cause such a catastrophic level of damage.

the "good reason" that you are looking for is the belief that the government has overstepped its authority when it makes laws regulating what people can ingest. I'm a big opponent of nanny governmental intervention and drug laws are certainly a form of nanny governmental control of personal; behavior. aside from the Constitutional issue, there's a more pragmatic reason. Mandatory drug sentencing has actually caused the early release of hardened felons. Because of prison overcrowding, violent felons are often given early parole in order to make way for mandatory drug sentenced individuals. Given a choice, I'd rather see the drug dealers on the street and the violent criminals in jail so that theyt can't commit more violent crimes.

I agree there is no reason to sacrifice prison space to house simple users. That's not what this debate is about. Drugs can still kept illegal while using existing bed space more wisely, and that still is no answer about a good reason for legilization. When simple changes to probation and more creative forms of house arrest can provide an answer to the issue you raise.

I agree with that, but politicians and LE would lose a massive empire with enormous funding and draconian public control by adhering to it. This issue has been tossed around for decades with no justification other than morality legislation based on undefined social costs for continued illegality. The DEA budget alone, without DOJ grants to state and muni LE, incarceration costs or court costs, is in excess of $2-billion. Tack on those exceptions, add state/muni LE costs for drug enforcement and calculate lost tax revenue based on distribution. Then look at the social cost. Winning the war on drugs? A political/LE pipe dream.

You don't have your facts straight. The murder rate is down nearly 40% from the 80's and in fact the combination of less cases to work and DNA technology has allowed homicide departments in many major cities to work 'cold cases' much harder and bring even more people to trial. That is a 40% drop in actual numbers as well, the population has increased substantially in that time frame so the per capita rate has plummeted. So your statement is just not true.

They went up, and then down as gang and distribution turf wars were sorted out and operating territories firmly established. With the exception of the new drug of choice, meth, the drug trade for pot, smack, coke and synthetics including methadone is now well organized and concentrates on logistical business issues such as supply and distribution. While murders are down, incarceration for drug sales and possession has skyrocketed. The US has the highest per-capita rate of incarceration in the developed world, a large portion attributed to drug offenses. It isn't that our LE is especially efficient, they're reactive, not proactive, the 'snitch' factor being the largest single contributor to drug arrests. Our sheriff says without the snitch factor drug busts would be limited to those caught driving erratically or with defective equipment in traffic stops while using and/or in possession. Here's an interesting article on correlation between alcohol prohibition and drug prohibition increasing the per-capita murder rate:http://www.drugwarfacts.org/crime.htm

That's not the way I understand the drug trade. Those in charge of specific territories are seldom if ever arrested unless LE has an informant who agrees to testify against them. If they are in fact convicted, their organizations continue functioning with new or substitute leadership as they control the wholesale supply. Street dealers operate at the whim of whomever controls a specific territory by having retail sales (rights) due to their ability to obtain product from the territory 'owner' and are considered expendable. Some violence occurs to fill a street void, but not often as territories were well established long ago (the drug 'wars' of the 1980s and early 1990s) due to the immense profitability factor. Users, consumers in possession, are the most common LE arrest and (meth excepted) considered non-violent. They're generally given a free LE ride if they identify their source of supply, the street dealer. Due to the immensity of the US drug trade, the street dealer seldom testifies against his/her supplier who controls the territory, valuing his/her life and that of family members and friends. Mercy and understanding are not in drug trade P&Ps. So our LE devoted to drug enforcement grows faster than a hutch of rabbits, our judicial system is hopelessly clogged, jails and prisons are full with early release due to overcrowding being a daily occurrence and it's 'business as usual' in the stabilized, tax-free drug trade with few interruptions.

Look at it this way; street level dealers with or without guns are replaced within hours of not servicing their clientèle. In most cases the weapons are for rip-off protection, not territory rights. Actual product delivery people in most inner-cities are 10-12-year old kids who carry the drugs because they take juvenile falls, not criminal code arrests. There's no jostling for territory, that's well established. Major killings (numbers) from the early, organizational period were over territory and supply rights. Those after power in the form of establishing territorial rights didn't kill another dealer, they decimated entire organizations. Colombians were known for taking out all members of associated families. Illegal or not, the drug trade is a well-organized and very profitable business. Like any other business, risk factors are evaluated and adjusted to accomplish product distribution with minimal disruption. Increased LE arrests from traffic stops, burglar apprehension and other non-drug crimes to turn and identify street level dealers are just reactive LE making their numbers, in no way contributing to the decease in drug-related murders.

I have enjoyed reading viewpoints in this thread. I think all will admit that we are losing this war on drugs, which is primarily a war on supply. Regardless of the product, if a demand exists that guarantees huge profits then there will always be those that will feed that demand. I don't see a victory on the horizon, but I do think the war should be fought on both fronts and more done to reduce demand. Alcohol and smoking are trending downward as our youth no longer see it as cool. Hopefully with the right education and rehab efforts we can, over time, slow the flow of new and old customers. Legalization as a means to winning this war is a complex subject with a lot of unanswered questions and I hope to see more studies on this. Major question is can the war be won or is it just an ongoing holding action.Dono

I believe the war on drugs is nothing more than an empty campaign tool. It will never be won for several reasons.The number one reason I believe is that the drug world is too big of a money machine for the legal industry including police, bondsmen, lawyers, courts, rehab centers, etc. People can proudly claim they are fighting the war on drugs all the while knowing that it is never going to end. It's like coming out against something you know is never going to stop just to say you are against it. It makes the Bible thumpers happy.The demand is never going to go to zero.

I believe that's reality. US population growth with inordinate 'legal' economic and moral dependency on having unregulated drugs remain illegal make any change far more complex than simply repealing the Volstead Act as was done to eliminate prohibition of alcohol. And let's not forget politicians also receive economic benefit from drug illegality.

Agreed. The drug enforcement efforts as well as the drug supply efforts have both become leviathans. There are probably $100's of Billion being spent on both sides of the equation. Simply repealing the Volstead Act would have a ripple effect that would take years to unravel.

Recent studies apparently show that pot is more harmful than you say. One joint is said to contain more carcinogens than four tobacco cigarettes.I doubt your 20,000 joints theory.You have a simplistic argument going for pot. I can't agree that legalizing all drugs would be a good thing either. Programs in Holland have failed to produce significant if any benefits to society in general. The druggies seem to have benefitted by having arrest-free drug zones and access to whatever they want, but the cost of drugs still requires some income, something that most of them likely do not have other than from crime, begging or social programs.One "benefit" I see from legalizing drugs is that the users could be more easily identified.

Too late, drug usage has already created those epidemics. Legalizing drugs may increase some of them temporarily, but they already exist. I would argue that there would be a decrease in crime, for certain.

i think that if you legalised drugs, but anyone who wanted to buy them must register, so for instance if a parent wanted to check weather there child was or wasn't doing drugs they could, for lesser drugs such as cannibis. harder drugs should have an age limit on. hard drugs would need a prescription, so only for addicts, and would have to be taken on the premises, so they couldn't give some to other people to get addicted, and in the use of needles infetions could be stopped spreading as much.and i agree with who ever said earlier, that we could use the tax money to educate children and to advertise that drugs where wrong and maybe help with rehab. i think the key is education on the facts, not just give the children the bad bits and leave out the rest, that just causes conflict of facts when the child reads something somewhere else. and causes them to doubt other info that is true.

I've been very iffy on the issue of legalization for quite some time. I used to be pro-legalization (atleast for weed) but now I'm pretty much against it.I really hate the idea that we're wasting money on 'problems' that simply will not go away. If people want to do drugs, they WILL do drugs... its really simply as that. There has been a lot of talk about the actually harm that marijuana does and I will have to agree that it is much less a problem than alcohol.I go to a college were both the binge drinking and the marijuana use is extremely rampant (#1 party school). I have friends who smoke pot every single day and I have friends who never smoke at all. I usually partake in smoking when my friends do it on weekends. The college here isn't easy and many of my friends are doing just fine in their classes. MARIJUANA DOES NOT MAKE YOU STUPID. Its the most distorting lie that I hear. It might make you lazy and a little short on memory DURING your high... but that only lasts a few hours.But now back to the issue... why should marijuana be legal anyway? If you want to smoke marijuana in your home, you can. I've done it probably 200 times in my college career and not once has a police come knocking or have I felt like my privacy was at risk. It feels  perfectly legal and I think that perceived freedom is the essence of what is important.Why pot should stay illegal... it makes it pretty damn expensive for a college student. I think this is a good thing. (This might not apply to everyone but atleast in my situation). Another thing is most people in jail are doing significant time were selling. They should be arrested... its the risk they take for making a lot of money. Either way our spending on the "drug war" should almost be cut out completely... but legalization isn't a good idea either. It sends the wrong message to young people.I think people in my situation (hold a job, are in schooling, are in control of their life, etc.) hold a certain degree of responsiblity that allows one to handle drugs if they please (this includes delving into mushrooms, or cocaine if one is so inclined). The essence of a REAL addiction is when being sober just doesn't cut it anymore. Its the people with ****** lives who like their reality forever distorted (and who can blame them). I think everyone has the right to do whatever the **** they please as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else.As I said before my thoughts are all around on the subject but my main point is this: The main argument for legalization is that the government shouldn't tell us what we can and can't do if it doesn't hurt anyone else... and I agree with this. But really... what are they doing to stop you from doing the drugs you want (atleast not blantantly in public)?... nothing! Legalizing drugs will lift much of the stigma (which I actually believe is good in some respects) that drugs are BAD simply stated. Kids at impressionable ages should believe this. They are to young and naive to have a plan for life and weed might just become it if they don't like school. When you're older and wiser you can make better decisions for yourself. You can 'rebel' if you want. You know the government is full of **** and weed won't make you stupid or crazy. But maybe its better for the youngin's to think so.Just my 2 ounces

i think that if you legalised drugs, but anyone who wanted to buy them must register, so for instance if a parent wanted to check weather there child was or wasn't doing drugs they could, for lesser drugs such as cannibis. harder drugs should have an age limit on. hard drugs would need a prescription, so only for addicts, and would have to be taken on the premises, so they couldn't give some to other people to get addicted, and in the use of needles infetions could be stopped spreading as much.and i agree with who ever said earlier, that we could use the tax money to educate children and to advertise that drugs where wrong and maybe help with rehab. i think the key is education on the facts, not just give the children the bad bits and leave out the rest, that just causes conflict of facts when the child reads something somewhere else. and causes them to doubt other info that is true.

I've been very iffy on the issue of legalization for quite some time. I used to be pro-legalization (atleast for weed) but now I'm pretty much against it.I really hate the idea that we're wasting money on 'problems' that simply will not go away. If people want to do drugs, they WILL do drugs... its really simply as that. There has been a lot of talk about the actually harm that marijuana does and I will have to agree that it is much less a problem than alcohol.I go to a college were both the binge drinking and the marijuana use is extremely rampant (#1 party school). I have friends who smoke pot every single day and I have friends who never smoke at all. I usually partake in smoking when my friends do it on weekends. The college here isn't easy and many of my friends are doing just fine in their classes. MARIJUANA DOES NOT MAKE YOU STUPID. Its the most distorting lie that I hear. It might make you lazy and a little short on memory DURING your high... but that only lasts a few hours.But now back to the issue... why should marijuana be legal anyway? If you want to smoke marijuana in your home, you can. I've done it probably 200 times in my college career and not once has a police come knocking or have I felt like my privacy was at risk. It feels  perfectly legal and I think that perceived freedom is the essence of what is important.Why pot should stay illegal... it makes it pretty damn expensive for a college student. I think this is a good thing. (This might not apply to everyone but atleast in my situation). Another thing is most people in jail are doing significant time were selling. They should be arrested... its the risk they take for making a lot of money. Either way our spending on the "drug war" should almost be cut out completely... but legalization isn't a good idea either. It sends the wrong message to young people.I think people in my situation (hold a job, are in schooling, are in control of their life, etc.) hold a certain degree of responsiblity that allows one to handle drugs if they please (this includes delving into mushrooms, or cocaine if one is so inclined). The essence of a REAL addiction is when being sober just doesn't cut it anymore. Its the people with ****** lives who like their reality forever distorted (and who can blame them). I think everyone has the right to do whatever the **** they please as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else.As I said before my thoughts are all around on the subject but my main point is this: The main argument for legalization is that the government shouldn't tell us what we can and can't do if it doesn't hurt anyone else... and I agree with this. But really... what are they doing to stop you from doing the drugs you want (atleast not blantantly in public)?... nothing! Legalizing drugs will lift much of the stigma (which I actually believe is good in some respects) that drugs are BAD simply stated. Kids at impressionable ages should believe this. They are to young and naive to have a plan for life and weed might just become it if they don't like school. When you're older and wiser you can make better decisions for yourself. You can 'rebel' if you want. You know the government is full of **** and weed won't make you stupid or crazy. But maybe its better for the youngin's to think so.Just my 2 ounces

Yes... I'm basically saying you should just be happy smoking pot if you want to, its legal in principle. You won't get in trouble doing it.And yes, if you are young and impressionable its best to make pot as scary and harmful as the politians do. My memory is just fine also

That's only because you've never been caught. It IS illegal to smoke pot even if you do it in your house. You have just been lucky.I've sat through my kids' DARE and Quest anti-drug programs and found them to be a joke. No doubt my kids did the same. Equating tobacco and cocaine immediately destroys any semblance of credibility with any kid with half a brain. After that, they view the whole program with a jaundiced eye.What was the question? emoticonXConfused :)

Actually, it's illegal to possess pot, not to smoke it. You can't get arrested for being high.

Not true. Public intoxication includes illegal drugs. Here's an example from WV.

...but, you can't get arrested just for being high. You have to disturb someone else with your actions. If you just sit in the park stoned out of your mind without bothering anyone, you can't be arrested for it. Sometimes it's hard to tell if someone is stoned or just wierd.I know a girl who has a natural high all the time and to my knowledge, she's never done any kind of drugs. If you met her though, you'd think she was a lifelong stoner.

I too support decriminalizing Marijuana.Because I know alot of pot heads and they don't hurt anyone.You don't see people robbing banks or killing or raping on a joint.You are right you can not overdose on marijuana.However to say it does not kill you is wrong.Anything that effects the mind like that does kill you it just takes time.Pop kills,tobacco kills,driving a car kills and water kills (usually too much at one time but however it might have some additives in it that someone might be allergic to).You are also correct that the war on drugs is not working it is a miserable failure.However we can not decriminalize hard drugs like Crack and Heroine and most of all Meth.Any money seized in these wars should go for education.But how can children respect the teachings of why they will harm you and destroy your life if they can easily get it?I know a meth user (I hate this guy but he uses).If I was a kid being taught how it kills and I know he uses and I can legally get it why would I believe you that it kills?But some parents would have a problem with real education on how drugs kill.Let the kids see a crack head in the hospital who was rushed there for an overdose.I have seen it.Not pretty.But the hard things are worth watching.

I support legalization of every drug. I'm sure most of you are young and have been fed XXXX like "Marijuana will kill you." Actually it does less damage to the brain then alcohol and it cannot kill you. It is impossible. It takes 20,000 joints in one sitting to overdose on marijuana. Alcohol however kills thousands of americans each year from alcohol poisoning. You know that idiot pothead. He didn't get dumb from pot, he got dumb from birth. Marijuana does not have long term effects on IQ. The only side effect is the lazy side effect. The day after a person tends to be more lazy however it is like a hang over..... it only lasts for a day. There is no reason why it should remain illegal.I also support all drugs being legalized because the drug war has failed. We spend billions each year on the drug war and I can call someone right now and pick up some crack. It is a failure. What we should do is make it government controlled and then spend the money to fight drugs on drug education. Flood the schools with ACTUAL info about how herion kills and how it breaks a person down. Tell the kids how you can die from one use of coke. Tell them the short term and long term effects of each drug. If we can educate our kids and even adults through an ad campaign about what drugs do to you then we could save far more people. Also allowing drugs to be regulated will lower the prices and effectively kill drug dealers and gangs off the streets. There are so many benefits to legalizing drugs. Anyone want to fight it? I have proof to back up what I say and also have the effects of each drug.

The amount of Bs I've heard in this thread so far has been amazing. First off it is safer for your body to smoke a joint then to drink one beer just look at the facts. I'm tired of people making this drug to be worse then it is, it is ranked as the least habit forming and least addicting Intoxicant available. It doesn’t cause any type of brain damage, it doesn’t kill brain cells, and the "laziness" associated with this drug is known most often to occur in minors. If you want to know more about Weed myths visit this site here it is completely backed up with studies and other data to support its conclusions: http://paranoia.lycaeum.org/marijuana/facts/. If anyone can prove anything contained in this site wrong I would gladly hear him or her out.Now the debate of legalization of drugs is a debate that shouldn't exist in the first place if people would just remember what happened during prohibition of Alcohol.There are many claims about how crime will go down or how violent crime has gone up blah blah blah…. None of this really matters if you look at the big picture. Think about it, when you buy drugs whom do you think produces sells and profits from these drugs? Whose profits and financial support would disappear if drugs were to be legalized? That’s right, gangsters and terrorists that’s who and no amount of law enforcement will ever be able to fully stop them, its just not working its as simple as that. Many people say that if drugs became legal that usage would rise. Well this is logical and I agree it would rise, but not by much and not enough to justify the wasted money, lives and the power prohibition grants organized crime and terrorists as well as the rampant corruption of public figures. Many people talk about legalization as if it will bring all sorts of problems associated with drug use. Let me clue you in: the problems already exist and drugs currently are illegal so, explain to me again how all these problems would magically arise if drugs were legal, but for some reason don't exist now? Now I agree that the problems would rise, but again not enough to justify the wasted money, lives and the power prohibition grants organized crime and terrorists as well as the rampant corruption of public figures. Many people say that of course crime would go down it would be the same if you legalized murder. This simply is not true there is a large amount of crime associated with drug use as well as selling drugs so, crime would go down but, in many different areas that hurt our society much more then drug use. Claims that drug use will sky rocket are simply false this has been proven true with prohibition. Also minors will have restricted from drugs due to age limits. It was much harder for me to get dope then it was for me to get a beer. To get beer I had to know somebody that was 21 and that was willing to buy me beer but, to get drugs I just had to know a dealer and many weren't much older then me when I was 16. Comon people the drug war is a lost cause that is hurting our county so, give it up already!
