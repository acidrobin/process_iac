this institution started out as a church recognized union. We Americans eventually incorperated it into our political system. I think it should either remain as it is (hetero), and if people have a problem with that, marriage should be given back to the church only. we can't have it both ways

nobody put a ban on gay marriage. gay marriage was never legal or customary in the first place, so your question might be me better put as 'permit gay marriage?'right now gay marriage is unlawful simply because the laws permitting gay marriage doesnt exist. in order for gay marriage to be permissible, the laws will have to be changed. right now there are lots of people lobbying to get gay marriage legal, and thats the proper procedureits very disturbing and aggravating when i hear gays say that their rights are being denied. they never had a marriage right in the first place, so nobody took away their right or denied them anything.

Were there no marriages before the church, did God perform the ceremony for Adam and Eve, or were they living in sin? The institution may have been taken over by the church, but it definitely did not start out as a church sponsored event.What it started out as no longer matters, what matters is what it is today, which as far as the courts should see it, is a legal agreement between two people. If you have a problem with it being two women, that is what it should be, YOUR PROBLEM.

First, this isn't about Adam and Eve. That's irrelevant. Research. It was a religious/community institution.Secondly, it's everyone's 'problem'. We're paying for it. That's what most of the argument is about. Do they get benifits? who pays for them?It does matter what it started out as, because it shows an alternative. We're either stuck with all of the arguements today, or we can go back to the 'old way' if you will. That would be nothing short of chaotic, but so is this.

It boils down to the fact that Americans are not ready to begin viewing homosexuality as an acceptable occurance. Homosexuality is still concidered a form of sexual deviance by many, myself included. Explaining sex to youngsters is tough enough without having to explain sexual deviance.

Homosexuality is behavior. If we must recognize gay marriages then why should polygamist be discriminated against? The law governs are behavior. If we don't want to recognize homosexuality we have that right as a society. We don't recognize polygamy, which by the world standards is more acceptable.

What sex isn't behaviour?Polygamy is not more acceptable by the standards of Western society. I'm not sure I would call it a significant factor of contemporary Western society. It is significant in patriarchal societies. No court or government in Western society has recognized marriage rights for polygamists.

No one is preventing any adults from getting married (except poligamy and incest). Anyone who wants to marry a member of the opposite sex can marry. If someone wants to make a life contract to another - for whatever reason - may due so, to an extent. No one is stopping a woman from being a mother. But wait! Men can't be mothers! That must be a result of discrimination! (sarcasim implied)Just because an individual can't experience everything that another individual can does not make it discrimination. More men are denied the 'right' to make a choice about a pregnancy then there are homosexuals who are denied the 'right' to marry.Incidentally, the whole concept of marriage is a religious SACRAMENT that has taken on legal / civil aspects through history. It was never a social concept taken on by religions.What is wrong with civil unions if the couple enjoys the same rights as married couples, but without the title?

It's not just for a heterosexual contract in the Netherlands, Belgium, most of Canada, and probably not limited that way for much longer in Sweden and Spain. It won't be just for a heterosexual contract in Mass. in May.There are married heterosexual couples who either choose to not have children, or cannot have children. So it is not just for having a family unit with children either.

emclean,Let me reverse your question. What government began the institution of marriage? (For what purpose would a government create such an institution?) Like marriage, religion is a concept. Marriage has religious rules enforced by God. The civic rules of marriage (alimony ect.) are realatively new.Noah and the others you mention were married by their religious leaders and any government of the time was not involved. Purely religious.

The same as any other heterosexual couple. It's not the way children are created ( adopted, serrogacy, etc). It 's the nature of the relationship (heterosexual). Natural refers to nature not child bearing.

We're talking about traditional families. A family can be just a wife and husband. It can't be two husbands.

Look at the current hoity-toity polls which show strong support for gay rights among those 18-29. I don't see polygamy as a value among minorities in the U.S.Hawaii was different, as the legislature made changes against marriage for gays, while the stayed decision was being appealed to the Supreme Court.So is casual sex and rabies.

Polygamy is not women married together. It's one man or women married to multiple of the opposite sex like a harem or entourage.Everyone feels their values are right or else they wouldn't believe in them. What we value shows. Of course atheist don't believe in God so they have a different set of values. I of course believe in God first, family second, and country third. If you have different values then of course you will think yours are better if not then you wouldn't have them. Our values are what guide us. I feel that from perspective my values give someone a better balance and stability to function in society. You probably think otherwise but I feel statistically I can support mine.

Exactly it means not having sex with someone jsut becaue you're attracted to them. Also it is understandable to feel certain emotions. Society knows that people must learn to manage their emotions. It means doing things because they're "right" not becaue you have the urge to do it. That is why laws are made to apply to us ojectively.

The fault was yours, your definition of natural is bizarre and vague.

As soon as it starts becoming too restrictive like your version insisting on no sex other than for reproduction and starts preventing too much of what people want to do they will rebel (effectively forming a new socirty within the first one).

First off favoring a hand is natural. Teaching ourselves to be ambidextrous is an advantage. It's not common but a natural phemenon that helps us and it to our advantage.Marriage is natural. Throughout history and thorughout the wolrd it's normal to create families. It's a basic a instinct. Science has determined that most of our problems from deviant behavior is when there is a break down in the home. The best adjusted kids are not the ones that have grown up where they see both of roles mothers and fathers being performed. Even in hot climates people need to protect their skin. Look at all the desert tribes they bundles up more there than people in moderate climates.Also there is a need for privacy for many cultures. When we value our bodies as personal as most cultures do then we value protecting that privacy.I was illustrating that development is natural.Personal opinion. Like most of our comments are opinion

If I give a gay a right that I have to marry same sex then they have the right that I have. If they dont' have the right to marry same sex and I don't then we both don't have that right. same rights.Now if they want a right that they dont' have that is different. Just like rapist want the right to have sex with whomever they want. Do they? NO. Do gays no? NO Do I? no So are we disriminatinig against them?

But if it wasn't sex only in reproduction- this means not even between married couples except for the specific purpose of haing children, then would you have no problem with gay marriage? Surely this is the case as sex only for reproduction isn't enforced nor is marriage only for the purpose of children enforced. Why shouldn't gays be granted equal rights to marry someone they love, in what way could this possibly have any effect on the public interest whatsoever? Why is it in the publics interest you get married before having kids rather than just having children out of wedlock and both partners staying to raise them? You have many rights granted you that are not in the public interest- free speech, the right to bear arms, freedom of religion. These are all rights in the individual's interest rather than the whole society.Greeks and Romans are probably the most influential powers in the history of the world, and their empires lasted a great deal longer than ours have.

What most people do is natural. Hence the term natural.I'm not saying sex only in reproduction. I'm saying marriage only recognized in heterosexual relationships.Also more inclusive societies? Greeks, Romans, Zulus, what all happened to them? They were destroyed from within and they were unable to defend themselves when anything came along.

It's a circular argument that states marriage simply is heterosexual. It's the same line of logic they used against inter-racial marriages. You have said before that race is proven physical. I believe the effect is similar.You state sexual orientation is behaviour. Religions are behaviours. Do Christians have equal rights in China and Iran, under the former Taliban, because they have the right to be the same as the "natural" "non-deviant" majority, and practice another religion or no religion? In those societies, not even the Islamic people or the non-religious people have the right to practice Christianity, nor to be married in a Christian church. Thus, everyone has equal rights. Therefore there is no need to concern ourselves with Christian "oppression" in certain societies. It isn't discrimination. These are not Christian societies, and they don't respect Christain institutions and Christian behaviour. There are some religious people who want the right to do all sorts of harmful rituals to others. Those societies don't give that right, just as they don't give it to Christians.

If I give a gay a right that I have to marry same sex then they have the right that I have. If they dont' have the right to marry same sex and I don't then we both don't have that right. same rights.Now if they want a right that they dont' have that is different. Just like rapist want the right to have sex with whomever they want. Do they? NO. Do gays no? NO Do I? no So are we disriminatinig against them? NO we decided that it was not in our public interests.Now there are reason that you will argue that it is in our public interest. That may be true but we are not discriminating them if they still have the same rights.

Marriage is about protecting a family. Even after death the marriage is still protected as surving the marriage. WE'd change the definition of families it wouldn't be husband and wife it'd be husband and husband. The argument of why shouldn't we grant equal rights to gays is already debated and we won't debate it again. REad above posts. The right to marry has nothing to do with love in the eyes of the law. It gives a man the right to marry a woman and a woman to marry a man. Everyone has the right. If you want a different right well it doesn't mean you're discriminated against.It isn't illegal to ahve kids out of wedlock. The law recognizes that through common law marriages and parental rights. The public has an interst in free speech. It promotes interaction of ideas. What good does society have in promoting homosexuality? They're down fall was their inability to control their liberalism. They were destroyed because they were too accepting. The people that made it great such as aristole and socrates were probably against gay marriages. If you read their philosophy about families you'll be pretty impressed. So the poeple taht made it great were about protecting families.

But if it wasn't sex only in reproduction- this means not even between married couples except for the specific purpose of haing children, then would you have no problem with gay marriage? Surely this is the case as sex only for reproduction isn't enforced nor is marriage only for the purpose of children enforced. Why shouldn't gays be granted equal rights to marry someone they love, in what way could this possibly have any effect on the public interest whatsoever? Why is it in the publics interest you get married before having kids rather than just having children out of wedlock and both partners staying to raise them? You have many rights granted you that are not in the public interest- free speech, the right to bear arms, freedom of religion. These are all rights in the individual's interest rather than the whole society.Greeks and Romans are probably the most influential powers in the history of the world, and their empires lasted a great deal longer than ours have.

We already debated this. The effect is not similar. The law protects heterosexual marriages. They sid a heterosexual marriage isn't legal if you're black. Law only heterosexual marriage. I want a gay one. Well we don't allow that for anyone regardless of the race, gender, ability, or orientation.Do you understand the difference yet?Religion isn't behavior. It's belief. The US protects beliefs. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Mormons) were allowed to believe in their beliefs. The law regulated their behavior. They weren't allowed to be polygamists. The US has an interest in allowing people to believe as they will as long as their behavior isn't illegal. The law protects people's beleifs so taht a majority religion doesn't discriminate based upon their beliefs.If I believed rape was justified by God. No one could discriminate me according to my beliefs.

Please try to understand, you saying 'you are only allowed to marry someone of the opposite sex, everyone has the same right' is akin to saying 'you are only allowed to marry someone of the same race, everyone has the same right'. It is flawed logic at best and a weak excuse for prejudice at worst.Err the Roman Empire's fall was mostly due to mass migration, a run of weak Emperors, the population's tendency towards peace over war, political infighting, economic decline, plagues, and the Visigoth revolution. I doubt any serious historian would list 'liberalisation' as a major factor in it's decline.Overall your argument is incoherent, illogical and contradictory and yet you have the audacity to insult me.

And they didn't allow inter-racial marriage for anyone regardless of race, gender, ability, religion, or orientation. The effect would be the same if they didn't allow inter-faith couples to marry, or didn't recognize marriages performed by a different faith. When put into practice it is behaviour. One could say homosexuality is a belief in having sex with those of the same sex(without practice or behaviour).Indeed, putting their belief into practice. Of course two men or two women living together isn't illegal. Same-sex marriage is currently not legal, but that may change in the U.S.However, if all people were only allowed to practice Islam(Iran), and only be married in Islamic institutions as an Islamic couple, and only have Islamic ceremonies, that would be giving Christians and all others equality based on behaviour or practice. If I am a practicing Christian who wants to be married to another practicing Christian in a Christian-friendly institution, well they don't allow that for anyone. If it were a free society we would ask who would be harmed by giving equal respect to Christianity? The onus would be on those making the assertion or assumption that it is harmful or bad to show that it is harmful or bad. That's in a free society.How so?

Agreed. I know I've done similar things before, so no harm done.However I disagree with that, but that's what we're here for! :)But you are talking about from the beginning of civilised mankind, once we moved into societies we moved away from what is natural. Actually the basic needs are drink, food and shelter. In that order. Anything else is a product of society. Now whilst it could be argued it is necessary in extreme conditions, such as artic or dessert climate as mentioned before as neither you (I presume) nor I live in such conditions I would say that is irrelevant.I disagree. Your first comment stated natural is not the 'most common' your second is that it is 'what most people do', ie the 'most common'. I see. Well I suppose it is all in the eye of the beholder. Personally I feel homosexuality cannot be considered 'extreme'. Attraction to children or animals yes, but just to others of your own sex?But these people harm society by acting out on their 'deviant' behaviour, hence it is necessary for society to restrict them for it's own defence. Homosexuality hurts nobody, so why should it need to be restricted?Well firstly, being British I don't care that much about the constitution. It's a great document but people have too great a tendency to regard it as being some divinely written document that can never be wrong. But that is beside the point. Constitution or not, do you not see that the 'we all have the same rights' argument is just an excuse to say 'everyone should act how I act'I wouldn't put too much faith in a source that claims it's explanations are 'sometimes silly', and I question the objectivity of the second link. In any case they both list it as a minor point amongst many others.

The tax and fringe benefits are a result of society's interest not nature's. However the debate is should we allow the marraiges. I'd concede to civil unions but not marriage. Just like I don't think HS students shouldn't get degrees until they get their diploma. it would change the dynamics of marriage. We couldn't say he's not gay he's married. ( the current assumption) The marriage tends to insinuate that even if it's not true. A person would say that he's a Hs graduate because he has his degree.Can you see the analogy? We believe that isn't the definition of a family. We believe a family is a result of a marriage (husband, wife, children), intercourse ( sharing biology), or adoption(relationship). Not two men being husbands to each other.

EXACTLY.I've been saying civil union all along. Take the relgious context out of it completely. Homosexual couples receive all the "rights" that heterosexual couples receive, which is what they're after anyway, they aren't getting married in the church, and the religious crowd gets to defend the sanctity of the "sacrament of marriage".Everyone wins, everyone SHOULD be happy. Tolerance and compromise, how far fetched right?Mana'ia,I've been following pretty closely, and I guess I must be really dense, because try as I might, I just can't get the logic or reasoning behind your "natural" arguement or the grounds on which you would deny same sex marriage.

All gay people are not allowed to marry according to their practiced sexual orientation, but heteros are. See above, discriminatory by sexual orientation behaviour than.Thanks for clearing that up. What was I thinking? Who am I to argue with what you say your invisible man in the sky, which you can't prove exists, instructs us to do?

What right does a black man have? To marry a black woman. What right does the white man have? To marry white woman. Are these the same rights?What right does a straight man have? To marry a woman.What right does a gay man have? To marry a woman. Are these the same rights? Interfaith couplesCatholic man ? Only to catholic woman.LDS man? Only to LDS woman. Are these the same rights? That's true and they are allowed to believe that. When they practice is when the government can stop it.They were allowed to believe but not practice. We agree.True. The debate is if it should be.Heterosexual behavior by Islam okay.Heterosexual behavior by Christian not okay.Discriminatory because same behavior regulated the faith.Natural behavior is behavior given to us physiologically ( not biologically).Religious behavior is behavior god ( higher power) instructs us to do.

Okay, but that wasn't the question being asked.

Touche, and actually, I'm very surprised by your stance in this thread. Quite the dichotomy (and one that I'm not sure can be reconciled)However, the true sign of intelligence/wisdom is not to belittle those that don't understand, but to help them to understand. If you're unable to do so, IMHO, it reflects every bit as poorly on you as it does on them.Waxy

Laws are to apply to everyone objectively regardless, of race, gender, ora bilites. Behavior can be used to make a difference. Just like felons can't own guns. Their behavior limited their rights.We are allowed to discriminate behavior this is the same issue again. THe argument is then do we agree if homosexuality is behavior or not.How do you know He doesn't exist if you don't even know what He is?There are thousands of different philosophies of what God is, how do you knwo none of them are true if you don't know what He is?Anyways you cant prove he doesn't exist. I can't prove I love someone. Does that mean that love doesn't exist? Do you know how I act when I'm in love? People only think they know what love should be not how it is actually for me.I was just telling you the difference.

You mentioned earlier in the thread that sex should be for reproduction only. Please tell me if I misunderstood. If you believe this, do you believe childless heterosexual couples should not be allowed to marry? Disallowing sexual behaviour for anything other than reproduction is not an enforced requirement in marriage, as I believe Tastyfish mentioned.Not necessarily. It shouldn't matter if it is behaviour or not, as we accept many behaviours, including many heterosexual behaviours.An appeal to ignorance isn't proof. The problem occures when people say their ideology comes from a higher power they can't prove exists, and therefore their ideology is placed above debate.

How can you possibly equate prostitution to gay marriage? And would society break down if some individuals are allowed to enter into a legally protecting penumbra institution we call marriage? Probably not. If marriage is so sacred socially, then heterosexuals who get married should never divorce, and quickie marriages that celebrities have all of the time shouldn't be allowed (Not to mention things like Joe Millionaire and the Bachelorette). This shouldn't be a social issue because if it is, it's allowing the government to make individuals to adhere to a set of moral codes that only a select group believes. The government should approach this as a legal matter, which it is, and allow the legally binding marriage of homosexuals which affords them the same benefits that every other couple who pays 80 bucks to a local courthouse can enjoy. If you have a problem with it socially, then you probably also have a problem with homosexuals in the first place, and thats a problem that you need to deal with on your own. Otherwise, keep your mouth shut and let the government dole out legal unions (or dare I say "marriages") to same sex couples and let that be the end of it. If the word marriage bothers you so much because of the religious background of the word, get over it. The word is a useful way to describe the legal binding of any two individuals who may have a different faith than the one where some claim the word's definition is derived from. Atheist couples get married in courthouses because "marriage" in the legal sense has no religious affiliation. So, this being a purely legal matter, there should be no question that any two people can enjoy this legal right.

Well, actually there are churches which want the right to marry gay couples, such as the Metropolitan Community Church, and many congregations of the Unitarian-Universalists, as I am aware of in the U.S. I assume you are arguing for civil unions for all gay and straight and non-religious partnerships, equal to marriage in everything but name. Marriage would be a religious ceremony, having no legal value.I doubt if the government will get out of the marriage business. That would be quite drastic to make everyone lose the status of their marriage.

EXACTLY.I've been saying civil union all along. Take the relgious context out of it completely. Homosexual couples receive all the "rights" that heterosexual couples receive, which is what they're after anyway, they aren't getting married in the church, and the religious crowd gets to defend the sanctity of the "sacrament of marriage".Everyone wins, everyone SHOULD be happy. Tolerance and compromise, how far fetched right?Mana'ia,I've been following pretty closely, and I guess I must be really dense, because try as I might, I just can't get the logic or reasoning behind your "natural" arguement or the grounds on which you would deny same sex marriage.

To me, this entire thing boils down to defining marriage.It's simple really, to me anyway, there's the religious sacrament of marriage, and then there's the legal union of two people recognized by the state. Somewhere along the line the two got confused - the result is the mess we have today.Is marriage in the church not a purely relgious ceremony as it stands today? The state doesn't care what denomination you are or where you get married, they just want the documents signed. Marriage as recognized by the church is not in any way tied to the status of marriage as recognized by the state, and has no increased or separate legal valueThis whole thing is a matter of semantics, and IMHO, it's silly. No one is trying to destroy the Christian's sacrament of marriage or even to degrade it, they simply want equality under the eyes of the law. I can't for the life of me understand the rational of denying these people that right, REGARDLESS of one's feelings about homosexuality.Waxy

Question: What is the Church’s position on polygamy? Answer: In 1998, President Gordon B. Hinckley made the following statement about the Church's position on plural marriage: "This Church has nothing whatever to do with those practicing polygamy. They are not members of this Church. . . . If any of our members are found to be practicing plural marriage, they are excommunicated, the most serious penalty the Church can impose. Not only are those so involved in direct violation of the civil law, they are in violation of the law of this Church." ...In 1890, President Wilford Woodruff received a revelation that the leaders of the Church should cease teaching the practice of plural marriage (Official Declaration 1). http://www.mormon.org/question/faq/c...-114-3,00.htmlThis is from their official website.Mongamy is common in nature so is polygamy. We as humans are above the naturalization theory. We include thought into our decisions. We're the least predictable species on earth. We incorporate different reason why we decide to have sex with people. Many times it happens without intent. Darwinism the "THEORY" is that the best suited will surviv and perpetruate the best genes. Not necessarily that the best seeking the best. Although the best would be the most appealing. Monogamy is practiced throughout most of the Bible. There were times when there were so few righeous men and more righteous women that God instructed a few righteous prohets to raise a righteous generation.

There is no evidence that is definitve to suggest that. There is only speculation. The fact that there are gays that have changed proves that it is behavior.

TO be denied a right first there needs to exist that right and second someone else has to have it.That's exactly how our laws are and pne of the policy consdierations.

Mana'ia, if homosexuality is genetic, you would not endorse their marriage? But that is still discrimination. Our Constitution prohibits discrimination against any race, color, creed, sex, etc. and if homosexuality is genetic (which I believe it is), then they are entitled to protection because it's not a choice of theirs to be that way, but their genes are against them. Homosexuality does not harm others; it is not a self destructive way of life.

Some paid extreme Christian activists who have claimed a temporary change in their behaviours. That is, before they are caught in a gay bar. Right-wing Christians are always trying to recruit others, that's nothing new.And little to suggest being a right-wing Christian bigot is genetic. That says it all as to the fuzzy logic, and as to how vague your agruments happen to be. If we could call them "arguments".Homosexuality is not a disorder. Unless you are going to give me a vague overly broad definition of disorder now, that states it is anything that the statistical majority does not do.Prove that it's integrity will be compromised.Not all heterosexual couples have children, and not all gay couples are childless.

The reasons depend on your morals. The reasons to not accept public lewdness, rape, underage sex is dependent on your morals as well.

I suppose I haven't read every line written by Mana'ia, but where is the evidence she is a homophobe? A homophobe is someone who hates or harms homosexuals--where is any of this? You seem to be saying in this quote that a homophobe is anyone who is against homosexual behavior. Well, from what I've read of your posts, you oppose Christian behavior, namely thinking homosexuality is wrong. Following your definition of bigotry, are you a anti-Christian bigot?

There isn't a general agreement that all forms of homosexual behaviour are not to be accepted.Meaningless and vague to say it depends on your morals. Everything depends on your morals. Such as the fact that these things cause real harm, interfere with the freedom of others, and there is a general agreement that they are wrong. Not so with your homophobia, or with your we need to be against homosexuals when they act homosexually morality, if you prefer.

I am against extreme right-wing homophobic Christians, not against Christianity in general. Mana'ia started saying homosexual in the same breath as serial killer, etc, because it all falls under the very broad definition of behaviour, so I mentioned right-wing homophobic Christianity as another behaviour.

First off I guess if it were genetic it would change so many things. God might not oppose it and I would not feel so inclinde to fight against it. However iut is not genetic. There are gays that change and then there are heteros that are "recruited" by gays.Homosexuality is self destructive according to some experts.
attacks
Mana'ia, if homosexuality is genetic, you would not endorse their marriage? But that is still discrimination. Our Constitution prohibits discrimination against any race, color, creed, sex, etc. and if homosexuality is genetic (which I believe it is), then they are entitled to protection because it's not a choice of theirs to be that way, but their genes are against them. Homosexuality does not harm others; it is not a self destructive way of life.

THere are homsexuals that try to recruit as well. Also there are gays that have changed and were not paid. These anti-gay sites you read have no basis. They are very hateful anit-exgay and anti- Christian sites. How can you consider these impartial?So I'm a bigot now? Thanks for showing how people that disagree with you are Christian bigots. I'm not a bigot. Are you a bigot for opposing family values? Mine are fuzzy logics? Jake c'mon now. All your arguments are based upon bias speculation. If it's fuzzy maybe you need to change your glasses prescription.I showed yout that homosexuality is outside the norm therefore it's deviant. That is broad statement because it cover many disorders.THe fact that the institution will be changed (becaue it will no longer be the same heterosexual institution)proves that it's integrity will be compromised. Res ipsa loquitorNow prove tht it won't.Marriage is to protect family if they do ahve children. If they don't then theya re still a family.

Some paid extreme Christian activists who have claimed a temporary change in their behaviours. That is, before they are caught in a gay bar. Right-wing Christians are always trying to recruit others, that's nothing new.And little to suggest being a right-wing Christian bigot is genetic. That says it all as to the fuzzy logic, and as to how vague your agruments happen to be. If we could call them "arguments".Homosexuality is not a disorder. Unless you are going to give me a vague overly broad definition of disorder now, that states it is anything that the statistical majority does not do.Prove that it's integrity will be compromised.Not all heterosexual couples have children, and not all gay couples are childless.

There is no evidence that is definitve to suggest that. There is only speculation. The fact that there are gays that have changed proves that it is behavior. There is as much evidence to suggest that homosexuality is genetic as there is that serial killing and pedophilia is genetic.My argument does not rest on that it is natural. It relies on various arguments. It's only a policy consideration.No, becasue then I'd ahve to accept every disorder that was genetic such as prostituion (nymphomania).Maintaining the integrity of marriage and not endorsing the behavior as acceptable.The law is amde to apply to everyone equally. The law cannot be based upon desires. The law is objective. There is nothing to suggest that they are denied some right. TO be denied a right first there needs to exist that right and second someone else has to have it.That's exactly how our laws are and pne of the policy consdierations. Public lewdness, lawmakers didn't want to do it and did want anyone else to do it eihter. All laws are based upon that mentality. It exists for a variety of reasons. It exists to recognize a family unit and the legally obligating people to fufill their vow to their spouse and children. It exchange for their pledge the government protects that interest in the family.It doesn't allow for my desires to determine my rights.

Well, here's an article from the Guardian than...http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/st...183596,00.htmlBesen's book begins with an incident the author was barely able to believe when it happened. Newsweek magazine ran a cover story in 1998 about John and Anne Paulk, formerly gay but blissfully married. The Paulks were the poster boy and girl of a national ad campaign splashing across the American media that summer, funded by Christian ex-gay ministries. One night two years later, Besen received a call from a friend in a Washington DC gay bar. Guess who was there, chatting him up? John Paulk. Besen raced there, photographed Paulk, and has been persecuting the ex-gay movement ever since. He ticks off the victories on his fingers: of the four male stars of the 1998 ad campaign thus far, he says, Paulk has been caught, another outed himself and a third was discovered last summer taking part in a men-only orgy. "I have never," says Besen in a slow Florida drawl, "met a single person I believe has changed. I've met a few people who've changed their behaviour - but not their orientation. The founder of every single ex-gay ministry has failed. All of them have failed." Anything But Straight catalogues an astonishingly long list of ex-gays who became ex-ex-gays. There are counsellors caught giving nude massages to the men they are meant to be curing, and founders of ministries who fall in love and run off with each other. The stories are tragicomic, and in each the same cycle repeats: a honeymoon period of euphoria - I'm cured! - followed by the discovery that nothing has changed. But the author does not find any of it funny. The book's prosecution case builds angrily, until so much damning evidence has amassed that no serious scientific organisation could, you would think, conceivably stand up for the ex-gay movement. Why would Narth defend anything with so flawed a record? "Because," claims Besen, "the whole secular, scientific thing is a front. Dr Nicolosi is a fundamentalist Catholic, a religious fanatic disguising himself as a secular therapist. The vast majority of these therapists come from a religious background." Narth, he says, uses cod psychology to justify Christian homophobia. "Exodus International, the biggest ex-gay ministry in the world, promotes Nicolosi as a therapist to go to. He is the religious right! Narth is the religious right." In other words, sexual reorientation is nothing more than a fantasy born of Christian wishful thinking. But if that is the case, how do we account for Dr Robert Spitzer? A heterosexual atheist humanist, Spitzer undertook his study on nothing more than a hunch. At the outset, he thought it highly unlikely that anyone could change their sexual orientation. Yet he came to the conclusion that homosexuality was a treatable condition. When he announced that, for certain "highly motivated" homosexuals, change "was possible", the US media went berserk. "Can gays go straight? Yes - if they really want to!" exclaimed headlines. The ex-gay movement was jubilant. Gay activists were stunned. But as details of the study emerged, their incredulity turned to anger. It had taken Spitzer more than 18 months to find just 200 or so people willing to describe themselves as successfully converted. He found his interviewees by advertising through ex-gay organisations. Almost half were recruited through ex-gay ministries, and nearly a quarter by Narth. Religion was "extremely" or "very" important to 93% of them. One in five was a mental health professional (Cohen, for example, is a high-profile reparative therapist) or director of an ex-gay ministry, and more than three-quarters had previously lobbied for sexual reorientation. These are people who get paid to say that therapy works. For many critics, this alone was enough to discredit the exercise. An article in the APA's Psychiatric News likened it to testing a drug on people recruited by the pharmaceutical company. But in addition, many of the participants appeared to have been not so much altered from gay to straight, as bisexual all along. Ten per cent of the men had never had gay sex before therapy, whereas half had already slept with a woman. Only a third of the women and half the men said that before therapy they were "extremely" bothered by homosexual feelings. How gay were they? As with most statistics, everything depends on how they are read. The percentage who were "extremely bothered" by homosexual feelings after undergoing therapy fell to zero. You could say zero was a sensational turnaround; or you might say they weren't so gay in the first place. Two New York psychologists carried out another study of reparative therapy at the same time as Spitzer, and reached the opposite conclusion. "We interviewed 182 people who tried very hard to change," Dr Ariel Shidlo told Newsweek. "The stakes were really high for them. Some really thought that if they didn't change, they would literally find themselves in hell... And they still failed." "Spitzer?" Besen says. "I just don't understand the man. I told him, if there is one thing we know about these people, it is that when they say they've changed, they haven't." He shrugs, as though worn out with disbelief. "C'mon. He had John Paulk in his study, for chrissakes." Spitzer sounds fairly worn out as well. "If I were in my 30s," he says drily, "this is not something I would advise somebody to do. It would not advance their career." He has been condemned as a bigot, and claimed as a cheerleader by the religious right. Wary of misrepresentation, he tries to clarify once again the purpose of his study, and what he believes it proved. It was very straightforward, he sighs. The received scientific wisdom was that sexual orientation never changed. He found people who said theirs had. He asked them questions designed to test their credibility, and found that for a significant number it had changed to a significant degree. "Yes, I think change is probably extremely rare, otherwise it would not have taken so long to find the participants. And, yes, the change I found was seldom from one extreme to the other. But nevertheless, there was change. And that seems to me to be a worthwhile discovery, isn't it?" No one has ever tested the efficacy of gay affirmative therapy, Spitzer points out. If clients told a researcher that it had worked for them, would we disbelieve them? No. When a homosexual says he was emotionally damaged by reparative therapy, gay activists do not doubt his word. "So," Spitzer asks, patiently and deliberately, "why assume he is lying when he says it helped?" Spitzer's argument is simple, but quite sophisticated and persuasive. Even the most limited change would disprove the assumption that change was never possible - and that would indeed be interesting. But there is a crucial flaw in all ex-gay representations, and unwittingly Spitzer exposes it in his final comment. "Some people have suggested I ought to do a follow-up study." The idea would be to see if anyone had fallen off the wagon. "But if you were doing an evaluation of the treatment of cocaine addiction, say, and someone had a relapse, you wouldn't say that the treatment was of no value, would you?" You would not. But there is a crucial distinction here, one that undermines the analogy Nicolosi and others frequently like to draw between ex-gays and addicts. A recovering alcoholic will always be an alcoholic; successful treatment can only sustain his willpower. But to suggest an ex-gay can "relapse" implies that sexual reorientation is only ever a triumph of willpower, never a conversion of authentic desire. Ultimately, everything must come down to what we mean by sexual reorientation. But when I ask Nicolosi to define success, he seems surprisingly unconcerned, as though this were a rarefied detail. "Good question," he says airily. "Would you consider success," he muses, "a man who, OK, acted out four times a week at the beginning of therapy and now acts out once a month? Somewhat. Not great. OK, not great. Not no change, but not great." Not great at all. And where is his interest in women? Nicolosi sighs. "You see, sexual reorientation, half of it is to get rid of same-sex attraction. The other half is hopefully opposite-sex attraction. Most clients just can't imagine being attracted to women. A lot of them say, I just want to stop being attracted to guys. And, hey, that is a workable treatment." But isn't attraction to women supposed to follow on automatically? "I believe that, yes. We are sexual beings. If you shut off one door, you've got to open up another door, right? The trouble is, often my clients don't believe that." Nicolosi is beginning to sound glib. It transpires that by the time many clients complete therapy, attraction to women is still only the therapist's prediction, not the client's reality. And apparently it doesn't even need to come true. "Using the general definition of cure," he continues, "the diminishment of problematic behaviour is a cure. I would consider that a successful case." We seem to have travelled a long way from the radical claims being made so confidently on stage at Love Won Out. And we are about to depart even farther. "Let's say," Nicolosi suddenly suggests, "you work with a man for six months. Let's say he acts out once a week in the beginning, but when he acts out he tortures himself, beats himself up, thinks he's a pervert. After six months in therapy, he understands why he acts out. He's still acting out once a week, but it's more like a hollow ritual. He's not as upset with himself, he's more hopeful of change in the future. Now, his behaviour is still the same. Would you consider that a success?" Would you? "Yes," Nicolosi replies, "I would consider that a success." Even the most successful ex-gay, he adds casually, is always going to have to keep an eye on himself, to make sure he "doesn't fall". But surely that is the opposite of inner change? It sounds closer to a definition of willpower. "But he has changed! He's changed in the sense that, instead of living a gay lifestyle, he has a wife that he loves emotionally and sexually, and he has three kids, and his friends are married men. Isn't that a change? That's a change. He may still get a little same-sex titillation from time to time, sure, and he'd better be realistic about that. I mean, he's setting himself up for a fall if he really believes he won't. OK?" Jake: Love that part where the ex-gay guru defines success as a gay man only acting out homosexually once a week, but at the same time having a wife and kids.Just as long as gays are like straights, you can accept gays. How do they become like straights, if they are not extremely religious, like the biased activist samples(many bi-sexual) in the study which claimed some change was possible? Perhaps my family values include accepting gay family members.Your "arguments" on this topic get weaker and weaker by the post. Nothing but overly broad definitions and very bizarre red-herrings. Indeed, it could cover vegetarian behaviour as well.Okay, obviously changed. But to state that it's integrity will be compromised has a negative connotation. It could be changed in a positive or a neutral way.And if they don't have children, is their marriage just as "good".

There are some strong general agreements on morality. For example, I am quite sure much more than 52% of Americans think public lewdness is morally wrong. I doubt if there is anything close to 6 out of 10 who think that public lewdness should not be illegal. Homosexuality itself does not cause real harm. Two men or two women having sexual intercourse out on the street would not be tolerated, anymore than it would be tolerated of a man and a woman. That's the opinion of everyone in the race?

That is something that you, and not Jake, has done. Don't take offence here, I'm not calling you racist against your own race! But he has in no way been racist just because you claim your entire race has a different values to him. I could claim whatever values I like for my own race, it doesn't mean anyone who disagrees with said imposed values are racist.

What are the sources for your assertions about Polynesian sexuality? Are you sure it's not Margaret Mead's research? And you do need to distinguish between whether a culture has certain behaviors and whether those behaviors are approved of or not. By the way, I am not a religious person either, but for the record not ALL of us non-religious folks are for gay marriage.

I did not want to touch on other religions simply because I was unclear what the beliefs were and I did not want to get pouned for making an assumption.As far as the Polynesian sexuality, no I did not read Meads research. But it is a fact that homosexuality and transgenderism exists within the culture and I guess I would have to bring something to the table to back that up, but I did not.. I am sure there is plenty on the web to read about it.I am not a religious person therefore I do not make my judgements with that as my guidline.

Galton, may I ask as to why you are opposed to gay marriage?

That is not about it changing with the Christina times. Yes homosexuality has been around for as long as mankind. It however was not changed during Christianization of the island.There are a lot of research done by reasearchers that are not Tongan and do not speak the language. They get their information from Tongans that do not speak English very well so it's based off of flawed translation and bias research. Tongans that have studied our history which is passed down to us, know that what has changed due to Christianity. Homosexuality was never accepted and still isn't by 99% of the population including gays.

But Homosexuality has been around in the Polynesian culture for a very long time and has been thought to be completly natural.Homosexuality was probably socially acceptable for most of Polynesia in precontact times... and only changed since today’s Christianised South Pacific..

THey do it becasue it's harder than forcing themselves to overcome a weakness. Serial killers, rapists, and pedophiles have the same problem. DO they choose to be that way?Religious propaganda? Do you think anything religious has no credibility? People have changed. I know of two personally. They were even gay activists. There are tens of thousands of testimonials.Why don't you believe? Is it becasue you don't want to or becasue you get your information off of anti-exgay sites?Public interest. Social and economic considerations.No I'm saying prostitutes can use the excuse that they are nymphomaniacs to "jusitfy" their behavior. I mean they didn't choose to be that way.The fact that an institutions intergrity is based upon it's stability ( the fact it doesn't change standards). Compromising its standards degrades it's integrity.No. Subjectivity is it applies to people through blind eyes. The law is definite and objective. It is no respecter of person.yeah and that's the law. I was given the right by the law to marry a non-relative, adult single woman. I wasn't given a right to marry someone who I love. Heteros just happen to choose someone to marry that falls in that category based upon love.Marriage is the considered the fundamental foundation upon which families are formed. Look it up in any family science text book.The fact that some marriages fail does mean that the family cease to exist. Accepting gays would change the definition of families and what would constitute a marriage.Marriages do protect families. protection of families continue even through divorce. The protection is there becasue of the marraige and the family structure. We receive rights of family through biology and or marriage. These rights survive through almost anything. Also there are laws that pertain to marriage made to protect and promote the interest of children and spouses. These laws are passed based upon the policy that families are an integral part of our society. We don't want to change the definition and the structure of society.The tax structure is in place becasue of marriage not the other way around. Marriage has existed before this country was formed. Marriages are in place because they are the foundation of our society, they build families. Families build communities and communities build societies.Apparently not that is why they have so many laws pertaining to the social and moral safety of the laws.Keep thnking. Laws are made to promote and protect a public interest. We have laws that are made to effect all our social, physical, emotional, economical, and moral interests. Most laws do prevent harm because they look out for all our interests. lawmakers do have biases.

I don't believe our desires or behavior should determine our rights.

Homosexuality is a behaviour? Yep, lots of people choose to be "outcasts" in society and discriminated against by people like yourself. They do it for fun.People switch? That's religious propaganda. Furthermore, even if true, it proves nothing.OK. So being unnatural is only part of your "policy consideration". What is the rest of your policy based on?You think the reason prostitution exists is due to nymphomania? Are you serious? Wow.Please give me one concrete example of how homosexual marriage destroys the integrity of marriage, as defined by the state, and as it is implemented/used by the state. I don't care about the religious sacrament of marriage here, that's for each religion or figure out on its own.What does marriage law have to do with objectivity? Isn't the the fact that marriage is currently defined as a man and woman a subjective definition?You have the right to marry who you choose to marry, homosexuals do not have that right. You just got lucky at birth and your right is recognized under current laws.I asked you what the purpose of marriage is, you responded with this.B.S.Don't tell me marriage is to create/protect families, if that were the case, marriages couldn't be undone by the stroke of a pen. That's a farce, and furthermore, it could just as easily be applied to any homosexual couple.Let me narrow it down further. What is the purpose of marriage laws as defined by the state? Are they in place to protect religious sanctity and morality, or are they in place to define the legal union of two people for the purposes of asset sharing and tax structure? Marriage is simply contract law in the eyes of the state, any moral or social issues are irrelevent. It's all about money.I always thought laws were based upon the desire to prevent actions that were harmful to individuals or society as a whole, not on what the lawmaker's likes and dislikes (prejudices) were.How are your rights affected, let alone impeded, by gay marriage?Waxy

In what possible way can being attracted to someone that most others of your sex aren't ever be considered a weakenss?When they are trying to use flawed science as an excuse to justify religious prejudice, then yes.Personally, I do believe it is possible. I also see it as irrelivant. Just because some people who used to like something change their minds, how does this possibly justify banning it for the rest?How is it in the public intrest?Economic considerations? Such as what?

Guys, I think we are all beginning to loose the big picture here. OK so the homosexual issue is a problem, but I think the real menace is even more insidious.Brittany Spears.Personally I think listening to Brittany Spears should be made illegal. And I have very good and unrefutable reasons.Firstly it degrades the music industry. The music industry is a fine, unblemished institution but Brittany Spears rejects all of it's values. It should not be allowed to preserve the integrity of our splendid industry.Secondly it is not natural. I see no sign as to anything in nature that listens to Brittany Spears.It is against God, after all Joshua 6:18 says "And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it". This is obviously a prophesy about Brittany Spears.Please note I am not against the belief that Brittany Spears is good. We can't regulate belief now people, that would just be silly. But we can and must regulate behaviour.Therefore it should only be people who actively listen to her records who will be arrested.These people choose to be Brittany Spears fans, it is not inherent. I personally know several people who used to like her, but have managed to repress this disgusting tendency and now lead normal lives. They have now fought the urge to put on 'Oops I did it again' down to only once a week or so, and have successfully ignored their terrible weakness.There is also strong evidence from the respected, impartial and objective group 'The Campaign For the Death of Brittany Spears and Mutilation of Her Body' that liking Brittany Spears is actually a psychological disorder and all who are afflicted by this terrible problem should be immediately institutionalised. And some of them have even been to university, so no doubt they know what they are talking about.I advocate the same rights for all. I am not allowed to listen to Brittany Spears, neither is a Brittany Spears fan. Same rights.It is in the public interest. I have seen a poll that said 51% of people didn't like Brittany Spears too much. That means that practically everyone must want her outlawed.

I only have limited time to debate, so I have to pick my battles, so I'll pass on this one. I will make one point here. Heterosexual marriage is one of the most universal of all human institutions, found in almost all cultures ever existing. With a precedent like that, the question isn't, "Why Mr. Galton are you opposed to gay marriage?" The question is how do you justify revolutionizing that ancient institution? To me, heterosexual marriage is the Parthenon: ancient, beautiful, crumbling some of late, but it would be a tragedy to knock it down, clear it out, and put in a new building. You prove to me why that new building is so gotdamn necessary.

Galton, may I ask as to why you are opposed to gay marriage?

Homosexuality is not a weakness, not a problem. Much unlike it is with the homophobic religious right, who are too weak to think for themselves, and must claim God told them to be against gays.They do it for the money, not because they are nymphomaniacs.This is a circular argument that states marriage has always been heterosexual, end of debate. Also heterosexuals may not just marry for love, but also for lust or money. Family structures have already changed, to include a variety of family types. Allowing two people of the same sex to marry, will change marriage, obviously. However, this does not mean it will have a negative effect. Same-sex couples will be supporting the marriage institution by entering into it, and it will be good for their own families.This isn't a compelling argument to deny something to others, who have different desires or behaviour, than you happen to have.

It is circular to say marriage has simply always been heterosexual, end of debate. No one is talking about knocking down marriage. Gay families want to enter into it, because they want their families strengthened and protected as heterosexual families have been strenghtened and protected. Gay families want into the institution because they want to be a positive influence on it, to support it and to shore it up, not because they desire to harm it. They are fighting to get into it, as some heterosexuals can't wait to get out of it. I can't see if it would make such a dramatic change just because the couple are the same sex. Also marriage in the U.S. and Canada falls under common-law. This is a "living law" meant to evolve with society, with much room for interpretation by judges.

Unless we were to come to a conscensus on the "cause" of homosexuality, any further discussion on this is pointless.I think equating homosexuals with serial killers, rapists, and pedophiles is disgusting, and shows your true feelings on the subject. If one was not at least a little bit homophobic, one wouldn't use this line or reasoning, they'd see it for what it was.Interesting, you know two reformed homosexuals. You must have a significant amount of interaction with the gay community then, based on a purely statistical viewpoint, which given your beliefs, I find hard to believe. Either that, or you must be a very rare person. I don't dismiss anything and everything "religious", however, anything with a religious source will obviously have a religious bias, just as any pro-gay website will. I base my belief on the fact I believe homosexuality is in fact a genetic condition, not a learned one. You can't undo your genes, but you can choose to live in denial.Public interest. Interesting. Care to expand?Social considerations is somewhat valid. There will no doubt be some repercussions and a resulting adjustment of social attitudes. I fail to see how that's necessarily negative, or how any negative outweighs the potential positives, not only for the gay community, but for communities everywhere. I fail to see how two people forming a strong bond, legally recognized, and becoming active members of a community, is negative. A family does not have to have children to be a strong and positive influence on a community or society.Economic considerations such as what, tax benefits? Tax cuts lead to a stronger economy right?Have you ever, in your entire life, read, heard, or seen on TV a prostitute say they became a prostitute because they're a nymphomaniac? That's absurd. I'm having trouble reconciling that you actually believe that's the cause, or even A cause of prostitution. If so, it's an incredibly naieve belief.Is it? Or is it also based on its ability to adapt and remain relevent? Is Harvard law school revered because its classes and curriculum are unchanged since it's founding, or is it revered because it takes that foundation and combines it with modern thought and relevence?Was the government of the USA, or democracy in general, degraded by allowing minorities and women to vote, or has it become even more relevent and viable?How does subjectivity equal blind eyes? I realize you're the lawyer, but I don't believe for a minute that the law, as it was conceived and written, was purely objective. I realize that's the ideal, and I'd like to think it's application is objective, but even then, I can't agree to consistent objective application.Does a family equal children? Can a family equal two people and their pets? How about two people, their pets, and all of their immediate and extended family? How does a couple being barren, or incapable of having children make them less of a family? Should heterosexuals incapable of reproduction be prohibited from marrying?How does current marriage law protect families post divorce other than in monetary ways - ie division of property, child support, alimony, etc... Visitation rights does come to mind, but that's a whole new thread.Again, does a marriage have to equal children to be valid? I'm also very unclear on what laws you're referring to that "protect and promote the interest of children and spouses".Correction - YOU don't want to change it.Chicken and egg, circular logic.Again, family = children?So their writing was subjectively based on the religion of those that wrote them? Interesting.I posted this - "I always thought laws were based upon the desire to prevent actions that were harmful to individuals or society as a whole"The above quote is your smart *** response. How is preventing harm to individuals/society different than promoting/protecting the public interest? If you gave me one or two concrete examples, not broad speculations, of how allowing gay marriage would be harmful to society, I'd be forced to consider the ban as being reasonable.It doesn't directly affect you or your rights, you just stated that, but your belief that it might have a negative affect on the "institution of marriage" is sufficient for you to deny someone else happiness and equality. IMHO, that's sad.Then what do you believe should determine our rights?I think it's just about time we put this one to bed. It's getting more and more circular and we aren't getting anywhere, not that I expected we would.Overall, your responses are becoming more and more vague and evasive, I ask you for concrete examples or definitions and you supply/rehash broad generalizations or speculation. Quite frankly, I'm finding this very frustrating, all I ask for is some straight answers. As a law student, I would assume you would be able to supply this to my rather pointed questions on the law. If we can't get into some details, and you aren't willing to put your personal beliefs on the table, then what's the point?Waxy

You're gonna have to explain your circularity argument for us slow folks. And you're gonna have to back up your statement that gays as a group are really in their hearts conservatives, with a love of traditional institutions like marriage. I strongly suspect that you have some homosexuals who want the right to marriage for romantic reasons, some who want it for economic/legal privilege reasons, but also very many who want it so as to affirm that homosexuality is just as good as heterosexuality. It's the idea of we're just as good as you are, so we must be able to have everything you can have. For many, I suspect it is not a desire to adopt a more conservative lifestyle, but to make a point, and move the culture toward greater acceptance. This is a risky gamble to shove this down peoples' throats as it may cause a backlash instead of greater legitimization of the lifestyle.Oh and you've got to be kidding me that gay marriage doesn't revolutionize marriage.

Takes us back to where we started, assumes it absolutely must be and cannot be different or change.Sure, there are many who want acceptance from society, parents, friends, and that is a big reason why they marry, for gays or straights. If gays want their marriages to compete with heterosexual marriages, to prove gay marriages can be more successful, wouldn't that be good for the institution? The old fashioned backlash argument is not a reason to not do something, and frankly is a little tired and worn-out in 2004. Gays are just as good as you are. Is there a problem with gays believing and acting like they are just as good? We don't have the strong sense of different gender roles we once had, so why is it such a revolutionary change? I can't see that it has revolutionized the societies where it is in effect. It could have represented the next step in a very gradual continuation of acceptance that had been going on for a long time.

I am not arguing that heterosexual marriage must be as it has been or cannot be different. I am arguing that that revolutionizing such an important, ancient institution requires some heavy justification. People who have no respect for the past may not find my point compelling; people who look to the past with deep respect and see in it old wisdom will find it compelling. I for one do not want to revolutionize an ancient institution I have great respect for, in order so the gay community can prove something. Tired argument?! My god, how long have we been debating gay marriage? Only four or five years ago in grad school, we were discussing how difficult it would be to see more and more rights to be extended to cohabiting gays couples, and we talked a little bit about gay civil unions. Marriage wasn't even on the damn table!Homosexuality is an eccentricity; in my mind it is not equal in value to heterosexuality. This is not an issue of how gays believe and act; it is an issue of whether we are going to enshrine homosexual marriage as we do with heterosexual marriage. Gender, sexuality, and family organization are absolutely fundamental aspects of society--always have been, always will be.

By the way, the person who posted the issue of "BAN gay marriage?" is engaging in mischief, making it sound like gay marriage has always been around and legitimate; only now do the Big Bad Christians want to come along and BAN something that has always been around and accepted.

Yes, the hetero-only definition of marriage has been around a long time. However, simply because something is traditional does not make it just. Well that's how you see it because of your contempt for the gay community. You see it as "them" trying to step out of their lower place, or prove they are not lower than you and equal in value. Your last comment I've dealt with in this post, demonstrates that very well. Yes, the backlash threat is tired and boring. No one is listening anymore.Well, I remember people talking about marriage for gays and lesbians and their rights for much longer.Well, that says it all about where you are coming from. You believe homosexuals are human beings of lesser value.

Only four or five years ago in grad school, we were discussing how difficult it would be to see more and more rights to be extended to cohabiting gays couples, and we talked a little bit about gay civil unions. Marriage wasn't even on the damn table!Homosexuality is an eccentricity; in my mind it is not equal in value to heterosexuality. This is not an issue of how gays believe and act; it is an issue of whether we are going to enshrine homosexual marriage as we do with heterosexual marriage. Gender, sexuality, and family organization are absolutely fundamental aspects of society--always have been, always will be.

I believe homosexual behavior is an eccentricity and not equal in value to heterosexuality. I was not referring to the value of persons; I think homosexuals have as much intrinsic value as anyone else. I have contempt for no one. Your attempt to paint people who disagree with you as haters is unfair and a cheap debate tactic.

Yes, the hetero-only definition of marriage has been around a long time. However, simply because something is traditional does not make it just. Well that's how you see it because of your contempt for the gay community. You see it as "them" trying to step out of their lower place, or prove they are not lower than you and equal in value. Your last comment I've dealt with in this post, demonstrates that very well. Yes, the backlash threat is tired and boring. No one is listening anymore.Well, I remember people talking about marriage for gays and lesbians and their rights for much longer.Well, that says it all about where you are coming from. You believe homosexuals are human beings of lesser value.

Homosexuals are persons who have homosexual behaviour.

Yes, there is also homosexual orientation, which is part of the person's homosexual identity, and part of the person's homosexuality. The orientation leads to the behaviour.

Would you care to explain to me how homosexual behavior is inferior to heterosexual behavior? Homosexual couples are capable of loving each other unconditionally with their entire hearts and souls, they are capable of loving each other mor than they could love anyone else, just as much as heterosexuals can. There are only three differences. Physical appearence, gender roles, and ability to reproduce.Physical appearence should never be something to use when deciding if someone should love another person, as love should be based on the personalities and souls of those getting married. Is physical appearence what you think defines love? I hope not.Gender roles are decreasing more and more as times go by, and they soon will not exist, so why does it matter if sometimes a lesbian does the 'traditionally male' things in the family? Anyway, there really aren't 'traditionally male' roles anymore that aren't broken without shocking anyone, except for the role of having sex with women.Now onto ability to reproduce. Why, exactly, can that be considered a good thing? Millions of acres of natural rainforests are cut down every to make room for the growing human population. In China laws had to be made regulating reproduction, because it became so crowded that if they didn't there would be no way for them to survive. There wouldn't be enough food in the country, or, most likely, the surrounding countries, to feed them. Some high schools have three thousand students. The hallways are so over packed that there is no space between one student and the ones surrounding them, between bells if you go into the hallways you will find that until the bell rings again, there will most likely not be one instant where you are not in physical contact with another person. Millions of people starve to death every day, because there is not enough food in the world to feed the number of people in it. Tell me, why is adding to this problen a good thing?However, I understand that homosexuality is not superior to heterosexuality, because if heterosexuals feel the same way as I feel about my girlfriend, most likely stronger as we haven't been going out very long, that is a truely great thing. That is something that should never be taken away from them, they just need to use birth control a little more often, and really everyone should restrain from sex anyway unil they know they are with the one they love to avoid the spread of STDs. If people did this, that would also lower the population, and heterosexual couples could have sex as often as they liked, as soon as they were sure that their relationship would be forever. Also, the acceptance of gays would decrease the number of children born from gay parents in denial, thus also decreasing the population and therefore the amount of food consumed so that the children of heterosexual parents could be better fed.

Should senior citizens be allowed to marry? How about Hedir Antonio de Brito, of Brazil, a paraplegic from age 15. He wanted to marry a woman named Mara, but, the local bishop denied their application. According to the Vatican's Canonic Law 1084, a man must be able to copulate in order to be married. Most people wouldn't understand why an impotent man would want to be married, nor would they understand why anyone would want to be married to an impotent man. Their love is surely eccentric behaviour and goes against established doctrine.

I would see it as far more normal for two men to fall in love and want to be married than a woman and a paraplegic man- the latter wil hardly be an equal union.

I can't remember where I said it, but I claimed divorce for same-sex couples was not possible in Canada until the divorce law was changed. I was incorrect. Divorce is possible for same-sex couples. I am not aware of any divorces that have happened as of yet involving same-sex couples in Canada.

I don't feel gay people deserve any special rights, just the same rights as everyone else. As for gay marriages, I'm against them.Marriages were ,and are, meant to be between a man and woman.

The problem is, everyone else can get married. Straight couples can get hiring quotas, housing preference, tax exeptions, and a peice of paper to wave at everyone declaring their love for each other. The problem is that just because they love each other doesn't mean that they can feel like their relationship's permanant. They may believe in no sex until marriage, but unless they marry someone they don't love (which in and unto itself weakens the meaning of marriage), they can't ever have sex without breaking their morals. Another problem is that their relationship doesn't feel as real to them, as they are called girlfriends or boyfriends, it just sounds the same as if they weren't a committed couple. Thirdly, if gay relationships are treated as just as good as straight, more people who may not be looking for marriage, that are just afraid of admitting that they're gay will be willing to come out, thus keeping them from going into a marriage that they cannot enjoy, and eventually have to get a divorce or simply suffer never being able to have a relationship that satisfies them.

The answer to that depends on hw much you know about genetics- there is no homosexual gene, it is very unlikley to have a gene for anything. However there is very likely to be a genetic component which increases the chance of a person being gay depending on the environment they are brought up in. Very little in genetics is actually as cut and dry as 'this gene does this', mostly it is 'this gene makes this quite likely to happen assuming the environment is right and this, this and this gene are doing, unless these genes are doing that. Mostly.'Better question is 'Do you beleive there is no genetic component of homosexuality?'.

When I refer to weakness I'm referring to struggling with anything that would compromise what is acceptable or the norm.Just as can being attracted to children or other things that most others of your sex aren't ever can be considered a weaknessAm I using flawed science? Do you think this is religous bias? I'm not religiously prejudice. There are many things that I don't agree wiht in the world. It does not mean I'm prejudice (if you're referring to discriminatory).That doesn't justify it.That isn't my argument about justifying it. It goes to the heart that it's behavior and change is possible.Public interest is "health, safety, and moral welfare". Marriage is a public interest. So is the moral welfare.Economic considerations are economic impact a certain law will have. This really isn't an issue with gay marriages.

In what possible way can being attracted to someone that most others of your sex aren't ever be considered a weakenss?When they are trying to use flawed science as an excuse to justify religious prejudice, then yes.Personally, I do believe it is possible. I also see it as irrelivant. Just because some people who used to like something change their minds, how does this possibly justify banning it for the rest?How is it in the public intrest?Economic considerations? Such as what?

Good thinking phunting. I actually think Britney's music is whacked. The analogy is very different in many aspects.First comparing behavior.Choice of music is different than choice to listen or not to listen to music.We are not saying who to listen to that is your choice. We are saying that it's either you listen to music and we will not infringe on the right to listen to music but we will stop you if you want the radio station to play all the music backwards as well. That the music can be forward but it need to be backwards because we find that much more appealing and we want everyone to have it on the radio as well because we want it.

Guys, I think we are all beginning to loose the big picture here. OK so the homosexual issue is a problem, but I think the real menace is even more insidious.Brittany Spears.Personally I think listening to Brittany Spears should be made illegal. And I have very good and unrefutable reasons.Firstly it degrades the music industry. The music industry is a fine, unblemished institution but Brittany Spears rejects all of it's values. It should not be allowed to preserve the integrity of our splendid industry.Secondly it is not natural. I see no sign as to anything in nature that listens to Brittany Spears.It is against God, after all Joshua 6:18 says "And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it". This is obviously a prophesy about Brittany Spears.Please note I am not against the belief that Brittany Spears is good. We can't regulate belief now people, that would just be silly. But we can and must regulate behaviour.Therefore it should only be people who actively listen to her records who will be arrested.These people choose to be Brittany Spears fans, it is not inherent. I personally know several people who used to like her, but have managed to repress this disgusting tendency and now lead normal lives. They have now fought the urge to put on 'Oops I did it again' down to only once a week or so, and have successfully ignored their terrible weakness.There is also strong evidence from the respected, impartial and objective group 'The Campaign For the Death of Brittany Spears and Mutilation of Her Body' that liking Brittany Spears is actually a psychological disorder and all who are afflicted by this terrible problem should be immediately institutionalised. And some of them have even been to university, so no doubt they know what they are talking about.I advocate the same rights for all. I am not allowed to listen to Brittany Spears, neither is a Brittany Spears fan. Same rights.It is in the public interest. I have seen a poll that said 51% of people didn't like Brittany Spears too much. That means that practically everyone must want her outlawed.

Well then it's pointless unless you agree it's not genetic.I never equated gays to serial killers or anything else. I was saying that when people have urges that aren't "acceptable" or in the norm that they should practice some self control that we expect people wiht other disorders to behave. Waht standard can we make that would make gays to not refrain from their urges but for every other disorder to refrain from theirs? THanks anyways for jumping on the homophobic bandwagon.I have various relatives taht are gay. I also have one uncle and an girl I dated that are both ex-gays (although I still wished the girl would experiment wiht other women in front of me or at least include me in the action..just playing)My sister and a few girls I dated are flight attendants. Most male flight attendants it seems are gay. So they have had various gay roommates. So I've gotten to know my share. We can kick it and they know I'm down wiht them DESPITE the fact that they are gay. They know how I feel and so do my relatives. So any agnostic or atheist source doesn't have a bias? There is fact from non-religious sites that support that it is not genetic. THere is also nothing "DEFINITIVE" to suggest that it is genetic just mere hypothesies and speculation.Public interest is defined as the "safety, health, and moral welfare".Public interest, social and economic considerations are what lawmakers consider when making laws. They pass laws that incorporate at least one of these considerations.Families do not have to have children to be a family. I feel that a family is a result of a marriage or shared ancestry or descendants.WAxy you're missing the point. I was focusing and ilustrating how people can use their disorders (such as homosexuality) to justify theri behavior. Sorry I'll be more specific.Curriculum doesn't equal standards. Standards can remain high while curriculum changes.It wasn't really a democracy when it depends on the will of the people and yet the will of the people was disenfranchised.The law is written based upon the person and their intent. Marriage laws were not based upon feelings. They don't make people prove that they are in love. So there is no law that gives the right to marry based upon love. It merely gives the right based upon current marital status, blood relation, and age.Families don't have to have children. i defined it above. If a marriage happens it's a family (husband and wife). The minimum is shared genetic ancestry or descendants or marriage. Majority don't want to consider two husbands a family.Current marriage laws give standing to anyone invovled or part of a marriage. Any person is allowed rights of children in hospitals if they were part of a marriage , even step children. Even after divorce they still can claim that privledge.Correction - MOST people don't want to change itIt's quite clear marriage was first. FAmilies don't have to have children.I pointed out biases. Do republicans and democrats have biases? Do they pass laws based upon those biases?It would change the definition of a family. It also would degrade the institution by lessing the standard to be a part of it.AGain they have equality. The happiness argument is so subjective. Imagine if we had to accommodate everyone's desires to make them happy. I'm based my argument on the public interest.Why do you need my personl beliefs? How would that bolster my argument? I'll tell you anything you want.I don't believe homosexuality is genetic. In fact I know it's not.I believe that marriage is sacred and that people do revere it as it should be. Allowing gays into this institution would further reduce it's sacredness.Anything else you want ask for it and I'll tell you. I just don't want to you my eprsonal beliefs as arguments. Logic is better.

Unless we were to come to a conscensus on the "cause" of homosexuality, any further discussion on this is pointless.I think equating homosexuals with serial killers, rapists, and pedophiles is disgusting, and shows your true feelings on the subject. If one was not at least a little bit homophobic, one wouldn't use this line or reasoning, they'd see it for what it was.Interesting, you know two reformed homosexuals. You must have a significant amount of interaction with the gay community then, based on a purely statistical viewpoint, which given your beliefs, I find hard to believe. Either that, or you must be a very rare person. I don't dismiss anything and everything "religious", however, anything with a religious source will obviously have a religious bias, just as any pro-gay website will. I base my belief on the fact I believe homosexuality is in fact a genetic condition, not a learned one. You can't undo your genes, but you can choose to live in denial.Public interest. Interesting. Care to expand?Social considerations is somewhat valid. There will no doubt be some repercussions and a resulting adjustment of social attitudes. I fail to see how that's necessarily negative, or how any negative outweighs the potential positives, not only for the gay community, but for communities everywhere. I fail to see how two people forming a strong bond, legally recognized, and becoming active members of a community, is negative. A family does not have to have children to be a strong and positive influence on a community or society.Economic considerations such as what, tax benefits? Tax cuts lead to a stronger economy right?Have you ever, in your entire life, read, heard, or seen on TV a prostitute say they became a prostitute because they're a nymphomaniac? That's absurd. I'm having trouble reconciling that you actually believe that's the cause, or even A cause of prostitution. If so, it's an incredibly naieve belief.Is it? Or is it also based on its ability to adapt and remain relevent? Is Harvard law school revered because its classes and curriculum are unchanged since it's founding, or is it revered because it takes that foundation and combines it with modern thought and relevence?Was the government of the USA, or democracy in general, degraded by allowing minorities and women to vote, or has it become even more relevent and viable?How does subjectivity equal blind eyes? I realize you're the lawyer, but I don't believe for a minute that the law, as it was conceived and written, was purely objective. I realize that's the ideal, and I'd like to think it's application is objective, but even then, I can't agree to consistent objective application.Does a family equal children? Can a family equal two people and their pets? How about two people, their pets, and all of their immediate and extended family? How does a couple being barren, or incapable of having children make them less of a family? Should heterosexuals incapable of reproduction be prohibited from marrying?How does current marriage law protect families post divorce other than in monetary ways - ie division of property, child support, alimony, etc... Visitation rights does come to mind, but that's a whole new thread.Again, does a marriage have to equal children to be valid? I'm also very unclear on what laws you're referring to that "protect and promote the interest of children and spouses".Correction - YOU don't want to change it.Chicken and egg, circular logic.Again, family = children?So their writing was subjectively based on the religion of those that wrote them? Interesting.I posted this - "I always thought laws were based upon the desire to prevent actions that were harmful to individuals or society as a whole"The above quote is your smart *** response. How is preventing harm to individuals/society different than promoting/protecting the public interest? If you gave me one or two concrete examples, not broad speculations, of how allowing gay marriage would be harmful to society, I'd be forced to consider the ban as being reasonable.It doesn't directly affect you or your rights, you just stated that, but your belief that it might have a negative affect on the "institution of marriage" is sufficient for you to deny someone else happiness and equality. IMHO, that's sad.Then what do you believe should determine our rights?I think it's just about time we put this one to bed. It's getting more and more circular and we aren't getting anywhere, not that I expected we would.Overall, your responses are becoming more and more vague and evasive, I ask you for concrete examples or definitions and you supply/rehash broad generalizations or speculation. Quite frankly, I'm finding this very frustrating, all I ask for is some straight answers. As a law student, I would assume you would be able to supply this to my rather pointed questions on the law. If we can't get into some details, and you aren't willing to put your personal beliefs on the table, then what's the point?Waxy

Then this is pointless. IMHO, a genetic component is undeniable.The standard of one urges being harmful to others. Again, the correlation is disgusting IMHO. I call them as I see them.Sounds like George Costanza listing all his "black friends". How tolerant you are to be able to "kick it" with them DESPITE their homosexuality. emoticonXRolleyes I find it hard to believe that you could have this level of personal contact with people, and still not have any consideration for them, or their rights.So then, IN THEORY, a married gay couple would constitute a family by your definition.I missed your point because you don't have one. Please do.So according to that line of reasoning, the defintion of marriage, ie the "curriculum", could change, but since the "students" are being held to the same standards, where's the degradation? I see none.Agreed, the state could care less about love as far as marriage is concerned. Then why the man/woman designation? .See above. By your definition, two husbands IS a family.Help paying hospital bills? That's it? A standing I don't quite understand.I guess it depends which way the winds blowing on polling day.I don't think it's clear at all. Marriage is a social construct, it's not required for the conception/birth of children, and it's not required for the raising of children.That was my point mana'ia, all laws are subjectively based on the beliefs/biases of those that write them.You don't "know" anything about genetic vs. environment, you have an opinion. No one "knows", and anyone that claims to loses credibility. Especially without walking a mile in those shoes.IMHO, the public interest is served by allowing people the freedom to be happy, as long as that freedom does not come at the expense of harm to others.You have yet to give me any specific examples of this harm, despite my REPEATED requests for it. All I get from you is broad generalities. "Reduced sacredness", "degraded institution", "lessening standards" etc... are meaningless terms. Substantiate them.I'm asking for your personal beliefs because I'm trying to get some specifics out of you. It may or may not bolster your argument, but your personal beliefs are the basis that your logic is wrapped around. Waxy

How does homosexual marriage endanger public health? How is it detrimental to safety and moral welfare? There is no concrete evidence that this would happen.Homosexuality is not a disorder! There are genetic components involved in making one homosexual. Your statement that "you know" that homosexuality is purely behavioral is completely unbased and as a result, meaningless.But how does it degrade it? And what's so bad about changing the definition of a family? What does it matter to you? I'm always hearing that marriage would "degrade the institution". HOW?!?!?!?!? emoticonXKill That excuse is so tired and overused that I just want to go and hurl whenever I hear it.How do you know that?

Well then it's pointless unless you agree it's not genetic.I never equated gays to serial killers or anything else. I was saying that when people have urges that aren't "acceptable" or in the norm that they should practice some self control that we expect people wiht other disorders to behave. Waht standard can we make that would make gays to not refrain from their urges but for every other disorder to refrain from theirs? THanks anyways for jumping on the homophobic bandwagon.I have various relatives taht are gay. I also have one uncle and an girl I dated that are both ex-gays (although I still wished the girl would experiment wiht other women in front of me or at least include me in the action..just playing)My sister and a few girls I dated are flight attendants. Most male flight attendants it seems are gay. So they have had various gay roommates. So I've gotten to know my share. We can kick it and they know I'm down wiht them DESPITE the fact that they are gay. They know how I feel and so do my relatives. So any agnostic or atheist source doesn't have a bias? There is fact from non-religious sites that support that it is not genetic. THere is also nothing "DEFINITIVE" to suggest that it is genetic just mere hypothesies and speculation.Public interest is defined as the "safety, health, and moral welfare".Public interest, social and economic considerations are what lawmakers consider when making laws. They pass laws that incorporate at least one of these considerations.Families do not have to have children to be a family. I feel that a family is a result of a marriage or shared ancestry or descendants.WAxy you're missing the point. I was focusing and ilustrating how people can use their disorders (such as homosexuality) to justify theri behavior. Sorry I'll be more specific.Curriculum doesn't equal standards. Standards can remain high while curriculum changes.It wasn't really a democracy when it depends on the will of the people and yet the will of the people was disenfranchised.The law is written based upon the person and their intent.

I guess it is. I think there may be for SOME a genetic component that makes them more susceptible to being gay. They still control their destiny.The standard of one urges being the determining factor of what they should or should not do is what is not right.Keep thinking. I associate with them and still don't agree with their lifestyle is not hard to believe. I ahve an uncle tha helped raise me and he is an alcoholic. I'm so against alcoholism because of his alcoholism. It keeps him from fulfilling his potential.Anyways keep thinking though. I had all black roommates in college and I still don't like their "black" culture promotes promiscuity and vulgarity.Yeah if they were married. That's the whole reason we don't want them to marry because it would redefine a family and marraige.Read it again. If people can use a disorder such as homosexuality to justify changing the laws then why can't prostitutes "claim" to have a disorder such as nymphomania to justify their behavior. I'm not saying that they do but they could "claim: they did and therefore a right to love their job.The curriculum could change but the standard of the students to be high school graduates or in marriage case marry opposite gender would not change.

Those are soem of the best reasons but not the only reasons. There is harm when the institution is injured. You say there general but the fact is that it's specific to the institution and I pointed it out how.My belief is homosexuality is behavior and should not be granted any special consideration. It is not equal to race, gender, physical ability, or religion.Personally I think homosexuality is wrong in every way.
attacks
Then this is pointless. IMHO, a genetic component is undeniable.The standard of one urges being harmful to others. Again, the correlation is disgusting IMHO. I call them as I see them.Sounds like George Costanza listing all his "black friends". How tolerant you are to be able to "kick it" with them DESPITE their homosexuality. emoticonXRolleyes I find it hard to believe that you could have this level of personal contact with people, and still not have any consideration for them, or their rights.So then, IN THEORY, a married gay couple would constitute a family by your definition.I missed your point because you don't have one. Please do.So according to that line of reasoning, the defintion of marriage, ie the "curriculum", could change, but since the "students" are being held to the same standards, where's the degradation? I see none.Agreed, the state could care less about love as far as marriage is concerned. Then why the man/woman designation? .See above. By your definition, two husbands IS a family.Help paying hospital bills? That's it? A standing I don't quite understand.I guess it depends which way the winds blowing on polling day.I don't think it's clear at all. Marriage is a social construct, it's not required for the conception/birth of children, and it's not required for the raising of children.That was my point mana'ia, all laws are subjectively based on the beliefs/biases of those that write them.You don't "know" anything about genetic vs. environment, you have an opinion. No one "knows", and anyone that claims to loses credibility. Especially without walking a mile in those shoes.IMHO, the public interest is served by allowing people the freedom to be happy, as long as that freedom does not come at the expense of harm to others.You have yet to give me any specific examples of this harm, despite my REPEATED requests for it. All I get from you is broad generalities. "Reduced sacredness", "degraded institution", "lessening standards" etc... are meaningless terms. Substantiate them.I'm asking for your personal beliefs because I'm trying to get some specifics out of you. It may or may not bolster your argument, but your personal beliefs are the basis that your logic is wrapped around. Waxy

Destiny? How do gays control their destiny? Do you mean they should never act on their feelings, because you say so? Doesn't that put you in charge of their destiny, if they let you? Not following you. Unless you meant to write "one's urges"? If so, all sex is based on urges. But that is not the only factor to determine if it is right. Waxy was arguing that harm is a big factor. Being gay isn't an addiction like alcoholism.Well, one could claim that of any culture.If that's the whole reason, it's not a compelling reason.You are using a vague, overly-broad definition of disorder I believe, to apply to anything the majority do not do. Buddhists atheists and vegetarians and Latter Day Saints, and political revolutionaries could fit into this definition, and yes so could prostitution. It would still protect heterosexuality if gays were allowed to marry.And--?That's not empirical evidence. My anecdotal evidence tells me these people who claimed to change are closet cases. They don't tell you or anyone else about their same-sex activity. Even if you can change behaviour, that does not change orientation. It's just by sheer willpower in that case.But how would the institution be injured by marriages for same-sex couples, is what a few people are trying to ask you?It's equal consideration not special consideration. Religious practice could certainly be classified as behaviour. That assertion of your own personal prejudice is not an argument.

Mana'ia, have you ever thought about what it must be like to be a homosexual in today's society? All of the harmful stereotypes, the negativity exhibited by the religious right towards them, the trauma of coming out... Do you actually think that people CHOOSE to put themselves through that? The anguish that you are letting down your family, that you will always be known as 'different' and 'funny'... I cannot bring myself to believe that any sound person would put themselves through all of that. My gay friends who I know well have told me about all of their pain and confusion. If anything, that proved to me more than anything that homosexuality is not a choice. My best friend is a lesbian, and everday she'd ask me, "Why?" Her parents dislike her now because she decided to be gay. She has endured so much pain and trauma for something that she could not help. And what really gets my goat is the fact that people still make it their business to make these people's lives even harder, in that they seek to prevent them from marrying the people that they love, the people with whom they have found their acceptance. Ask yourself, Who am I to tell these people that they are not allowed to marry the person that they love? For what reasons am I preventing their being together? And what harm would it do to me/others if they do marry?

Yes,1) It's against Gods Law-an Abomination.2) God loves the gay people but hates the Sin- there is help- I can get any gay person in contact with someone who used to be gay and has been set free and he will be willing to help, just let me know and i will get his websight to you and his phone number if you like. 3) Jesus loves you and you still have a chance to have questions answered that no one in the secular world can answer.

What about the other laws of God? Here is an article which has been posted a lot on the internet...Open Letter To 'Dr.' LauraLaura Schlessinger is a US radio personality who dispenses sex advice to people who call in to her radio show. Recently, she said that, as an observant Orthodox Jew, homosexuality is an abomination according to Leviticus 18:22 and cannot be condoned in any circumstance. The following is an open letter to 'Dr.' Laura penned by a US resident, which was posted on the Internet:Dear Dr. Laura:Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's Law. I have learned a great deal from your radio show, and I try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind them that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination. End of debate.I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of the specific Bible laws and how to follow them. a) When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord (Lev. 1:9). The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them? b) I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her? She's 18 and starting University. Will the slave buyer continue to pay for her education by law? c) I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanliness (Lev. 15:19-24). The problem is, how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense. I'm sure you have found a way to do this and can share it with me.d) Lev. 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify? Why can't I own Canadians?e) I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself, or should this be a neighborhood improvement project?f) A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination (Lev. 11:10), it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree. Can you settle this?g) Lev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here? Would contact lenses help?h) Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev.19:27. How should they die?i) I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear hemp gloves?j) My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev. 19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? (Lev.24:10-16) Couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family affair like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev. 20:14)I know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident you can help.

Jake good try at manipulating scriptures. Jesus is all about family values. The point of thsoe scriptures is that His gospel is above everything else. The only thing that comes before family is GOD. He loves families but won't let a family bring someone down. The US rescues kids from bad homes too because to be in an enviroment that is detrimental serves no one.

Weak, weak, weak arguments, mana'ia. How can I be sure it is the inerrant word of God if there are so many contradictions, and which translation is the correct one, telling the real tales? Science doesn't claim to be inerrant, or unchanging, directly from a perfect higher power. Right. Well, I was responding to someone who called homosexuality an abomination.No, it works if they only act out gay once a week, according to one of the ex-gay gurus in the Guardian article I posted a while back in this thread, lol.No proof anyone ever went from gay orientation to straight orientation.Yes.

I agree with emoreno2292, for the government, this is a strictly legal matter about the legal protection provided by marriage. The fact that the word marriage comes from religious context is inconsequential in the government's decision to allow "marriage", for lack of a better word, between same sex couples. If you believe strongly against this kind of union, ok, but don't mix your religious or moral beliefs with the constitution or the law.

Yes,1) It's against Gods Law-an Abomination.2) God loves the gay people but hates the Sin- there is help- I can get any gay person in contact with someone who used to be gay and has been set free and he will be willing to help, just let me know and i will get his websight to you and his phone number if you like. 3) Jesus loves you and you still have a chance to have questions answered that no one in the secular world can answer.

I wasn't manipulating anything, I quoted the literal scriptures.Yes, and I pointed out exactly what kind of family values.That's true of one of the verses I quoted:"And everyone that hath foresaken houses, brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life."Matt. 19:29One could be a dead beat dad who foresakes his wife and child, and claim one did it for Christ's sake, and be richly rewarded for doing so, and have everlasting life.The verses don't say that..."If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple."Luke 14:26 (KJV) Doesn't say hate your family compared to me, Jesus. It just states hate your family. Why should hate enter into it at all? Apparently I must hate my mother to be the disciple of Jesus."For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law."Matthew 10:34That's why he is come. He hasn't come to make peace within families and to encourage togetherness of families.

Jake good try at manipulating scriptures. Jesus is all about family values. The point of thsoe scriptures is that His gospel is above everything else. The only thing that comes before family is GOD. He loves families but won't let a family bring someone down. The US rescues kids from bad homes too because to be in an enviroment that is detrimental serves no one.

Yup. That's why he ridiculed his own mother in public when he said, "Woman, what have I to do with thee?" John 2:4 When asked about a suitable burial for a deceased relative, Jesus said, "Let the dead bury the dead!" Matthew 8:22

I agree with emoreno2292, for the government, this is a strictly legal matter about the legal protection provided by marriage. The fact that the word marriage comes from religious context is inconsequential in the government's decision to allow "marriage", for lack of a better word, between same sex couples. If you believe strongly against this kind of union, ok, but don't mix your religious or moral beliefs with the constitution or the law. Let the government decide this on a purely constitutional or legal basis (because that 's its function). And, btw, how does someone set a gay individual "free". Do they put the person in a cage and then unlock it? Or do they set their spirit "free" of whatever its being trapped by (stuffy nose maybe)?

Weak, weak, weak arguments, mana'ia. How can I be sure it is the inerrant word of God if there are so many contradictions, and which translation is the correct one, telling the real tales? Science doesn't claim to be inerrant, or unchanging, directly from a perfect higher power. Right. Well, I was responding to someone who called homosexuality an abomination.No, it works if they only act out gay once a week, according to one of the ex-gay gurus in the Guardian article I posted a while back in this thread, lol.No proof anyone ever went from gay orientation to straight orientation.Yes.

It was written by humans.So you may not know it through the Bible with all its "flaws of man", but through these "prophets", none of which we can talk to today. "Prophets" are not infallible. They can't prove this higher power exists, so they don't know anymore about it/him/her than I do.This mythological storytelling hardly uses the same processes of science. Its fantastic claims require fantastic proof.I wasn't even doing that.I think we've gone through that already with yourself and others, on this and other threads. No proof that gay conversion therapy works in a broad, unbiased, generalizable sample.There are also ex-ex gays.That's very sad.

NO you took the out of context and made assertions about their meanings that were manipulated.no you asserted what kind of family values.Matt 1926 But• Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible•.27 ¶ Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?28 And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration (resurrection)• when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging• the twelve tribes of Israel.29 And every one that hath forsaken• houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name’s sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.30 But many that are first• shall be last; and the last shall be first.You see how you manipulated the scripture? The meaning was about what the disciples had forsaken and what disciples must be willing to forsake not what they WOULD forsake. That whatever tehy forsook including family it would be rewarded to them.Luke 14Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade many:17 And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are now ready.18 And they all with one consent began to make aexcuse•. The first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused.19 And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excused.20 And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.21 So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the ahalt•, and the blind.22 And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room.23 And the alord• said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and bhedges•, and ccompel• them to come in, that my house may be filled.24 For I say unto you, That anone• of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper.25 ¶ And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and said unto them,26 If any man come to me, and ahate• not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, byea•, and his own clife also, he cannot be my ddisciple.27 And whosoever doth not bear his across•, and come after me, cannot be my bdisciple•.28 For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and acounteth• the bcost, whether he have sufficient to cfinish it?29 Lest ahaply•, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him,30 Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish•.This is where you're manipulating the context again. First off it meant as it was referring to in MAtt 1037. That if they will love their mother more than than Him then they would not be worthy of Him. He was referring the the above parable. That if you put anything before Him then you are not worthy of Him as the above peopel had done when invited to dinner.Matt 10:37 He that aloveth father or mother more• than me is not worthy of me: and he that cloveth• son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.Matt 1032 Whosoever therefore shall aconfess• me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.33 But whosoever shall adeny• me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.34 Think not that I am come to send apeace• on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.35 For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.36 And a man’s afoes shall be they of his own bhousehold•.37 He that aloveth father or mother bmore• than me is not worthy of me: and he that cloveth• son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.38 And he that taketh not his across•, and followeth after me, is not bworthy of me.39 aHe• that findeth his life shall blose• it: and he that closeth• his dlife for my sake shall find it.40 ¶ He that areceiveth• you breceiveth• me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.THis scripture is meant that His gospel will not be easy to live. That there would be problems even from within your family because of their belief in Him. The gospel does not allow for fence sitters. There will be a time when you need to decide between Him and His gospel.

No, I don't see how I manipulated the scripture. You just repeated it what I quoted. You are trying to argue a difference between had and would and must be willing to? Yes, if they foresake their family, they will be richly rewarded and have everlasting life. Quite an incentive or carrot on a stick to do so, but they are not directly ordered to do so. The verse does not state it was referring to a different verse in a different book. You are making your own subjective judgments about context, which is not a literal interpretation. I could just as easily interpret hating your family, made it easier to foresake them and have everlasting life and rich rewards in another verse.And between him and your family. I have no interest in taking up a sword against my mother or father under any circumstance. Because my own family may have different beliefs, that does not make them my foes. If you hate your family, you don't love them more than Jesus anyway.

Homosexuality is not a weakness, not a problem. Much unlike it is with the homophobic religious right, who are too weak to think for themselves, and must claim God told them to be against gays.They do it for the money, not because they are nymphomaniacs.This is a circular argument that states marriage has always been heterosexual, end of debate. Also heterosexuals may not just marry for love, but also for lust or money. Family structures have already changed, to include a variety of family types. Allowing two people of the same sex to marry, will change marriage, obviously. However, this does not mean it will have a negative effect. Same-sex couples will be supporting the marriage institution by entering into it, and it will be good for their own families.This isn't a compelling argument to deny something to others, who have different desires or behaviour, than you happen to have.

Yes there is by the fact that it's changing the definition of families. There is a public interst in preserving marriage.It is a disorder. There is no DEFINITVE evidence to show that is genetic. I know because somehting gentic is physical. Something physical can only be changed pysically and since there are people that have changed without surgery or chemicals shows that it is not genetic.You jsut don't agree with that reasoning. Just because you dont' agree doesn't mean it isn't valid. yOu need to show how it's wrong not that you disagree.I've seen poeple change without physical treatment.

How does homosexual marriage endanger public health? How is it detrimental to safety and moral welfare? There is no concrete evidence that this would happen.Homosexuality is not a disorder! There are genetic components involved in making one homosexual. Your statement that "you know" that homosexuality is purely behavioral is completely unbased and as a result, meaningless.But how does it degrade it? And what's so bad about changing the definition of a family? What does it matter to you? I'm always hearing that marriage would "degrade the institution". HOW?!?!?!?!? emoticonXKill That excuse is so tired and overused that I just want to go and hurl whenever I hear it.How do you know that?

YOu haven't prooved either of these yet, why arn't religious people weak minded? What proof do they use to satisfy the logic that God must exist? What proof and logic have you shown to show why gay marriage should not be legalised. Absolutely none at all for any of it, you are just blindly doing as you are told and trying not to see the gaps in you argument and beliefs.The argument is wrong (again...), prostitution is not having sex with lots of people (which is legal). How could nymphomania be used to justify making people to pay for it? How is this situation even remotely related? If you are a homophobe and can't stand doing anything a gay can then yes, it will degrade the marriage for you if you relish in being able to do what they can't...otherwise in an actual physical way, nothing at all. You are trying to convince me that people will automatically think you are gay if married if gay marriage is allowed. Your standard of negative effect, define it and say how it would apply to your marriage if gay marriage was allowed. Or just define any standard of negative effect and how it would impact any marrigage what so ever. You can't can you? Blindly parroting again then...But if the desires are resonable and not going to harm people isn't that a compelling argument for granting new rights?

[QUOTE=JakeCJB]Destiny? How do gays control their destiny? Do you mean they should never act on their feelings, because you say so? Doesn't that put you in charge of their destiny, if they let you? There are acceptable normal urges and there are bad urges are not acceptabel or beneficial. The desire to reproduce is genetic and normal. There are genetic components that cuase us to want sex. THere is nothing genetic that forces us to be gay. If you want to use harm then define what is harm? Is prostituion hamrful? Is public nudity harmful? Is parking asking a religous question in an interview harmful if that information isn't used? Is running a red light harmful if ther are no other cars?Like homosexuality certain factors lead people to be pre-disposed.

Destiny? How do gays control their destiny? Do you mean they should never act on their feelings, because you say so? Doesn't that put you in charge of their destiny, if they let you? Not following you. Unless you meant to write "one's urges"? If so, all sex is based on urges. But that is not the only factor to determine if it is right. Waxy was arguing that harm is a big factor. Being gay isn't an addiction like alcoholism.Well, one could claim that of any culture.If that's the whole reason, it's not a compelling reason.You are using a vague, overly-broad definition of disorder I believe, to apply to anything the majority do not do. Buddhists atheists and vegetarians and Latter Day Saints, and political revolutionaries could fit into this definition, and yes so could prostitution. It would still protect heterosexuality if gays were allowed to marry.And--?That's not empirical evidence. My anecdotal evidence tells me these people who claimed to change are closet cases. They don't tell you or anyone else about their same-sex activity. Even if you can change behaviour, that does not change orientation. It's just by sheer willpower in that case.But how would the institution be injured by marriages for same-sex couples, is what a few people are trying to ask you?It's equal consideration not special consideration. Religious practice could certainly be classified as behaviour. That assertion of your own personal prejudice is not an argument.

Then don't use your religion in your arguments. This country is not supposed to endorse certain religions, and so whether Christians are weak or strong, it shouldn't matter. Christianity has no place in legal arguments.Actually, family structures have changed. Now there are kids who alternate between which parent they live with, which is not the same as if one parent was dead, and before the Church of England, 'Til death do you part' actually meant that they would be together until death.According to my standered of negative effect, there has to be someone who loses something they had before or gains some kind of disadvantage that they didn't have before, what is your definition of negative effect?Actually it is. For example, I do not have any desire to be Christian, and lets say, hypothetically, that the majority of Americans had no desire to be Christian and believing in the Christian God was banned. It would be banned for me and for you. If I thought this was fair because of the fact that neither of us could do it, would you not think this was unfair because we have different desires?

I can sympathize with problems of gays. It would seem that it is genetic becasue they do not overcome their problems that they do not want. I'm not saying that they are equal but many others have problems overcoming like kelptomaniacs, pyromaniacs, pedohiles, and many others. The obvious difference is the harm factor. Poeple feel that there is a tangible harm so that is should be illegal. The fact is that everyone struggles with something that they need to overcome. Just becasue we struggle with it doesn't mean it's genetic. Even if it were genetic should we cater to it?

Mana'ia, have you ever thought about what it must be like to be a homosexual in today's society? All of the harmful stereotypes, the negativity exhibited by the religious right towards them, the trauma of coming out... Do you actually think that people CHOOSE to put themselves through that? The anguish that you are letting down your family, that you will always be known as 'different' and 'funny'... I cannot bring myself to believe that any sound person would put themselves through all of that. My gay friends who I know well have told me about all of their pain and confusion. If anything, that proved to me more than anything that homosexuality is not a choice. My best friend is a lesbian, and everday she'd ask me, "Why?" Her parents dislike her now because she decided to be gay. She has endured so much pain and trauma for something that she could not help. And what really gets my goat is the fact that people still make it their business to make these people's lives even harder, in that they seek to prevent them from marrying the people that they love, the people with whom they have found their acceptance. Ask yourself, Who am I to tell these people that they are not allowed to marry the person that they love? For what reasons am I preventing their being together? And what harm would it do to me/others if they do marry?

It should still be prohibited becasue it will open up the flood gates for other behavior.Also true love does not mean love everything. God is knowable.
attacks
But in terms of legality and constitutionality, do you believe that they should still be prohibited? Also, how can god hate? I thought he was true love. Scratch that-- I thought he was unknowable.Thanks emoticonXBye

You do not know this, and I'm pretty sure it's not a choice. Even before I admitted to myself that I was gay I felt grossed out kissing boys, and would think up reasons not to kiss that one again.

There is no danger in homosexual intercourse that is not also a risk in heterosexual intercourse.Prostitution is harmful if the prostitute does not get tested for STDs. Public nudity is only harmful if it is below fourty degrees outside. Parking asking a religious question is not harmful if the information isn't used.

At least these people love each other, many heterosexual couples go into a marriage without love.How do they have equality? You can marry the one you love, and they can't.

Why is homosexuality something we need to overcome?
attacks
I can sympathize with problems of gays. It would seem that it is genetic becasue they do not overcome their problems that they do not want. I'm not saying that they are equal but many others have problems overcoming like kelptomaniacs, pyromaniacs, pedohiles, and many others. The obvious difference is the harm factor. Poeple feel that there is a tangible harm so that is should be illegal. The fact is that everyone struggles with something that they need to overcome. Just becasue we struggle with it doesn't mean it's genetic. Even if it were genetic should we cater to it?

How will it open the flood gates?

It should still be prohibited becasue it will open up the flood gates for other behavior.Also true love does not mean love everything. God is knowable.

John1 AND the athird• day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:2 And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.3 And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.4 Jesus saith unto her, aWoman•, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.5 His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.6 And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the apurifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.7 Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.8 And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it.9 When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,The scripture again taken out of context. Mary came to Christ to ask about What should be done about the wine. Then Christ's response was "Jesus saith unto her, aWoman•, what have I to do with thee?" which means Woman, what wilt thou have me to do for thee? that will I do; for mine hour is not yet come. This is better illustrated in the SPanish and German translations of the gospel according to John.Matt 818 ¶ Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side.19 And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will afollow• thee whithersoever thou goest.20 And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.21 And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer• me first to go and bury my father.22 But Jesus said unto him, aFollow me; and let the dead bury their dead.This is refernce to disciples committing to follow Him. He merely was stating that their first responsibility was to Him. That it was figurative to the dead bury the dead. Thanks for manipulating it though.

It was written by humans.So you may not know it through the Bible with all its "flaws of man", but through these "prophets", none of which we can talk to today. "Prophets" are not infallible. They can't prove this higher power exists, so they don't know anymore about it/him/her than I do.This mythological storytelling hardly uses the same processes of science. Its fantastic claims require fantastic proof.I wasn't even doing that.I think we've gone through that already with yourself and others, on this and other threads. No proof that gay conversion therapy works in a broad, unbiased, generalizable sample.There are also ex-ex gays.That's very sad.

I don't understand why people have a problem with gay marriage. Most of the arguments that I have heard have come out of the bible. Well if the bible says that homosexuality is wrong shouldn't you tell that to these priests who molest the alterboys. but that's another discussion entirely. What is marriage really, isn't it just a celebration of the love that two people share? so can't two people of the same gender celebrate their love for each other. I say let them get married if they want to, hey it might lower the divorce rate in this country.
supports
Yes Or No?And Why?

My prediction is that within a decade, two decades tops, gay marriage will be the law of the land. The only way I see this not happening is if the religious conservatives get so outraged over this that they manage to put more and more conservatives in office, and as a consequence the federal courts get stacked with conservatives. I think this scenario is unlikely, and I doubt very much that a constitutional amendment would ever get passed. So if I am right, a new chapter of American family life begins. Well, you gotta love this country; at least it's never boring.

Homosexuality has been observed in nature. What's more the human hetero male is one of the few animals who is attracted to the female at all times, not just when she is fertile. Our sex is not just for reproduction. If a person has one or two children, that person has plenty of opportunities to have sex, not just one or two opportunities. There are also many different forms of sex for heteros which allow no possible opportunity for reproduction in their natural form. There are heterosexuals who never reproduce.The idea that heterosexuality is more "normal" or natural or genetic, meaning in itself and in any form it can take, meaning it is more "good" is really a leap of faith.Also, not all animals reproduce. In kin selection, an animal will not reproduce. However, the animal will help its family and therefore its own shared genes by defending, hunting for food, and by reducing violent competition for females.Of course not, but it doesn't mean they should not "continue down that path."Actually I was just rejecting those kinds of generalizations about cultures, including black culture.Beliefs are a mental condition. Not necessarily a diseased condition, nor is homosexuality a diseased condition. Not in an unbiased sample that can be generalized to all gay and lesbian people, and which also has been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.

You manipulated by insinuating that it meant that He was against family values when all He was referring to is that God comes first.You don't understand because you don't knwo the history or the context of the bible. The gospels were written to differnt audiences about the same events. Since the audiences had a difference of knowledge and perception they wrote it to cater to their audiences. Liek you wouldn't teach elementary, high school, and college about DNA the same. yOu'd have to cater to their needs. So when there is trouble understanding one then you can turn to another gospel for a different perspective about the same events. Also in German and Spanish it is different than the KJV. The KJV is the english translation. That is how you manipulated it. I didn't actually expect you to know the bible in other languages but I'm pointing it out to you for reference sake.It's figurative. He doesn't expect anyone to kill their family unless they had to defnd others or it was necessary for some unforseeable reason. That' is how youre manipulating scripture.
attacks
No, I don't see how I manipulated the scripture. You just repeated it what I quoted. You are trying to argue a difference between had and would and must be willing to? Yes, if they foresake their family, they will be richly rewarded and have everlasting life. Quite an incentive or carrot on a stick to do so, but they are not directly ordered to do so. The verse does not state it was referring to a different verse in a different book. You are making your own subjective judgments about context, which is not a literal interpretation. I could just as easily interpret hating your family, made it easier to foresake them and have everlasting life and rich rewards in another verse.And between him and your family. I have no interest in taking up a sword against my mother or father under any circumstance. Because my own family may have different beliefs, that does not make them my foes. If you hate your family, you don't love them more than Jesus anyway.

Then don't use your religion in your arguments. This country is not supposed to endorse certain religions, and so whether Christians are weak or strong, it shouldn't matter. Christianity has no place in legal arguments.Actually, family structures have changed. Now there are kids who alternate between which parent they live with, which is not the same as if one parent was dead, and before the Church of England, 'Til death do you part' actually meant that they would be together until death.According to my standered of negative effect, there has to be someone who loses something they had before or gains some kind of disadvantage that they didn't have before, what is your definition of negative effect?Actually it is. For example, I do not have any desire to be Christian, and lets say, hypothetically, that the majority of Americans had no desire to be Christian and believing in the Christian God was banned. It would be banned for me and for you. If I thought this was fair because of the fact that neither of us could do it, would you not think this was unfair because we have different desires?

Yes, well I've seen heterosexist right-wing Christians unnaturally obsessed with trying to recruit everyone to be just like them, struggle and overcome their disorder. It may be more than they think they can do, but they can do it. People with other disorders such as those obsessed with trying to recruit Jews and Hindus, or anyone who does not believe or live as they do, overcome their disorders too. So do many other people who also are not normal and have disorders that run the entire gamut.

It's not just for a heterosexual contract in the Netherlands, Belgium, most of Canada, and probably not limited that way for much longer in Sweden and Spain. It won't be just for a heterosexual contract in Mass. in May.There are married heterosexual couples who either choose to not have children, or cannot have children. So it is not just for having a family unit with children either.

Remarkable that someone with such contempt for "white culture" can so thoroughly embrace "white religion".

If you are a homophobe and can't stand doing anything a gay can then yes, it will degrade the marriage for you if you relish in being able to do what they can't...otherwise in an actual physical way, nothing at all. You are trying to convince me that people will automatically think you are gay if married if gay marriage is allowed. Your standard of negative effect, define it and say how it would apply to your marriage if gay marriage was allowed. Or just define any standard of negative effect and how it would impact any marrigage what so ever. You can't can you? Blindly parroting again then...But if the desires are resonable and not going to harm people isn't that a compelling argument for granting new rights?

If something is a disorder and doesn't help to improve life then it should be overcome.eIt will force the government to be consistent with its ruling and making all behavior that falls into the category that homosexuality does (polygamy, voyeurism, sadist, prostitution, etc) receive recognition.

Why is homosexuality something we need to overcome?

I don't understand why people have a problem with gay marriage. Most of the arguments that I have heard have come out of the bible. Well if the bible says that homosexuality is wrong shouldn't you tell that to these priests who molest the alterboys. but that's another discussion entirely. What is marriage really, isn't it just a celebration of the love that two people share? so can't two people of the same gender celebrate their love for each other. I say let them get married if they want to, hey it might lower the divorce rate in this country.

Homosexuality in nature is also considered a disorder. I don't know why you don't think about your assertions before you make them. In the animal kingdom animals do things more routinely and more consistently than humans. Just because they only mate during mating seasons and don't respond to females in certain situations doesn't mean that they are not attracted to them. There is only correllary(sp?) indications that they do not respond to women making them seem unattractive. Men and children don't always react to women that they are attracted to as well. Also women are fertile from as early as age 12 to as late as 45. The only time they are not fertile is when they are on their period and when they are menstrating.Sex is natural between a male and female. Humans many times react less and less when stimuli is very monotonous. So that is why there is an urge to try different sexual stimulations.When women are sexuallly stimulated and men too there is better chances of mating.When heterosexuals can't reproduce then they have some genetic problem. When they choose not to reproduce then they are jsut defying the nature of their genetics. It's still genetic and it will propel itself even "darwinsim" supports that.I can't even understand how you can consider homosexuality as even clsoe to normal. There is nothing genetic to it and it wouldn't serve a purpsoe in nature excpet under darwinism to kill off the "weaker" offspring.Almost all animals reproduce. Usually it doesn't reproduce in nature becasue it's considered an inferior specimen and it doesn't want to be promulgated.Why?Well I thought you saying insinuating about gay lifestyle.Beliefs are not a condition.Conditiona : a state of being  b : social status : RANK c : a usually defective state of health <a serious heart condition> d : a state of physical fitness or readiness for use  <the car was in good condition> <exercising to get into condition> e plural : attendant circumstancesSince we control our beliefs then it can't be a state of being. We think a way but are not in that state.Did you ever think that because the psychiatric field politically motivated to condone homosexuality? They always refer to people that disagre with homosexuality as homophobic or bias. There is no support or extensive reasearch done that is sanctioned by their agenda.Also don't you wonder if there is no way to change something that is chosen. Therapy can't change something that someone chooses not to do. Just as rehad only works if people are willing to make the sacrifices and effort to change.

Homosexuality has been observed in nature. What's more the human hetero male is one of the few animals who is attracted to the female at all times, not just when she is fertile. Our sex is not just for reproduction. If a person has one or two children, that person has plenty of opportunities to have sex, not just one or two opportunities. There are also many different forms of sex for heteros which allow no possible opportunity for reproduction in their natural form. There are heterosexuals who never reproduce.The idea that heterosexuality is more "normal" or natural or genetic, meaning in itself and in any form it can take, meaning it is more "good" is really a leap of faith.Also, not all animals reproduce. In kin selection, an animal will not reproduce. However, the animal will help its family and therefore its own shared genes by defending, hunting for food, and by reducing violent competition for females.Of course not, but it doesn't mean they should not "continue down that path."Actually I was just rejecting those kinds of generalizations about cultures, including black culture.Beliefs are a mental condition. Not necessarily a diseased condition, nor is homosexuality a diseased condition. Not in an unbiased sample that can be generalized to all gay and lesbian people, and which also has been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.

Wow, how subjective is that?

Right. It is not condsidered a disorder by all scientists.A lot of human non-response is due to social conditioning, as you know. There is no reason for an animal to not respond when it is sexually attracted.Yadda, yadda, yadda.What if a hetero couple only like "different" sexual stimulations? What if the hetero couple only did the wide diversity that couldn't lead to reproduction? So what? If something can appear to be genetic, or it is proven it has a gene for it, that does not make it good or bad in itself. If someone merely naturally reproduces as a heterosexual, does that mean they are capable of providing a good family environment which will help its offspring survive and thrive for example? So what if the heterosexuals are defying the nature of their genetics? You believe gay people are all really straight too, so those gay people are just defying their genetics like the heterosexuals who don't reproduce. There is nothing genetic to being a Christian, and having a Christian wedding either. One possible theory is the kin selection theory I already outlined. At any rate, I don't think humans are always slaves to what is biological. All our behaviours as humans are so incredibly diverse.No. Do some research on kin selection.You can put yourself into a state of being with your beliefs. One could say being gay is a belief one has that one should have sex with someone of the same sex.As if the right-wing "ex-gay" organizations don't have an agenda. Many are affiliated with other political groups that work against equal rights for gays. My anectdotal evidence tells me that many are clearly religiously addicted. I'm talking to one such person online right now who wants to die because he can't be straight as he believes God commands. He believes he will go to hell, but his life is a hell anyway, pressured into a marriage where he feels nothing for his wife. However, he believes God is keeping him in his miserable situation. He has very low self-esteem. Notice that the ex-gay organizations are made up of people who say religion is extremely important to them.I'm trying to get this person to see a therapist because of religious addiction before he risks killing himself. I honestly am not making this up.

Its funny how people in this world talk about equal rights. Then go along and when they hear about gay people they go well they shouldnt get married because its agianst religion or whatever.Now this doesnt count for everyone of course thats obvious. But ive seen that happen way more than once. Its even worse at school. People find out people are gay and they freak and treat the person with rudeness and as if they were an animal.If these people would just open thier eyes and see. We all have the same organs, we all have the skin etc etc. Yes i could understand if you disliked them because of thier personality but when you go and judge them and not speak to them or give them an attitude before you got to speak to them. It just shows your a "wimp" . People should have the right to do what they want and not have the goverment say no because of thier gender. I say no to banning gay marriage. If that made no sense what so ever or have stated something incorrectly please correct me

Yes Or No?And Why?

I have read your posts, all of them, at not one point have you proved anything like this, all you have done is spout doctrine of what you have been told to beleive by homophobes, even if you yourself do not hold the same gay hating views, you are still perpetuating them. Quote me an example of you 'proving' you relgious people arn't weak minded and I will apologise.There is quite a difference between being able to marry someone you love and enjoying a particular job, the nymphomania bit is still irrelevant as anyone could enjoy their job and there is massive negative effects with prostitution whcih their isn't for gay marriage. Hardly the best, but best isn't really needed, however you are homophobic even if you don't like to call yourself it. So you beleive in changing nothing, well monarchy worked really well for a bit, as did tribal societies. Guess it would be really bad to change stuff like that otherwise government and leadership would lose all integrity (um..bad example really ;) ) same with medicines, far better to just pray to god for a cure rather than use drugs, at least the principle of healing people will still have integrity. Do you honestly beleive that more heterosexuals will get divorced if homosexual marriage is allowed, or people will stop caring for children?It is in the publics interest, gays are part of the public and pretty much half the population are in favour of it (the flip side to your 50 or so percent saying gay marriage is wrong), and the other half is giving the same reasons as you...'I don't like it'. Where is the harm other than people refusing to accpet them (you don't support it because it can cause emotional problems because you won't accept them, because of the harm their beliefs cause from the emotional harm caused by...). It is not a mental disorder, and only things that have a definite negative effect actaully need to be overcome, things that are neutral do not need to be.Actually give some reasoning for your veiws rather than endless circular arguments- what negative effect will actually occur to people who don't participate in gay marriage, if gay marriage is official recognised?

I have proved that religous people are nto weak minded by my arguments. I have not used religion to bolster my arguments. Read all of my posts and they will show you my arguments. I am not doing what I am told I'm doing what I beleive is right. Tasty read my posts before you speak about what I have proven. Poeple are claiming that non-gays have the right to marry someone tehy love (which isn't true). I'm saying then others will claim that they have the right to work in the profession they love. That is how they are related. That's the best you can do is say calling me a homophobic? Wow. My definition of negative effect is that the puposes for which something is created is hindered or compromises. Marriage was created to promote and build families. By changing standards there is a harm to it's integrity. Intregrity is compromised when it isn't stable. Something that changes all the time loses that integrity like John Kerry on his views. Things must remain consistent to be integral..It isn't reasonable because it is a disorder and not promotive to the public interest. Also there is harm.

Trying to influence people to maintain or to accept vertain values is not considered a disorder by any means. I have not insulted gay groups or their beliefs just disagreed with them. If we are not allowed to try to influence others then there is no reawson to debate or even have free speech. There is a reason to communication. I don't feel insulted to have people challenge my beliefs. Do you?

Yes, well I've seen heterosexist right-wing Christians unnaturally obsessed with trying to recruit everyone to be just like them, struggle and overcome their disorder. It may be more than they think they can do, but they can do it. People with other disorders such as those obsessed with trying to recruit Jews and Hindus, or anyone who does not believe or live as they do, overcome their disorders too. So do many other people who also are not normal and have disorders that run the entire gamut.

Up to a point. I was just saying certain people obsessed with making a mirror image of the behaviour of everyone else, when that behaviour does not affect those certain people, could actually get a life and have more time to focus on their very own families if they wanted to.

It is not a disorder, because it does not harm. In order for something to be considered a disorder it must be abnormal, maladaptive, and unjustifiable. You may define homosexuality as abnormal, and due to the low population of homosexuals it is abnormal, however it is not maladaptive. It is not adaptive, unless you consider the advantages due to the lowering of the population, but I do not see how it is maladaptive. What harm can come from it?Also, those who seem to overcome it, whether they really do or not, are often more depressed afterwords. If anything, these people forcing themselves into a heterosexual relationship is a sign of disorder. To sleep with someone you are not attracted to is abnormal, and due to the depression it causes it is maladaptive. It is also unjustifiable to do this, as anyone would notice the inconsistancy of the bible if they believe it says that homosexuality is wrong. God is all loving, but then he damns gays to hell for all time, and they have no choice in the matter. How can someone not see that is unfair, and not very loving. Actually, my heterosexual friends would be more loving than him, as they are able to love homosexuals without even having the slightest desire to make them suffer because of it.How would this be consistant in its ruling? It would be ruling that any two consenting adults could marry. These behaviors do not fall under that same catagory, and if you think they are in anyway similar you are very wrong. The only similarity is that both are not considered sociably acceptable in this day in age, but many things we do today would once be considered unacceptable. When these things became acceptable, we did not suddenly say everything else, no matter how unrelated, should be considered okay in order to stay consistant, because it would be another issue entirely and consistancy would have nothing to do with it.

Sorry about that.Still, the definition of a family did change at one point.So changing the standards on how cars were made so that they would be less likely to stall was a negative thing? It is true that if you change your ideas too often without explaination, you loose respect, but if you refuse too often you become like glass. The reason glass breaks so easily is because it doesn't bend, so if too much force is applied to it, it shatters. If someone refuses to change their views, even when reason tries to force them to, they can't handle it.Not to mention the fact that the Christian Church has changed it views before, and it's still strong and respected. For example, did you know that the Christian Church once fought against interracial marriages? And that it used to be against women being seen as man's equal? If these views hadn't changed, the growing support of women's rights and interracial marriages would have smashed the church like a mirror.Yes, but change my example to something that is behavior, like watching Angel, and saying that the rights are the same for those who do and do not like the show, would that be fair to those who like the show?

You're late. I didn't bring up religon in my argument. Jake did. So please don't specualte anything until you knwo what we're talking about.All laws are based upon morals. So it is based upon the morals of the country whcih happen to be predominantly Christian.England was one of many countries. There is no new family structure that didn't exist before this country.My definition of negative effect is that the puposes for which something is created is hindered or compromises.By changing standards there is a harm to it's integrity. Intregrity is compromised when it isn't stable. Soemthing that changes all teh time loses that integrity like John Kerry on his views. Things must remain consistent to be integral.This argument has a flaw. That when there is guaranteed religous freedomw then we dont' have equal rights. Everyone has equal rights in terms of believing. However behavior is regualted by the government. Therefore we can do anyting in the name of religion until it violates behavior that is acceptable by society.

Yes, but they have disorders. Being homosexual is not a disorder, because it is not harmful.But why would I want to? So that I can make the overpopulation problem even worse?Looking into someone's window without them knowing may not cause them harm, but it is risking the possibility of causing them mental harm, because if they ever find out they will have a hard time getting over the feeling that they are being watched every time they get dressed.To drug and rape a person does cause harm, even if they don't know it, because there's always physical harm. Not only is there the risk of STDs and pregnancy, both would make the person find out giving them mental harm as well, and if the person is psychologically unable to take care of a kid that would also cause mental harm, the actual act of intercourse leaves behind evidence so that you could figure it out, thus causing mental harm due to the knowledge that you've been raped. I'm pretty sure that there would be some injury around the female genatalia, as the male genetalia is about...well, one time I heard it was an inch and a half in diameter, so I'll go with that, and the female genetalia is one millameter wide. This would have to tear and stretch simply to make room, and I think the female would figure out what happened due to the location of her injuries.If there is a girl being forced to be a prostitute by her boyfriend, there is mental harm in being forced to have sex with strangers. With the husband thing, it is harmful to marriage, but not to the participants of the act. The best thing for that marriage would have been for it to never have existed in the first place, if the husband could not stay within the marriage. However, if he is that kind of man, I doubt he would have chosen to not cheat on his wife.The girl will be grossed out, but if people were used to the idea of seeing naked people, nudity would not be associated with sex and the girl would not be harmed.It is almost impossible to keep some form or bias somewhere from forming from some question in the interview. It causes no more harm than anything else off topic in an interview.The red light thing would cause harm in the case of misjudging, you were right about that one.So should engaging in above average intellegence activity also be not permitted? Average intelligence is the norm, and everyone has the "inalienable right" to have average intelligence.No one reorients themselves, they simply change whether they act on their desires or force themselves to stomach heterosexual sex.Not at first, as many gays would have had to wait a long time to get married, and they already know that they could stay together for a long period of time. Eventually, though, they would end up having the same divorce rate as heterosexuals would, in the end. However, heterosexuals would have less loveless marriages, because those homosexuals who wish to marry would be less likely to marry a member of the opposite sex. Not only because they could choose the one they truely wanted but also because gays would be more accepted, and they would have no reason to pretend that they were heterosexual.No, but there are reasons for that, where there aren't for not allowing gay marriage. The fifteen year old would not be certain of what he wanted to do with his life, and the marriage would effect that. If he was married, he would also be in love with someone else, and though it may be possible that he loved you both equally, in order for it to work everyone in the marriage would have to love everyone else in the marriage completely. I do not think many people are capable of that, though a few may be.

I can imagine your pain. I'm sorry. I'm going to use this analogy only as a reference. I'm not insinuating that homosexuality is equivalent to anything only on the smae parallel.You struggle with things like poeple struggle with other disorders. If you read baout pedophiles, voyeurits, sadist, masochists, and many other disorders they struggle to overcome their urges or desires as well. Tehy wnat to change but after a while they give in. Just because people struggle wiht soemthing doesn't mean that it is genetic. I've seen people struggle and overcome it. I know you can too. It might be more than you think you can do but you can do it.So if someone doesn't see me looking into their window while their undressing then their is not harm? Or if i drug a person and have sex wiht them and they dont' knwo it then there is not harm? Or if sell pornography to minors that are already looking at porn and buying it form other vendors then there is no harm.So prostitution isn't harmful to the girls that are pimped by their boyfriends? it sin't harmful to the prostitutes that sleep with other husbands? public nudity isn't harmful to school girls when they're flashed by a big hairy fat guy? Asking a religious question isn't harmful if they don't use it but yet it casts a slight bias already upon the interview? Running a red light isn't harmful when no one else is around but you keep thinking that there isn't and one time you misjudge things.There is harm and policy reasons in every law. They pass laws to protect and promote a public interest. Heterosexuality is natural and wihtint the norm and therefore everyone's "inalienable right".[QUOTE=Nature's Cry] True, but neither is homosexuality. It cannot be a physical or mental condition, because no one is harmed by it.[\quote] it is a mental condition. people are harmed by it because they are not functioning in the norm. They cannot reproduce naturally with the ones they are attracted to and don't function the way nature intended them to.So then jake is wrong to say that ex-gays have reoreinted themselves when they say they have.Are you saying if gay marriages were permitted then there wouldn't be any lvoeless gay marriages?I don't have that right to marry the one I love. If I was in love with my brother that was 15 and curently married, do I have the right to marry him? No Most poeple happen to love the person that is eligible to be married to them.

The thing is, you're not just talking about challenging someone's beliefs, you're talking about legislating who they can love- not based on abuse or harm, but on religious or personal beliefs.

No proof it was inspired by "God".Who today are eyewitnesses? People in wards for the insane?What kind of historical proof are you referring to?I was responding to someone who said being gay was an abomination, so I quoted other old testament laws.It's not like alcohol or drug addiction. If it were, where are the follow-up studies? This is nonsense, because we are not talking about addictive and harmful behaviour when we talk about run of the mill homosexuality. Men and women are not an addictive substance. Do you feel that homosexuality itself is addicting? Perhaps those extremely religious paid ex-gay activists, who claimed some change in their gay behaviour, without a follow-up, merely became addicted to religious extremism. This led them to guilt and sexual hypocrisy and the desire to fund raise.

According to the scriptures themselves?Anyone can claim that, including those who say homosexuality is cool according to their own higher power.Even if there is, it doesn't prove they are God or God inspired.The person I was responding to I believe was referring to the Levitican laws which many believe state that homosexuality is an abomination. I pointed to the other drastic Levitican laws we don't observe.It isn't a disorder.There is no recognized treatment, because it is not a disorder.It is unique and beautiful and wonderful, and not detrimental.Because of that one poll you posted a while ago that showed 52% think it's immoral?

I was curious about this percentage, so I went to U Michigan's website where you can go online data analysis with nationally representative samples. The most recent they had available (the General Social Survey) asked 2,832 people if homosexuality is immoral. Only 24.6% said it is not wrong at all, and I imagine a few folks in that 24.6% are like me and don't think it is immoral but are not jumping up and down about it either. The real number is probably a little higher than 24.6 though since this survey is not brand new, and "Will and Grace" is working its magic on many Americans.I just ran across another survey (2002). It is called "The American Freshmen: 35 Year Trends" by Alexander Astin et al. I was surprised to see that among this young group, 25% still believe homosexuality should be outlawed. Wow.

That probably wouldn't be acceptable to most people but it would be legal and equal. They don't allow religious practices of polygamy, animal or human sacrifices, body mutilation, and many other religious practices.So then we should allow prostitution, polygamy, human trafficking, drug trafficking, gambling, drug distribution, and all other consensual acts.

Fine, so what if the government said people are free to 'believe' in God, but any sign of them putting their belief into practice, such as going to church or even just praying in private was illegal? Would that be acceptable? After all it is just regulating behaviourA, not belief?Your comparisons are ludicrous. All of these situations involve non-consensual acts either through lack of knowledge or involvement of minors. You cannot compare that to consensual acts between adults.

No religiously based. Religiously motivated.Well you shoudl take a lookat the middle east and other countries that actually have laws banning gays.I never use the Bible when I debate this. And I do have a superior understanding if someone hasn't even read the books that they claim to udnerstand. Jake was jsut using sources off a website.

Here's the thing - up until now, you've claimed that your beliefs were based on logic, turns out they were actually religiously based. Not much logic in the Bible.I've never seen anyone object to gay marriage that was not doing so based on Christian religious dogma, that's why I was so intrigued by your stance. Turns out, you're just one like all the rest. Too bad.At least I won't waste any more time debating this with you, if there's one thing I've learned on these boards, it's that debating an issue that is founded in religious belief is the ultimate exercise in futility. Especially when the person claims to have a "superior" understanding of the Bible.Waxy

Laws can only regulate behavior. They cna't maek laws controlling anything else that is not within our control.

it seems to me that, regardless of your religious beliefs or feelings twords he subject, we cannot seek to limit the behaviours of human beings. We, as human animals, if presented with a wall, will seek to move over that wall, regardless of what is on the other side. now, while i myself do not advocate gay marrage, i do not believe that it is fundamentally wrong. so, as tword yes or no, i take a no postition, but only because of the consiquences.

I don't have contempt for the "white culture". I ahve contempt for when poepel think that "white culture" is "American culture" or when they think that their "white culture" is superior and should be pressed upon others.Also Christianity is not "white religion". It began in the Israel as did Judaism and Islam. Now the fact that many are white in the Christian faith does not make it a "white religion".Also if God is white, black, or brown, why would I care? Would one color make Him better for me or for anyone? Would a brown or black God be any better than a white one?

Remarkable that someone with such contempt for "white culture" can so thoroughly embrace "white religion".

All laws are based on subjective reasons.There is almost no consensus among any group of professionals. We look at the majority.We don't know that. It is an assumption. It could be for many reasons such as the controlled conditions could make it feel pressured or uncomfortable. We don't know what they think or feel. Animals also have social behavior that is conditioned as well.It's true as much as you don't want to accept it.It would unusual and highly unlikely. Even men that use condoms still would rather not use a condom. They choose to to avoid consequences.The fact still remains the government should make laws recognizing that behavior.The argument of heterosexuals not necessarily being good parents is not an argument. Being gay doesn't make you a good parent either. However studeis show taht kids grow much more adjusted than those that grow up in gay households overall.The government doesn't have to recognize couples behavior if they wnat to defy their urges heterosexual or not.WE agree on something. Humans are not slaves to what is biological or not. So tehy are not slaves to their gay prediposition.Humans are not genetically Christian. Religion is usually structured. People have biological need for structure.I did. Altruism can evolve, therefore, not because it increases the survival and reproduction of the individual who expresses the trait of altruism (since this individual has decreased reproduction) but because it is reproduced by kin of that individual who have, but do not express, the alleles for altruism. Like other traits, altruism will evolve if it is passed from generation to generation more than are alternative alleles for non-altruism. However, we can't describe how altruism will evolve based on the survival and reproduction of the individuals who express altruism, so our usual measure of relative fitness does NOT work to explain the evolution of altruism. Instead, we need to consider something called "inclusive fitness." Inclusive fitness refers to the degree to which a trait is passed from generation to generation. The trait can be passed from generation to generation directly, by reproduction by individuals who express the trait, and also indirectly, when individuals who express the trait help (are altruistic toward) individuals who carry the alleles for the trait, and who reproduce more because they receive help from the altruistic individuals who express the trait. So both ways in which a trait like altruism can be passed on must be considered to evaluate its inclusive fitness. http://www.utm.edu/~rirwin/391KinSel.htmI don't see how this is relevant. It appears altuism promulgates itself through kin selection. The species continues promulgate itself. You're still making a jump that isn't supported. No one would ever accept that a person can congtrol their mental condition like they can change their thoughts. It is possible to cause a mental condition due to actions based upon your beliefs. That is not the case with religion in general.I don't see how this is relevant. If I believed the government did not care for me and then all of a sudden they helped me overcome a problem and then I became [politically active to help ohters in my situation. How would that make my experience less credible?Do you ever think that people want to change becasue they are religious as a opposed to poeple who are not religious and complacent with their lifestyle choice?Religious addiction? What is that? I'm gald you're helping the person.I see so many people come from affluent backgrounds that are depressed when they don't succeed like other they admire. I also see others that don't care if they suceed like others because they feel that it is not meant for them. I'm really trying to help these affluent people not to be so hard on themselves becasue they are such good people and shouldn't have such high hopes for themselves.

Right. It is not condsidered a disorder by all scientists.A lot of human non-response is due to social conditioning, as you know. There is no reason for an animal to not respond when it is sexually attracted.Yadda, yadda, yadda.What if a hetero couple only like "different" sexual stimulations? What if the hetero couple only did the wide diversity that couldn't lead to reproduction? So what? If something can appear to be genetic, or it is proven it has a gene for it, that does not make it good or bad in itself. If someone merely naturally reproduces as a heterosexual, does that mean they are capable of providing a good family environment which will help its offspring survive and thrive for example? So what if the heterosexuals are defying the nature of their genetics? You believe gay people are all really straight too, so those gay people are just defying their genetics like the heterosexuals who don't reproduce. There is nothing genetic to being a Christian, and having a Christian wedding either. One possible theory is the kin selection theory I already outlined. At any rate, I don't think humans are always slaves to what is biological. All our behaviours as humans are so incredibly diverse.No. Do some research on kin selection.You can put yourself into a state of being with your beliefs. One could say being gay is a belief one has that one should have sex with someone of the same sex.As if the right-wing "ex-gay" organizations don't have an agenda. Many are affiliated with other political groups that work against equal rights for gays. My anectdotal evidence tells me that many are clearly religiously addicted. I'm talking to one such person online right now who wants to die because he can't be straight as he believes God commands. He believes he will go to hell, but his life is a hell anyway, pressured into a marriage where he feels nothing for his wife. However, he believes God is keeping him in his miserable situation. He has very low self-esteem. Notice that the ex-gay organizations are made up of people who say religion is extremely important to them.I'm trying to get this person to see a therapist because of religious addiction before he risks killing himself. I honestly am not making this up.

Gee I guess its the same kind of setting free that happens when a heterosexual tries and likes homosexuality or when a closeted homosexual comes out of the closet. emoticonXRolleyes Just because you don't believe in the value of reorientation therapy doesn't mean you know all concerning it.For instance, not all reorientation therapies involve religion as part of the theraputic process. Some are solely secular psychotherapuetic regimens.Where is your proof that it isn't a "behavioral disorder". All of the studies trying to find genetic causes for homosexuality have come up empty or in some circumstances been found false and debunked. Most research points to enviromental factors and parental nurture as the foundations for how sexuality is formed so basically there is more "credible" evidence to show that it is a behavioral. There is even evidence to show that brains of homosexuals undergo a change much like those in pedophiles. So in a sense it could be likened to a disorder. Its the political correctness and pandering of the APA that keeps it from being classified as such. To say all this does not mean that I believe in creating "deprogramming shops" but I think we need to examine theraputic regimens more fully. Like it or not there are gays out in the world that are unconsolable with their sexuality. No matter how many times they have had their egos boosted by the gay community and such they may still feel depressed and sometimes suiicidal. Homosexuals have higher rates of depression/mental illness and suicide than heterosexuals and no matter the cause, you cannot just pin the blame on that on the anti-gay crowd possibly bringing them down. Homosexuals do suffer from coping problems within their community. Just a bit of triva. Dr. Spitzer was key in having Homosexuality removed from the APA's list of mental illnesses. Would you believe that he only did this out of sympathy to homosexuals. So even in the psychiatric community, the jury is not out on the causality of homosexuality.This is the thing though. Kids see through all the bull. The saying "kids are cruel." is not true because kids just want to be cruel (although some do) its because kids don't use tactic or guile in debate. They come out and say exactly what they mean usually, the way they and often times others see it. I agree its not cool to be disliked, but this is the backlash of the world. You try to get people comfortable with things they don't like or feel are wrong and they resist. To you maybe the morality of life that says homosexuality is wrong is trivial. Fine, but how about Murder, theft, adultry. Are you carefree now? Or only when the sexual behaviour of individuals is in question. Its those same morals that say to the common man: murder is wrong, theft is wrong, adultry is wrong that also come into play with concerns to homosexuality. That is why kids freak. There not stupid, their being told right from wrong in the old fashiioned sense most likely. What would be worse, to tell them right from wrong and omit parts out for sake of political correctness or allow them the full knowledge of what is acceptable and what is not? To ask a child to not tease is one thing, to force a child to accept values he is not comfortable with is another. Would you approve of a heterosexual aqaintance cheating on his mate or would you for sake of political correctness ingore it, chalk it up to "progressive" society? Does that mean that gays deserve to be teased? No, but it also means that people are realizing values are much more a part of them than popular thought dictates. Kids are more sophisticated now, most know the "birds and bees" before their parents can tell them. They know gay sex while human and quite possibly done for ages is not a "viable" method of reproduction, which what I think kids associate sex with more in their early understanding of it. I think the real issue is not "should gays be allowed to marry." I think the issue should be "should we redefine society based on homosexual behavior(s)" This is what they are essentially asking us to do. They'll deny it but change has ripple effects. Just look at Sweden, now that gays can marry there the divorce rates have skyrocketed amongst these gay couples. In Denmark heterosexual marriages are so far down, they're almost mythological. These societies have commitied to allowing gays to be seen as equals so its too late to reverse. Its already happening that way in some of the countries that have just started allowing gay marriage and It could happen this way here. So should we be accepting "behaviour" that some see as immoral, others see as harmful to society? Personally I say no. Though I believe the religious moral arguements have merit and deserve to be a part of debate concerning this topic my views are not religion based. Persoanally I believe homosexual relationships to be biologically inferrior and unsound in relation to heterosexual ones. While nature may afford our bodies both hetero and homo sexual proclivities, it is only the heterosexual that continues survival of the species, I have yet to see a homosexual be born through homosexual means. Heterosexual sex in its purest mechanical form is also the most healthiest with male and female sexual organs obviously designed to accomodate each other with minimal or negligible physical damage during normal activity and normal health. Homosexuality while also seen in nature is abberant. Though animials of many species exhibit this it is not regarded as productive. Not only that but atempting to base human mores on animal ones is a bad idea. Animals regularly abandon or eat their offspring, which of course wouldn't rational behavior for humans, especially considering humans were gifted with higher reasoning skills and not just base instincts. Homosexual anal sex is almost always damaging physically to the individuals involved. Male sex organs coupled anally are not totally complementary with damage occuring at not only visible levels but more frequently at a cellular level. Male homosexuals have higher incidents of anal prolapse, tearing, rectal cancers, infections, fistulas, fissures, urethritis and other non-HIV/venereal infections than their heterosexual couterparts. Does this mean that I hate gays. No, homosexuals are people too, but I don't believe in promoting homosexual agendas,goals or behaviors any more than I would promote divorce, rape, incest or infideltiy. As such I also don't believe that desire not to promote those values is hatefull or bigoted, unlike the great outcries of "homophobe" we always hear when heteros don't agree or support homosexuals. I do believe the right to marriage as being between a unaltered man and woman. Same sex couples wanting to be married to me is a perversion of the institution, in looks as a petty attempt to damage the institution. The arguement that its unfair that gay couples don't get the same recognition as married couples, to me is ludicrous. Married couples have a higher chance of creating a family, of course the deserve governmental tax brakes. Homosexual couples while desiring to be "families" are not guaranteed this ability because it was not forseen long ago that they would be put in postions of creating families. If gays deserve special treatment then I think single people should be given special priveleges to, to encourage them to create families and so they won't feel left out. I think before any change is made to our way of life we should have a nice long study of same-sex marriage in European society before we just institute it here. That way we can see and perhaps guage the outcome, before it turns us into another Denmark or Sweden.Weekly Standard article of gay marriage causing decline National Review Kurtz rebuttalhttp://www.marriagedebate.com/pdf/SSdivorcerisk.pdf

Its funny how people in this world talk about equal rights. Then go along and when they hear about gay people they go well they shouldnt get married because its agianst religion or whatever.Now this doesnt count for everyone of course thats obvious. But ive seen that happen way more than once. Its even worse at school. People find out people are gay and they freak and treat the person with rudeness and as if they were an animal.If these people would just open thier eyes and see. We all have the same organs, we all have the skin etc etc. Yes i could understand if you disliked them because of thier personality but when you go and judge them and not speak to them or give them an attitude before you got to speak to them. It just shows your a "wimp" . People should have the right to do what they want and not have the goverment say no because of thier gender. I say no to banning gay marriage. If that made no sense what so ever or have stated something incorrectly please correct me

That was because they were trying to find a single gay gene, but it may not be just one gene, but a combination of many. Also, they have not found proof of handedness or many other characteristics that are generally accepted as genetic. Besides, they have found the gay gene in fruit flies, just not humans, but our genetic code is so much more complex that we don't have just one gene for all our sexual activity.Einstein's brain had unusual structures in it, could he have had some kind of disorder as well? One that made him smarter than everyone else?It was the fact that there was such controversy surrounding it that it was looked into in the first place.Japanese also have high suicide rates, does that mean being Japanese is a disorder? Plus, even though within the homosexual community, if a given homosexual is Christian, it is their own bible telling them they are doing something wrong. I don't think a little support from friends is going to make someone feel better if they think they are going to hell.That may be true, but it isn't harmful so I doubt it really should be on the list.A homosexual is no more likely to cheat on their mate than a hetersexual. I do not see why this ties into adultry. Murder and theft directly harm someone, so that is why it is immoral. Adultry spreads disease, so that is harmful too. Also, even though you may know marriage to be a thing between a man and a woman who get to share tax returns, once upon a time it was an emotional bond and well, one that stated that the two were truely in love and couldn't love anyone else or be broken apart by anything but death. Adultry means that for all that time, their marriage was not truely a marriage, or anything at all.But how is homosexuality wrong?No, but you can have a homosexual aquaintance as the only aquaintance, and thus it wouldn't be adultry. This would be more likely to happen if gay marriage was legal.Yes, but that didn't happen in Demark.Is that really such a bad thing? After all, we now have medical ways to reproduce without heterosexual sex. That would decrease the world's population, as not everyone would do that, as well as the number of accidental births. Parents and children would be closer, as the children would know that the parents wanted them, and there would be no hate crimes against gays. A decreased population would mean enough food in the whole world for everybody, as well as a decrease in war. It is much easier to keep the peace in a small group than a large one.People once thought of interracial marriages this way.Yes, but now you can artificially inject semen without any sex at all. Also, with our overpopulation problem, heterosexuality could be the death of the species as well. There is only so much food and space in the world, and at this reproduction rate we are going to run out.Are you sure about that? Heterosexual sex goes as follows: The female's one millimeter hole gets a one inch hidious peg rammed into it, tearing the hole until it is big enough for the peg. Wow, how...not physical damaging. I think lesbian activities are a lot less harmful.I'm sure ramming the peg in the vagina, which is smaller than the anus, is harmful as well.Reproduction is a bad thing, why would it make the family superior? And how is what happened in Denmark a bad thing?

I don't believe the majority use the term "disorder" when referring to homosexuality in nature.I didn't say it wasn't true that heterosexuality is natural. Homosexuality is natural too. If homosexuality went against the law of nature, humans would not be able to violate that law.Maybe you need to get out more. Does something being unusual make it good or bad?There are many reasons why people use condoms. It avoids disease(natural) and pregnancy. It also reduces sensation slightly which can delay climax. This makes the sexual act more pleasurable, but doesn't help reproduction.Even if the majority are not like that for perhaps all their lives? Even if it does not lead to reproduction?Children deserve to know that their relationships with both of their parents are stable and legally recognized. This applies to all children, whether their parents are of the same or opposite sex. The American Academy of Pediatrics recognizes that a considerable body of professional literature provides evidence that children with parents who are homosexual can have the same advantages and the same expectations for health, adjustment, and development as can children whose parents are heterosexual.1–9 When 2 adults participate in parenting a child, they and the child deserve the serenity that comes with legal recognition. http://aappolicy.aappublications.org...cs%3b109/2/339No, not slaves to anything. But this doesn't make something right or wrong, including with being gay. If that is true, it doesn't mean humans necessarily have a need for the particular structure of Christianity.But not necessarily through reproduction. How they've tied it into with Darwin's, is to say that those who engage in kin selection help others to reproduce by acting as helpers, without reproducing themselves.Your thoughts can create your mental condtion.I'm glad most others today encourage people to accept themselves.Who is being complacent?He's obsessed with the idea he is going to hell, because of what he has been taught. Apparently God put him into this marriage of his where he doesn't care for his wife, but God isn't responsible for him being gay. I'll come back with a link for religious addiction. It concerns an obsession with rules, and not thinking for one's self, with being perfect. Everything is black and white, heaven or hell. I just basically advised him to get therapy for that, and other issues. Then he attacked me, and won't speak to me or anyone else who was trying to give him advice(Christians), because he can't handle criticism of anything that challenges his particular viewpoint. After all, it's God's plan for him that he should be miserable denying who he is. He even said dying may be the only cure for being gay. He's tried and tried not to be gay. I don't know how God would expect to be served if God puts the person in an inescpable situation where the person is so depressed that the person wants to die. I really did not try to push my lack of religion onto him. I told him he was just using his own religion in a destructive way, and the problem was not with religion itself. I really don't think his problems are because he is not as successful as the heterosexual. He certainly has tried to "succeed" at being something he is not.

No they were trying to not just find a singel gene but overall genetic causality in general. That is why there were so many studies. They have failed to find conclusive proof that sexuality of either type is geneticly derived. This in light of other behaviors is irrelevant. Handedness can also be learned, there is no proof it is geneticly derived or that it isn't but just because it is accepted as genetic doesn't validate that assumption or assumptions for any other behaviors. The tendancy to be nervous or rape or commit other crimes may or may not be genetically related. So far they have no proof but would you say that a person genetically predisposed to anxiety is a positive benefit. The justification that something may be genetic makes it some how "acceptable" is invalid. It may alleviate the feelings that individuals have no responsiblity for control of certain behaviors but that doesn't automatically mean those behaviors is a good or desireable thing. Let me ask you this... If it were found out tomorrow that we isolated a cluster of genes that are responsible for homosexuality AND had the ability to remove said genes out of individuals, would you strive to ensure that homosexuality is genetically protected or would you support individuals re-engiineering their children to weed out such trait, which by wrote could render homosexuality extinct eventually? Big question but an important one, because this is where I think alot of people are kidding themselves in this whole "gene vs. enviroment" debate. Were moving toward an era where we will be able to alter our own bodies on a genetic level, if there is the slightest iota of genetic homosexuality do you really think it will last through the "splicer" years. Cmon, you know it wouldn't and then gays would be fighting for legislation to make it illegal to genetically elimiate homosexuality and then where will we be. I dunno about that, but possibly. They do know that those afflicted with ADD have some unusual structures in their brains too. Last I heard they were investigating the causality of homosexuality with developmental deficencies in the brain. The jury is not out yetYes it is true that homosexuality was controversial, however it was not the controversy that lead to the decision being made to remove it. It was the act of one doctor who was sympathetic to homosexuals. It was the choice of one individual, based on compassion, not factual data. Patently dangerous and wrong in my opinion. No being Japanese is not a disorder. What you are neglecting is causality of depression and suicide. That is why I mentioned that the high rates cannot possibly be attributed to just homosexuals that are ostracized by the religious or openly hostile anti-gay individuals. There must be associative behavior and cause within the community, within these homosexual relationships themselves. Is that caused by homosexual brains? Unsure. Is it the indivduals themselves and the assosiative issues within the homosexual relationship. Quite likely, but still causality is not 100% clear. I'm sure if you delved deeper into the causes of Japanese suicides you would find a myriad of reasons much like any colletive with high suicide rates. On the issue of homosexuality and the bible, that is indeed unfortunate. Does that mean the bible should change to be more amenable to those commiting what was deemed sinful by it long ago. I don't think so. Granted I am not basing my arguements against homosexuality on biblical or other religious text but I think to "change" religion to suit society is dangerous. Even if you don't believe in a particular religion I don't think its wise to alter its credo to conform to society any more than it would be correct to force a religion on an individual. You run the risk of invalidating the true message of the religion. Its kinda like the debate about censoring literature with curse words or racial epithets in them. Many may feel offended that Twain used the "N" word but to alter what is an important work of art and not just literature for sake of political correctness damages the social fabric of how society has evolved and changed through the generations. I cannot offer an easy method for Homosexual Christians to feel better about themselves, but the fact that the conflict exists means that a certain individual feels a loyalty to more than just his personal desires. That is a struggle they weigh individually. What is more important, their sexuality or being moral within the framework of Chrisitanity, or Judiaism, or Islam for that matter. Just because the Christians are more vocal doesn't mean they are the only ones that religiously object to homosexuality either, how about smacking up some of the other religions?Well that may be your contention, but medically that is not necessarily true. Maybe being gay doesn't mean you are suicidal or depressed, but there is more of it going on in the gay life than in the hetero. That in itself is a wake up call. Depression and suicide are harmful, even if it doesn't touch you personally. If it were as simple as you say the APA wouldn't be re-evaluating "reorientation therapies" would they and with positive critiques too. You wouldn't have prominent gay activists like Camile Paglia deriding the gay community for being malcontent when those unhappy with being gay seek and desire the way to be hetero.I didn't say that a homosexual was more likely to cheat than a heterosexual. What I alluded to was the fact that one indivdual was making a statement against moral values, when he neglects to recognize the root of said morals. The same values that say murder, adultry and theft are wrong are the same values that say homosexuality is wrong. Just because its between two individuals doesn't mean no one else can be affected. You brought up how adultry is bad becaue it spreads disease. Hello, take a look at how many men have given their women AIDS from being on the "DL" and having gay sex. Homosexuality is capable of spreading and creating disease just like heterosexual sex, the difference is most heterosexuals that have sex with only their partner and are "healthy" are not at risk for an infection or condition that could be harmful to them by having sex. You cannot necessarily say that with homosexuals engaging in anal sex. Talk to a doctor about how damaging anal sex is and the different problems associated with anal penetration if you think I am joking. You don't see many cases of prolapsed rectums, and increases in rectal cancer due to vaginal sex. THe causality of those reactions to anal sex (within the male homosexual community) has been shown. Political correctness keeps most doctors hush hush about it though. Oh and BTW I do believe marriage is not just between two people who want to consolidate their finances. If adultry means what you said, then how come a marriage is not diissolved officially until a judge declares divorce? What about if the couple reconciles the adultry incident and continues on with their marriage? I think the nuances of adultry are more complicated then your simplistic understanding.I'm not going to get into a religious debate, but I can appreciate someone taking a religious stance against it. Why do I think it is wrong? I think its wrong in the sense that it is treated as equal to heterosexualty. Its not, it cannot be, and that is no ones fault but natures. Nature doesn't allow homosexual sex to create life, to reproduce, and though humans use sex as entertainment, it obviously was meant for a greater purpose. Biology shows us we need both male and female to create life, that male and male doesn't create life, that indivdual gratification doesn't create life. If you want to attach relgious or philosophical significance to sex you may at this juncture. That is why I think it is wrong. Humanity wouldn't be around if homosexuality were the standard, homosexuals wouldn't exist without heterosexuals. You may be looking for a more fundamental "morality" to my basis. I choose to validate my beliefs on science and years of living proof of heterosexualitie's superiority, and when I mean hetero superiority I mean strict hetero adhearance, no socially unacceptable behavior being thrown in like "cheating" or "rape". Ah but that is conjecture. At least in this country you cannot fully guage this becaue we have not had years of same sex marriage. Basically you are saying that homosexuals would be less likey to cheat on each other if same sex marriage were instituted. I'd like to see your supporting data on this. Take a look at some societies that have had same sex marriages for a while now and you might be surprised. In Sweden the rate of divorce amongst same sex couples surpasses heterosexual divorce. So sexual preference is no measure of security against adultry or cheating.No, in Denmark, the rates of cohabilitation and out of wedlock births went up and heterosexual marriage is declining because the population sees the same sex marriage as an excuese to live lifestyles where traditional family is outdated. This is also happening in Sweden and Norway. Basically heteros see the society as so open that there is no longer any need for traditional family, that cohabilitation and single parent homes are just as acceptable as traditional marriage. If these countries are good indicators like they seem to be then other nations will follow the same route. I don't think that would be a positive thing for the U.S. or any nation for that matter. Right now what is known as the Norweigian Cohabilitation Syndrome is got its claws into Britian, where more individuals are having children with partners and living with them instead of marrying them. This syndrome is having a slow creep into the U.S. as well. Though there is not guarantee same sex marriage will not hasten this and other deteriorating family values, the trend is looking pretty bleak and hastening not slowing family disolution.Hey if Denmark wants to limit their populations with these measures that is their business but where is the voice of those in Denmark that want better? Its been forced out by the homosexual agenda.This sounds Socio-fascist to me. Reproduction via artificial means is NEVER a first resort. It is a last resort for those that are having difficulty having children or unable to produce children through natural means. Its not a panacea and should never be treated as such. Ever read Brave New World? THe desire to curb accidental births is admirable but, who gets the responsibility. Some big brother government like in China where state sanctioned abortions is the way or do people get to have freewill over their reproductive rights. All you are suggesting is just another means of limiting choice in a world of shrinking choices. Its altruistic that you want everyone in the world to be fed but how about getting countries with crappy governments to take care of their populations first before you force other nations into a communist wealth sharing scheme. I'd love to see Castro stripped to the bone, if it meant the people of Cuba could live normal lives. Just throwing wealth at poverty is unwise, especially when the majority of these poor countries are run by "fat cat" potentates that rob their citizens of luxury and basic necessity. I also think your statement about children and parents is "polyanna" reasoning. There is no evidence to say that parents and children would somehow become closer through enforced or regulated reproduction. I'd like to see some data on that one. As for limiting hate crimes against gays, I would rather see hate crimes against gays be punished like any other "hate crime" and stop priveledging gays because someone commits an offense against them. An offense is an offense, sexuality may be the root cause but I don't think gays deserve a special preference over any other individual subjected to prejudical hate. All that does is send a message that one group of individuals deserves a special beneficance over another. And I would like to see corrolary data from you supporting your arguement that a smaller more controlled population would bring these issues under control. You may be right but I don't think your small collective would have much freewill in their society and I am definately no supporter of socialist societies. Ah but interracial marriages were only socially prejudiced. There was no real biological basis for the prejudice. We know that interracial diversity is biologically sound. Sometimes there are genetic or congenital anomollies that can be detrimental to the offspring of interracial couples, but these conditions do not preclude the validity of said relationships. You are trying to equate sexuality with racial diversity. This is a false equation, for one, we do know racial traits are inherited and that races can interracially reproduce. This trumps homosexuality's abilities two fold. This is a poor arguement for eugenics, population control and support of gay marriage. You could also replace an entire countries clothing with uniforms, that way everyone will dress alike and thus the risk of some poor soul being teased for looking "different" will be diminished. Don't see alot of demand for that. The idea that technology is going to save us by keeping our population in check is Orwellian if not Huxleyian and totally abhorent to most. Maybe you would gladly give up your right to reproduce for sake of a that has for the past 100 years never reached fruition. I don't see many people supporting your cause if it means destroying individual freedoms for the sake of a "statist" ideal. All this is Malthusian socialism. We eliminated that idea once we reached the industrial revolution. If we are so great with technology to use it so drastically like you claim, why not attempt to colonize another planet within our system or build underwater colonies. At least you are broadening horizions for future growth and not rigidly and fascistly usurping the future. Well be cynical if you want, if someone in your family had done as you ascribed you wouldn't be here to be so glib. Nor would the human race or any other species where penile-vaginal sex takes place. I guess all those years of biological reproduction show it. You will also notice I didn't make it an absolute statement. I said "minimal or negligable physical damage".I understand that female biology undergoes truama too during sex, the fact is the trauma of vaginal sex i.....1. more forgiving and 2. Obviously possible of greater/important final result. And um, like with lesbian activities, the size of the "peg" also matters so how do you know lesbian activities are a lot less harmful.. Ahem, maybe you better talk to a doctor about the differences in sexual trauma between vaginal sex and anal sex. Its alot more than "ramming the peg in the vagina." as you so eloquently put it. In fact is not mainly an issue of penile force as much as it is the structures and purposes of say a vagina versus an anus. I didn't say reproduction was a bad thing. I think its a good thing and it does make the family superior and makes heterosexual behavior superior and right in my eyes. I think "reinventing" the family to support cohabilitaing adults and homosexuals wishing to adopt and raise children is a bad thing. I don't like divorce or out of wedlock parenting, I consider them bad for marriage as much as I consider gay marriage to be. The fact ot the matter is were discussing bans on gay marriage. Well, to be banned it would have to have been legal in the first place. Here in the states it never was so technically it cannot be banned yet. However I am not for legalizing gay marriage as I see it as an affront to heterosexual marriage and family and supporting ideals that to me are not productive to society. Nature may afford homosexual behavior, it is not that behavior that creates societey and life so therefore I don't recognize the claims of equality. Denmark serves as a great example becasue in their full acceptance of gay marriage they have sent a message that the traditional family is a negative thing, its passe and the incomplete family that so many were against for quite some time is now chique and acceptable. They tried to say in all the instances where gay marriage was accepted in society that heterosexual marriage was strengthed, but they failed seeing how low heterosexual marriage has fallen and the rate of single parent "families" and cohabilitations have risen along gay marriage. Maybe in Denmark the population will drop off in another decade or so, as less get married, maybe most will not have children. Then what of the future of Denmark? Maybe the government will get concerned and promote traditional marriage? Maybe they will abolsh gay marriage and things will repair themselves over time? Who knows, but its looking real bleak for Scandanavian states these days. Who knows how this will affect their cultural identity in the next generation.

That was because they were trying to find a single gay gene, but it may not be just one gene, but a combination of many. Also, they have not found proof of handedness or many other characteristics that are generally accepted as genetic. Besides, they have found the gay gene in fruit flies, just not humans, but our genetic code is so much more complex that we don't have just one gene for all our sexual activity.Einstein's brain had unusual structures in it, could he have had some kind of disorder as well? One that made him smarter than everyone else?It was the fact that there was such controversy surrounding it that it was looked into in the first place.Japanese also have high suicide rates, does that mean being Japanese is a disorder? Plus, even though within the homosexual community, if a given homosexual is Christian, it is their own bible telling them they are doing something wrong. I don't think a little support from friends is going to make someone feel better if they think they are going to hell.That may be true, but it isn't harmful so I doubt it really should be on the list.A homosexual is no more likely to cheat on their mate than a hetersexual. I do not see why this ties into adultry. Murder and theft directly harm someone, so that is why it is immoral. Adultry spreads disease, so that is harmful too. Also, even though you may know marriage to be a thing between a man and a woman who get to share tax returns, once upon a time it was an emotional bond and well, one that stated that the two were truely in love and couldn't love anyone else or be broken apart by anything but death. Adultry means that for all that time, their marriage was not truely a marriage, or anything at all.But how is homosexuality wrong?No, but you can have a homosexual aquaintance as the only aquaintance, and thus it wouldn't be adultry. This would be more likely to happen if gay marriage was legal.Yes, but that didn't happen in Demark.Is that really such a bad thing? After all, we now have medical ways to reproduce without heterosexual sex. That would decrease the world's population, as not everyone would do that, as well as the number of accidental births. Parents and children would be closer, as the children would know that the parents wanted them, and there would be no hate crimes against gays. A decreased population would mean enough food in the whole world for everybody, as well as a decrease in war. It is much easier to keep the peace in a small group than a large one.People once thought of interracial marriages this way.Yes, but now you can artificially inject semen without any sex at all. Also, with our overpopulation problem, heterosexuality could be the death of the species as well. There is only so much food and space in the world, and at this reproduction rate we are going to run out.Are you sure about that? Heterosexual sex goes as follows: The female's one millimeter hole gets a one inch hidious peg rammed into it, tearing the hole until it is big enough for the peg. Wow, how...not physical damaging. I think lesbian activities are a lot less harmful.I'm sure ramming the peg in the vagina, which is smaller than the anus, is harmful as well.Reproduction is a bad thing, why would it make the family superior? And how is what happened in Denmark a bad thing?

Well, who knows? I hope at that point our society will be more accepting of diversity. Women are certainly more accepting of homosexuality. I think women would not want their uterus and fetus tampered with, to be made straight, just because it would be shown to have a gene which could make it gay. There are many deaf people who would not become hearing if that could be cured, and who do not even learn to speak, because they see themselves as "differently abled". It is who they are, and they appreciate their culture.The study you were originally referring to, I believe, looked at rats put into two different groups. One group was 100% celibate, the other group were extremely sexual. Changes in the brains were observed. However, the differences in behaviour between the two groups were very extreme. It was also the result of studies done on gays outside of the institutional setting, such as that done by people like Dr. Evelyn Hooker. Nor is homosexuality.There are many possible causes. Nothing to idicate homosexuality itself is the cause. However, the following studies shown do show rejection and fear of rejection by family and friends and closetedness play a role(you can click on the abstracts available in the references in the following link)....Of the 10 studies, 6 explored risks for suicide by comparing attemptors and nonattemptors. They found that suicide attempts were neither universal nor attributable to homosexuality per se, but they were significantly associated with gender nonconformity,3 early awareness of homosexuality,3, 8, 11, 14 stress,12 violence,14 lack of support,8, 11, 14 school drop-out,12 family problems,8 acquaintances' suicide attempts,12 homelessness,12 and substance abuse3 or other psychiatric symptoms.6, 11, 14 http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content...-JMS1006-6-1-3It appears many differences in suicide rates and depression, life expectancy, etc., among many different groups....Differences in the health of blacks and whites are many and varied. Blacks have more undetected diseases, higher disease and illness rates (from infectious conditions such as tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases), more chronic conditions (such as hypertension and diabetes), and shorter life expectancies than whites (78,79,80,81). Morbidity and mortality rates for blacks from many conditions (cancer, HIV/AIDS, pneumonia, and homicide) exceed those for whites (80,82). These findings exist even though black females are generally less likely than white females to report risk behaviors such as smoking cigarettes, consuming alcohol, or using other substances (79,83,84,85). Hispanic and white women have a higher lifetime prevalence of depression (24 percent and 22 percent, respectively) than black women (16 percent). Furthermore, when surveyed in 1991, nearly twice as large a share of Hispanic women (11 percent) reported being depressed as did black and white women (nearly 6 percent and 5 percent, respectively) (80). http://www.4woman.gov/owh/pub/woc/toc.htmSuicide rates among black youth increase dramatically, different ideas as to the causes...http://members.aol.com/digasa/stats21.htmBlacks have shorter life expectancy compared to whites...http://www.4woman.gov/owh/pub/woc/figure1.htmPatriarchal ones tend to be homophobic. It messes with their ideas of gender roles. There may be room for interpretation in text, and perhaps some slight changing of custom, which may not bring the whole thing down. Religion has to change with society to survive in that society, as religion is a social human construct.The APA does not support "reparative therapy" or "conversion therapy". There are no idications that it intends to re-evaluate.There are people in every group and culture who deride their own group or culture.I hardly think so.In this case, I haven't seen anything to suggest otherwise, that more than the people involved are affected.Heterosexual women can get cervical cancer through vaginal sex, from the same virus that causes anal cancer in gay men who engage in anal sex.

No they were trying to not just find a singel gene but overall genetic causality in general. That is why there were so many studies. They have failed to find conclusive proof that sexuality of either type is geneticly derived. This in light of other behaviors is irrelevant. Handedness can also be learned, there is no proof it is geneticly derived or that it isn't but just because it is accepted as genetic doesn't validate that assumption or assumptions for any other behaviors. The tendancy to be nervous or rape or commit other crimes may or may not be genetically related. So far they have no proof but would you say that a person genetically predisposed to anxiety is a positive benefit. The justification that something may be genetic makes it some how "acceptable" is invalid. It may alleviate the feelings that individuals have no responsiblity for control of certain behaviors but that doesn't automatically mean those behaviors is a good or desireable thing. Let me ask you this... If it were found out tomorrow that we isolated a cluster of genes that are responsible for homosexuality AND had the ability to remove said genes out of individuals, would you strive to ensure that homosexuality is genetically protected or would you support individuals re-engiineering their children to weed out such trait, which by wrote could render homosexuality extinct eventually?

I guess all those years of biological reproduction show it. You will also notice I didn't make it an absolute statement. I said "minimal or negligable physical damage".I understand that female biology undergoes truama too during sex, the fact is the trauma of vaginal sex i.....1. more forgiving and 2. Obviously possible of greater/important final result. And um, like with lesbian activities, the size of the "peg" also matters so how do you know lesbian activities are a lot less harmful.. Ahem, maybe you better talk to a doctor about the differences in sexual trauma between vaginal sex and anal sex. Its alot more than "ramming the peg in the vagina." as you so eloquently put it. In fact is not mainly an issue of penile force as much as it is the structures and purposes of say a vagina versus an anus. I didn't say reproduction was a bad thing. I think its a good thing and it does make the family superior and makes heterosexual behavior superior and right in my eyes. I think "reinventing" the family to support cohabilitaing adults and homosexuals wishing to adopt and raise children is a bad thing. I don't like divorce or out of wedlock parenting, I consider them bad for marriage as much as I consider gay marriage to be. The fact ot the matter is were discussing bans on gay marriage. Well, to be banned it would have to have been legal in the first place. Here in the states it never was so technically it cannot be banned yet. However I am not for legalizing gay marriage as I see it as an affront to heterosexual marriage and family and supporting ideals that to me are not productive to society. Nature may afford homosexual behavior, it is not that behavior that creates societey and life so therefore I don't recognize the claims of equality. Denmark serves as a great example becasue in their full acceptance of gay marriage they have sent a message that the traditional family is a negative thing, its passe and the incomplete family that so many were against for quite some time is now chique and acceptable. They tried to say in all the instances where gay marriage was accepted in society that heterosexual marriage was strengthed, but they failed seeing how low heterosexual marriage has fallen and the rate of single parent "families" and cohabilitations have risen along gay marriage. Maybe in Denmark the population will drop off in another decade or so, as less get married, maybe most will not have children. Then what of the future of Denmark? Maybe the government will get concerned and promote traditional marriage? Maybe they will abolsh gay marriage and things will repair themselves over time? Who knows, but its looking real bleak for Scandanavian states these days. Who knows how this will affect their cultural identity in the next generation.

Really? If "nature" meant for all things to reproduce through heterosexual methods then maybe all other forms of reproduction would not exist, hmm. They would have been "eliminated" because heterosexuality is far superior. Think again. The majority of organisms on this planet reproduce using binary fission (bacteria dividing), asexual reproduction (there goes your "individual gratification argument), and zygotic reproduction. None of these things require sexes of any type. Even animals that have "normal" sexual reproduction can reproduce using a process known as parthenogenesis, in which only a female is required to produce offspring (turkeys and lizards do this). If homosexuality isn't natural or is inferior, then why do we see examples of it in nature. The bonobo (closely related to the chimpanzee) exhibits heterosexual and homosexual activity in both genders in the wild, and the bonobo and humans share a very common ancestor. Look, you can't say that one way of reproduction is "the standard" since it is clear that different species reproduce in a variety of ways. You also can't say that homosexuality is a disorder if you follow your previous logic that what is "natural" is valid. Also, you said that heterosexuality is superior because it has a "greater purpose". By implying that something has a purpose, you stray from the realm of Science by assuming a teleology. If you want to assume that things were given "purpose" by some higher being, that's fine, but you'll have to stick to religion to defend your argument. In science, it is impossible to assume a purpose. For example, what is the purpose of a river? To flow to the ocean? To carve a canyon? To carry sediment? You can say what something is good at doing, or what it does, but you cannot say what it was "made" for (purpose) without implying some grand design that can be easily provided by your local religion. As for hetero and homosexuality, it can be said that heterosexuals are better at producing offspring than homosexuals. Does that automatically make heterosexuality superior based on the arbitrary criterion of number of offspring produced? So in the eyes of a value system that believes that something is valued higher that creates more offspring or "life", heterosexuality would be superior. But in the eyes of science and reason, your argument doesn't hold water.

No they were trying to not just find a singel gene but overall genetic causality in general. That is why there were so many studies. They have failed to find conclusive proof that sexuality of either type is geneticly derived. This in light of other behaviors is irrelevant. Handedness can also be learned, there is no proof it is geneticly derived or that it isn't but just because it is accepted as genetic doesn't validate that assumption or assumptions for any other behaviors. The tendancy to be nervous or rape or commit other crimes may or may not be genetically related. So far they have no proof but would you say that a person genetically predisposed to anxiety is a positive benefit. The justification that something may be genetic makes it some how "acceptable" is invalid. It may alleviate the feelings that individuals have no responsiblity for control of certain behaviors but that doesn't automatically mean those behaviors is a good or desireable thing. Let me ask you this... If it were found out tomorrow that we isolated a cluster of genes that are responsible for homosexuality AND had the ability to remove said genes out of individuals, would you strive to ensure that homosexuality is genetically protected or would you support individuals re-engiineering their children to weed out such trait, which by wrote could render homosexuality extinct eventually? Big question but an important one, because this is where I think alot of people are kidding themselves in this whole "gene vs. enviroment" debate. Were moving toward an era where we will be able to alter our own bodies on a genetic level, if there is the slightest iota of genetic homosexuality do you really think it will last through the "splicer" years. Cmon, you know it wouldn't and then gays would be fighting for legislation to make it illegal to genetically elimiate homosexuality and then where will we be. I dunno about that, but possibly. They do know that those afflicted with ADD have some unusual structures in their brains too. Last I heard they were investigating the causality of homosexuality with developmental deficencies in the brain. The jury is not out yetYes it is true that homosexuality was controversial, however it was not the controversy that lead to the decision being made to remove it. It was the act of one doctor who was sympathetic to homosexuals. It was the choice of one individual, based on compassion, not factual data. Patently dangerous and wrong in my opinion. No being Japanese is not a disorder. What you are neglecting is causality of depression and suicide. That is why I mentioned that the high rates cannot possibly be attributed to just homosexuals that are ostracized by the religious or openly hostile anti-gay individuals. There must be associative behavior and cause within the community, within these homosexual relationships themselves. Is that caused by homosexual brains? Unsure. Is it the indivduals themselves and the assosiative issues within the homosexual relationship. Quite likely, but still causality is not 100% clear. I'm sure if you delved deeper into the causes of Japanese suicides you would find a myriad of reasons much like any colletive with high suicide rates. On the issue of homosexuality and the bible, that is indeed unfortunate. Does that mean the bible should change to be more amenable to those commiting what was deemed sinful by it long ago. I don't think so. Granted I am not basing my arguements against homosexuality on biblical or other religious text but I think to "change" religion to suit society is dangerous. Even if you don't believe in a particular religion I don't think its wise to alter its credo to conform to society any more than it would be correct to force a religion on an individual. You run the risk of invalidating the true message of the religion. Its kinda like the debate about censoring literature with curse words or racial epithets in them. Many may feel offended that Twain used the "N" word but to alter what is an important work of art and not just literature for sake of political correctness damages the social fabric of how society has evolved and changed through the generations. I cannot offer an easy method for Homosexual Christians to feel better about themselves, but the fact that the conflict exists means that a certain individual feels a loyalty to more than just his personal desires. That is a struggle they weigh individually. What is more important, their sexuality or being moral within the framework of Chrisitanity, or Judiaism, or Islam for that matter. Just because the Christians are more vocal doesn't mean they are the only ones that religiously object to homosexuality either, how about smacking up some of the other religions?Well that may be your contention, but medically that is not necessarily true. Maybe being gay doesn't mean you are suicidal or depressed, but there is more of it going on in the gay life than in the hetero. That in itself is a wake up call. Depression and suicide are harmful, even if it doesn't touch you personally. If it were as simple as you say the APA wouldn't be re-evaluating "reorientation therapies" would they and with positive critiques too. You wouldn't have prominent gay activists like Camile Paglia deriding the gay community for being malcontent when those unhappy with being gay seek and desire the way to be hetero.I didn't say that a homosexual was more likely to cheat than a heterosexual. What I alluded to was the fact that one indivdual was making a statement against moral values, when he neglects to recognize the root of said morals. The same values that say murder, adultry and theft are wrong are the same values that say homosexuality is wrong. Just because its between two individuals doesn't mean no one else can be affected. You brought up how adultry is bad becaue it spreads disease. Hello, take a look at how many men have given their women AIDS from being on the "DL" and having gay sex. Homosexuality is capable of spreading and creating disease just like heterosexual sex, the difference is most heterosexuals that have sex with only their partner and are "healthy" are not at risk for an infection or condition that could be harmful to them by having sex. You cannot necessarily say that with homosexuals engaging in anal sex. Talk to a doctor about how damaging anal sex is and the different problems associated with anal penetration if you think I am joking. You don't see many cases of prolapsed rectums, and increases in rectal cancer due to vaginal sex. THe causality of those reactions to anal sex (within the male homosexual community) has been shown. Political correctness keeps most doctors hush hush about it though. Oh and BTW I do believe marriage is not just between two people who want to consolidate their finances. If adultry means what you said, then how come a marriage is not diissolved officially until a judge declares divorce? What about if the couple reconciles the adultry incident and continues on with their marriage? I think the nuances of adultry are more complicated then your simplistic understanding.I'm not going to get into a religious debate, but I can appreciate someone taking a religious stance against it. Why do I think it is wrong? I think its wrong in the sense that it is treated as equal to heterosexualty. Its not, it cannot be, and that is no ones fault but natures. Nature doesn't allow homosexual sex to create life, to reproduce, and though humans use sex as entertainment, it obviously was meant for a greater purpose. Biology shows us we need both male and female to create life, that male and male doesn't create life, that indivdual gratification doesn't create life. If you want to attach relgious or philosophical significance to sex you may at this juncture. That is why I think it is wrong. Humanity wouldn't be around if homosexuality were the standard, homosexuals wouldn't exist without heterosexuals. You may be looking for a more fundamental "morality" to my basis. I choose to validate my beliefs on science and years of living proof of heterosexualitie's superiority, and when I mean hetero superiority I mean strict hetero adhearance, no socially unacceptable behavior being thrown in like "cheating" or "rape". Ah but that is conjecture. At least in this country you cannot fully guage this becaue we have not had years of same sex marriage. Basically you are saying that homosexuals would be less likey to cheat on each other if same sex marriage were instituted. I'd like to see your supporting data on this. Take a look at some societies that have had same sex marriages for a while now and you might be surprised. In Sweden the rate of divorce amongst same sex couples surpasses heterosexual divorce. So sexual preference is no measure of security against adultry or cheating.No, in Denmark, the rates of cohabilitation and out of wedlock births went up and heterosexual marriage is declining because the population sees the same sex marriage as an excuese to live lifestyles where traditional family is outdated. This is also happening in Sweden and Norway. Basically heteros see the society as so open that there is no longer any need for traditional family, that cohabilitation and single parent homes are just as acceptable as traditional marriage. If these countries are good indicators like they seem to be then other nations will follow the same route. I don't think that would be a positive thing for the U.S. or any nation for that matter. Right now what is known as the Norweigian Cohabilitation Syndrome is got its claws into Britian, where more individuals are having children with partners and living with them instead of marrying them. This syndrome is having a slow creep into the U.S. as well. Though there is not guarantee same sex marriage will not hasten this and other deteriorating family values, the trend is looking pretty bleak and hastening not slowing family disolution.Hey if Denmark wants to limit their populations with these measures that is their business but where is the voice of those in Denmark that want better? Its been forced out by the homosexual agenda.This sounds Socio-fascist to me. Reproduction via artificial means is NEVER a first resort. It is a last resort for those that are having difficulty having children or unable to produce children through natural means. Its not a panacea and should never be treated as such. Ever read Brave New World? THe desire to curb accidental births is admirable but, who gets the responsibility. Some big brother government like in China where state sanctioned abortions is the way or do people get to have freewill over their reproductive rights. All you are suggesting is just another means of limiting choice in a world of shrinking choices. Its altruistic that you want everyone in the world to be fed but how about getting countries with crappy governments to take care of their populations first before you force other nations into a communist wealth sharing scheme. I'd love to see Castro stripped to the bone, if it meant the people of Cuba could live normal lives. Just throwing wealth at poverty is unwise, especially when the majority of these poor countries are run by "fat cat" potentates that rob their citizens of luxury and basic necessity. I also think your statement about children and parents is "polyanna" reasoning. There is no evidence to say that parents and children would somehow become closer through enforced or regulated reproduction. I'd like to see some data on that one. As for limiting hate crimes against gays, I would rather see hate crimes against gays be punished like any other "hate crime" and stop priveledging gays because someone commits an offense against them. An offense is an offense, sexuality may be the root cause but I don't think gays deserve a special preference over any other individual subjected to prejudical hate. All that does is send a message that one group of individuals deserves a special beneficance over another. And I would like to see corrolary data from you supporting your arguement that a smaller more controlled population would bring these issues under control. You may be right but I don't think your small collective would have much freewill in their society and I am definately no supporter of socialist societies. Ah but interracial marriages were only socially prejudiced. There was no real biological basis for the prejudice. We know that interracial diversity is biologically sound. Sometimes there are genetic or congenital anomollies that can be detrimental to the offspring of interracial couples, but these conditions do not preclude the validity of said relationships. You are trying to equate sexuality with racial diversity. This is a false equation, for one, we do know racial traits are inherited and that races can interracially reproduce. This trumps homosexuality's abilities two fold. This is a poor arguement for eugenics, population control and support of gay marriage. You could also replace an entire countries clothing with uniforms, that way everyone will dress alike and thus the risk of some poor soul being teased for looking "different" will be diminished. Don't see alot of demand for that. The idea that technology is going to save us by keeping our population in check is Orwellian if not Huxleyian and totally abhorent to most. Maybe you would gladly give up your right to reproduce for sake of a that has for the past 100 years never reached fruition. I don't see many people supporting your cause if it means destroying individual freedoms for the sake of a "statist" ideal. All this is Malthusian socialism. We eliminated that idea once we reached the industrial revolution. If we are so great with technology to use it so drastically like you claim, why not attempt to colonize another planet within our system or build underwater colonies. At least you are broadening horizions for future growth and not rigidly and fascistly usurping the future. Well be cynical if you want, if someone in your family had done as you ascribed you wouldn't be here to be so glib. Nor would the human race or any other species where penile-vaginal sex takes place.

But they obviously wouldn't be equal, because a significant proportion of the population would be restricted from worshipping how they want in a for that hurts nobody.These elements mostly have links to crime over and above the act itself, that justifies restrictions. Homosexuality doesn't.

That probably wouldn't be acceptable to most people but it would be legal and equal. They don't allow religious practices of polygamy, animal or human sacrifices, body mutilation, and many other religious practices.So then we should allow prostitution, polygamy, human trafficking, drug trafficking, gambling, drug distribution, and all other consensual acts.

I'm still cathcing up with all the posts. I'll respond to them sooner or later.How do you say they don't have equal right when all have the smae rights. We all ahve the right to marry. The right to marry someone we love is not a right because I'm in love with Bill Gates, Oprah Winfrey, Larry Ellison, Sam Walton's family and all the billionaires. Just because you love someone doesn't give you a right to marry them.Where do we draw the line wiht behavior?

Its funny how people in this world talk about equal rights. Then go along and when they hear about gay people they go well they shouldnt get married because its agianst religion or whatever.Now this doesnt count for everyone of course thats obvious. But ive seen that happen way more than once. Its even worse at school. People find out people are gay and they freak and treat the person with rudeness and as if they were an animal.If these people would just open thier eyes and see. We all have the same organs, we all have the skin etc etc. Yes i could understand if you disliked them because of thier personality but when you go and judge them and not speak to them or give them an attitude before you got to speak to them. It just shows your a "wimp" . People should have the right to do what they want and not have the goverment say no because of thier gender. I say no to banning gay marriage. If that made no sense what so ever or have stated something incorrectly please correct me

You do have the right to marry someone you love if you are gay or lesbian in Massachusetts, as of today. Mana'ia, you have the right to marry all of those rich people if they consent. You have the right to marry rich people of the same sex, if you live in Massachusetts. You could even marry someone just because of love who is of the same sex there.

First off I'm not a homophobic. Is everyone that disagrees wiht Judaism antisemtic? What is your definiton of homophobic?I do not spout doctrine. I share my views that I have logically proven. So if you condier it all doctrine and dismiss it all then of course it is not evident. I did the same to you there would be no debate because we'd jsut be dismissing each other's arguments.The fact that I showed-Homosexuality is not geneticGay marriages degrade the institutionHomosexuality is a disorder Recognizing disoprders such as homosexuality will lead to other disorders needing equality of recognitionThere is a public interest in not allowing gay marriage.They have equality because they have all rights afforded to anyone else.It isn't discrimination and if it is then the whole constitution is discriminatory.All laws are morally based and we as a society decide what is morally acceptable.Homosexuality is behavior and laws govern behavior not race, gender, abilities, etc.The argument is that gays desires deserves recognition in marriage. Why can't nymphomaniacs claim their desires deserves recognition in profession? YOu can't discriminate gays at work?There are negaitve effects of homosexuality, probably more so than prostitution. Just as colon and Gastronal Intestine specialists.Monarchy and tribal governments were changed to democracy a proven instituion. monarchy and tribal government don't exist if they' been replaced.So your analogy is flawed. You say keep the same instituion and change the standard. TAht is different than saying keep change the insitution for another institution.Also your medical analogy is also not relevant. It's frustrating pointing it out. Changing methods and changing standards are nto the same. I''ll let you figure out how that isn't relevant.SAy what you want. I'm not afraid of gays or have a bias agianst them. I simply disagree with their lifestyle and mentality. Using the term homophobic has been your best argument so far. More than 60% oppose gay marriage according to the latest polls.http://www.pollingreport.com/civil.htmAlso I gave you many arguments above and you simply dismiss them. So that's why their circular you haven't proven them not credible DEFINITVELY. I may not aas well but I proved there is a basis and it's debateable. Until it's proven definitvely then you can't say it's not relevant.
attacks
I have read your posts, all of them, at not one point have you proved anything like this, all you have done is spout doctrine of what you have been told to beleive by homophobes, even if you yourself do not hold the same gay hating views, you are still perpetuating them. Quote me an example of you 'proving' you relgious people arn't weak minded and I will apologise.There is quite a difference between being able to marry someone you love and enjoying a particular job, the nymphomania bit is still irrelevant as anyone could enjoy their job and there is massive negative effects with prostitution whcih their isn't for gay marriage. Hardly the best, but best isn't really needed, however you are homophobic even if you don't like to call yourself it. So you beleive in changing nothing, well monarchy worked really well for a bit, as did tribal societies. Guess it would be really bad to change stuff like that otherwise government and leadership would lose all integrity (um..bad example really ;) ) same with medicines, far better to just pray to god for a cure rather than use drugs, at least the principle of healing people will still have integrity. Do you honestly beleive that more heterosexuals will get divorced if homosexual marriage is allowed, or people will stop caring for children?It is in the publics interest, gays are part of the public and pretty much half the population are in favour of it (the flip side to your 50 or so percent saying gay marriage is wrong), and the other half is giving the same reasons as you...'I don't like it'. Where is the harm other than people refusing to accpet them (you don't support it because it can cause emotional problems because you won't accept them, because of the harm their beliefs cause from the emotional harm caused by...). It is not a mental disorder, and only things that have a definite negative effect actaully need to be overcome, things that are neutral do not need to be.Actually give some reasoning for your veiws rather than endless circular arguments- what negative effect will actually occur to people who don't participate in gay marriage, if gay marriage is official recognised?

Just because something is genetically predisposed does not mean it has a positive benefit, but I never said that it did. Homosexuality is different, because it has no negative reprocussions that are not caused by something social or religious.I would fight to protect homosexuality, because it is a good thing. If there were no homosexuals, the human population would rise, and I see no point in having more people in this world. We have enough, too many in fact. I would like it if there weren't so many people in the world that millions of acres of trees had to be cut down every day in order to make room and supplies for all the people.Then you also have to consider the definition of disorder. A disorder is not just something that is different, but something different and negative. Intelligence is not a negative.It may have been taken off for the wrong reasons, but there was really no reason for it to be on there in the first place.Yes, but this is why I brought up the bible, because that would be an alternate reason that would not be caused by homosexual brains that could occur in cultures supportive of homosexuality. I believe that you are right about Japanese culture, if you delved into it you would find there is not a genetic but cultural cause for their high suicide rates, but I believe that you would find the same thing with homosexuality.You are right, these other religions also are the cause of depression in homosexuals, and are just as bad for that reason. The thing is, it isn't like you would have to rewrite their religious books just because you want equality, because all of them have passages that are now considered outdated and not strictly enforced, or enforced at all for that matter. There is also the fact that a religious book is a dangerous weapon, as people will do what it says, moral or not. A novel is not as dangerous, as few people seriously worship things they read in novels.There are blacks who wish there was a way to be white and vise versa. Many things that make people depressed are not disorders, it is simply something that happened that they didn't like because of something about them. Also, I think if you convinced a person who wanted to be a nationality they weren't that they were no longer that nationality, they would then be happier than before, making people think that it must make one happy to be the nationality this person thinks they have become.Moral values in the sense of religious moral values are not good in debate, and religious moral values are the ones who list all of those as bad thing. The best thing to do is to stick to the reasons why this individual act is considered wrong.I was saying that now marriages are more concerned about gender than love. Many married couples may also be in love, but many non married gay couples may be just as much in love. Plus, many people get married for publicity and not for love. Thus, the factor that is consistant in all marriages is not love, but gender and taxes. Adultry legally means nothing, just as love between two people legally means nothing, so legally the marriage is not over due to any matters of love and adultry. When the couple reconciles, they are basically saying that they still love each other so are promising again that they will love each other, and only each other, and believing that the promise will not be broken again.No, I wasn't looking for religious morality, I was looking for general morality, so your argument was the kind I wanted to debate. Anyway, what is with people thinking that an activity that creates children is neccesarily a good thing? There are already a lot of people in the world, and too many more will end up using up all the food, and then there will no people, because we will all die an agonizing death of starvation. Heterosexuality is good, without any reproduction we would die out as well, but homosexuality is also very good and important because without enough non reproductive couples, the population would increase even more.There would still be adultry and cheating, just not any more than there was before. There would be a decreased number of people in denial of their sexuality, though, and so they would not get married to pretend to be what they are not. However, I believe that what is happening in Sweden is not linked to homosexual marriage, but a world wide trend of increasing divorce rates. I think two things are happening at once, and people are making the mistake of thinking that they are related and attacking one thinking it will end the other. However, I think that this will not work, because homosexuality and higher divorce rates are not corrolated, as higher divorce rates exist in countries that don't even have legalized gay marriage. Besides, one of the worst countries of all about divorce is the United States, and we are behind other countries in gay rights.http://www.divorcereform.org/nonus.html#anchor5599108http://www.glocom.org/special_topics...07_trends_s10/This is only because people see homosexuality as completely anti-traditional marriage, and so they figure if they break one aspect of marriage, they might as well break them all. If people would look at it as a statement that marriage is for love, not gender, then this would not happen.I was saying that if everyone decided that they wanted to be gay, it wouldn't be bad because we could do this. Homosexuality would not be enforced, and it wouldn't be the government regulating births. It would be private doctors, like gynocologists, who would help people become pregnant. People would still have complete control over their reproductive rights.I wasn't saying that we should just throw wealth at poverty, I just mean that we should have enough food in the world that if they put some effort into getting some, they have something to be rewarded with. Homeless people can pull themselves up from poverty if they try, as long as there is something left for them to get. With high populations, everything ends up used up and there is nothing for them to try to earn.I'm not saying enforced or regulated reproduction, I'm saying intentional reproduction as opposed to accidental undesired births.I'm not saying they should be treated differently, I don't think that. What I was saying was that if everyone was magically gay, then there would be no hate crimes against gays. We'd still have to work on the other kinds of hate crimes. The best thing would not be to force people to be any one thing though, but to accept those that are. I simply was pointing out that if what happened in Denmark with almost everyone having gay marriage happened everywhere, it might not be so bad if it was a willing thing.Why wouldn't they have free will? I'm not completely sure about less crime due to less people, I was simply thinkin that people wouldn't have anything to fight over if there was enough for everybody willing to do their part to gain it.Yes, but we do not know that homosexuality is not inherited, and it is the arguments like this that make people want to prove that homosexuality is genetic. Also, people born infertile cannot reproduce, so are those people inferior in a relationship because of what they cannot do?There is no harm in being teased for being different, so I see no reason to get rid of that. Besides, if no one can even come up with an explaination as to how they could tolerate heterosexual sex, much less enjoy it, they obviously can't want it so bad that they'd miss it too much anyway. I may have a slight, mild desire to mate with females, but it is not a desire I've ever acted on or neccisarily ever plan on acting on.I do not plan on rigidly or fascistly usurping the future, and to my knowledge some people have already been fertilized without mating. I am not saying to take away people's right to reproduce, they could be fertilized at any time. I was also not saying that people would now be required to be homosexual, I was simply saying if they all desired to be homosexual it would be useful. To my knowledge we cannot do the things you suggested, if we could I would support them.I'm sorry, I was under the impression that in order to mate the male must insert his genetalia into the female's, which I happen to know is at least sometimes only one millimeter in diameter. I simply did not see how a female could desire this, and how it could not be extremely damaging. Also, with lesbian activities the peg does not matter if nothing is inserted, and nothing needs to be inserted between two females.The structures of the vagina and the anus are similar, though, only the vagina is smaller in size. The female genetalia is perfectly round, like the anus, and both also have muscles around the edges to tighten and loosen the hole. There is only one difference, and that is that solid objects exit the anus on a regular basis, proving that they can fit.I never said you did, I think that.But it increases the population in and overpopulated world.They are worse for marriage, as it implies the couple married without love.If people had legalized gay marriage before marriage had started falling apart, then we could have it without damaging marriages. What we need is marriage reforms against divorce, while supporting gay marriage, as to show that they are two different things. People need to be convinced that marriage needs to be preserved, even if there is homosexual marriage.

No they were trying to not just find a singel gene but overall genetic causality in general. That is why there were so many studies. They have failed to find conclusive proof that sexuality of either type is geneticly derived. This in light of other behaviors is irrelevant. Handedness can also be learned, there is no proof it is geneticly derived or that it isn't but just because it is accepted as genetic doesn't validate that assumption or assumptions for any other behaviors. The tendancy to be nervous or rape or commit other crimes may or may not be genetically related. So far they have no proof but would you say that a person genetically predisposed to anxiety is a positive benefit. The justification that something may be genetic makes it some how "acceptable" is invalid. It may alleviate the feelings that individuals have no responsiblity for control of certain behaviors but that doesn't automatically mean those behaviors is a good or desireable thing. Let me ask you this... If it were found out tomorrow that we isolated a cluster of genes that are responsible for homosexuality AND had the ability to remove said genes out of individuals, would you strive to ensure that homosexuality is genetically protected or would you support individuals re-engiineering their children to weed out such trait, which by wrote could render homosexuality extinct eventually? Big question but an important one, because this is where I think alot of people are kidding themselves in this whole "gene vs. enviroment" debate. Were moving toward an era where we will be able to alter our own bodies on a genetic level, if there is the slightest iota of genetic homosexuality do you really think it will last through the "splicer" years. Cmon, you know it wouldn't and then gays would be fighting for legislation to make it illegal to genetically elimiate homosexuality and then where will we be. I dunno about that, but possibly. They do know that those afflicted with ADD have some unusual structures in their brains too. Last I heard they were investigating the causality of homosexuality with developmental deficencies in the brain. The jury is not out yetYes it is true that homosexuality was controversial, however it was not the controversy that lead to the decision being made to remove it. It was the act of one doctor who was sympathetic to homosexuals. It was the choice of one individual, based on compassion, not factual data. Patently dangerous and wrong in my opinion. No being Japanese is not a disorder. What you are neglecting is causality of depression and suicide. That is why I mentioned that the high rates cannot possibly be attributed to just homosexuals that are ostracized by the religious or openly hostile anti-gay individuals. There must be associative behavior and cause within the community, within these homosexual relationships themselves. Is that caused by homosexual brains? Unsure. Is it the indivduals themselves and the assosiative issues within the homosexual relationship. Quite likely, but still causality is not 100% clear. I'm sure if you delved deeper into the causes of Japanese suicides you would find a myriad of reasons much like any colletive with high suicide rates. On the issue of homosexuality and the bible, that is indeed unfortunate. Does that mean the bible should change to be more amenable to those commiting what was deemed sinful by it long ago. I don't think so. Granted I am not basing my arguements against homosexuality on biblical or other religious text but I think to "change" religion to suit society is dangerous. Even if you don't believe in a particular religion I don't think its wise to alter its credo to conform to society any more than it would be correct to force a religion on an individual. You run the risk of invalidating the true message of the religion. Its kinda like the debate about censoring literature with curse words or racial epithets in them. Many may feel offended that Twain used the "N" word but to alter what is an important work of art and not just literature for sake of political correctness damages the social fabric of how society has evolved and changed through the generations. I cannot offer an easy method for Homosexual Christians to feel better about themselves, but the fact that the conflict exists means that a certain individual feels a loyalty to more than just his personal desires. That is a struggle they weigh individually. What is more important, their sexuality or being moral within the framework of Chrisitanity, or Judiaism, or Islam for that matter. Just because the Christians are more vocal doesn't mean they are the only ones that religiously object to homosexuality either, how about smacking up some of the other religions?Well that may be your contention, but medically that is not necessarily true. Maybe being gay doesn't mean you are suicidal or depressed, but there is more of it going on in the gay life than in the hetero. That in itself is a wake up call. Depression and suicide are harmful, even if it doesn't touch you personally. If it were as simple as you say the APA wouldn't be re-evaluating "reorientation therapies" would they and with positive critiques too. You wouldn't have prominent gay activists like Camile Paglia deriding the gay community for being malcontent when those unhappy with being gay seek and desire the way to be hetero.I didn't say that a homosexual was more likely to cheat than a heterosexual. What I alluded to was the fact that one indivdual was making a statement against moral values, when he neglects to recognize the root of said morals. The same values that say murder, adultry and theft are wrong are the same values that say homosexuality is wrong. Just because its between two individuals doesn't mean no one else can be affected. You brought up how adultry is bad becaue it spreads disease. Hello, take a look at how many men have given their women AIDS from being on the "DL" and having gay sex. Homosexuality is capable of spreading and creating disease just like heterosexual sex, the difference is most heterosexuals that have sex with only their partner and are "healthy" are not at risk for an infection or condition that could be harmful to them by having sex. You cannot necessarily say that with homosexuals engaging in anal sex. Talk to a doctor about how damaging anal sex is and the different problems associated with anal penetration if you think I am joking. You don't see many cases of prolapsed rectums, and increases in rectal cancer due to vaginal sex. THe causality of those reactions to anal sex (within the male homosexual community) has been shown. Political correctness keeps most doctors hush hush about it though. Oh and BTW I do believe marriage is not just between two people who want to consolidate their finances. If adultry means what you said, then how come a marriage is not diissolved officially until a judge declares divorce? What about if the couple reconciles the adultry incident and continues on with their marriage? I think the nuances of adultry are more complicated then your simplistic understanding.I'm not going to get into a religious debate, but I can appreciate someone taking a religious stance against it. Why do I think it is wrong? I think its wrong in the sense that it is treated as equal to heterosexualty. Its not, it cannot be, and that is no ones fault but natures. Nature doesn't allow homosexual sex to create life, to reproduce, and though humans use sex as entertainment, it obviously was meant for a greater purpose. Biology shows us we need both male and female to create life, that male and male doesn't create life, that indivdual gratification doesn't create life. If you want to attach relgious or philosophical significance to sex you may at this juncture. That is why I think it is wrong. Humanity wouldn't be around if homosexuality were the standard, homosexuals wouldn't exist without heterosexuals. You may be looking for a more fundamental "morality" to my basis. I choose to validate my beliefs on science and years of living proof of heterosexualitie's superiority, and when I mean hetero superiority I mean strict hetero adhearance, no socially unacceptable behavior being thrown in like "cheating" or "rape". Ah but that is conjecture. At least in this country you cannot fully guage this becaue we have not had years of same sex marriage. Basically you are saying that homosexuals would be less likey to cheat on each other if same sex marriage were instituted. I'd like to see your supporting data on this. Take a look at some societies that have had same sex marriages for a while now and you might be surprised. In Sweden the rate of divorce amongst same sex couples surpasses heterosexual divorce. So sexual preference is no measure of security against adultry or cheating.No, in Denmark, the rates of cohabilitation and out of wedlock births went up and heterosexual marriage is declining because the population sees the same sex marriage as an excuese to live lifestyles where traditional family is outdated. This is also happening in Sweden and Norway. Basically heteros see the society as so open that there is no longer any need for traditional family, that cohabilitation and single parent homes are just as acceptable as traditional marriage. If these countries are good indicators like they seem to be then other nations will follow the same route. I don't think that would be a positive thing for the U.S. or any nation for that matter. Right now what is known as the Norweigian Cohabilitation Syndrome is got its claws into Britian, where more individuals are having children with partners and living with them instead of marrying them. This syndrome is having a slow creep into the U.S. as well. Though there is not guarantee same sex marriage will not hasten this and other deteriorating family values, the trend is looking pretty bleak and hastening not slowing family disolution.Hey if Denmark wants to limit their populations with these measures that is their business but where is the voice of those in Denmark that want better? Its been forced out by the homosexual agenda.This sounds Socio-fascist to me. Reproduction via artificial means is NEVER a first resort. It is a last resort for those that are having difficulty having children or unable to produce children through natural means. Its not a panacea and should never be treated as such. Ever read Brave New World? THe desire to curb accidental births is admirable but, who gets the responsibility. Some big brother government like in China where state sanctioned abortions is the way or do people get to have freewill over their reproductive rights. All you are suggesting is just another means of limiting choice in a world of shrinking choices. Its altruistic that you want everyone in the world to be fed but how about getting countries with crappy governments to take care of their populations first before you force other nations into a communist wealth sharing scheme. I'd love to see Castro stripped to the bone, if it meant the people of Cuba could live normal lives. Just throwing wealth at poverty is unwise, especially when the majority of these poor countries are run by "fat cat" potentates that rob their citizens of luxury and basic necessity. I also think your statement about children and parents is "polyanna" reasoning. There is no evidence to say that parents and children would somehow become closer through enforced or regulated reproduction. I'd like to see some data on that one. As for limiting hate crimes against gays, I would rather see hate crimes against gays be punished like any other "hate crime" and stop priveledging gays because someone commits an offense against them. An offense is an offense, sexuality may be the root cause but I don't think gays deserve a special preference over any other individual subjected to prejudical hate. All that does is send a message that one group of individuals deserves a special beneficance over another. And I would like to see corrolary data from you supporting your arguement that a smaller more controlled population would bring these issues under control. You may be right but I don't think your small collective would have much freewill in their society and I am definately no supporter of socialist societies. Ah but interracial marriages were only socially prejudiced. There was no real biological basis for the prejudice. We know that interracial diversity is biologically sound. Sometimes there are genetic or congenital anomollies that can be detrimental to the offspring of interracial couples, but these conditions do not preclude the validity of said relationships. You are trying to equate sexuality with racial diversity. This is a false equation, for one, we do know racial traits are inherited and that races can interracially reproduce. This trumps homosexuality's abilities two fold. This is a poor arguement for eugenics, population control and support of gay marriage. You could also replace an entire countries clothing with uniforms, that way everyone will dress alike and thus the risk of some poor soul being teased for looking "different" will be diminished. Don't see alot of demand for that. The idea that technology is going to save us by keeping our population in check is Orwellian if not Huxleyian and totally abhorent to most. Maybe you would gladly give up your right to reproduce for sake of a that has for the past 100 years never reached fruition. I don't see many people supporting your cause if it means destroying individual freedoms for the sake of a "statist" ideal. All this is Malthusian socialism. We eliminated that idea once we reached the industrial revolution. If we are so great with technology to use it so drastically like you claim, why not attempt to colonize another planet within our system or build underwater colonies. At least you are broadening horizions for future growth and not rigidly and fascistly usurping the future. Well be cynical if you want, if someone in your family had done as you ascribed you wouldn't be here to be so glib. Nor would the human race or any other species where penile-vaginal sex takes place. I guess all those years of biological reproduction show it. You will also notice I didn't make it an absolute statement. I said "minimal or negligable physical damage".I understand that female biology undergoes truama too during sex, the fact is the trauma of vaginal sex i.....1. more forgiving and 2. Obviously possible of greater/important final result. And um, like with lesbian activities, the size of the "peg" also matters so how do you know lesbian activities are a lot less harmful.. Ahem, maybe you better talk to a doctor about the differences in sexual trauma between vaginal sex and anal sex. Its alot more than "ramming the peg in the vagina." as you so eloquently put it. In fact is not mainly an issue of penile force as much as it is the structures and purposes of say a vagina versus an anus. I didn't say reproduction was a bad thing. I think its a good thing and it does make the family superior and makes heterosexual behavior superior and right in my eyes. I think "reinventing" the family to support cohabilitaing adults and homosexuals wishing to adopt and raise children is a bad thing. I don't like divorce or out of wedlock parenting, I consider them bad for marriage as much as I consider gay marriage to be. The fact ot the matter is were discussing bans on gay marriage. Well, to be banned it would have to have been legal in the first place. Here in the states it never was so technically it cannot be banned yet. However I am not for legalizing gay marriage as I see it as an affront to heterosexual marriage and family and supporting ideals that to me are not productive to society. Nature may afford homosexual behavior, it is not that behavior that creates societey and life so therefore I don't recognize the claims of equality. Denmark serves as a great example becasue in their full acceptance of gay marriage they have sent a message that the traditional family is a negative thing, its passe and the incomplete family that so many were against for quite some time is now chique and acceptable. They tried to say in all the instances where gay marriage was accepted in society that heterosexual marriage was strengthed, but they failed seeing how low heterosexual marriage has fallen and the rate of single parent "families" and cohabilitations have risen along gay marriage. Maybe in Denmark the population will drop off in another decade or so, as less get married, maybe most will not have children. Then what of the future of Denmark? Maybe the government will get concerned and promote traditional marriage? Maybe they will abolsh gay marriage and things will repair themselves over time? Who knows, but its looking real bleak for Scandanavian states these days. Who knows how this will affect their cultural identity in the next generation.

I would say Christianity as we know it is a product of Rome but that's neither here nor there. In my world Semitic people are "white" just like Polynesians since they aren't "oriental"(mongoloid) or black(negroid). Maybe the concept of only three races has fallen from favor but it works for me.

OK, first off, as you said, you don't agree that a homosexual lifestyle is right and should be legislated against (or at least not protected to the same way as heterosexual ones are). You are Homophobic as far as anyone in the UK would say- you don't like gays, fear is misleading term and these 'phobias' are not really about that. If you thought that jewish weddings should not be legal and that common jewish practices should be thought of as bad then I would say you are anti-semetic. Homosexuality being genetic is not certain, there isn't a gay gene in humans (though in other organsims) but there could be a gentic tendancy being the result of a combination of specific alleles across several genes.Gay marriage degrades the institution- no proof so far at all. Even the stats from denmark posted by someone else can be interpreted in a very different way- gay marriage was legalised becasue the population had a less opinion on the importance of 'traditional marraiges', hence fewer getting married. The actual legalisation of gay marriage had nothing to do with it. It also has nothing to do with the religious aspect as this is mopt beog forced on anyone, all that is happening is that two people of the same sex who wish to live together will gain protection and benefits from the law for doing so. Actual 'marriage' has very little to do with it which is more a relgious term, it just happens to be the name given to the set of rules that govern behaviours of which traditional marriage comes under.Homosexuality is not a disorder, plain and simple. Show some proof that genuine psychologists actual beleive this, if it was a disorder then this wouldn't even be an issue. Gay marriage would never have come up. It is unsual, yes, but it is not a mental disorder.See above.Depends how you define descimination and the act itself, we have been over this and taken it apart. If everyone has to follow shintoism and christianty is banned then there is no discrimination? If blacks can not enter white shops and whites can not enter black shops is this not discrimination?Last two points are irrelevant, can be argued either way. Should the majority always be able to impose on the minority, or should society step in to help those that are the minority?No proofs, just opinons.

I think that is an overly broad statement. No man is an island. Behavior in society affect all society. People are concerned with their levels of decency. Poeple have values. If you look at the definition of values you'll see its the acceptable standard of proper behavior. People wiht values don't accpet things below their values because of the affect on society.People feel that improving society does helpt their families. If they don't stand up for their values who will?

Up to a point. I was just saying certain people obsessed with making a mirror image of the behaviour of everyone else, when that behaviour does not affect those certain people, could actually get a life and have more time to focus on their very own families if they wanted to.

homosexuality is maladaptive, abnormal, and condiered unjustifiable. It's not a consensus but it fits that defintion. Ask any colon or general instestinal specialist. Ask some obgyn about homosexuality.Homosexuality in public is obscene as is voyerism in public. Also it's considered non-conducive to the public interest.First off you're making broad blacket statements. Just because some couldn't continue as heterosexuals doesn't mean everyone that has converted is experiencing all of those signs. Think of homosexuality in terms of any type of treatment. Some succeed and some don't. Those that succeed usually have some motivation such as families, religions, opportunities. Those that fail usually don't have much motivation.God is all loving. A parent loves all their children but hates their behavior that is unacceptable. God loves everyone, even me.Then polygamy is two consenting adults. One jsut happens to be married. Waht about relatives? Polygamy is considered more acceptable worldwide. Gay marriages are not considered acceptble in over 90% of the world population. Homosexuality is still considered not acceptable by the general population.
attacks
It is not a disorder, because it does not harm. In order for something to be considered a disorder it must be abnormal, maladaptive, and unjustifiable. You may define homosexuality as abnormal, and due to the low population of homosexuals it is abnormal, however it is not maladaptive. It is not adaptive, unless you consider the advantages due to the lowering of the population, but I do not see how it is maladaptive. What harm can come from it?Also, those who seem to overcome it, whether they really do or not, are often more depressed afterwords. If anything, these people forcing themselves into a heterosexual relationship is a sign of disorder. To sleep with someone you are not attracted to is abnormal, and due to the depression it causes it is maladaptive. It is also unjustifiable to do this, as anyone would notice the inconsistancy of the bible if they believe it says that homosexuality is wrong. God is all loving, but then he damns gays to hell for all time, and they have no choice in the matter. How can someone not see that is unfair, and not very loving. Actually, my heterosexual friends would be more loving than him, as they are able to love homosexuals without even having the slightest desire to make them suffer because of it.How would this be consistant in its ruling? It would be ruling that any two consenting adults could marry. These behaviors do not fall under that same catagory, and if you think they are in anyway similar you are very wrong. The only similarity is that both are not considered sociably acceptable in this day in age, but many things we do today would once be considered unacceptable. When these things became acceptable, we did not suddenly say everything else, no matter how unrelated, should be considered okay in order to stay consistant, because it would be another issue entirely and consistancy would have nothing to do with it.

I did address the harm. Read above posts. I'm legislating whot they can love. We are legislating puclic interests and what we want to recognize by this government.

The thing is, you're not just talking about challenging someone's beliefs, you're talking about legislating who they can love- not based on abuse or harm, but on religious or personal beliefs.

There is not proof of that. Only specualtions. If you believe in evolution thre is no prooof these family structures did not exist before humans. The car analogy is flawed because the standard is how it operates not what is done to meet those requirements.First off there is no "Christian Church". There are many. Some did change their views and I beleive they did lose credibility. It was more men than the Church itself imposing these views. Also not all of the Churches were opposed to it. It was mostly here in the US and the south and midwest.The people deem what is acceptable behavior. It favors the majority. Most of laws are made according to morals of the majority whcih happent to be Christian. It's not fair to the minority but it's the best we standard we can come up with. The laws can't violate the consittuion. So many things are subjective so the that is why we have checks and balances.

Sorry about that.Still, the definition of a family did change at one point.So changing the standards on how cars were made so that they would be less likely to stall was a negative thing? It is true that if you change your ideas too often without explaination, you loose respect, but if you refuse too often you become like glass. The reason glass breaks so easily is because it doesn't bend, so if too much force is applied to it, it shatters. If someone refuses to change their views, even when reason tries to force them to, they can't handle it.Not to mention the fact that the Christian Church has changed it views before, and it's still strong and respected. For example, did you know that the Christian Church once fought against interracial marriages? And that it used to be against women being seen as man's equal? If these views hadn't changed, the growing support of women's rights and interracial marriages would have smashed the church like a mirror.Yes, but change my example to something that is behavior, like watching Angel, and saying that the rights are the same for those who do and do not like the show, would that be fair to those who like the show?

No it is not. Homosexuality is none of those things.Ask these people about what? Are you talking to these people for some reason, and could you provide us with their phone numbers?Have a phone number of an obgyn? Talked to one recently about homosexuality? What did he or she have to say about it, and how does it apply generally to all gay couples?Why is homosexuality in public obscene? What is the connection to voyerism?Having people in loving stable relationships and stable families, same-sex, or not, is good for the public interest. Being a busybody who is concerned with what other consenting couples, same or different sex, may or may not be doing in bed, is not good for the public interest. People's families and religious backgrounds normally push them into those phoney-baloney programs.I spoke to God, and she told me she doesn't like your homophobic behaviour. My parents always taught me not to behave with prejudice.In patriarchal societies where both women and gay men don't have equality. When was the world population polled? Should other aspects of these societies be brought to the USA? We're not arguing for polygamous marriages, or weddings for relatives, or for other aspects of other societies. Same-sex marriage is already legal in the USA. You're basing that on poll numbers in the U.S. which change with the wind?

I think that is an overly broad statement. No man is an island. Behavior in society affect all society. People are concerned with their levels of decency. Poeple have values. If you look at the definition of values you'll see its the acceptable standard of proper behavior. People wiht values don't accpet things below their values because of the affect on society.People feel that improving society does helpt their families. If they don't stand up for their values who will?

No according to history and current events.Yeah but they don't. TEHy also don't claim to be prophets.It's not proof it's jsut corrollary or the biggest statistical coincidence ever.There are n ew testment laws that prohibit homosexuality.According to some.

According to the scriptures themselves?Anyone can claim that, including those who say homosexuality is cool according to their own higher power.Even if there is, it doesn't prove they are God or God inspired.The person I was responding to I believe was referring to the Levitican laws which many believe state that homosexuality is an abomination. I pointed to the other drastic Levitican laws we don't observe.It isn't a disorder.There is no recognized treatment, because it is not a disorder.It is unique and beautiful and wonderful, and not detrimental.Because of that one poll you posted a while ago that showed 52% think it's immoral?

What current events?Yes they do.So if they go by some other name, use some other form, they are wrong, and yours are right?What statistics do you mean?We could have big arguments about that, and about other new testament laws that we do not use today. It's interesting that someone who was a while ago, telling me to not quote literally, but in context, when it came to passages some people don't like, would not use context and interpretation when it comes to passages that relate to homosexual activities. Well, straight people may come into the offices of various specialists about problems. That's their business. If a gay person or a straight person goes into see a colon specialist, for whatever reason, that's their business. Being gay, doesn't mean you will have to see a colon specialist. For what? Anal sexual activity? Not all gays do that, but have a wide variety of activities. Some heterosexuals do this. Not everyone who does that form of penetration will experience problems, just as with other forms of penetration. It depends on how one does it. And I restate, that it is only the business of those engaged in the activity. Those polling numbers constantly change. Where in the world do we have a direct democracy, where rights are purely popularity contests?

There are already threads about this. Use of the Bible to bolster arguments against homosexuals, Jews, Black people, etc., are historically constant. The Bible is a collection of many texts, written over thousands of years, and there are passages which can be taken out of context to mean all kinds of things. In point of fact, if we were to evaluate the relative value of different sexualities based on potential health concerns or injuries, all women should be lesbians. Men, I guess, would be outta luck completely.Even in direct democracies, the rights of ten percent of the population are not insignificant. For example, in First Peoples direct democracies, homosexuality and other variations of gender norms were not only tolerated, but celebrated. Such people are considered extra powerful because of their ambiguity and their knowledge of more than one way of being.

And a lot of things taken in context mean exaclty what the anti-homosexual party want them to. This isn't the point, why should someone's religious text be froced on anyone if they don't agree if it is purely a religious issue. Perhaps it would be better if the US had something closer to France's 'freedom from religion' rather than its 'freedom of religion', but that is the topic for another thread.Are there any official recognised (by their peers and the rest of the scientific community) organisations that do beleive that homosexuality is a disorder? There is a central board that decides what is and what is not a legally recognised disorder is there not?As for quoting Polls for current opinions, what do the anti-homosexuals think about this one?

Data on long-term outcomes for children placed in homosexual households are very limited and the available evidence reveals grave concerns. Those current studies that appear to indicate neutral to favorable results from homosexual parenting have critical flaws such as non-longitudinal design, inadequate sample size, biased sample selection, lack of proper controls, and failure to account for confounding variables.2,3,4 Childrearing studies have consistently indicated that children are more likely to thrive emotionally, mentally, and physically in a home with two heterosexual parents versus a home with a single parent. 5,6,7,8,9 Therefore, the burden is on the proponents of homosexual parenting to prove that moving further away from the heterosexual parenting model is appropriate and safe for children.Risks of Homosexual Lifestyle to ChildrenViolence among homosexual partners is two to three times more common than among married heterosexual couples. 10,11,12,13,14 Homosexual partnerships are significantly more prone to dissolution than heterosexual marriages with the average homosexual relationship lasting only two to three years. 15,16,17 Homosexual men and women are reported to be inordinately promiscuous involving serial sex partners, even within what are loosely-termed "committed relationships." 18,19,20,21,22 Individuals who practice a homosexual lifestyle are more likely than heterosexuals to experience mental illness,23,24,25 substance abuse,26 suicidal tendencies,27,28 and shortened life spans.29 Although some would claim that these dysfunctions are a result of societal pressures in America, the same dysfunctions exist at inordinately high levels among homosexuals in cultures were the practice is more widely accepted.30 Children reared in homosexual households are more likely to experience sexual confusion, practice homosexual behavior, and engage in sexual experimentation. 31,32,33,34,35 Adolescents and young adults who adopt the homosexual lifestyle, like their adult counterparts, are at increased risk of mental health problems, including major depression, anxiety disorder, conduct disorder, substance dependence, and especially suicidal ideation and suicide attempts.36ConclusionThe research literature on childrearing by homosexual parents is limited. The environment in which children are reared is absolutely critical to their development. Given the current body of research, the American College of Pediatricians believes it is inappropriate, potentially hazardous to children, and dangerously irresponsible to change the age-old prohibition on homosexual parenting, whether by adoption, foster care, or by reproductive manipulation.

I don't believe the majority use the term "disorder" when referring to homosexuality in nature.I didn't say it wasn't true that heterosexuality is natural. Homosexuality is natural too. If homosexuality went against the law of nature, humans would not be able to violate that law.Maybe you need to get out more. Does something being unusual make it good or bad?There are many reasons why people use condoms. It avoids disease(natural) and pregnancy. It also reduces sensation slightly which can delay climax. This makes the sexual act more pleasurable, but doesn't help reproduction.Even if the majority are not like that for perhaps all their lives? Even if it does not lead to reproduction?Children deserve to know that their relationships with both of their parents are stable and legally recognized. This applies to all children, whether their parents are of the same or opposite sex. The American Academy of Pediatrics recognizes that a considerable body of professional literature provides evidence that children with parents who are homosexual can have the same advantages and the same expectations for health, adjustment, and development as can children whose parents are heterosexual.1–9 When 2 adults participate in parenting a child, they and the child deserve the serenity that comes with legal recognition. http://aappolicy.aappublications.org...cs%3b109/2/339No, not slaves to anything. But this doesn't make something right or wrong, including with being gay. If that is true, it doesn't mean humans necessarily have a need for the particular structure of Christianity.But not necessarily through reproduction. How they've tied it into with Darwin's, is to say that those who engage in kin selection help others to reproduce by acting as helpers, without reproducing themselves.Your thoughts can create your mental condtion.I'm glad most others today encourage people to accept themselves.Who is being complacent?He's obsessed with the idea he is going to hell, because of what he has been taught. Apparently God put him into this marriage of his where he doesn't care for his wife, but God isn't responsible for him being gay. I'll come back with a link for religious addiction. It concerns an obsession with rules, and not thinking for one's self, with being perfect. Everything is black and white, heaven or hell. I just basically advised him to get therapy for that, and other issues. Then he attacked me, and won't speak to me or anyone else who was trying to give him advice(Christians), because he can't handle criticism of anything that challenges his particular viewpoint. After all, it's God's plan for him that he should be miserable denying who he is. He even said dying may be the only cure for being gay. He's tried and tried not to be gay. I don't know how God would expect to be served if God puts the person in an inescpable situation where the person is so depressed that the person wants to die. I really did not try to push my lack of religion onto him. I told him he was just using his own religion in a destructive way, and the problem was not with religion itself. I really don't think his problems are because he is not as successful as the heterosexual. He certainly has tried to "succeed" at being something he is not.

Once again, no it isn't. It still has to be harmful to be a disorder, otherwise its just a less common phenotype. What you are putting in as laws of nature are not really what they actually mean, you can not break physical laws, they are fundamental discriptions of the universe- not common trends or an idealised behaviour like our human laws are. Not sure what you mean by enabling more?And that is all, not a disorder.Getting dangerously close to eugeneics here, in what way is someones genes anything to do with us or that their beleifs are being allowed to continue to the next generation. If that kind of stuff was legislated against then that would be far more damamging to soiceity than allowing gay marriage. Would you prefer a less pious more tolerant society, or a return of the nazi gas chambers?

The poeple would be equal. The religions would not. Look at our country. Almost all Christian beleifs are legal and no other non-Christians Churches have almost all their legal beleifs.That's it? Crime? That's it. The criminal link? So if they criminalized homosexuality then it would be okay to ban gay marriage. Homosexuality has links to crime too. Sodomy is a crime.Define harm becaue homosexuality is harmful according to many.

But they obviously wouldn't be equal, because a significant proportion of the population would be restricted from worshipping how they want in a for that hurts nobody.These elements mostly have links to crime over and above the act itself, that justifies restrictions. Homosexuality doesn't.

OK, first off, as you said, you don't agree that a homosexual lifestyle is right and should be legislated against (or at least not protected to the same way as heterosexual ones are). You are Homophobic as far as anyone in the UK would say- you don't like gays, fear is misleading term and these 'phobias' are not really about that. If you thought that jewish weddings should not be legal and that common jewish practices should be thought of as bad then I would say you are anti-semetic. Homosexuality being genetic is not certain, there isn't a gay gene in humans (though in other organsims) but there could be a gentic tendancy being the result of a combination of specific alleles across several genes.Gay marriage degrades the institution- no proof so far at all. Even the stats from denmark posted by someone else can be interpreted in a very different way- gay marriage was legalised becasue the population had a less opinion on the importance of 'traditional marraiges', hence fewer getting married. The actual legalisation of gay marriage had nothing to do with it. It also has nothing to do with the religious aspect as this is mopt beog forced on anyone, all that is happening is that two people of the same sex who wish to live together will gain protection and benefits from the law for doing so. Actual 'marriage' has very little to do with it which is more a relgious term, it just happens to be the name given to the set of rules that govern behaviours of which traditional marriage comes under.Homosexuality is not a disorder, plain and simple. Show some proof that genuine psychologists actual beleive this, if it was a disorder then this wouldn't even be an issue. Gay marriage would never have come up. It is unsual, yes, but it is not a mental disorder.See above.Depends how you define descimination and the act itself, we have been over this and taken it apart. If everyone has to follow shintoism and christianty is banned then there is no discrimination? If blacks can not enter white shops and whites can not enter black shops is this not discrimination?Last two points are irrelevant, can be argued either way. Should the majority always be able to impose on the minority, or should society step in to help those that are the minority?No proofs, just opinons.

I know there are people in the UK who agree with you, but they are in a much greater minority then in the US and are far more isolated to the extremes (generally the older population and those who already have extreme fringe groups). So you like gays, but just don't think they should be treated equally and be allowed to choose the lifestyle you want- some friend you are. You oppose gay rights and consider it a mental disorder, that fits quite well into the common defintion of homophobic. If you beleive what you do you have no problem being homophobic as there is a definite reason for it, howwever don't try to pretend you are a friend in anyway to them.Likewise, if it is not genetic there would no real reason not to accomodate it is there? Also there isn't a great deal of higher organisms studied other than mice and even then there isn't a great deal of pressure looking for them. Just isn't the most common kind of genentic research.Are these civil unions divorcing at the same rate as non relgioius marriages? Do we mean civil union as purely gay marriage as well, the term changes from place to place? Not sure if you looked at the stats compared to marriages between non religious people it would be very different. And how does someone else divorcing reduce the chance you will stay with your partner?meh, everyone else gets too, felt it was my turn.The religion analogy is fine, the individual descrimation is religious rather than sexual. We just have laws banning one and not the other at the momentShinto beleiver- can go to temple, but not chuchChristian beleiver - can go to temple, but not churchStraight man - can marry womanGay man - can marry womanSame? Yes.The majority doesn't decide what is acceptable behaviour, nor should it. The majority is controlled by minorities which really decide what is good and what is not and then tell the majority what to beleive. It is the only way a society can operate if you don't want massive persecution of minorities

Okay, you've only proved that homosexuality is maladaptive in males just now, and only then if they mate. Also, there is a lot of harmful behavior that is worse than that that is not considered a disorder, like playing football. You can be injured doing that, but as it doesn't fit under the other two catagories, it is not considered a disorder. Homosexual intercourse is justifiable, it would be unjustifiable to expect two people in love to never have a physical relationship.Yes, but you can not prove that they are no longer homosexual, just that they no longer act on what they desire.Yes, but a loving parent does not make rules for no reason. There has to be some way that it is harmful to someone for it to be unacceptable. Also, they wouldn't make a rule against some slightly harmful behavior without making rules against more harmful behavior, like spending all your time watching sports or playing football, which can cause injuries. Or going to a Catholic Church, did you know that all that kneel sit stand stuff can cause damage to your kneecaps?Polygamy is between more than two consenting adults, because everyone in the marriage is married to more than one person. Relatives may end up getting married, but they are just as likely to if gays can or can not get married. After all, if two relatives fall in love they can fight for it just as well with or without gay marriage. Personally, I don't think gay marriage has any effect on it, because if it gets enough support we will end up with it, gay marriage being legal or not.

homosexuality is maladaptive, abnormal, and condiered unjustifiable. It's not a consensus but it fits that defintion. Ask any colon or general instestinal specialist. Ask some obgyn about homosexuality.Homosexuality in public is obscene as is voyerism in public. Also it's considered non-conducive to the public interest.First off you're making broad blacket statements. Just because some couldn't continue as heterosexuals doesn't mean everyone that has converted is experiencing all of those signs. Think of homosexuality in terms of any type of treatment. Some succeed and some don't. Those that succeed usually have some motivation such as families, religions, opportunities. Those that fail usually don't have much motivation.God is all loving. A parent loves all their children but hates their behavior that is unacceptable. God loves everyone, even me.Then polygamy is two consenting adults. One jsut happens to be married. Waht about relatives? Polygamy is considered more acceptable worldwide. Gay marriages are not considered acceptble in over 90% of the world population. Homosexuality is still considered not acceptable by the general population.

Thank you so much for these misrepresented statistics from the board of directors of this not so prestigious, 2 year old, right-wing political organization. What was I thinking posting from the American Academy of Pediatrics?I just love the part where they state that homosexual partnerships are more prone to breaking up, compared to heterosexual marriage. Do all heterosexuals marry the first person they have a partnership with?Oh, and what a surprise, heterosexual marriages last longer than the average gay relationship! Just like in my previous example, this is an apples and oranges comparison. Not all heterosexuals who are in relationships are married. They also cited the Bell and Weinberg study from the 1970's. Gay men in sex clubs and gay singles bars and gay book stores were interviewed, and found to be promiscuous. The heterosexuals surveyed were from residential areas, some included married couples. In order for the samples to be comparable they would have to survey heterosexuals from hetero singles bars, hetero sex clubs, and hetero book stores. For all we know their findings could have indicated what life was like for the average single person in San Fran in the 1970's. Also, some other studies were misrepresented.For example, the claims of more domestic violence in gay relationships cites the Island and Letellier study. It's authors have shown how they were quoted completely out of context by right-wing anti-gay groups...http://www.afaexposed.com/a_letellier.htmlAlso the authors of the original study on gay life expectancy have had their study misrepresented by anti-gay groups, as the authors show in this article in the International Journal of Epidemiology...http://ije.oupjournals.org/cgi/content/full/30/6/1499Obsessed with the idea that he is going to hell if he doesn't follow all the rules, wanting to die because he sees it as the only "cure"? Attacks anyone who questions his beliefs. That indicates a problem with religion. He has a wide diversity of opinions presented to him. I did not attack religion as I wrote previously. I told him he had to consider that he was using religion in a destructive way.Yes, it really is. It shows the dark side of the ex-gay "program". You are the last person he needs to talk to.

Since animal genetics and behavior is quite consitent when somehting deviates so far it's considered a disorder.Laws of nature are physical laws. Disorders occur and we learn to deal wiht them. It does mean enable them more.I'm referring to that it would be the exception not the norm.It still is enabling reproductive desires. These desires are based upon genetic desires that are in many ways still in the public interest.Yes becaue it is the basic element that encourages us to build families.You're going to live and die on what the board of the APA says, regardless if it sin't a general consensus. If they ever changed their position you'll have no legitimicay.Heterosexual parenting is the normative model upon which most comprehensive longitudinal research on childrearing has been based. Data on long-term outcomes for children placed in homosexual households are very limited and the available evidence reveals grave concerns. Those current studies that appear to indicate neutral to favorable results from homosexual parenting have critical flaws such as non-longitudinal design, inadequate sample size, biased sample selection, lack of proper controls, and failure to account for confounding variables.2,3,4 Childrearing studies have consistently indicated that children are more likely to thrive emotionally, mentally, and physically in a home with two heterosexual parents versus a home with a single parent. 5,6,7,8,9 Therefore, the burden is on the proponents of homosexual parenting to prove that moving further away from the heterosexual parenting model is appropriate and safe for children.Risks of Homosexual Lifestyle to ChildrenViolence among homosexual partners is two to three times more common than among married heterosexual couples. 10,11,12,13,14 Homosexual partnerships are significantly more prone to dissolution than heterosexual marriages with the average homosexual relationship lasting only two to three years. 15,16,17 Homosexual men and women are reported to be inordinately promiscuous involving serial sex partners, even within what are loosely-termed "committed relationships." 18,19,20,21,22 Individuals who practice a homosexual lifestyle are more likely than heterosexuals to experience mental illness,23,24,25 substance abuse,26 suicidal tendencies,27,28 and shortened life spans.29 Although some would claim that these dysfunctions are a result of societal pressures in America, the same dysfunctions exist at inordinately high levels among homosexuals in cultures were the practice is more widely accepted.30 Children reared in homosexual households are more likely to experience sexual confusion, practice homosexual behavior, and engage in sexual experimentation. 31,32,33,34,35 Adolescents and young adults who adopt the homosexual lifestyle, like their adult counterparts, are at increased risk of mental health problems, including major depression, anxiety disorder, conduct disorder, substance dependence, and especially suicidal ideation and suicide attempts.36ConclusionThe research literature on childrearing by homosexual parents is limited. The environment in which children are reared is absolutely critical to their development. Given the current body of research, the American College of Pediatricians believes it is inappropriate, potentially hazardous to children, and dangerously irresponsible to change the age-old prohibition on homosexual parenting, whether by adoption, foster care, or by reproductive manipulation. This position is rooted in the best available science.http://www.acpeds.org/?CONTEXT=art&c...KIT=2920801063AT least we agree desires doesn't dictate necessity or it's acceptance. No but it has been shown that prayer is beneficial.THey do help reproduce. Do gays do that? It's always in the best interest of the specie to help the group for the sacrifice of the few.Yeah they can lead to it. Still religion is not mental condition.How do you what they are? What if they're pedophiles?Anyone that doesn't continue to improve.That is not an example of religious addiction. That is an example of a religious man struggling with problems. If you talk to him like those anti-religious gay sites write about God, I wouldn't talk to you either.I have a hard time beleive it's exactly teh way you describe it. Do you mind If I contacted him?So if he fails then he wasn't meant to suceed?

Wow, I am surprised that an organization like the American College of Pediatricians would take such a strong stand like that. And with so little research done in the area. Ignoring the studies for just a second, I would expect a tendency for more instability in homosexual families because they are not institutionalized. A leading family sociologist, Andrew Cherlin, argues that one reason why stepfamilies are not as stable as intact families is that there is no rich tradition indicating what the guidelines are for stepfamilies. For example, what are the roles for a stepmother and an at-home stepchild? These families figure it out on a case-by-case basis since the stepfamily is not very institutionalized. These families tend to have more conflict and instability as a result. If homosexual couples are having or are caring for children without being married to each other, if Cherlin is right, those children may tend to do more poorly under current conditions and while homosexual marriage is new, but they would do much better in the future (maybe decades) once gay marriage was institutionalized. Another hunch I have, and it is just that, is that lesbian relationships would tend to be stable, maybe even as much or more than with heterosexual couples, because it is two women involved in a relationship. Women tend to be more commmitment-oriented. I wouldn't be surprised at all to see children do quite well in many of these homes. On the other hand, men tend to be less commitment-oriented and are, on average, less devoted to children, and I could easily see a high level of instability in these relationships. If I were a gay male and all my partners liked sex and independence as much as I naturally do, this does not seem to be a recipe for the long-term commitment that children demand. Of course, I am generalizing, and there would be many exceptions. As for the relevant studies I have run across, I have seen research showing more domestic violence among gay men, but once again, we are talking about two men, and men tend to be more violent than women. In addition, research indicates that the average cohabiting couple lives together between 18 and 24 months, and roughly half break up, the other half get married (and then half of those eventually divorce). So these numbers indicate a level of relationship instability that is apparently not much different from the gay couples as reported by that website, especially given the fact that gay couples do not have the stabilizing effects of institutionalized marriage.

Thank you so much for these misrepresented statistics from the board of directors of this not so prestigious, 2 year old, right-wing political organization. What was I thinking posting from the American Academy of Pediatrics?I just love the part where they state that homosexual partnerships are more prone to breaking up, compared to heterosexual marriage. Do all heterosexuals marry the first person they have a partnership with?Oh, and what a surprise, heterosexual marriages last longer than the average gay relationship! Just like in my previous example, this is an apples and oranges comparison. Not all heterosexuals who are in relationships are married. They also cited the Bell and Weinberg study from the 1970's. Gay men in sex clubs and gay singles bars and gay book stores were interviewed, and found to be promiscuous. The heterosexuals surveyed were from residential areas, some included married couples. In order for the samples to be comparable they would have to survey heterosexuals from hetero singles bars, hetero sex clubs, and hetero book stores. For all we know their findings could have indicated what life was like for the average single person in San Fran in the 1970's. Also, some other studies were misrepresented.For example, the claims of more domestic violence in gay relationships cites the Island and Letellier study. It's authors have shown how they were quoted completely out of context by right-wing anti-gay groups...http://www.afaexposed.com/a_letellier.htmlAlso the authors of the original study on gay life expectancy have had their study misrepresented by anti-gay groups, as the authors show in this article in the International Journal of Epidemiology...http://ije.oupjournals.org/cgi/content/full/30/6/1499Obsessed with the idea that he is going to hell if he doesn't follow all the rules, wanting to die because he sees it as the only "cure"?

Here is more about Spitzer's unpublished study, and its sample, including what Spitzer himself has to say about it...He was disappointed, however, that many reports overlooked his statements explaining that his sample was limited and that he was not maintaining that a substantial number of gays and lesbians could become straight if they sought reparative therapy. "For the vast majority it is not possible for them to change their sexual orientation," he said. Spitzer also acknowledged that "a lot of people will misuse" his findings, which could cause pain for many individuals. "It may help 5,000 people, but harm 500,000," he said. He is concerned, he added, that "the Christian right," with its intolerance of and opposition to homosexuality, will use his findings in its campaign to prevent gays and lesbians from gaining civil rights protections. http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/c.../full/36/13/20Spitzer learned from Stalstrom that his study was being misused—an outcome about which he has been concerned since his study was publicized last spring. He then wrote to Karkkainen, the lawmaker leading the charge against the bill, saying that he was "disturbed" that his study results were being "misused by those who are against antidiscrimination laws and civil unions for gays and lesbians." Spitzer explained that while his study results run counter "to the current view of most mental health professionals," who maintain that homosexuals cannot change their sexual orientation, his report was "based on a very unique sample." Such results "are probably quite rare, even for highly motivated homosexuals," he said. He added in his letter to the parliament member that "it would be a serious mistake to conclude" from his research that homosexuality is a "choice." He emphasized that he is concerned with "scientific issues" related to sexual orientation, and that he "personally favor[s] antidiscrimination laws and civil unions for homosexuals." In an interview with Psychiatric News, Spitzer also rejected the argument made by Finnish opponents of civil unions, as well as some people who hailed his study results earlier this year, that the decision to remove homosexuality as a DSM-III diagnosis was a political decision in which APA succumbed to pressure from gay groups and their allies in the profession. That argument is "nonsense," he emphasized. "Both sides of the controversy were convinced that science was on their side" when they made their decision. http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/c.../full/36/24/11It had taken Spitzer more than 18 months to find just 200 or so people willing to describe themselves as successfully converted. He found his interviewees by advertising through ex-gay organisations. Almost half were recruited through ex-gay ministries, and nearly a quarter by Narth. Religion was "extremely" or "very" important to 93% of them. One in five was a mental health professional (Cohen, for example, is a high-profile reparative therapist) or director of an ex-gay ministry, and more than three-quarters had previously lobbied for sexual reorientation. These are people who get paid to say that therapy works. For many critics, this alone was enough to discredit the exercise. An article in the APA's Psychiatric News likened it to testing a drug on people recruited by the pharmaceutical company. But in addition, many of the participants appeared to have been not so much altered from gay to straight, as bisexual all along. Ten per cent of the men had never had gay sex before therapy, whereas half had already slept with a woman. Only a third of the women and half the men said that before therapy they were "extremely" bothered by homosexual feelings. How gay were they? As with most statistics, everything depends on how they are read. The percentage who were "extremely bothered" by homosexual feelings after undergoing therapy fell to zero. You could say zero was a sensational turnaround; or you might say they weren't so gay in the first place. Two New York psychologists carried out another study of reparative therapy at the same time as Spitzer, and reached the opposite conclusion. "We interviewed 182 people who tried very hard to change," Dr Ariel Shidlo told Newsweek. "The stakes were really high for them. Some really thought that if they didn't change, they would literally find themselves in hell... And they still failed." http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/st...183596,00.htmlDrescher is concerned about the harm that patients can suffer after going through some of the conversion therapies, an issue not addressed in Spitzer’s selective patient sample. "Religious reparative therapies, like the faith healing from which they are derived, are a treatment modality that purports to provide definitive answers regarding human nature and sexuality. They always define homosexuality as wrong and require that individuals trying to change their sexual orientation submit to the therapist’s authority as a condition of treatment," he said in his annual meeting presentation. In the type of interventions Spitzer assessed, "it is the client’s compliance with the therapist’s authority, rather than the therapist’s interpretations, that will determine the outcome of treatment," Drescher suggested. "This is a clinical stance with troubling ethical implications."http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/c.../full/36/13/20

No there are people in the Uk that agree with me. Also I neve said I didn't liek gays. I don't agree with their lifestyle but i'm not afraid of it. Thanks for assuming though. I do feel Jewish wedding should be legal. I do not agree wiht their doctrine though. Keep digging though for some basis to call me homomphobic and to make an accurate analogy.No proof of that. Also predispostion doesn't mean the tendency has to be accommodated.Also there is not gay gene in other species just simple organisms that aren't even close to comparable to humans.There is proof of that. Civil unions in Vertmont are divorcing. Also it has helped to trivialize marriage by not lowering the standards.I do not have the space to go into a detailed analysis of the history leading up to the APA's decision.15 Nonetheless, it is a misconception to think that this came about only after dispassionate and scholarly discussion, and only after listening equally to all sides of the issue. Also, it is important to note that the APA's vote was anything but unanimous. Dr. Robert Spitzer, professor of psychiatry at Columbia University in New York, contributed to the 1973 decision by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) to remove homosexuality from its list of mental disorders. However, after talking with ex-gays, he decided to do a study. He presented his paper May 9, 2001 at the annual meeting of APA in New Orleans. In summary, he writes: “The subjects’ self-reports of change appear to be, by and large, valid, rather than gross exaggerations, brainwashing or wishful thinking. We therefore conclude that some individuals who participate in a sexual-reorientation therapy apparently make sustained changes in sexual orientation.”http://www.inoohr.org/apa.htmSee above.Tasty why do you make analogies taht aren't well thought out and not well are not even similar to our situation?The religon analogy is there is no individual discrimination only religious discrimination.White man rights- white storeblack man- black storesame?

Being a busybody who is concerned with what other consenting couples, same or different sex, may or may not be doing in bed, is not good for the public interest.

Also, he didn't do a follow-up study.They certainly did.This is an argument to not allow any sexual relationship. Other things are different from homosexuality, and will have their unique standards, regardless of whether or not we accept gay people. If these others want to fight to have their relationships equally recognized, they will do so regardless of whether or not we accept gay relationships. This was essentially the point of Nature's Cry I believe, and it's a good one.If the polling is flawed, as you say, how can we trust the numbers it produces?

Nudity in public is illegal, that's the difference. Many may not feel heterosexual acts in public are acceptable either. Many don't feel people walking downtown, or going door-to-door and handing out religious pamphlets, and trying to convert others to their religion is appropriate either.

Give us a break, the bibe saying 'in the future there will be Wars...and Earthquakes!' is hardly proof, that is beyond coincidence predicting that 'things will stay much the same as they are and natural events will occur as usual'. Abortions an unwed couples seems to have pretty much nothing to do with the last line.As for minorities and the constitution, the majority can change the constitution or just ignore it. It is in the majorities interest to support and accept minorities because pretty much everyone falls within one of them and minorites still have a significant number of people, maybe not the most important but enough to swing power between forces competting over the majority.

I thought this was where the problem started, that it wasn't a consitiutional thing, but a state thing and they defined marriage in different ways (not thinking gay marriage as being a possibility and having it just being the union of two adults or suchlike)As for the constitutional democracy, mroe like a group of wolves deciding what they want for dinner and the sheep having a peice of paper saying that they can't be eaten.

This is not equality. You are using the letter of the law to twist the purpose of the law, and even then doing it using very shaky logic. Equality is about general concepts, not specifics. It is equality to say 'everyone is has the same right to worship who they want', it is not equality to say 'everyone has the same right to worship who we tell them to'. That is equality within an unequal system, which cannot be counted. Can you re-phrase, I don't follow.No. As I said, those have strong links to criminal activity irrespective of the act itself being a crime. For example drug use has noted links to theft, the same just cannot be said for homosexuality.No it isn't. And even if it was, that has nothing to do with homosexuality anyway.Physical or psychological injury or damage. Homosexuality is therefore in no way harmful. And I have serous doubts about the 'many' who say it is.

The poeple would be equal. The religions would not. Look at our country. Almost all Christian beleifs are legal and no other non-Christians Churches have almost all their legal beleifs.That's it? Crime? That's it. The criminal link? So if they criminalized homosexuality then it would be okay to ban gay marriage. Homosexuality has links to crime too. Sodomy is a crime.Define harm becaue homosexuality is harmful according to many.

I would be interested to seehow the polls turn out if the questions 'do you beleive hmosexuality is wrong?' and 'do you think soe effort should be made to reduce homosexuality?' were asked alongside the 'do you think homosexual marriage should be recognised?'

I thought this was where the problem started, that it wasn't a consitiutional thing, but a state thing and they defined marriage in different ways (not thinking gay marriage as being a possibility and having it just being the union of two adults or suchlike)As for the constitutional democracy, mroe like a group of wolves deciding what they want for dinner and the sheep having a peice of paper saying that they can't be eaten. If the wolves want to get rid of the paper it is perfectly in their power.

They haven't violated the law, it just wouldn't be officially recognised. Marrying two pets together isn't illegal, it just is worthless in the eyes of the law. Banning Gay mariage isn't the issue, that would have wierd repercussions elsewhere with free speech and suchlike, the issue is recognising it. Still pretty sure that the state defintions of marriage came up as well at somepoint, or at least that was one of the issues reported here.Yeah well...this isn't really the forum for this but I still think it is just as pointless now as a piece of paper now.

The facts don't support the contention that homosexuality isn't harmful. The average life span for a gay man is considerably less than that of a heavy smoker even. A heavy smoker's life is shortened by 7.3 years on average. A gay or bisexual male's lifespan is shortened by 8 - 20 years! If for no other reason than an individual's health, homosexuality should be discouraged in the same way that smoking and drinking are discouraged nationally. The problem is that it's PC to be anti-smoking and not to be anti-homosexuality.http://www.afamichigan.org/articles/...ealthrisks.htmhttp://www.narth.com/docs/whitehead.html

The 8-20 years less life statistic for gay men comes from a study of gay men, with HIV, done of a select urban area(Vancouver) in the late 1980's and early 1990's. The authors wrote "Gay Life Expectancy Re-Visited" in the Internatinal Journal of Epidemiology, in response to anti-gay groups misuing their study...In contrast, if we were to repeat this analysis today the life expectancy of gay and bisexual men would be greatly improved. Deaths from HIV infection have declined dramatically in this population since 1996. As we have previously reported there has been a threefold decrease in mortality in Vancouver as well as in other parts of British Columbia.4 http://ije.oupjournals.org/cgi/content/full/30/6/1499

I suspected that this idea of AIDS becoming increasingly heterosexual was overblown so I looked at these stats:http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/stats/hasr140...anceReport.pdfLooking at the 30 areas in the country where cases are reported, over 1999-2002 (most recent years availalbe) new cases every year were going up more from male-males contacts compared to female hetersexual contact, and new male hetersexual cases went DOWN a tiny bit between 1999 and 2002. The trends are different if we look at national estimates (I can't figure out why the whole country is supposed to be going in the opposite direction of the 30 areas where data is actually reported.) Over the 1998-2002 5 year period, the average new cases went up 83 cases for male-male contact, it went up 181 cases for male heterosexual contact, and 235 additional cases each year for female heterosexual contact. With around 42,000 new AIDS cases each year, the slightly higher numbers for heterosexuals is not very significant. As of 2002, 45% of the total new cases were from male-male contact (or not being able to tell if it was male-male sex or sharing needles). At this pace, heterosexuals are NEVER going to catch up and contract AIDS at the rates  homosexuals do. A tiny group of Americans produces 45% of all new cases; heterosexual rates will never be that high. Another way of looking at it is to calculate what percentage of people are living with HIV/AIDS. The CDC doesn't give those numbers (that I could see) so I calculated and found that it is 4.97% of male homosexuals, and .09% for everyone else. That .09% is never ever going to catch up.While the risk of infection is 55 times higher for a male homosexual (4.97%/.09%) than everyone else, it is still a small minority of homosexuals that suffer from the disaese. Morevover, the rate of infection for lesbians is very low.

That 0.09% is of a much, much larger population than the 4.97% (I would guess that homosexuals make up less than one fifth of the population) which gives a much greater number of heterosexual sufferers. Its not that they could never catch up (making 55% of nwe cases means it will happen eventually), just it would take a long time now that awareness of the disease is more widespread.

It's a consideration for many reasons. It's a tremendous NEW tax on businesses, the Social Security System and Healthcare systems because this would create a new "dependent class" that doesn't presently exist. Make no mistake about it, Gay marriage IS about ECONOMICS. Any claims to the contrary are simply false. There are no scenarios in which gay partners can't enjoy the same treatment as a heterosexual couples. For example, the claim that they aren't allowed in a hospital room with their partner, for example, is false. Anybody can get a "medical power of attorney" which grants them the same access as family members.

Are you saying that gay people who pay into the same systems, shouldn't also benefit? Speaking of dependency, imagine a scenario where a gay person is in a same-sex marriage, that is not legally recognized. This person is also dependent on the other spouse. The marriage breaks up. Now, the taxpayer must support the dependent partner, because the marriage was not legally recognized. If it were legal, the richer partner could have been made to support the poorer one, after divorce.

I can safely predict that you will never see 4.97% of heterosexuals living with HIV/AIDS in the U.S. It took them 20 years to get to .09%, which is 1/55 of the homosexual rate. One trend I noticed is that new cases from IV drug use--mostly heterosexuals--is going down markedly. You may or may not be right about its relevance; my goal was only to dispel the idea that the gap in rates is narrowing significantly.

It is sooo easy to eat cheesy. I think it is a serious mistake to equate acceptance of homosexuality with acceptance of gay marriage. It is one thing to say homosexuality is not big deal so "live and let live," and quite another to be in favor of the state enshrining the lifestyle with a marriage license. The function of legal marriage is for society to formally say that we hold this union up as special and the preferable arrangement for adults. It's function is not to say since we don't really have serious problems with your lifestyle, here's a license. By the way, I want to amend an earlier post. I was arguing that homosexual relationships don't appear to be much more unstable than for heterosexuals. I later realized that I completely left out all heteros that marry without living together first (BIG error). Roughly half of heteros entering a serious relationship marry with out living together first; half of those never divorce. The average person marries at 26 and dies at 76, so these marriages are an average of 50 years. The average marriage that ends in divorce last an average of 7 years. As I wrote before, hetero cohabitors do three things; one half break up in an average of 20 months; one quarter eventually marry and divorce in 7 years average; and one quarter marry and never divorce, having an average marriage of 50 years. Doing all the calculations, the average hetero relationship lasts 21.8 years. The number is so high since one-third of heteros--whether or not cohabiting first--never divorce and are married for 50 years. So if the one study is correct that the average gay relationship lasts say 2 years, then we can validly conclude that while heteros currently have their share of problems, they are, on average, much more stable than homosexual relationships. Of course heteros have the advantage of having marriage available to them which is more binding than just living together, but these days the binding force of marriage does little to stop unsatisfied people from splitting up.

I disagree with your definition of the purpose of a LEGAL marriage. IMHO, when it comes to the state's involvement, it's all about the MONEY.What does the state require of, and offer to, a couple that is married vs. unmarried? As near as I can tell, there's only one difference, and it's how you're taxed. The state doesn't really care whether you love each other, whether you have children, how old each partner is, what religion you ascribe to, etc, etc... The state only cares that both partners are freely entering into what for all intents and purposes is nothing more than legal contract. That contract entitles you to certain benefits and tax credits, as you are now viewed as "one entity" rather than two individuals. Call it a marriage, call it a legal union, call it cheese, it doesn't matter to matter to me, but I just can't wrap my head around denying another person STATE BENEFITS (their tax dollars) based on their sexual orientation.I agree with your definition of a marriage as it pertains to religious beliefs. Each faith should be free to define marriage as it so chooses. I don't think state recognized marriages are a threat to the religious sacrament of marriage in any way. It's apples and oranges IMHO.Waxy

It is sooo easy to eat cheesy. I think it is a serious mistake to equate acceptance of homosexuality with acceptance of gay marriage. It is one thing to say homosexuality is not big deal so "live and let live," and quite another to be in favor of the state enshrining the lifestyle with a marriage license. The function of legal marriage is for society to formally say that we hold this union up as special and the preferable arrangement for adults. It's function is not to say since we don't really have serious problems with your lifestyle, here's a license. By the way, I want to amend an earlier post. I was arguing that homosexual relationships don't appear to be much more unstable than for heterosexuals. I later realized that I completely left out all heteros that marry without living together first (BIG error). Roughly half of heteros entering a serious relationship marry with out living together first; half of those never divorce. The average person marries at 26 and dies at 76, so these marriages are an average of 50 years. The average marriage that ends in divorce last an average of 7 years. As I wrote before, hetero cohabitors do three things; one half break up in an average of 20 months; one quarter eventually marry and divorce in 7 years average; and one quarter marry and never divorce, having an average marriage of 50 years. Doing all the calculations, the average hetero relationship lasts 21.8 years. The number is so high since one-third of heteros--whether or not cohabiting first--never divorce and are married for 50 years. So if the one study is correct that the average gay relationship lasts say 2 years, then we can validly conclude that while heteros currently have their share of problems, they are, on average, much more stable than homosexual relationships. Of course heteros have the advantage of having marriage available to them which is more binding than just living together, but these days the binding force of marriage does little to stop unsatisfied people from splitting up.

JPSartre12's joke was the appropriate response to this post, but at the risk of being the wet blanket, let me make a comment. This is such a cheap shot to judge a man who live 200 years ago by currently accepted standards. A hypothetical example will put this in context. (Context is a foreign word to left-leaning people). One of the contemporary heroes of the Left is Noam Chomsky. He is a brilliant linguist, and he has been a articulate champion of the leftist ideals and causes for several decades. Yet while many people in his political persuasion are vegetarian, he is a meat eater. Chomsky himself has said that say 100 years from now, most if not all people may be vegetarian. I don't think it is an unlikely scenario at all that the time may come in the not-too-distant when the PETA view of animals comes to be embraced and accepted as matter of fact by people. In their view, killing animals to eat them or to wear their skins or fur is the worst kind of barbarism. They have called it a holocaust like what the Nazis did. Killing creatures that we share more than 90% of our DNA with is mass murder, and people with any decency will fight against it. It may very well be the case that 100 years from now organizations like PETA will be seen as modern-day abolitionists. So put yourself in that future world. What should our attitude be toward Noam Chomsky? He feasted on the bloody flesh of thousands of animals and wore leather shoes his whole life. Apologists can't use the excuse that Chomsky didn't know any better; he was very familiar with PETA's arguments and had many friends who were vegetarians. Will we have to conclude that he is not a hero but a villian, a monster, a serial murderer? No we will not, because right now in this time we can see how a very smart man like Chomsky does not look at the state of affairs like PETA people today do, or like everyone would take for granted a 100 years from now. He understands their point of view, and has some sympathy for it, but he is not convinced of their viewpoint. Of course now we look at slavery with horror, but that simply was not the worldview of the time. Yes, there was some feeling then and some people that felt that slavery was wrong, but it was not a taken-for-granted principle like it is for us today.It is the mistake of a child to think that everybody always sees things like you do. An example would be cover a young child's eyes who is watching TV with you and to ask him what daddy sees now. The child then says, "That's easy Daddy, you can't see anything." It is impossible of course for people of the past to believe in worldviews they were never a part of.

That's funny. You want to emulate Thomas Jefferson? Do you wish you were a slave-owner like him?

I'm glad that you clarified that one Waxy. ;)I think that allowing gay marriages diminishes the sanctity of marriage. Remember, marriage, to many, is a sacrament first and foremost. It was only added to the secular world later on.

Just to stir the pot a little.We all have things that we feel are just plain "wrong". Federal funding of social programs, Islam, religion in general, eating meat, etc, etc...We tolerate these things because they are beneficial to, or the free choice of some, while not coming at the expense of others (except maybe the social programs JP. :p ).What makes gay marriage different that we would deny it?Waxy

Mnay feel that new words and slang detract from the original language rather than being part of an ongoing evolving process. While it may have been a sacrament first, it is not now purely, the sacrament version is not being given out so arguing that it will diminsh the sanctaty of marriage is like saying that new words and defintions (like microprocesser and the word gay itself) will spoil English.As for the stability numbers, factor in non-serious hetero relationships (i.e not just marraige and long term cohabitation but young people's boyfriend/girlfriend realtionships) and factor out those who were married and not allowed to divorce for religious reasons and the numbers are probably quite a bit closer. In fact studies shown on a similar thread on Portent (will see if I can find them) actually showed that if you only counted couples with children, gay families are far more stable.

Well if I were homosexual, I would think the label "gay" WAS spoiling English. ;) With all this talk of high rates of suicide, how happy can these folks be? I think "stylish" is much more complimentary and accurate. "Hey, you wanna meet up at the stylish bar later for drinks?"In my view, family arrangements are very consequential while slang trends are not. Family is arguably THE critical institution in society, so revolutionizing it will have a much wider and deeper impact on people, for good or for bad, than language trends. One of the most profound changes in American society in the last 50 years has been the movement of women into the workplace; some people argue that this has been a good thing, others say a bad thing. My point here is that this one change, which probably seemed like an unimportant switch among the women who first decided to break the norm and get a job, has revolutionized society in many ways. Family, gender, and sexual patterns of all sorts have been deeply impacted by this one change.Presumably, the study of gay relationships did not include non-serious relationships (maybe I can look this up) so why should we include those with the heteros. And yes, I would love to see those studies because frankly I am skeptical. What would possilby lead gay couples to be more stable than heteros?

Deaths of 228 homosexuals as recorded in the Washington Blade 1999-2001 were examined. Although more apt to have a partner when older, the median age of death of 88 homosexually partnered men was 45 yr., while for 118 unpartnered homosexual men it was 46 yr.

Of an urban sample from 5 additional cities, 0.5% of current heterosexuals reported that they had been homosexually 'married'. It thus appears that perhaps 1-2% of heterosexuals are ex-homosexuals. Proportionately more adults than teenagers and more men than women moved from homosexuality to heterosexuality. Of the 18 who changed, 12 became heterosexual and 6 bisexual, suggesting that perhaps two-thirds of those who abandon "being" homosexual 'become' heterosexual and a third 'become' bisexual.

Seventeen of 5,182 randomly obtained adults from six U.S. cities answered questionnaires indicating that they had a homosexual parent. Parental homosexuality may be related to findings that: (1) 5 of the 17 reported sexual relations with their parents; (2) a disproportionate fraction reported sexual relations with other caretakers and relatives; and (3) a disproportionate fraction: (a) claimed a less than exclusively heterosexual orientation (47%); (b) indicated gender dissatisfaction; and (c) reported that their first sexual experience was homosexual. Of 1,388 consecutive obituaries in a major homosexual newspaper, 87 of the gays who died had children and registered a median age of death of 47 (the 1,267 without children had a median age of death of 38); 10 lesbians did and 24 did not have children.

Title: DO HOMOSEXUALS TEACHERS POSE A RISK TO PUPILS? , By: Cameron, Paul, Cameron, Kirk, Journal of Psychology, 00223980, Nov96, Vol. 130, Issue 6ABSTRACT. Questionnaires were completed by 5,182 adults derived from one-wave area cluster samples in 6 metropolitan areas: 56% of homosexuals and 18% of heterosexuals reported having had a homosexual teacher; 12% of the men and 4% of the women said that the teacher made sexual advances toward them. A fifth of those with a homosexual teacher said they were influenced to regard homosexuality as socially acceptable; 4% said that the teacher influenced them to try homosexuality. About 1% of the sample reported that, as pupils, they had sexual relations with at least one of their elementary or secondary teachers. Eight respondents reported their first sexual experience was with an elementary or secondary teacher and that one of these experiences was homosexual. Of 49 other reported sexual experiences with teachers, 12 were homosexual. The findings that homosexuals more frequently claimed to have had homosexual teachers and more frequently reported homosexual sex with teachers tend to fit the contagion model of homosexuality--that homosexuality is taught by or caught by sexual interaction with homosexual practitioners.

I believe that once the gay lifestyle is completely forced upon us all, we will see our first amendment rights reduced. When this practice is labeled "normal" by unelected judges, we will be told it is against the law (a thought police, hate crime) to speak out and condemn that lifestyle. Ministers will not be free to preach against homosexuality, even if that is the official position of their church. I heard of such a case in Canada.

You aren't allowed to outspokenly racist in the same way, even if you actually beleive that, no different here. Hmm as for the lifespan thing, I wonder how much of that is due to the older population not being as openly gay as those amoung the younger population as their peers are generally not as accepting. Think it would have an effect? Do they factor out AIDS as well, I doubt it.Children increased chance of being homosexual, so what. If you don't see a problem with it this is not really a big issue. They might be more likely to experiment but are m,ore likely to be allowed to choose want they want in the end than the other way round in straight couples.Doesn't sound like it, looks like it basically compared all gay relationships to all long term straight ones. Seems like what a serious relationship for straights is different from gays in this study. Can't find the families one, will keep looking but has something to do with the extra effort that gay couples need to go to to get a child compared to straight couples. They have to be very certain they want it and get far more opertunities to decide they don't want to than a straight couple under noral conditions.

The function of law is to sanction behavior; law is one type of formal social control. The state uses privileges to reward desirable behavior and taxes to punish undesirable behavior (if it is rational anyway). It is a mistake to see the state as nothing more than some sort of amoral money collector and dispenser. Law is to a large extent the formalization, the codification of a society's values (at least the values of society's powerful groups). Granting marriage licenses to homosexuals rewards their relationship arrangement. As you write, there are economic benefits. But there are other kinds of rewards as well. For example, a married partner may be able to make medical decisions for a partner who is not capable of making his or her own choices. This is a legal privilege, not an economic one. Another benefit, which I am sure is important to some homosexuals, is symbolic, moral and social. Marriage communicates something to others. The state uses its authority to say this union is legitimate; it is equal in moral value to other marriages. Some homosexuals want marriage because an authoritative source--in this case the government--is affirming, certifying, their lifestyle. In my view, the proper role of government is to ignore homosexuality, not to use its power to enshrine a homosexual lifestyle.

I disagree with your definition of the purpose of a LEGAL marriage. IMHO, when it comes to the state's involvement, it's all about the MONEY.What does the state require of, and offer to, a couple that is married vs. unmarried? As near as I can tell, there's only one difference, and it's how you're taxed. The state doesn't really care whether you love each other, whether you have children, how old each partner is, what religion you ascribe to, etc, etc... The state only cares that both partners are freely entering into what for all intents and purposes is nothing more than legal contract. That contract entitles you to certain benefits and tax credits, as you are now viewed as "one entity" rather than two individuals. Call it a marriage, call it a legal union, call it cheese, it doesn't matter to matter to me, but I just can't wrap my head around denying another person STATE BENEFITS (their tax dollars) based on their sexual orientation.I agree with your definition of a marriage as it pertains to religious beliefs. Each faith should be free to define marriage as it so chooses. I don't think state recognized marriages are a threat to the religious sacrament of marriage in any way. It's apples and oranges IMHO.Waxy

I read these and another Davis page, and it looks like he was thrown out of the APA and other organizations because they don't like his politics. They argue such things as he wrongly interprreted others' studies or was called a sociologist when he wasn't; if every person were thrown out of the APA for misinterpreting research or for making misleading commments or for being called something they weren't, there wouldn't be anyone left in the organization. On other Davis pages, they critique his data collections as seriously flawed. Once again if people were thrown out of these orgs. everytime they did arguably shoddy work, I could count the number remaining on my fingers and toes. The only point at which these orgs. approach honesty is when they say that Cameron opposes civil rights for homosexuals. So finally we get to it; he was kicked out because he doesn't share their politics. If he were on the left instead of the right, these organizations would scream "MCCARTHYISM!!!!!" But since he is a conservative Christian, his right to free speech and academic freeedom can be flushed down to the toilet. This reveals the true colors of liberals; they believe in free speech when it advances their cause, and the fascist comes out when someone's speech works against them. I take my lessons from liberals, so I will applaud the American College of Pediatricians if they eject a member for being too pro-homosexual. As for the criticisms of his research methods, some are valid and some are quibbles. Many analysts never subject research to this standard of scrutiny if they like the results. I need to read through the studies to get a bet a better sense of their quality, but at this point they seem pretty run-of-the-mill in terms of methods. I certainly do not automatically dismiss his findings because he has an agenda; if that was my rule, I couldn't read 90% of social science research. One thing I noticed was that the critics offered not even one study, let alone better done stuff, to contradict Cameron. The proper response to Cameron is to conduct better research, not to ostracize and demonize him.As for Psychological Reports, one likely reason it has a low rejection rate is that it is a bimonthy (not quarterly) journal that publishes many, short studies, thus accomodating many people who submit papers. Anyway, it is a good enough journal to be at every university I have ever attended or taught at; the psych. dept. here has deemed it a good enough journal to keep on the shelf dating back to 1955.

There are many problems with Paul Cameron's methodology. He has been thrown out of the APA for violating its ethics, the American Sociological Association has stated it wants nothing to do with his faulty research. Also, according to a federal judge in Texas, Paul Cameron misrepresented statistics about gay men in a court case...http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbo...ron_sheet.htmlhttp://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbo...eron_obit.htmlhttp://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbo...on_survey.html

Apparently, your post here is wrong. I read the abstract of this article, and the conclusions are the life expectancy of ALL gay men is 8 to 20 years less than heterosexual men--not just HIV positive men. The conclusion of the study:"In a major Canadian centre, life expectancy at age 20 years for gay and bisexual men is 8 to 20 years less than for all men. If the same pattern of mortality were to continue, we estimate that nearly half of gay and bisexual men currently aged 20 years will not reach their 65th birthday. Under even the most liberal assumptions, gay and bisexual men in this urban centre are now experiencing a life expectancy similar to that experienced by all men in Canada in the year 1871."I don't know how you could construe this to mean they are speaking of the life expectancy of only gay men living with AIDS. And the fewer cases of AIDS in recent years that they speak is not significant in the case of the the U.S. According to Table 3 at http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/stats/hasr140...anceReport.pdf there were 17,357 new male-male contact cases of AIDS in 1998; it was 16,944 in 2002. So it took 5 years to come down 413 cases (17,357-16944=413). A drop of 413 new cases over 5 years averages to 82.6 fewer new cases each year. 82.6 is .5% of the 17,357 new cases observed in 1998. In other words, based on the last five years of available data, new cases have been dropping only .5% per year. This slowdown is too small to affect life expectancy much.

The 8-20 years less life statistic for gay men comes from a study of gay men, with HIV, done of a select urban area(Vancouver) in the late 1980's and early 1990's. The authors wrote "Gay Life Expectancy Re-Visited" in the Internatinal Journal of Epidemiology, in response to anti-gay groups misuing their study...In contrast, if we were to repeat this analysis today the life expectancy of gay and bisexual men would be greatly improved. Deaths from HIV infection have declined dramatically in this population since 1996. As we have previously reported there has been a threefold decrease in mortality in Vancouver as well as in other parts of British Columbia.4 http://ije.oupjournals.org/cgi/content/full/30/6/1499

It would include men with HIV which would be the main thing bringing the statistic down. To actually see if it is the homosexuality bringing it down you would have to take this into account as it is really just prooving that a population with a greater percentage of AIDS victims will have a lower life expectancy than one without. I still wonder if the older population would be as open to admitting whether they were gay or not which would mess with the stats some what too.

Much more important than all this homosexual controversy is whether the Kirk Cameron in those studies I posted is the guy from "Growing Pains" or not. ;) I know the guy is a televangelist now.

You're right, I am just surprised that there are enough HIV positive homosexuals living a short enough time to bring down the overall life expectancy that much. I wonder if their assumption that 3-9% of the male population being gay is wrong. In a large urban center, it could be more than that. If it were more, that should raise the life expectancy estimates (I think...). If you mean that elderly gay men didn't get calculated in, thus not raising the life expectancy, well they based their calculations on the number of men dying from AIDS of any age, and based on other studies, assumed that 95% of male deaths from AIDS cases in that city were of gay men, so presumably old men denying they are not gay would not be an issue.

I don't follow, that would just show that there is a greater proportion of gays with AIDS rather than straights with it. For the kind of thing that these stats would be trying to proove you would have to discount this kind of thing. If the stats were done purely of AIDS deaths as you say that actually prooves nothing about homosexual expectancy other than that gays will tend to get AIDS younger than straights, but you would expect that with it being far more common in their population.

Everyone's just getting all Mccarthy on poor little old Paul Cameron? I don't think that's it. His methods are seriously flawed. That's why his research is not taken seriously...Cameron's method had the virtue of simplicity, at least. He and two co-authors read through back numbers of various urban gay community papers, mostly of the giveaway sort that are laden with bar ads and personals. They counted up obituaries and news stories about deaths, noted the ages of the deceased, computed the average, and published the resulting numbers as estimates of gay life expectancy.What do vital-statistics buffs think of this technique? Nick Eberstadt at the American Enterprise Institute sums up the reactions of several of his fellow demographers: "The method as you describe it is just ridiculous." But you don't have to be a trained statistician to spot the fallacy at its heart, which is, to quote Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistician John Karon, that "you're only getting the ages of those who die." Gay men of the same generation destined to live to old age, even if more numerous, won't turn up in the sample.http://slate.msn.com/?id=2098http://www.vtfreetomarry.org/vparepl...ameron%20Studyhttp://www.indegayforum.org/authors/...ietrzyk53.htmlhttp://www.qrd.org/qrd/religion/anti...d.and.rebuttalhttp://www.qrd.org/QRD/www/RRR/cameron.html

You might do for something like that, combined with it being used to make a political point rather than just for fame and money. Might have had warnings with the organisation wanting to try to keep out of it or not be associated with the kind of thing through bad research.Not to sure about the results of the other study, its interesting but not for the reason they give. Seems suprising that HIV would be more prevalent amoung the older population of heterosexuals, something that goes against what you would normally think what which younger people being more sexually active. Guess its time for sex ed in homes nowadays seeing as they would have missed out on a lot of this kind of information the first time round. Ah well, nevermind back on topic then...

We have been discussing the case of the research Paul Cameron in this thread. He was thrown out of several professional organizations for conducting research with findings unflattering to homosexuals and for opposing the gay agenda. We see precedents in Canada and Europe of people being imprisoned for various types of "hate speech." For example, a guy named Ernst Zundel is rotting in prison in Canada for believing that certain parts of the history of the Holocaust are not accurate. He didn't assault anyone, didn't threaten anyone's life, all he did was have a kooky opinion. So your point is not in the least bit paranoid. It really could happen. When it comes to the idols of the PC religion--race, gender, sexual orientation--liberals do not even feel the need to deny that they are fascists. You people who believe in traditional Christianity had better start fighting back or the day may arrive where your beliefs are a punishable crime.

I believe that once the gay lifestyle is completely forced upon us all, we will see our first amendment rights reduced. When this practice is labeled "normal" by unelected judges, we will be told it is against the law (a thought police, hate crime) to speak out and condemn that lifestyle. Ministers will not be free to preach against homosexuality, even if that is the official position of their church. I heard of such a case in Canada.

"Gay Life Expectancy Re-Visited", mentioned the 3-fold decrease in HIV infection death among gay men in the Vancouver area since 1996.There is evidence of deaths declining from HIV/AIDS in the U.S., since that study of Vancouver, British Columbia, was done...The age-adjusted death rate from HIV/AIDS declined nearly 4 percent between 2000 and 2001, a bigger decline than the year before and continuing a trend that has occurred since 1995. Over this six-year period, mortality from HIV has declined nearly 70 percent after increasing over 191 percent between 1987 and 1994.http://usgovinfo.about.com/cs/census...lifeexpect.htm(MSM are men who have sex with men)The estimated number of deaths among MSM reported with AIDS rose steadily in the 1980s and early 1990s, and then leveled at approximately 25,000 deaths in 1994 and 1995. In the first 6 months of 1996, overall AIDS deaths declined for the first time. Compared with the first half of 1995, AIDS deaths among MSM fell 19% in the first half of 1996.

I don't know if your point is that deaths are dropping faster than new diagnoses but if you are, you make an excellent point. Going back to the CDC tables I have been using, there were 7120 "male-to-male" in 1998 and only 5418 in 2002. That is a average 4.8% decrease for each year over that 5 year period; that is significant. What I don't get is how AIDS would lower life expectancy (or in the case of these mortality decreases, increase life expectancy) of the gay population much. My earlier estimates were that only 5% of gay men are HIV positive--how could that small number affect life expectancy much? I don't know what other things would possibly lower life expectancy. For example, if my 5% is right and say the average HIV positive gay man lived only to 30, and all other gay men lived to 73--the life expectancy of all men--that implies a life expectancy of 70.9 years for homosexuals, only 2.1 years less. But the epidemiological study said life expectancy was 8-20 years lower. Puzzling to me.

I was able to find what percent of male homosexuals attempt suicide athttp://www.datalounge.com/datalounge...l?record=20117It was 5.3 times higher than for hetero males, so assuming that this ratio would be the same for completed suicides, I multiplied the total single-year male suicide rate from the CDC by 5.3, then multiplied that by 75, approximating the number of ages that a male might kill himself. The result is that an estimated 6.9% of gay men commit suicide. If the average at age when the suicide was committed was 30, and we add this to the AIDS deaths, that gives a life expectancy of 67.9, or about 5 years less than heteros. This is still not the 8-20 years lower life expectancy concluded in that apparently well done study, but it is at least getting in the neighborhood. Does anyone know of other causes of death that gay men may face at higher rates than others? Victims of homicide or heart attacks maybe?

Whihc study are we looking at? I thought you said that the study was done off AIDS deaths so these other things arn't an issue, homosexuals with AIDS have a lower life expectancy as they are more likely to get it younger is what the study says, most likely due to the different sectors of the population it is most common. For the kind of drop we are seeing in an overal population I think the stats might be a little wrong, if the majority of homosexuals were dying in their 30-50s then it would be a much bigger thing and would have been noticed well before these types of studies were done. If 5% had such a low life expectancy in the population then a lot of people in the rest of the population would be noticably living longer than the 'normal' which would also be noted before now.

You aren't allowed to outspokenly racist in the same way, even if you actually beleive that, no different here. Hmm as for the lifespan thing, I wonder how much of that is due to the older population not being as openly gay as those amoung the younger population as their peers are generally not as accepting. Think it would have an effect? Do they factor out AIDS as well, I doubt it.Children increased chance of being homosexual, so what. If you don't see a problem with it this is not really a big issue. They might be more likely to experiment but are m,ore likely to be allowed to choose want they want in the end than the other way round in straight couples.Doesn't sound like it, looks like it basically compared all gay relationships to all long term straight ones. Seems like what a serious relationship for straights is different from gays in this study. Can't find the families one, will keep looking but has something to do with the extra effort that gay couples need to go to to get a child compared to straight couples. They have to be very certain they want it and get far more opertunities to decide they don't want to than a straight couple under noral conditions.

You know it. And if you think mine are strong, my wife is even more protective.

That came out of nowhere, fair enough, but where did teachers come it even. I said nothing about this, thought I was talking about homosexual couples with children?

I have news for you, pal. The first homosexual teacher that attempts to engage one of my kids in a homosexual act will be taken out of the school in a bodybag and I'm not a homophobe OR violent person by nature. I am, however, a very protective father who will go from 0 - murder in a heartbeat if one of my family members is threatened. Does that clarify my feelings on the matter? emoticonXKill

I don't understand how giving someone an apple makes an orange less valuable.It DOESN'T affect the sanctity of the sacrament whatsoever. The church does not have to marry gay couples. Like I said, call the gay marriage whatever you like, if it's the word "marriage" that's the stumbling block, then eliminate it. Leave it for the religious or the "Christian" only.I'm in favour of equal rights for gays as it pertains to the state, not religion.Waxy

I'm glad that you clarified that one Waxy. ;)I think that allowing gay marriages diminishes the sanctity of marriage. Remember, marriage, to many, is a sacrament first and foremost. It was only added to the secular world later on.

I agree with you for the most part.It's very difficult, and I'd suggest somewhat naive, to attempt to legislate morality.It's my belief, and this may be my romantic version of reality, that the function of law, especially in a free and democratic society, is not to impose morality, but to prevent/punish immorality. A minor distinction, but in my mind, a very important one. In plain speaking, the gov't will not impose any kind of behavioural code upon you, you are free to do as you please, as long as it doesn't harm others or legitimately infringe on their rights. On that basis, I don't see homosexual marriage as an issue that is legislatable? by the state. Furthermore, I think every point you've made is actually BENEFICIAL to the state. If we can take an area of society that will always exist, and rather than marginalize it, recognize it for what it is and allow it to to become strong and self sufficient, IMHO, everyone wins. Is it better that the state is making critical care decisions? Or should your closest friend and life partner be making that decision? Do you want a nanny gov't, or would you rather people took care of themselves?Is it better for the state to ostracize these people and make them illegitmate in society, or would it be better to grant them an equal footing and let them contribute as recognized members of society? IMHO, granting them the "affirmation" of marriage will lead to increased stability and positive contribution on their part, again, everyone wins.Throughout all of these debates, I've yet to have anyone demonstrate any CONCRETE efffects that gay marriage will have on society. Instead, all I hear is broad generalities on how gay marriage will destroy the sanctity of marriage. Frankly, I just don't see it. I don't see how my life will be cheapened or my upcoming heterosexual marriage would be any less valid.These threads seem to me to always come down to one thing, and it's not marriage/laws/rights, it's simply whether or not you accept/tolerate homosexuality, and whether or not you feel that homosexuals are deserving of equal value and status as heterosexuals and human beings. If people view homosexuals as being somehow less valuable or inferior to heteros, they tend to object to anything that may threaten their "superior" status. IMHO, it really is that simple, and if I may be so bold, I think a lot of people on both sides of the issue agree me, whether they realize it or not.Waxy

The function of law is to sanction behavior; law is one type of formal social control. The state uses privileges to reward desirable behavior and taxes to punish undesirable behavior (if it is rational anyway). It is a mistake to see the state as nothing more than some sort of amoral money collector and dispenser. Law is to a large extent the formalization, the codification of a society's values (at least the values of society's powerful groups). Granting marriage licenses to homosexuals rewards their relationship arrangement. As you write, there are economic benefits. But there are other kinds of rewards as well. For example, a married partner may be able to make medical decisions for a partner who is not capable of making his or her own choices. This is a legal privilege, not an economic one. Another benefit, which I am sure is important to some homosexuals, is symbolic, moral and social. Marriage communicates something to others. The state uses its authority to say this union is legitimate; it is equal in moral value to other marriages. Some homosexuals want marriage because an authoritative source--in this case the government--is affirming, certifying, their lifestyle. In my view, the proper role of government is to ignore homosexuality, not to use its power to enshrine a homosexual lifestyle.

I assume then that you would react the same way if any HETEROSEXUAL teacher attempted to engage one of your children in a HETEROSEXUAL act.Otherwise, you ARE a violent homophobe.The very fact that you would equate a homosexual advance with a threat to your children's well being pretty much makes the case, unless of course you view any sexual advance toward one of your children as a threat. (I'm basing this comment on the knowledge that your children are all young adults, and that sex is a part of their worlds. This of course would not be the case with young children/minors.)Waxy

As far as I can see, every law without exception is the expression of some value. Laws reward as well as punish. whether that was the intention of the lawmakers or not. Legalizing gay marriage doesn't punish anything; it rewards homosexuality, or putting it in other words, it says homosexuality is on the same moral plane as heterosexual marriage. This position expresses a value, the value that anything whatsoever should be permitted as long as no one else is harmed. You cannot claim that this position makes you not a morality legislator. By the way, I think this value is a harmful one. It is nihilistic and licentious. As a couple examples, a group of cultists who kill themselves are engaging in moral behavior by your standard, or teenagers who cut on themselves are behaving morally by your definition. Drug addiction is moral behavior. This is a bankrupt morality that says that all behavior that doesn't harm others is good.If you argue that these behaviors are not good, that your morality only labels certain behaviors as bad (i.e., those that hurt others), then your morality is nihilistic: there is no good behavior.

I agree that marriage would be good for homsexuals, and I agree that homosexuality will always be a part of society. I oppose gay marriage because legitimizing homosexuality attacks and works to discredit tradition and Christianity and Judaism, the only authoritaitve sources of morality in America. If the time arrives where homosexuality can be squared with tradition and Christianity and Judaism. As long as the advance of homosexuality results in a retreat in morality, I oppose it. Ok, so we do agree then that gay marriage is more than an issue of money. I would prefer a partner to make these decisions. Actually, my main concerns with gay marriage are moral, and over concerns about children raised in these families, and secondarily about the potential for abuse and fraud. As I said, homosexuals and their children benefit from marriage over just living together. Everyone else, on the other hand loses, because one authoritative morality is futher discredited (it has been gutted for the last 40 years) and the gulf of nihilism we find ourselves in widens and deepens. I'm sorry but several millenia of marriage being heterosexual puts the onus on you, not us, to demonstrate why gay marriage is justified.I will quote what I wrote this in an earlier post: "Your claim that only right wing religious fanatics would argue against legalizing gay marriage is belied by poll after poll shows that at least 60% of Americans are against homosexual marriage. And for many of the rest, it is just an attitude of tolerance, not that they positively value homosexual marriage. It is just this attitude of "whatever people want to do" or "anything goes" that is a major problem in our culture right now. That is just plain nihilism: there are no authoritative values, no right and wrong. If you want to move in with a goat, who am I to question it?" "Personally, I have nothing against homosexuality, but it is high time we said enough nihilism! For the last 40 years, we have been unable to tell anyone "NO!" If we destroy all the traditional restraints, there will be nothing in the way of every imaginable impulse from having free reign. Freud said "Civilization is only made possible by individual renouncement." He knew that unchecked animal passions will eventually lead to the destruction of civilization. On our present course, we will one day see the ruins of a once great society. But at least we'll be able to say, "Well at least we didn't judge anybody!" "Any healthy society requires an authoritative moral structure to lead people to prosocial behavior. The bedrock of that structure in the U.S. has been the Bible, and when you discredit it, people find themselves in a moral vacuum where there are only personal tastes and preferences, and Freud was right that people run only by their ids end up in producing chaos. As I said before, gay marriage itself is not that big of a deal to me, and I might go along with the cultural nihilists if they would promise me this was the very LAST time they would destroy another traditional value. But I know them too well; their logic will never let them stop."Homosexual sex is not of equal moral value to heterosexual sex. Homosexual attraction is an eccentricity, and we don't enshrine eccentricities. That is not to say homosexuals have less intrinsic value; it is easy to separate one behavior from the person. You are right to imply that being in favor of gay marriage is to say that homosexual sex is morally equal to heterosexual sex; this is not just an issue of homosexuals being withheld something that there is no reason not to give them. This IS a moral issue, and we disgree on the moriality of it. To me a heterosexual arrangement is the desired, preferable one for adults. For you, one is not preferable to the other. It appears that your views on specific issues are drawn from the principle of "no harm done to others." On the issue of harm, one thing that seems apparent to me from earlier discussions of the facts of relationship stability, heterosexuals average long-term relationships of more than 20 years, while the average homosexual couple is together 2 to 3 years (I am not certain how reliable this number is.) If those numbers are right, children raised in homosexual homes are much more likely to be harmed by the break up of their parents than other children. This problem is serious among kids raised in heterosexual homes, implying the problem is much worse in homosexual homes. Marriage might help some homosexual families be more stable, but the nihilistic tendencies of our culture I have been writing have rendered the binding power of marriage very weak nowadays. On the other hand, legalizing gay marriage may encourage some homosexuals to have kids they wouldn't otherwise have since they think kids should be born to married parents, thus bringing children into families that have much higher rates of instability than in hetero families.

I wouldn't have any problem with the term "civil union" if it meant that employers and the Social Security Agency didn't have to include them in their costs.

On the issue of pedophilia, I think it makes sense to have a much closer eye on male teachers, coachers, babysitters etc. than their female counterparts. Ninety-nine percent of pedophiles are male. I think it's a wise policy to avoid putting men in intimate charge of children, period. As an anecdote, the only incident that became public knowledge at schools while I was growing up was our junior high school teacher molested a couple boys before getting caught. From what I know, he was basically slapped on the wrists for it too. And this was in very conservative rural Idaho 20 years ago, so I'm skeptical of the view that hatred of homosexual sex is so intense, that every homosexual is going to be chased to the top of the windmill by a bunch of villagers with pitchforks at the slightest provocation. I looked up how many homosexuals were killed in 2002 in a hate crime. You'd think from the coverage like that of the Matthew Shephard incident that the number is in the thousands. It's 12. Of course those 12 crimes are awful, but thousands of heteros are killed every year, so let's get a little perspective.

But the US government legislates morality all of the time. No sex with minors; no underage drinking; no smoking under 18; no obscenities in public; no pornography....the list is endless. The state has a vested interest in preserving marriage as an institution. That's why it grants special rights to married partners. Granting the same rights to gays does have a negative impact on society. It diminishes the institution of marriage. It creates more of a financial burden on companies that have to pay for the partner's health benefits. It puts more strain on the Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare systems.

Good point. Once gay marriage was the law of the land, I can easily see the next set of arguments being that gay families are new and fragile and are often victims of discrimination, so the government needs to initiate new programs to strengthen those families and to re-educate heteros on the rightness of these families. Gay families will further bolster the argument that increasingly homosexuals are family providers, yet face discrimination at the workplace, so we need affirmative action and set-aside programs for them, and on and on.

You say reward, I say give long overdue equality.I have no problem with the moral implications of "elevating" gay marriage to the same plane as far as the state is concerned.

IMHO, as I've said and posted, it's just basic human equality and rights. It's the lack of a rebuttal for this assertion that I was pointing out. As much as pure nihilism scares you, pure Chrisitian or gov't mandated "majority" morality scares me.I disagree, again, this isn't about morality IMHO, it's about equality under the law, but for those who oppose homosexual marriage, morality is the only issue that can really be argued.There are a multitude of things that I prefer in our society, heterosexual marriages is one of them. Does that mean that my preferences should overrule those of everyone else? We tolerate things - everything from social issues and morality to people driving a different brand of vehicle than we prefer - on a daily basis. Should we stop tolerating that and attempt to legislate intolerance based on the majority? That seems to be your position. I'm right, you're wrong, and if we do it your way, the world will end due to moral bankruptcy.These numbers are so skewed and whimsical IMHO. How can you compare relationships in a state affirmed, enshrined bond openly accepted by society, to those of people who live on societies edges and are openly persecuted?If the only option available to you was long term dating, where is the incentive for commitment?If you are living your life "in the closet" or on the "down low" what support is there for any type of a long term commitment?I think children are a big factor, 20 years is just about right for Mom and Dad to tough it out till the kids are out of the house and then go their separate ways. Of the divorces I know of personally, 4 of 5 were this scenario.What positive influence would legalized marriage have on homosexual couples? I think it would be big factor, having legal and open marriages to defend and have supported.This stuff is such pointless speculation IMHO. For every negative that can be associated, the numbers can just as easily be spun to demonstrate the positive effect that marriage can and would have for couples.WaxyP.S. How is the eroding "power of the bond" of marriage among heterosexuals relevent? I don't see that as being a factor.

I agree that marriage would be good for homsexuals, and I agree that homosexuality will always be a part of society. I oppose gay marriage because legitimizing homosexuality attacks and works to discredit tradition and Christianity and Judaism, the only authoritaitve sources of morality in America. If the time arrives where homosexuality can be squared with tradition and Christianity and Judaism. As long as the advance of homosexuality results in a retreat in morality, I oppose it. Ok, so we do agree then that gay marriage is more than an issue of money. I would prefer a partner to make these decisions. Actually, my main concerns with gay marriage are moral, and over concerns about children raised in these families, and secondarily about the potential for abuse and fraud. As I said, homosexuals and their children benefit from marriage over just living together. Everyone else, on the other hand loses, because one authoritative morality is futher discredited (it has been gutted for the last 40 years) and the gulf of nihilism we find ourselves in widens and deepens. I'm sorry but several millenia of marriage being heterosexual puts the onus on you, not us, to demonstrate why gay marriage is justified.I will quote what I wrote this in an earlier post: "Your claim that only right wing religious fanatics would argue against legalizing gay marriage is belied by poll after poll shows that at least 60% of Americans are against homosexual marriage. And for many of the rest, it is just an attitude of tolerance, not that they positively value homosexual marriage. It is just this attitude of "whatever people want to do" or "anything goes" that is a major problem in our culture right now. That is just plain nihilism: there are no authoritative values, no right and wrong. If you want to move in with a goat, who am I to question it?" "Personally, I have nothing against homosexuality, but it is high time we said enough nihilism! For the last 40 years, we have been unable to tell anyone "NO!" If we destroy all the traditional restraints, there will be nothing in the way of every imaginable impulse from having free reign. Freud said "Civilization is only made possible by individual renouncement." He knew that unchecked animal passions will eventually lead to the destruction of civilization. On our present course, we will one day see the ruins of a once great society. But at least we'll be able to say, "Well at least we didn't judge anybody!" "Any healthy society requires an authoritative moral structure to lead people to prosocial behavior. The bedrock of that structure in the U.S. has been the Bible, and when you discredit it, people find themselves in a moral vacuum where there are only personal tastes and preferences, and Freud was right that people run only by their ids end up in producing chaos. As I said before, gay marriage itself is not that big of a deal to me, and I might go along with the cultural nihilists if they would promise me this was the very LAST time they would destroy another traditional value. But I know them too well; their logic will never let them stop."Homosexual sex is not of equal moral value to heterosexual sex. Homosexual attraction is an eccentricity, and we don't enshrine eccentricities. That is not to say homosexuals have less intrinsic value; it is easy to separate one behavior from the person. You are right to imply that being in favor of gay marriage is to say that homosexual sex is morally equal to heterosexual sex; this is not just an issue of homosexuals being withheld something that there is no reason not to give them. This IS a moral issue, and we disgree on the moriality of it. To me a heterosexual arrangement is the desired, preferable one for adults. For you, one is not preferable to the other. It appears that your views on specific issues are drawn from the principle of "no harm done to others." On the issue of harm, one thing that seems apparent to me from earlier discussions of the facts of relationship stability, heterosexuals average long-term relationships of more than 20 years, while the average homosexual couple is together 2 to 3 years (I am not certain how reliable this number is.) If those numbers are right, children raised in homosexual homes are much more likely to be harmed by the break up of their parents than other children. This problem is serious among kids raised in heterosexual homes, implying the problem is much worse in homosexual homes. Marriage might help some homosexual families be more stable, but the nihilistic tendencies of our culture I have been writing have rendered the binding power of marriage very weak nowadays. On the other hand, legalizing gay marriage may encourage some homosexuals to have kids they wouldn't otherwise have since they think kids should be born to married parents, thus bringing children into families that have much higher rates of instability than in hetero families.

So your problem is now not moral, you just don't want to pay? It's all about the MONEY. Interesting.I don't get it. Do you object to health care, retirement plans, benefits etc for hetero couples? Are hetero couples a "dependent class"?Who do you think picks up the tab for these expenses now? Hint, it's not them. Why not give them the ability to look after themselves like any hetero couple?This type of response is baseless IMHO, it's pure and utter descrimination based on sex. No different that denying someone a right to marry because of skin color or creed.As for the far fetched "extensions of logic" that are always thrown out, please, I think we all know how ridiculous they are.Waxy

My comments were in response to the post below:"Title: DO HOMOSEXUALS TEACHERS POSE A RISK TO PUPILS? , By: Cameron, Paul, Cameron, Kirk, Journal of Psychology, 00223980, Nov96, Vol. 130, Issue 6ABSTRACT. Questionnaires were completed by 5,182 adults derived from one-wave area cluster samples in 6 metropolitan areas: 56% of homosexuals and 18% of heterosexuals reported having had a homosexual teacher; 12% of the men and 4% of the women said that the teacher made sexual advances toward them. A fifth of those with a homosexual teacher said they were influenced to regard homosexuality as socially acceptable; 4% said that the teacher influenced them to try homosexuality. About 1% of the sample reported that, as pupils, they had sexual relations with at least one of their elementary or secondary teachers. Eight respondents reported their first sexual experience was with an elementary or secondary teacher and that one of these experiences was homosexual. Of 49 other reported sexual experiences with teachers, 12 were homosexual. The findings that homosexuals more frequently claimed to have had homosexual teachers and more frequently reported homosexual sex with teachers tend to fit the contagion model of homosexuality--that homosexuality is taught by or caught by sexual interaction with homosexual practitioners."As for my reaction if one of my kids was sexually attacked, in general, the same applies. A bodybag for the perp. I wouldn't discriminate between hetero or homo; they'd be just as dead. emoticonXKill

But the US government legislates morality all of the time. No sex with minors; no underage drinking; no smoking under 18; no obscenities in public; no pornography....the list is endless. The state has a vested interest in preserving marriage as an institution. That's why it grants special rights to married partners. Granting the same rights to gays does have a negative impact on society. It diminishes the institution of marriage. It creates more of a financial burden on companies that have to pay for the partner's health benefits. It puts more strain on the Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare systems. It creates a new class of "victims" for the courts to deal with in divorce proceedings, custody disputes, etc., Drug abusers have always existed too. Should we also allow them to "become strong and self-sufficient"? How about prostitution? If you answer anything but "yes", then you are applying your logic selectively. I think that you know my answer to that question already, But, as long as we have a whole plethora of nanny programs, I'm against creating any new members.I disagree for the reasons stated above.I've listed several concrete examples above.I could care less if someone is gay or not right up until they want to start taking money out of my pocket to put in their own. I hear gays saying all of the time that it isn't an economic issue. Fine. Deny them the ability to collect their partners SS, medical benefits, inheritance (without a will), etc., and see how they'd react to that proposal. I'll guarantee you that they'd respond in the negative. It IS about money; yours and mine.

It is irrelevant, we are talking purely about the effects of being gay, not any other associated things. Its ice creams and drowning again. Being gay will not make you take drugs and if you are looking at the 'health risks' of homosexuality you can't include this. STDs maybe though, but I would guess that mnay are fairly avoidable with safer sex (less need for it in a gay relationship as one of you isn't going to get pregnant)As for recognising gay relationships damaging the foundations of morality, I disagree. The emphasis of the bible is being reduced as it and its rules are decreasingly relavant, I would say now that we have a stable enough society that we don't need some kind of afterlife punishment to make us decide that doing the right thing is the thing to do, usually because it benefits us in a society anyway.

It is not in the least bit irrelavent. A hypothetical situation will illustrate. Imagine research proved that 99% of day care centers were run by drug addicts. Running a day care center doesn't cause drug addiction, but that wouldn't stop me for a minute from not leaving my kids at a day care center, because in this situation I don;t give a damn about what causes the problem, it the FACT of the problem as it impacts on my kids that is the concern. Decline in the Bible in the last 40 years has run in tandem with an explosion of social problems. I wrote in an earlier post: "In last 40 years, while people like some in this thread have trashed Chistianity and the traditional moral foundation of American society, a tidal wave of social problems the likes of we've never seen before has swept over the country. Crime is several times what it was pre-1960. In the 60s there were a few thousand gang members in the country who were about as nasty as the dancing guys in "West Side Story"; now there are 1 million Tech 9-toting gangbangers, dealing drugs to kids and killing them in drive-bys. Addictions are of control: drugs--legal and illegal--gambling, sex, pornography, you name it. The porn industry was underground in the 60s and now it's a multi-billion dollar industry (I've read it's bigger than Hollywood). We supply the world with porn these days. STDs were at low levels; AIDS was non-existent. Now 20% of people have genital herpes (45% of black Americans) and hundreds of thousands are HIV positive. The percent of kids under 15 are having sex several times higher than in the past. More than 1 million abortions are performed every year, half of them on fetuses more than 2 months old. Divorce and out-of-wedlock births exploded in the 60s where now 1/2 of kids grow up with little involvement from dad; 70% of blacks kids are born to an unwed mom. Infidelity is way up, both among married and unmarried. I could go on and on, but the list of social ills is getting tedious." There clearly has been a severe decline in traditional moral authority, as its critics have been arguing things like, "People can do whatever they want, and we should respect that. Only God can judge. The Bible is irrelevant and false." We folks on this forum like to flatter ourselves that we are too smart for old-time morality, but what the guy on the street takes all this to mean is that there is no authoritative right and wrong, and I can do whatever I feel like. His only fear has become whether the cops catch him or not. As a less extreme example, the man who has isn't ready for kids or who grown tired of playing the father role has nothing holding him back as he walks away. He tells himself that while the old rules would have forbidden such a thing, nowadays the old morality doesn't apply; we just need to find our own happiness in life. I can imagine that your response this arguement is that correlation does not necessarily mean causation, but if X runs in tandem with Y, it is becuase X causes Y, or Y causes X, or Z causes both X and Y. I doubt an explosion of social problems causes a decline in traditional morality, and I'm not sure what would cause both.

My point is that causation is not the issue; you are now switching to the relevant issue which is: Are there problems associated with homosexual lifestyles to the extent to convince us that it's a bad idea to encourage homosexual families? This is a complex issue because it requires us to look at many factors. Two factors that now seem clear to me (others are not) are that homosexuals have lifesltyles that reduce their lives an average of 14 years--that sounds pretty bad to me--and that serious heterosexual relationships may last up to ten times longer than for homosexuals--also a very important fact. As I have explained, my opposition to gay marriage is concern over the discrediting of traditional moral authority and the consequences for society, but this issue of harm or lack of harm to children raised by homosexuals is important in its own right, and I for one am in the process of trying to get a handle on that reality.So far I haven't seen any hard evidence that homosexuals offer, on average, any advantages...other than maybe better fashion sense. Any hard evidence out there? Don't tell me, let me guess--gay couples and their children are more tolerant, right? Except toward Christians and "breeders" and Republicans of course.

It was stupid, by the looks of things they included all gay relationships but only serious long term heterosexual ones (I think they even defined serious ones by a minimum period, but only for straight relationships), seems like a loaded survey to me. As for the life expectancy ones a lot of the behaviors are hardly limited to homosexuality and their inclusion makes me wonder about the validity of that survey too as well as the huge gap. When someone then explained how it was done it made no sense and didn't proove what it said it did (just showed gays get AIDS younger than straights on average), but they may have misinterpretted it.Seems a lot of surveys also have trouble geting the full range of homosexuals and instead focus on where they are easy to find (i.e gay bars), while taking a general overview of the straight population.

Moreover, I think there are other pro-gay marriage posters like Waxy who probably agree that homosexuals, on average, don't stay together as long as heteros, but they then attribute that to not having access to the stabilizing influence of marriage. Well that view is just a hypothesis, and I'm not sure what causes their instability; what is clear to me is that it exists whatever the reason. My personal experience is consistent with this view too, but I realize this is anecdotal. I have written in a earlier post that I suspect lesbian homes would be much more stable than male homosexual homes since men tend to be not as good at commitment. Hetero men have needed a lot of moral pressure to stay with their wives and children throughout history; that pressure does not exist in this era to keep two gay men together.

Some of your points are worth considering and looking in to, but all those health risks are listed by medical practioners when sensitizing professionals to the special health needs of gay men.

I'm interested in this question of the typical homosexual lifestyle, so I started an analysis of General Social Survey data--a nationally representative sample of Americans conducted every year by the U. of Chicago:http://webapp.icpsr.umich.edu/GSS/I looked to see if gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals differed on aspects of lifestyle I ran across. Contrary to earlier posts, I found that homosexual men are less likely to smoke. Lesbians and bisexual men were the groups who smoked the most.I looked to see what percent of people hang out in bars almost every night. Bisexuals were the most likely; gay and hetero men were in the middle; lesbians and hetero women were least likely to. I looked to see what percent of people were: romantically involved; lived together; and were happy in their relationship. Both hetero groups and the bisexual men and especially lesbians were the most likely to be involved, and gay men and bisexual women were the least likely. A high percentage of gay men and lesbians lived with their romantic partner; the bisexual groups were least likely, with heteros in the middle. All groups were very likely to be happy in their relationships.So these numbers don't show instability or unhealthy lifestyles among gay men and lesbians. It does look like about half of lesbians smoke, but the number of respondents was small, so this estimate may be crude. The bisexual tended to show more instability; this was probably due to the fact that the bi's tended to be younger. The only potentially negative aspect of these findings is that most gay men and lesbians who say they are romantically involved also say they are living with their partner, so this apparently makes a question about being romantically involved comparable to asking that of heteros, and thus provides evidence that the conclusion that hetero relationships tend to last longer than homosexual ones is based on comparable groups. Actually, according to this survey, you capture a higher percentage of casual relationships among the heteros when you ask, "Are you involved?"

This seems to be a particularly important basis for your view. These statements lack precision. You are not advocating equality in the eyes of the law because (I am guessing) that you are not in favor of, for example, pedophile-victim marriages; you are in favor of equality before the law for marital arrangements that don't harm anyone. If this is your position, then ANY marital arrangment that doesn't harm anyone should be granted. That would include but not be limited to following types of marriages: adult daughter/father, adult son/mother, adult daughter/mother, adult son/father, adult brother/daughter, adult brother/brother, adult sister/sister, adult niece/uncle, adult nephew/aunt, adult niece/aunt, adult nephew/uncle, adult granddaughter/grandfather, adult grandson/grandmother, adult grandson/grandfather, adult granddaughter/grandmother, homosexual and heterosexual first-cousin pairings, groups marriages of family members of all possible combinations as long as their adults. By your standards, ANY conceivable group qualifies for marriage as long as no one gets hurt. Polygyny and polyandry fit this category, and there are tens of thousands of polygynists in the country and more immigrating every year. A free love commune desiring group marriage is another. There are hundreds of thousands of bisexuals in the country; maybe many would like to have one of each sex for a spouse. Many people might decide that a marriage of a group of friends would give the variety, economic stability, and social/emotional support not always found between two people. And I'm not even being skeptical about whether there is harm in marriages involving children. Girls in many parts of the world are marriage in their early teens, presumably not doing harm to participants. If I am reading you right, the burden of proof that the marital arrangements are harmful falls on the opponents of these marriages. How can we deny a couple who are originally from Mexico who want to get married even though the girl is only 13? How can deny 2 severely retarded people from getting married, or 2 institutionalized paranoid schizophrenics? A complete list of arguably non-harming marital arrangements (as homosexual marriages are arguably non-harming) would be very long indeed. As long as even one of these groups is not granted marriage licenses, we have not reached equality under the law as you define it.

You say reward, I say give long overdue equality.I have no problem with the moral implications of "elevating" gay marriage to the same plane as far as the state is concerned. It just goes to basic human equality under the eyes of the law. I see your point galton, and I do agree that all things have limits.The cultists - we as a society have deemed suicide as immoral. Nihilistic as it may be, I believe that if someone IS OF SOUND MIND and wants to kill themselves, that should be their right. As for the teen cutting himself, it's likely a sign of depression and easily treatable. Unfortunately, nothing is black and white. What mental issues or mind control has affected these people that they want to kill/injure themselves? Should they be forced to undergo psychological treatment? IMHO, every effort should be made to help these people, but ultimately, the choice of what to do with their lives is THEIRS, not yours and mine.Drug addiction harms far more people than the addict themselves.There is good behaviour, that seems obvious to me.

It's 2004 and the world has a favorite people to hate: homosexuals. That's right! People have moved away from using religion against blacks,(I'm black and mix), women, and Jews. The favorite target is gays. Why? Because some people are not tolerant and they are uncomfortable being around people who are different. Next, they have created an argument to justify oppressing homosexuals. Homosexuals are unnatural (The American Psychiatrists Association disagree), they are against God's will (Man made myth), gays are sexual perverts, they can't create(All heterosexuals don't marry nor have kids) God made Adam and Eve( I thought there were others after Adam and Eve),,,etc. Guess What! If homosexuals did not exist, these bigots would pick on another minority group. They quote little bits of biblical verses to deny homosexuals their rights, but these bigots don't have a full understanding of why these words were used and how they cannot be used in 2004 because, the words were of different meanings and were not against honest gays and lesbians (only homosexuals who were in pagan practices). For example, someone did not finish reading a newspaper article, but they are willing to tell everyone the story. These bigots don't understand why Paul (bible apostle) uses certain words. They say that the bible is against homosexuals, when in fact, bigots have improperly used the bible to justify hate. They have a lot in common with southern bigots during the civil rights movement. They used the biblical ham story(a 100% percent myth) to deny "blacks" their rights. They have cited Paul biblical verses to deny women the rights of equality with men(Paul teachings were for a specific period). The bottom line: We are dealing with cultural prejudice, not biblical prejudice. Humans have created dislike and hate for others who are different. This is bigger than a dislike for homosexuals, women, Jews, "whites," "blacks," etc;;; Hate is about disliking someone because of their ethnicity or perhaps the height of an individual. HOMOSEXUALS MAY HAVE A HARD TIME CHANGING PEOPLE VIEWS, BUT THEY HAVE TO BE PROTECTED UNDER THE LAW JUST LIKE ANY OTHER GROUP. CHRISTIANS, JEWS, MUSLIMS, AND HINDUS MAY NOT DISAGREE IN THEIR RELIGIOUS VIEWS, BUT THEY ARE ALLOWED THEIR RIGHT TO PRACTICE THEIR RELIGIONS(OPPS!

melsucceeds,Good post: meaningful, understandable, your opinion.But, to address the problem is to look at it. Face it and comment on it. Since it is a man's right to marry another man, would it also be his right to marry a mule? I'm not trying to be funny - far from it - I am trying to understand the justification for using the sanctity of marriage as a device for equality.This is the problem we're faced with. Not hatred, bigotry, or racism.

I don't think I missed the point at all. Not only were you objecting to marriage, but it seemed pretty clear to me from this statement - that you objected to any form, civil union included, of state recognition that would provide equal legal and financial rights to homosexual couples. Was that an incorrect interpretation of your point?I like the idea of a civil union, that's been my axe since the beginning. Give them a "civil union" that entitles them to state benefits and equality without redefining marriage. It would simply be defined as the union of either two men or two women. Problem solved. It's so simple and logical, it'll never work.I could have been clearer, but perhaps you need to read a little more carefully as well.I don't view married heterosexual couples as a "dependent class", far from it. (Other than the fact that every citizen has become too dependent on the gov't for my liking.)I think that while there are gov't programs in place to provide direct financial assistance to married couples, the biggest thing they provide is a means for couples to help themselves. Tax incentives, retirement plans, legal and estate issues, etc... are all in place to aid them. It allows them to help themselves and get them off the gov't dole, or at least, minimize their impact.Who is paying for these services for homosexuals, or homosexual couples? It would seem to me that the gov't is picking up a much bigger piece of the pie, both directly and indirectly, due to the fact that the same aid in dealing with these important and COSTLY issues is not available to them.Is that schizophrenic?I don't want to set you off on another rant about liberal judges, that's for sure. :pI think we've been down this road, just because something is "long standing" does not make it fair or equitable. We can both list off examples of this I'm sure.As for the process of change, I don't think that's the argument here, it is a clever duck of the issue of descrimination based on sexual orientation though. ;) When it comes to marrying your kin, I'd say your southern countrymen have the market cornered. :pRealistically, have you ever heard an outcry for the right to marry incestuously? Theoretically, I guess it does crack the door open. The potential for birth defects and other side affects is reason enough to prevent reproduction in an incestuous relationship.Polygamy - What was the original reason for banning polygamy? Likely the Bible. Anyhoo, again, I may be an "ultra-liberal" but honestly, I fail to see the harm. Polygamy is still practiced in many cultures. If both man and wives enter into the marriage willingly, the marriage is stable, and all are law abiding, upstanding citizens in their community, what's the issue?That said, it would seem to me you'd have to be outright CRAZY to want to try and juggle more than one wife, I can barely handle one most of the time! :pWaxy

Quite frankly, I could care less how long the average marriage lasts, it doesn't have an real bearing on the right to marry IMHO.Marriage does NOT equal children.Waxy

Moreover, I think there are other pro-gay marriage posters like Waxy who probably agree that homosexuals, on average, don't stay together as long as heteros, but they then attribute that to not having access to the stabilizing influence of marriage. Well that view is just a hypothesis, and I'm not sure what causes their instability; what is clear to me is that it exists whatever the reason. My personal experience is consistent with this view too, but I realize this is anecdotal. I have written in a earlier post that I suspect lesbian homes would be much more stable than male homosexual homes since men tend to be not as good at commitment. Hetero men have needed a lot of moral pressure to stay with their wives and children throughout history; that pressure does not exist in this era to keep two gay men together.

See my response to JPSartre12.Again though marriage does NOT equal children.Waxy

This seems to be a particularly important basis for your view. These statements lack precision. You are not advocating equality in the eyes of the law because (I am guessing) that you are not in favor of, for example, pedophile-victim marriages; you are in favor of equality before the law for marital arrangements that don't harm anyone. If this is your position, then ANY marital arrangment that doesn't harm anyone should be granted. That would include but not be limited to following types of marriages: adult daughter/father, adult son/mother, adult daughter/mother, adult son/father, adult brother/daughter, adult brother/brother, adult sister/sister, adult niece/uncle, adult nephew/aunt, adult niece/aunt, adult nephew/uncle, adult granddaughter/grandfather, adult grandson/grandmother, adult grandson/grandfather, adult granddaughter/grandmother, homosexual and heterosexual first-cousin pairings, groups marriages of family members of all possible combinations as long as their adults. By your standards, ANY conceivable group qualifies for marriage as long as no one gets hurt. Polygyny and polyandry fit this category, and there are tens of thousands of polygynists in the country and more immigrating every year. A free love commune desiring group marriage is another. There are hundreds of thousands of bisexuals in the country; maybe many would like to have one of each sex for a spouse. Many people might decide that a marriage of a group of friends would give the variety, economic stability, and social/emotional support not always found between two people. And I'm not even being skeptical about whether there is harm in marriages involving children. Girls in many parts of the world are marriage in their early teens, presumably not doing harm to participants. If I am reading you right, the burden of proof that the marital arrangements are harmful falls on the opponents of these marriages. How can we deny a couple who are originally from Mexico who want to get married even though the girl is only 13? How can deny 2 severely retarded people from getting married, or 2 institutionalized paranoid schizophrenics? A complete list of arguably non-harming marital arrangements (as homosexual marriages are arguably non-harming) would be very long indeed. As long as even one of these groups is not granted marriage licenses, we have not reached equality under the law as you define it.

Well over 90% of people who marry eventually have or raise children--that is close enough to "equals" for me, and stating that that you are indifferent to the length of the average marriage suggests you are indifferent to the issue of harm which supposedly is at the the top of the hierarchy of your values.

You're going to have to abandon you're "marriage does not equal children" to make this point.Ok, so you're fine with polygamy, and I'm not sure about your position on all incestuous marriages. What about all the other types I mentioned? It seems to me that your standards do not allow you to be against incestuous marriages as long as they don't have children and presumably all other imaginable combinations as long as they are not doing anything that is blatantly harmful. Do you see why I describe a "It's all good as long as no blatant harm is done" moral standard is licentious, nihililistic, and empty--it gives you no armor to resist a potential world of brothers and sisters marrying each other. One reason why we don't see an outcry for incestuous marriage is that the traditional morality remains strong and unchallenged in this area, but there is not reason this won't come under assault by some people from the "anything goes" camp? Incest is just a irrational superstition like all moral traditions, right? Those scary, meddling Christians are up to it again, telling siblings what they can and can't do. They are a terrifying bunch; they get taught destrictive things like that since you are a child of God, God commands them that they must treat you with dignity whether they feel like it or not, unlike the harmless nihilist who is free to see you as just a pile of biomass in his way from getting what he wants.

Is it not conceivable that the "marriage law" as amended could provide for marriage between two consenting adults as long as they were not too close of blood relations. No mules, no victim/perp., no polygamy, no children. Some of you guys are just reaching.As far as "civil union", this was my postion initially although now I don't support that solution.

You really think so, sinjin? What about, let's say, thirty years from now, when you're old and gray with little sinjin's sitting on your lap. When it has gotten to the point that a person's rights are, by far, more important than right and wrong? When the hologram shows a human/mule union and a lot of braying and singing going on?Somehow, if the sick-minded have precedence, they will fight for that; demand it. Call it reaching if you want, but one step leads to another.

I, for one, am not reaching at all; I was responding to Waxy's principled point: the country lacks equality under law as long as couples who are not hurting anyone cannot marry. So I listed some examples of people we must arguably grant marraige license to by his standard. By what basis or principle, do we dissallow all these marriages that you are against?

Can you presently enter into a legally binding contract with a non-human? In addition, marriage laws and incest laws are unrelated. Marriage laws could be changed without changing existing prohibition of incest.The fact is that many of you opposed see homosexuality as either a crime against nature or God or both, akin to beastialty or pedophilia or incest. It is none of those but your moral indignation has overwhelmed your ability to have compassion for two human beings in love who just want to be granted the same rights as any straight couple.

I'm not sure the 90% statistic is #1 valid, and #2 applicable to homosexual marriages.How can an indifference to the length of marriage be correlated to harm? Especially if no children are involved?This would imply that divorce causes direct harm to one or both parties. This may or may not be true, and is certainly a matter of what you consider harm.The potential harm done is also not limited to homosexual marriages, and therefore, IMHO, cannot be used as a significant argument for or against.Waxy

I can't really make a point here. I don't support incestuous relationships, but I would find it hard to ban them. I just don't see them as a major factor. Anyhoo,If two mentally handicapped people or two people with mental health problems can find happiness and want to be married, why would anyone want to deny them that? Why jump to the "poor persecuted Christian" thing? Why classify anyone in favour of gay marriage as a nihilist who only regards humans as biomass? IMHO, nothing could be further from the truth. It's the concern that us "nihilists" have for the welfare and happiness of others that drives us to argue for their rights. We aren't screaming that the sky is falling.Who is denying who dignity in this discussion? That's a precarious statement on your part.Waxy

You're going to have to abandon you're "marriage does not equal children" to make this point.Ok, so you're fine with polygamy, and I'm not sure about your position on all incestuous marriages. What about all the other types I mentioned? It seems to me that your standards do not allow you to be against incestuous marriages as long as they don't have children and presumably all other imaginable combinations as long as they are not doing anything that is blatantly harmful. Do you see why I describe a "It's all good as long as no blatant harm is done" moral standard is licentious, nihililistic, and empty--it gives you no armor to resist a potential world of brothers and sisters marrying each other. One reason why we don't see an outcry for incestuous marriage is that the traditional morality remains strong and unchallenged in this area, but there is not reason this won't come under assault by some people from the "anything goes" camp? Incest is just a irrational superstition like all moral traditions, right? Those scary, meddling Christians are up to it again, telling siblings what they can and can't do. They are a terrifying bunch; they get taught destrictive things like that since you are a child of God, God commands them that they must treat you with dignity whether they feel like it or not, unlike the harmless nihilist who is free to see you as just a pile of biomass in his way from getting what he wants.

I, for one, am not reaching at all; I was responding to Waxy's principled point: the country lacks equality under law as long as couples who are not hurting anyone cannot marry. So I listed some examples of people we must arguably grant marraige license to by his standard. By what basis or principle, do we dissallow all these marriages that you are against?

I hadn't thought of that, it rings VERY true.Waxy

Is it not conceivable that the "marriage law" as amended could provide for marriage between two consenting adults as long as they were not too close of blood relations. No mules, no victim/perp., no polygamy, no children. Some of you guys are just reaching.As far as "civil union", this was my postion initially although now I don't support that solution. Upon reflection I am reminded that "separate but equal" is not equal.

I wish to be clear here if you'll allow me since I fear I have upset someone who's thoughts I value.I do not consider homosexuality to be "deviant" in any way. IMO when someone easily equates homosexuality with beastiality, pedophilia and/or incest I am inclined to believe "deviant" is how they view it. How can anyone support the expanding rights of sexual "deviants" where there are clearly victims be they human or livestock or? Where is the victim in "gay marriage"?

Same sex unions have existed in this world centuries ago. Homosexuals deserve the same rights as heterosexuals. It could be called gay marriage or civil unions as long as they have the same equal rights as a married heterosexual couple. Gays have families and their children also need to be protected. I believe gays are allowed to marry in Sweden and Holland. There are no problems whatsoever. The problem: Don't think sex all the time when you think of homosexual relationships. You have gay couples who are senior citizens. 2 men being in a relationship is foreign to you, but it's not for others. If Mike and Shawn are happy with one another, you should be ok with it. Hey, at least you don't have to worry about a gay person trying to talk to your wife or girlfriend. Please Remember: Don't think sex when dealing with same sex relationships. It's love, commitment, and also sexual pleasure. IT's the same principles as a heterosexual couple.MELSUCCEEDS

melsucceeds,Good post: meaningful, understandable, your opinion.But, to address the problem is to look at it. Face it and comment on it. Since it is a man's right to marry another man, would it also be his right to marry a mule? I'm not trying to be funny - far from it - I am trying to understand the justification for using the sanctity of marriage as a device for equality.This is the problem we're faced with. Not hatred, bigotry, or racism.

88% of ever married women aged 40-44 have at least one child (I pick this age since by that age we can presume a woman is done). The number is higher for women never divorcing, but I can't find it yet. http://www.census.gov/population/soc...2002/tab01.pdfMore later....

I'm not sure the 90% statistic is #1 valid, and #2 applicable to homosexual marriages.How can an indifference to the length of marriage be correlated to harm? Especially if no children are involved?This would imply that divorce causes direct harm to one or both parties. This may or may not be true, and is certainly a matter of what you consider harm.The potential harm done is also not limited to homosexual marriages, and therefore, IMHO, cannot be used as a significant argument for or against.Waxy

Deviant is a very general term. We could call vegetarians deviant, and any minority group, deviant. I suppose it depends on the same-sex couple what they do and don't practice. Why do you seem so interested in the "wide world" of normal sex between partners of same sex? Are you gay yourself?

No one is forcing you to have gay sex though, I said before, I find cheese physically repellant.

Course if these problems could be fixed easily (gene therapy is not that good at the moment) then there is no real problem with incest anymore, but that is opening a whole different debate anyway.Incest is a better example of a possible slippery slope than bestiality or pedophilia, though how much of one it is I am not sure as the issue is different (gay marriage is mainly about traditional values and peoples opinions on normalcy rather than the other issues of consent and harm to children)

Religions still don't recognise each others marriages or civil ones and they wouldn't recognise these either, doesn't seem much of a reason to make the word different other than to emphasise that it is less than marriage if there is a difference.

I tried reading everything here but to me it sounded like a big argument over nothing. Why is this even a freaking issue? If people have problems with gays getting married then they most have problems with almost everything our society holds. I think the goverment should not create any laws for any perticular group of people whether for or against them. Are laws are there for equal rights not to prevent people from doing what they like to do. I think gays and anyone should have the same rights and if they are denied that then the whole point of our society is down the drains. First of all marriage is not a right. You sign marriage papers in order to get benefits from the goverment which has very little to do with the religion you are marrying in. Then you marry any where you desire. People get marriage certificates and go off and marry in a Satanic chruch. Should they be banned? Hasn't anyone thought of that.But the goverment should not get involved. They should allow anyone the same rights and just allow the religions to decide.

Good argument Jake. Way to just show how bias you are against Christians. Religion isn't a disorder becasue people are taught relgion not disorders. Also people can change relgions and have much more control over their religions.

Yes, well I've seen heterosexist right-wing Christians unnaturally obsessed with trying to recruit everyone to be just like them, struggle and overcome their disorder. It may be more than they think they can do, but they can do it. People with other disorders such as those obsessed with trying to recruit Jews and Hindus, or anyone who does not believe or live as they do, overcome their disorders too. So do many other people who also are not normal and have disorders that run the entire gamut.

All of these situations involve non-consensual acts either through lack of knowledge or involvement of minors. You cannot compare that to consensual acts between adults.

It is completely logical in the scriptures. It's funny how people say it isnt' logical when tehy can't understand teh basic concepts.

And a lot of things taken in context mean exaclty what the anti-homosexual party want them to. This isn't the point, why should someone's religious text be froced on anyone if they don't agree if it is purely a religious issue. Perhaps it would be better if the US had something closer to France's 'freedom from religion' rather than its 'freedom of religion', but that is the topic for another thread.Are there any official recognised (by their peers and the rest of the scientific community) organisations that do beleive that homosexuality is a disorder? There is a central board that decides what is and what is not a legally recognised disorder is there not?As for quoting Polls for current opinions, what do the anti-homosexuals think about this one?

Define harm. For many homosexualiuty is harmfulEnabling means to help the behavior. Also humans laws are all subjective.It is a disorder. It isn't considered the norm. Loo up disorder.I don't follow at what you're getting at wiht this.

Once again, no it isn't. It still has to be harmful to be a disorder, otherwise its just a less common phenotype. What you are putting in as laws of nature are not really what they actually mean, you can not break physical laws, they are fundamental discriptions of the universe- not common trends or an idealised behaviour like our human laws are. Not sure what you mean by enabling more?And that is all, not a disorder.Getting dangerously close to eugeneics here, in what way is someones genes anything to do with us or that their beleifs are being allowed to continue to the next generation. If that kind of stuff was legislated against then that would be far more damamging to soiceity than allowing gay marriage. Would you prefer a less pious more tolerant society, or a return of the nazi gas chambers?

I like people not homosexuality. Everyone has equal rights this is already done until you can show how they don't. Also why do I care about the UK? Go to China, Tonga, Phillipines, Peru, India, Jordan, and see how much support gay marriage has there.I'm a friend to everyone. If I don't accept pedophilia does that mean I'm a pedophobic ( or however you call it)?Humans have the msot studies done about them. There are hundreds of medical school worldwide dedicated to studying human anatomy.The argument is that gays will help the isntituion because they won't divorce and that isn't true.Also LDS marriages divorce at around 15%. That is the only religious marriage statistic I could find.Exactly the inidiviual rights are the samea teh religous rights are not. So what is your point? Not all behavior has equal rights because we legislate against some and not others.The majority always decides in a democracy. The minority is protected by a constitution. How is it fair to let a minority dictate policy making? Should we let muslims or whtie supremacist rule the majority?
attacks
I know there are people in the UK who agree with you, but they are in a much greater minority then in the US and are far more isolated to the extremes (generally the older population and those who already have extreme fringe groups). So you like gays, but just don't think they should be treated equally and be allowed to choose the lifestyle you want- some friend you are. You oppose gay rights and consider it a mental disorder, that fits quite well into the common defintion of homophobic. If you beleive what you do you have no problem being homophobic as there is a definite reason for it, howwever don't try to pretend you are a friend in anyway to them.Likewise, if it is not genetic there would no real reason not to accomodate it is there? Also there isn't a great deal of higher organisms studied other than mice and even then there isn't a great deal of pressure looking for them. Just isn't the most common kind of genentic research.Are these civil unions divorcing at the same rate as non relgioius marriages? Do we mean civil union as purely gay marriage as well, the term changes from place to place? Not sure if you looked at the stats compared to marriages between non religious people it would be very different. And how does someone else divorcing reduce the chance you will stay with your partner?meh, everyone else gets too, felt it was my turn.The religion analogy is fine, the individual descrimation is religious rather than sexual. We just have laws banning one and not the other at the momentShinto beleiver- can go to temple, but not chuchChristian beleiver - can go to temple, but not churchStraight man - can marry womanGay man - can marry womanSame? Yes.The majority doesn't decide what is acceptable behaviour, nor should it. The majority is controlled by minorities which really decide what is good and what is not and then tell the majority what to beleive. It is the only way a society can operate if you don't want massive persecution of minorities

What do you mean define harm? Means 'damage or hurt', and those who see homosexuality itself being harmful have to be careful not to include traits commonly assocaiated with it (like depression due to lack of acceptance, greater instance of unsafe sex etc). As for the enabling (which means nothing like what you said), still don't get what you are trying to say and the human laws being subjective seems odd here too as we were not talking about them- you were calling thing laws of nature whihc weren't.Disorder doesn't mean simply outside the norm but a harmful disturbance of the body/organ. You can get unusual traits that are not disorders but you can not have a beneficial disorder. Look up eugenics, if we are going to talk slipperly slope arguments you have a good one here. If you decide that one of the reasons gays shouldn't adopt children is that they will more likely turn out gay then this is the kind of thing you are trying to do.

No one is paying more, but some more people are paying less. If you are worrying about having to pay more taxs then shouldn't you take inot account them being able to pay less up to the normal levels for a married couple?

I can tell that you're not an economist. :)Here's an example. I own a company employing 10 people. Half of these people are married. As their employer, I pay $500/month for the family healthcare and $200/month for singles, so my total costs are $2500 + $1000 = $3500. Two of my single employees are gay and get "married to same-sex partners. If they're legally married, my healthcare costs go up by $600/month, so I'm now paying $4100/month in healthcare benefits.

Let's assume that the gays are reasonably successful and pay in at the maximum rate (based on $87.9K/year).If the "spouse" dies today, leaving a family, they would receive up to $3352.00/month in benefits that wouldn't have existed prior to the legalization of gay marriages. If one of those 10,000 gays died at age 40, leaving a "husband/wife/whatever" and a young child, this could amount to an extra 3352 x 12months x 18years = ~$724,000. Add to that the survivor's benefits after the spouse turns 65 and you're up to a $Million PLUS.So, you see, it IS an economics issue.

But the economic points didn't make sense. It isn't a new tax, its just the same tax benefits  that they could get anyway should they chose to. No one is paying more, but some more people are paying less. If you are worrying about having to pay more taxs then shouldn't you take inot account them being able to pay less up to the normal levels for a married couple?

JP,You can't mix and match responses. :( That post was made in reference to a couple of very specific posts by mana'ia in which his true colors came shining through.I certainly wouldn't accuse you of the same, despite the fact I know you are devotedly Christian, and that it does undoubtedly form part of your resistance to the issue. I realize that you have argued it from a non-religious standpoint.As for the "new tax", that's why I challenged you to all or nothing. If you want to base this purley on money and taxes, then it's a simple matter of equality. Either there are benefits for married couples or there aren't. Pretty simple.Waxy

I can tell that you're not an economist. :)Here's an example. I own a company employing 10 people. Half of these people are married. As their employer, I pay $500/month for the family healthcare and $200/month for singles, so my total costs are $2500 + $1000 = $3500. Two of my single employees are gay and get "married to same-sex partners. If they're legally married, my healthcare costs go up by $600/month, so I'm now paying $4100/month in healthcare benefits. So, you see, businesses will be forced to subsidize these gay marriages whether or not they agree with the practice or they'll get hauled into court by gays screaming "discrimination".

No I've referred to both genders. If they dobn't act on it then are they gay? Am I a professional football player becasue I think about hjow great it would be or do I ahve to actually do before I'm considered a pro football player? Football has many benefits that outweight the risks. Homosexuality does not. Also how is it justifiable? Yes the law prohibits many people taht are in love to never act on their feelings, such as if school/teacher, adult/minor, two married, relatives, and many others.Define a homosexual? If someone tries weed once and tehy always wnt it again but never do it are tehy addicted?I've given you many reasons on why ti shouldn't be done. It is harmful to them and society. Tehy do make rules to more harmful behavior but spending your time watching or palying sports has many beneficial aspects as opposed to other behavior.Polygamy is between two people. It jsut happens that one makes various contracts. The contracts are independent of each other so it only invovles two. It's liek if you're a buyer or seller. One contract with one buyer/seller is independent other buyers and sellers.How do you determine that gay nmarriage deserves recognition adn other marriages do not?
attacks
Okay, you've only proved that homosexuality is maladaptive in males just now, and only then if they mate. Also, there is a lot of harmful behavior that is worse than that that is not considered a disorder, like playing football. You can be injured doing that, but as it doesn't fit under the other two catagories, it is not considered a disorder. Homosexual intercourse is justifiable, it would be unjustifiable to expect two people in love to never have a physical relationship.Yes, but you can not prove that they are no longer homosexual, just that they no longer act on what they desire.Yes, but a loving parent does not make rules for no reason. There has to be some way that it is harmful to someone for it to be unacceptable. Also, they wouldn't make a rule against some slightly harmful behavior without making rules against more harmful behavior, like spending all your time watching sports or playing football, which can cause injuries. Or going to a Catholic Church, did you know that all that kneel sit stand stuff can cause damage to your kneecaps?Polygamy is between more than two consenting adults, because everyone in the marriage is married to more than one person. Relatives may end up getting married, but they are just as likely to if gays can or can not get married. After all, if two relatives fall in love they can fight for it just as well with or without gay marriage. Personally, I don't think gay marriage has any effect on it, because if it gets enough support we will end up with it, gay marriage being legal or not.

Jake so what I can go to other websites that have an agenda like you websites do and pull up articles to refute and then we'll eb going back and forth. My argument if that there is nothing defintive and each side is going to believe in their studies. Also since neither side can show that it is definitively better or genetic then it should be assumed that it isn't because until their is defintive evidence to suggest otherwise original decision should stand.Why do you keep using the word obsessed? People can be concerned and not obsessed. If i had a problem that i thought was so bad I would wnat to die regardless what the reason was even if it was religious. If I had a terminal illnesses I would rather die quickly than be a burden and suffer the idignities of the disease. Does that make my culture or the medical communtiy wrong for giving me that perspective?( I do not believe in euthanasia)I can't understand how you cna provide with a variety of non-religous views without condemning his religous views.Ex-gay programs are like any intervention program. Many poeple that fail rehab or anyt other rehab programs feel depressed and upset becasue tehy feel there is no cure.I would simply ask him what he is feelinig. I feel that indirect communication loses alot in the translation. I feel that you're presenting a very bias opinion of his probloems and that doesn't allow me to see what he's feeling.

Thank you so much for these misrepresented statistics from the board of directors of this not so prestigious, 2 year old, right-wing political organization. What was I thinking posting from the American Academy of Pediatrics?I just love the part where they state that homosexual partnerships are more prone to breaking up, compared to heterosexual marriage. Do all heterosexuals marry the first person they have a partnership with?Oh, and what a surprise, heterosexual marriages last longer than the average gay relationship! Just like in my previous example, this is an apples and oranges comparison. Not all heterosexuals who are in relationships are married. They also cited the Bell and Weinberg study from the 1970's. Gay men in sex clubs and gay singles bars and gay book stores were interviewed, and found to be promiscuous. The heterosexuals surveyed were from residential areas, some included married couples. In order for the samples to be comparable they would have to survey heterosexuals from hetero singles bars, hetero sex clubs, and hetero book stores. For all we know their findings could have indicated what life was like for the average single person in San Fran in the 1970's. Also, some other studies were misrepresented.For example, the claims of more domestic violence in gay relationships cites the Island and Letellier study. It's authors have shown how they were quoted completely out of context by right-wing anti-gay groups...http://www.afaexposed.com/a_letellier.htmlAlso the authors of the original study on gay life expectancy have had their study misrepresented by anti-gay groups, as the authors show in this article in the International Journal of Epidemiology...http://ije.oupjournals.org/cgi/content/full/30/6/1499Obsessed with the idea that he is going to hell if he doesn't follow all the rules, wanting to die because he sees it as the only "cure"? Attacks anyone who questions his beliefs. That indicates a problem with religion. He has a wide diversity of opinions presented to him. I did not attack religion as I wrote previously. I told him he had to consider that he was using religion in a destructive way.Yes, it really is. It shows the dark side of the ex-gay "program". You are the last person he needs to talk to. What would you tell him, to keep going on the path he's going on? To keep trying something that has not worked. Stay miserable so that you want to die, because God wants you in that situation, or God can magically make you feel better or heterosexual if you simply have a little more faith and pray just a little more? What would you tell this person? How would you defend the ex-gay "program"? I'm thinking maybe nothing could make things worse for him, but I still hesitate to give you his email.

Waxy, you're sounding more like a bleeding heart American liberal instead of a Canadian Socialist every post. :)Why should anyone be forced to give money to a newly-created group that the majority don't think should even exist? Why should businesses be forced to support social experiments that they disagree with? And you failed to make a significant distinction. The tax benefits that you "are entitled to" aren't based on your sexual orientation, they're based on your marital status. You get NO benefits from being a heterosexual nor do you lose any by being a homosexual. What you gain through marriage are benefits that the government has deemed worthy of reinforcing/rewarding financially. It is no different from giving home owners a tax break on their mortgage interest because the government promotes property ownership of its citizens. And these benefits were given to the individuals through legislation written by Congress and signed into law by the President. Gays don't want to go that route because it would be the kiss of death to their cause. Instead, they search out sympathetic minor governmental officials and judges who attempt to institute fiat laws that attempt to force policy AND COSTS on the citizens without their input. If gay marriages are allowed without Congressional involvement, a saavy lawyer could easily argue that it would represent an example of taxation without representation. emoticonXAgree

In the US, WE pay for our healthcare directly, not Uncle Sam. If I was single, I would pay ~$150/month, but since I'm married with dependents AND an HCI, I pay more than twice that amount, as does my employer.And WRT our Social Security System, current recipients are receiving far more in benefits than they ever imagined or could have contributed. IIRC, the factor was something like 17X as much, so I could argue that it really isn't THEIR money in the first place. Add to that a "new prescription plan" that will be paid for by current and future employees and it becomes even more of a stretch to call it THEIR money.

Why? What does that mean? I wasn't even aware I was a Canadian socialist. emoticonXConfused Anyhoo.The simple answer is the precedent has already been set. You're misinterpreting my stance as being pro handout, when in fact I'm only pro equality. You can eliminate all the handouts tomorrow, I'd be a happy man for the most part, but as long as they exist, I believe there should be equality in the way they are distributed. Taxpayers and businesses pay for things they disagree with everyday, that's a simple fact. You either have to give them the right to refuse to pay, or force them to pay equally. That seems pretty straight forward to me. Again, see the first sentence.As for private enterprise, they are not FORCED in any way to provide health benefits. They can just as easily choose not to provide health benefits to their employees if they feel that would be beneficial, as long as they do it equally.This is a red herring JP, and pretty simply, a false distinction. Your sexual orientation determines your ability to marry. Your marital status determines your tax/benefit situation.It's pretty simple to follow that if A requires B, and B is determined by C, then A is determined by C. A= tax benefitsB= marriageC= sexual orientationI agree. HOWEVER.Are homosexuals prohibited from receiving tax breaks on home ownership?Why should homosexuals then be denied the right to marry and receive the accompanying benefits?What you've done here, is completely abandon your financial stance, and shift to a moral one - what the gov't, ie the citizens, deem morally right. (in your opinion). Which I would suggest, will ALWAYS be the basis of any anti gay marriage stance.Whatever, I don't want to get into this one.Waxy

Indeed I am not an economist but I defintely agree with the equality issue, you are not creating a entirely new dependant class (and they as have been pointed out are not really dependant on the government...hmm, wonder if married couples are generally less dependant as one partner can support the other either indefinitely or at least between jobs) but enlarging the group to cover people who would fit all the right qualifications for it. Meh, I'll just stick to proteins.So which group would you rather be in? Europe and Canada or China and the Middle East?Damn you foot hater you! ;) I wouldn't mind considering myself being strongly opposed to paedophilia and would admit to being paedophilophobe (if only because the word sounds cool). The same is rarely true for the homosexual case and people against it. never mind though, was a fairly pointless argument anyway.But given the choice between Cancer and AIDs prevention or whether hmosexuality is innate, far fewer choose the latter. Research resources are rare and priorities are made. There are very few unbiased studies done due to the lack in funding other than lobbies they will get.No one ever suggested this, the point was really why does it matter if John and Dave get divorced, will that make you love your wife less (well, maybe if you fancied Dave...but then who doesn't ;))?Are those official divorces? Could be be remarried in an LDS church? Will have a hunt around for some other stats and will see where to put them.But do you not beleive that people should be allowed to practice their religion? Would you not oppose a law banning religions?Or blacks and women, why should they get a vote if they don't have it. The mjority doesn't rule, minorites (though not always the normally viewed issue based ones) decide what the majority should believe and the masses go along unless servely pushed.

I like people not homosexuality. Everyone has equal rights this is already done until you can show how they don't. Also why do I care about the UK? Go to China, Tonga, Phillipines, Peru, India, Jordan, and see how much support gay marriage has there.I'm a friend to everyone. If I don't accept pedophilia does that mean I'm a pedophobic ( or however you call it)?Humans have the msot studies done about them. There are hundreds of medical school worldwide dedicated to studying human anatomy.The argument is that gays will help the isntituion because they won't divorce and that isn't true.Also LDS marriages divorce at around 15%. That is the only religious marriage statistic I could find.Exactly the inidiviual rights are the samea teh religous rights are not. So what is your point? Not all behavior has equal rights because we legislate against some and not others.The majority always decides in a democracy. The minority is protected by a constitution. How is it fair to let a minority dictate policy making? Should we let muslims or whtie supremacist rule the majority?

You're creating a new "legal entity" who will have new legal status, leading to increased court costs. While I've discussed private medical insurance, there will also be increased public costs as taxpayers are forced to cover medical expenses of Federal, State and Municipal workers' new dependents....and the list goes on.....

JP,You can't mix and match responses. :( That post was made in reference to a couple of very specific posts by mana'ia in which his true colors came shining through.I certainly wouldn't accuse you of the same, despite the fact I know you are devotedly Christian, and that it does undoubtedly form part of your resistance to the issue. I realize that you have argued it from a non-religious standpoint.As for the "new tax", that's why I challenged you to all or nothing. If you want to base this purley on money and taxes, then it's a simple matter of equality. Either there are benefits for married couples or there aren't. Pretty simple.Waxy

Not really sure this is just cause for denying it though, doesn't seem that different from argueing against freeing slaves as they would start owning property and cause all manner of new court costs as well as the government now being required to support them if they have a problem.From a lot of the stats it doesn't seem like it will create that many new 'dependants' compared to the overall population. One of the other threads estiamtes that it is probably about 3% of the population gays and no way near all of them will get married. Does being married cause you to gain all this 'other peoples money' or is it just when a married couple encounters difficulties?

Originally posted by Tastyfish:Indeed I am not an economist but I defintely agree with the equality issue, you are not creating a entirely new dependant class (and they as have been pointed out are not really dependant on the government...hmm, wonder if married couples are generally less dependant as one partner can support the other either indefinitely or at least between jobs) but enlarging the group to cover people who would fit all the right qualifications for it. Meh, I'll just stick to proteins.By reclassifying gays as "married" , you are, indeed, creating a new class of dependent. You are expanding the number of people who have claim to others' money and resources. I gave the example of the impact on businesses, but there are many others. You're creating a new "legal entity" who will have new legal status, leading to increased court costs. While I've discussed private medical insurance, there will also be increased public costs as taxpayers are forced to cover medical expenses of Federal, State and Municipal workers' new dependents....and the list goes on.....

And just as substantial and satisfying. ;) :pNever heard of it, I'm 99% sure it doesn't exist in Alberta, at least not within the oil industry. Dang commie auto industry. :pIf homosexual couples are a new "dependent class", then every heterosexual couple in the country is part of a dependent class. That means that not only are the single people pulling their weight, they're actually paying for what, 2/3 of the population as well? How realisitic is that?Single people unite - you're being screwed! I just don't think "why should employers be forced to pay" is a valid argument. Like I've said, employers and employees are forced to pay for things they don't use or don't agree with everyday. Like I said, the precedent has been set. Unless you are willing to grant the ability to opt out of every "undesirable" program, then the precedent exists to enforce mandatory payment.In the case of health benefits, it is the CHOICE of the employer to pay them. Any employer has the option of simply not offering a health benefit plan to its employees.There's no creation of a new class, only the granting of equality when it comes to marital benefits. So employers do have a choice, all or nothing, as long as it's done equally.That's what happens when the fox is in charge of the henhouse.Waxy

Clear as pea soup. :)"Highly compensated individual". It's a term that big companies use in order to extract more money from an employee for their healthcare benefits compared to the average Joe. In otherwords, corporate Marxism "from each according to his means....." ;)It's unfair because it is the creation of another dependent class for which a "spouse's" employer will be forced to subsidize. While the employee may willingly want to pay a portion of his new dependent's benefit, why should the employer?Yes, the folly of SS. It sarted out as a saving's plan using the employee's AND employer's money. Then the politicians found it was an infinite source of votes for them, so they gave away other people's money as well. emoticonXAngry

It all comes down to the fact thta it isn't definitive. ALso any program for rehabilitaiton works better if the poerson is religious and has family support. All Psitzer p[roves is that homosexuality isn't genetic. If it were genetic then it would be definitve. If it genetic they show where it is genetic and then that is it. You cant' deny the evidence if it existed.

Here is more about Spitzer's unpublished study, and its sample, including what Spitzer himself has to say about it...He was disappointed, however, that many reports overlooked his statements explaining that his sample was limited and that he was not maintaining that a substantial number of gays and lesbians could become straight if they sought reparative therapy. "For the vast majority it is not possible for them to change their sexual orientation," he said. Spitzer also acknowledged that "a lot of people will misuse" his findings, which could cause pain for many individuals. "It may help 5,000 people, but harm 500,000," he said. He is concerned, he added, that "the Christian right," with its intolerance of and opposition to homosexuality, will use his findings in its campaign to prevent gays and lesbians from gaining civil rights protections. http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/c.../full/36/13/20Spitzer learned from Stalstrom that his study was being misused—an outcome about which he has been concerned since his study was publicized last spring. He then wrote to Karkkainen, the lawmaker leading the charge against the bill, saying that he was "disturbed" that his study results were being "misused by those who are against antidiscrimination laws and civil unions for gays and lesbians." Spitzer explained that while his study results run counter "to the current view of most mental health professionals," who maintain that homosexuals cannot change their sexual orientation, his report was "based on a very unique sample." Such results "are probably quite rare, even for highly motivated homosexuals," he said. He added in his letter to the parliament member that "it would be a serious mistake to conclude" from his research that homosexuality is a "choice." He emphasized that he is concerned with "scientific issues" related to sexual orientation, and that he "personally favor[s] antidiscrimination laws and civil unions for homosexuals." In an interview with Psychiatric News, Spitzer also rejected the argument made by Finnish opponents of civil unions, as well as some people who hailed his study results earlier this year, that the decision to remove homosexuality as a DSM-III diagnosis was a political decision in which APA succumbed to pressure from gay groups and their allies in the profession. That argument is "nonsense," he emphasized. "Both sides of the controversy were convinced that science was on their side" when they made their decision. http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/c.../full/36/24/11It had taken Spitzer more than 18 months to find just 200 or so people willing to describe themselves as successfully converted. He found his interviewees by advertising through ex-gay organisations. Almost half were recruited through ex-gay ministries, and nearly a quarter by Narth. Religion was "extremely" or "very" important to 93% of them. One in five was a mental health professional (Cohen, for example, is a high-profile reparative therapist) or director of an ex-gay ministry, and more than three-quarters had previously lobbied for sexual reorientation. These are people who get paid to say that therapy works. For many critics, this alone was enough to discredit the exercise. An article in the APA's Psychiatric News likened it to testing a drug on people recruited by the pharmaceutical company. But in addition, many of the participants appeared to have been not so much altered from gay to straight, as bisexual all along. Ten per cent of the men had never had gay sex before therapy, whereas half had already slept with a woman. Only a third of the women and half the men said that before therapy they were "extremely" bothered by homosexual feelings. How gay were they? As with most statistics, everything depends on how they are read. The percentage who were "extremely bothered" by homosexual feelings after undergoing therapy fell to zero. You could say zero was a sensational turnaround; or you might say they weren't so gay in the first place. Two New York psychologists carried out another study of reparative therapy at the same time as Spitzer, and reached the opposite conclusion. "We interviewed 182 people who tried very hard to change," Dr Ariel Shidlo told Newsweek. "The stakes were really high for them. Some really thought that if they didn't change, they would literally find themselves in hell... And they still failed." http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/st...183596,00.htmlDrescher is concerned about the harm that patients can suffer after going through some of the conversion therapies, an issue not addressed in Spitzer’s selective patient sample. "Religious reparative therapies, like the faith healing from which they are derived, are a treatment modality that purports to provide definitive answers regarding human nature and sexuality. They always define homosexuality as wrong and require that individuals trying to change their sexual orientation submit to the therapist’s authority as a condition of treatment," he said in his annual meeting presentation. In the type of interventions Spitzer assessed, "it is the client’s compliance with the therapist’s authority, rather than the therapist’s interpretations, that will determine the outcome of treatment," Drescher suggested. "This is a clinical stance with troubling ethical implications."http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/c.../full/36/13/20

I already have given you a definition to ban homosexualtiy. ANy behavior that is deemed unbeneficial, deviant, or a disorder and is not helpful to the public interest shall not receive and recognition.No talking about general practice is not considered confidential. If it were then people couldn't ask if a surgeon has done so many surgeries of certian types of people.The fact is that there isn't a high rate and that there is a benefit to heterosexuality as in homosexualktiy there is none.That is different. RAce and behavior are not the same. We can regulate behavior but not race. Nudity and homosexualkiuyt are both behavior. Why does one deserve recognition and the other doesn't?Good thing there are good reasons such as decency, morality, health, etc.Taht is your only argument. How many psychologist are have a gay agenda too? You're only argument is taht the sample taht is relgious and has family support is the most successful jsut like any other treatment. Religious and family supported poeple have the highest rates of success for any rehab. What's your point? Does that mean AA, drug rehab, gambling anonymous are phoney too?That is relative.No there is discrimination if we allow this behavior and others that fit the criteria in allowing homosexuality. Heterosexuality has a benefit. Heterosexuality is the foundation for civilization. HOmosexuality has no benefit.The change in polling is always relted to the margin of error. I don't beleive there really ahs been a big change opinion.

The onus is on you to do that.They sit around with you, gossiping about confidential matters with patients? There are problems with acts between heterosexuals.Yes, well there are parts of the U.S. south, where inter-racial relationships are not accepted to be on display. I don't see the connection between nudity and homosexuality. Nudists, will be nudists, regardless of what is happening with gay people.It won't just be imposed without good reason, either.Especially when your sample is of therapists themselves, and of paid activists and lobbyists, given to him by conversion businesses, like Spitzer's sample which he described as "very unique". Also, he didn't do a follow-up study.They certainly did.This is an argument to not allow any sexual relationship. Other things are different from homosexuality, and will have their unique standards, regardless of whether or not we accept gay people. If these others want to fight to have their relationships equally recognized, they will do so regardless of whether or not we accept gay relationships. This was essentially the point of Nature's Cry I believe, and it's a good one.If the polling is flawed, as you say, how can we trust the numbers it produces? The numbers really have not remained steady over time.

You keep bringing up the disorder thing but you are using your own scientifically wrong defition of disorder to back up other point of views. You have deemed it "behavior that is deemed unbeneficial, deviant, or a disorder and is not helpful to the public interest shall not receive and recognition" but officially and medically it is not a disorder, deviant is a loaded word (again maybe true to your defintion but not the general understanding of it in this context.) or irrelevant and what is helpful to the public intrest is dubious as well (doesn't mean what the majority wants, but what is decided to be best for society overall).Clearly there is a benefit to homosexuality for homsexuals, you may not see the appeal but surely you can understand the benefit of loving someone you are attracted to? Might not even have as many possible benefits as heterosexuality as it won't result in kids, but with adoption or IVF this is not an issue either. Heterosexuality is not the basis of civilisation, mutual self interest is. I think you will find that there are many heterosexual organisms in nature and they don't have civilisations. Cooperation and living together are the basis of civilisation, to me it seems that accepting and recognising homosexuality is more in line with the foundations of civilisation than not doing so.

Which would only leave room for Ozzie and Harriott.This is very general hearsay. I have my own anectodotal evidence of the many gay people I know, myself included, who have never had health problems. I won't even say what any of us do, specifically, in our sexual activities, because that's no one's business.Heterosexuality in itself is not beneficial. Good families can be beneficial. Heterosexuality and heterosexual reproduction in and of itself, does not necessarily provide good families, free from abuse, abandonment, etc. Gay and lesbian people have ways of reproducing or adopting too, as Tastyfish mentioned. Heterosexuality is behaviour too. Nudists can be married. They can't be nude in public. Perhaps we should just outlaw all sexual behaviour. Replace it with clean, safe, artificial inseminatin. Otherwise, people risk liking sex for the sex itself, or as a means to be social, and end up doing things which may not have what some believe is the most noticable benefit, namely reproduction. We could also evaluate people under law, to ensure only those who can provide a good family environment may reproduce.These are all good reasons to fight prejudice.So was your original comment I responded to.Opinion polling numbers seem to change quite a bit.

The standards of most in society, is that they don't want busybodies nosing into their sex lives, when they aren't affecting anyone else.

Nudity in public is illegal, that's the difference. Many may not feel heterosexual acts in public are acceptable either. Many don't feel people walking downtown, or going door-to-door and handing out religious pamphlets, and trying to convert others to their religion is appropriate either.

Marriage just doesn't change people. The relationbships won't be affected much by marriage. If two people wanted to eb amrried but couldn't then they would act properly. Marriage wouldn't change their lifestyle. TEHre is no evidence that marriage or civil unions has helped gay lifestyle at all.

How do you explain this, and don't even think of quoting scripture to me. We're in the United States; there is something called seperation of Church and State here.

Marriage is a specially protected institution in most societies for a reason. If the definition of marriage is expanded to include other subgroups, it will lose some of it's status, and will be weakened. This is not a good thing, and will hurt us as a nation, and as a culture, in a very broad sense. Also, it doesn't help to take a wonderful and well respected institution like marriage and redefine it as something supportive of sexual perversion. It's a loss of respect that is quite injurious. Turning marriage into a haven for deviant behavior is a very bad idea.Within ten years of legalizing homosexual marriage, the words, husband and wife, will become politically incorrect.The homosexuals will then complain that those words offend their status as married couples and that everybody should be referred to as partners.

Give us a break, the bibe saying 'in the future there will be Wars...and Earthquakes!' is hardly proof, that is beyond coincidence predicting that 'things will stay much the same as they are and natural events will occur as usual'. Abortions an unwed couples seems to have pretty much nothing to do with the last line.As for minorities and the constitution, the majority can change the constitution or just ignore it. It is in the majorities interest to support and accept minorities because pretty much everyone falls within one of them and minorites still have a significant number of people, maybe not the most important but enough to swing power between forces competting over the majority.

Equality is treating every person the same. However it does not mean treating every person's behavior the same. It does not mean treat every organization the same either. Everyone has the same rights. NOt every religous practice, ideology, or behavior get the same treatment. Teh people determine what is in the public's interest to protect and ban.It basically only the Christian practices that are completely legal. Islamic polgamy and other religons don't have their practices recognized as often as christianity.Homosexuality has strong links to sodomy.Also prostitution is legal in Nevada so shoudl all states be forced to allow taht behavior? Insome states adults cann have sex wiht 14-16yr olds in some cases. Should other states recognize that too?Most serial killers of men and young boys were homosexuals. Sodomy is a crime do you wnat me to post it?gynocologist, Gi specialists, and colon specialist have all stated the effects homosexual related activites. Also there is a higher risk of disease transmission among homosexual men so much so they are not allowed to donate blood for 5 yrs from their last activity.

This is not equality. You are using the letter of the law to twist the purpose of the law, and even then doing it using very shaky logic. Equality is about general concepts, not specifics. It is equality to say 'everyone is has the same right to worship who they want', it is not equality to say 'everyone has the same right to worship who we tell them to'. That is equality within an unequal system, which cannot be counted. Can you re-phrase, I don't follow.No. As I said, those have strong links to criminal activity irrespective of the act itself being a crime. For example drug use has noted links to theft, the same just cannot be said for homosexuality.No it isn't. And even if it was, that has nothing to do with homosexuality anyway.Physical or psychological injury or damage. Homosexuality is therefore in no way harmful. And I have serous doubts about the 'many' who say it is.

Becasue tehre is no merit to the behavior that would need special recognition. SHould people with attachment disorders be allowed to be polygamists? What is so special about homosexuality that it deserves to be treated different than other behaviors? Remember there is no definitve evidence that it is genetic.

Just to stir the pot a little.We all have things that we feel are just plain "wrong". Federal funding of social programs, Islam, religion in general, eating meat, etc, etc...We tolerate these things because they are beneficial to, or the free choice of some, while not coming at the expense of others (except maybe the social programs JP. :p ).What makes gay marriage different that we would deny it?Waxy

Homosexuality among men and women there is harm as I've stated above. There are many things that are harmful that are not illegal. Tobacco, beer, abortion, pornography, gambling, and many tohers should tehy be illegal? Stock manipulation in itself is not harmful should that be legal? What about polygamy it isn't harmful?

What do you mean define harm? Means 'damage or hurt', and those who see homosexuality itself being harmful have to be careful not to include traits commonly assocaiated with it (like depression due to lack of acceptance, greater instance of unsafe sex etc). As for the enabling (which means nothing like what you said), still don't get what you are trying to say and the human laws being subjective seems odd here too as we were not talking about them- you were calling thing laws of nature whihc weren't.Disorder doesn't mean simply outside the norm but a harmful disturbance of the body/organ. You can get unusual traits that are not disorders but you can not have a beneficial disorder. Look up eugenics, if we are going to talk slipperly slope arguments you have a good one here. If you decide that one of the reasons gays shouldn't adopt children is that they will more likely turn out gay then this is the kind of thing you are trying to do.

I wouldn't be so sure. Kids have a way of becoming more conservative as they get older.

mana'ia: Spare us the garbage you picked up from some right wing site about gay serial killers, which leaves out men who kill women.Your slippery slope argument as usual, doesn't look at different orientations or attractions, it only connects things because they are sex. Therefore, to stop the alleged slippery slope, we would have to get rid of the cause, the cause being, sex.There may indeed be some health issues which affect a larger percentage of gay men, as a group, in North America. There are health issues that affect more African Americans as a group. Sickle cell anemia is primarily seen in African Americans.Using your logic, one should cease being a young heterosexual woman in South Africa....http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4684371/If one wanted to be the lowest risk group for HIV, anywhere, one should be a lesbian.If more natural disasters signal end times, it's interesting how jurisdictions full of God-fearing, Bible-thumpting, hillbilly rednecks, are always being hit by horrible tornadoes.

Equality is treating every person the same. However it does not mean treating every person's behavior the same. It does not mean treat every organization the same either. Everyone has the same rights. NOt every religous practice, ideology, or behavior get the same treatment. Teh people determine what is in the public's interest to protect and ban.It basically only the Christian practices that are completely legal. Islamic polgamy and other religons don't have their practices recognized as often as christianity.Homosexuality has strong links to sodomy.Also prostitution is legal in Nevada so shoudl all states be forced to allow taht behavior? Insome states adults cann have sex wiht 14-16yr olds in some cases. Should other states recognize that too?Most serial killers of men and young boys were homosexuals. Sodomy is a crime do you wnat me to post it?gynocologist, Gi specialists, and colon specialist have all stated the effects homosexual related activites. Also there is a higher risk of disease transmission among homosexual men so much so they are not allowed to donate blood for 5 yrs from their last activity.

Indeed I am not an economist but I defintely agree with the equality issue, you are not creating a entirely new dependant class (and they as have been pointed out are not really dependant on the government...hmm, wonder if married couples are generally less dependant as one partner can support the other either indefinitely or at least between jobs) but enlarging the group to cover people who would fit all the right qualifications for it. Meh, I'll just stick to proteins.So which group would you rather be in? Europe and Canada or China and the Middle East?Damn you foot hater you! ;) I wouldn't mind considering myself being strongly opposed to paedophilia and would admit to being paedophilophobe (if only because the word sounds cool). The same is rarely true for the homosexual case and people against it. never mind though, was a fairly pointless argument anyway.But given the choice between Cancer and AIDs prevention or whether hmosexuality is innate, far fewer choose the latter. Research resources are rare and priorities are made. There are very few unbiased studies done due to the lack in funding other than lobbies they will get.No one ever suggested this, the point was really why does it matter if John and Dave get divorced, will that make you love your wife less (well, maybe if you fancied Dave...but then who doesn't ;))?Are those official divorces? Could be be remarried in an LDS church? Will have a hunt around for some other stats and will see where to put them.But do you not beleive that people should be allowed to practice their religion? Would you not oppose a law banning religions?Or blacks and women, why should they get a vote if they don't have it. The mjority doesn't rule, minorites (though not always the normally viewed issue based ones) decide what the majority should believe and the masses go along unless servely pushed.

Look being gay is not a right. It is a decision, you are free to pursue, and others are free to chastise you for doing it. Marriage began as a way for a MAN and WOMAN to be together and raise a child. If a two members of the same sex wish to commit to each other they can call it something else, but not marriage. It says nowhere in the constitution that we have to accept people for who they are, or what they believe in. All it says is that all men are created equal, which is true, however, that changes once you start growing up, making choices, gaining prestige, getting convicted of felonies. So yes everyone starts as equals, however we do not end up that way.

There is no official definition homosexuality being a non-disorder. There is only the APA DSM-IV decision which isn't the "official" declaratory use of homosexuality. Just as the American Bar Association doesn't determine what is legal for Attorneys or what should be the APA only represents most of its members views however they are not the worlwide decision makers on if it is a disorder or not.Also here is a definition of disorder.What is Abnormal?Before we can write about specific behavioral disorders, we must define 'abnormal'. And what is normal behavior?The following criteria are used to determine wheter a persons behavior is abnormal or not:Deviation from statistical norms;the word abnormal means 'away from the norm'. Many population facts are measured such as height, weight and intelligence. Most of the people fall within the middle range of intelligence, but a few are abnormally stupid. But according to this definition, a person who is extremely intelligent would be classified as abnormal. Thus in defining abnormal behavior we must consider more. Deviation from social norms; every vulture has certain standards for acceptable behavior; behavior that deviates from that standard is considered to be abnormal behavior. But those standards can change with time and vary from one society to another. Maladaptiveness of behavior; this third criterium is how the behavior affects the well-being of the individual and/or social group. Examples are a man who attempts suicide, an alcoholic who drinks so heavily that he or she cannot keep a job or a paranoid individual who tries to assasinate national leaders. Personal distress; the fourth criterium considers abnormality in terms of the individual's subjective feelings, personal distress, rather than his behavior. Most people diagnosed as 'mentally ill' feel miserable, anxious, depressed and may suffer from insomnia.In the type of abnormality called neurosis, personal distress may be the only symptom, because the individual's behavior seems normal. None of these definitions provides a complete description of abnormal behavior. The legal definition of abnormality declares a person insane when he is not able to judge between right and wrong, but this criterium is not used by psychologists. http://library.thinkquest.org/26618/...20behavior.htmUnder this definition homosexuality falls under it.This is an issue of self gratification. Polygamy, stock manipulation, voyerism, prostituion all have their benefits to the individual participants but not to society in general. How is homosexuality better than those?Do you know civilization means?Main Entry: civ·i·li·za·tion Pronunciation: "si-v&-l&-'zA-sh&nFunction: noun1 a : a relatively high level of cultural and technological development; specifically : the stage of cultural development at which writing and the keeping of written records is attained  b : the culture characteristic of a particular time or place2 : the process of becoming civilized3 a : refinement of thought, manners, or taste b : a situation of urban comfortYou better not resond to this because you obviously have proven that you are talking about things you know nothing about.

You keep bringing up the disorder thing but you are using your own scientifically wrong defition of disorder to back up other point of views. You have deemed it "behavior that is deemed unbeneficial, deviant, or a disorder and is not helpful to the public interest shall not receive and recognition" but officially and medically it is not a disorder, deviant is a loaded word (again maybe true to your defintion but not the general understanding of it in this context.) or irrelevant and what is helpful to the public intrest is dubious as well (doesn't mean what the majority wants, but what is decided to be best for society overall).Clearly there is a benefit to homosexuality for homsexuals, you may not see the appeal but surely you can understand the benefit of loving someone you are attracted to? Might not even have as many possible benefits as heterosexuality as it won't result in kids, but with adoption or IVF this is not an issue either. Heterosexuality is not the basis of civilisation, mutual self interest is. I think you will find that there are many heterosexual organisms in nature and they don't have civilisations. Cooperation and living together are the basis of civilisation, to me it seems that accepting and recognising homosexuality is more in line with the foundations of civilisation than not doing so.

JP,You can't mix and match responses. :( That post was made in reference to a couple of very specific posts by mana'ia in which his true colors came shining through.I certainly wouldn't accuse you of the same, despite the fact I know you are devotedly Christian, and that it does undoubtedly form part of your resistance to the issue. I realize that you have argued it from a non-religious standpoint.As for the "new tax", that's why I challenged you to all or nothing. If you want to base this purley on money and taxes, then it's a simple matter of equality. Either there are benefits for married couples or there aren't. Pretty simple.Waxy

Okay, kids, time to get back on track. When you start comparing countries in their cultures, you're not giving any logical input to this debate.See, the way I look at it, marriage is an agreement between two people to be devoted to each other and to remain faithful. Then, if it's a legal marriage, you have a piece of paper saying you are married, and blah blah blah. The main point here is, that regardless of our christian foundation in our culture, two people should be able to create a legal binding together if both people are willing to do so. No one can stop two people from swearing their love and devotion to each other, so to try and pretend we have any say so over it is pointless. People all over consider themselves married, even if they are not legally so. Has the foundation of our culture collapsed? I don't think so. And any problems in our society can be traced back alot further than lame excuses like "tv violence", or "alternate lifestyles".. so therefore those things cannot possibly be the cause. Sorry. so, long story short.. I thing gays should be allowed to marry. even if they had the same rights under a different name, I think that'd be okay.. but at the same time, I want people to understand that right now, "civil unions" do NOT entitle all the same rights and priviledges as marriage does.. so it's not equal yet. (for instance, there is no divorce process. ick, hu?)I just love how passionate people will get in denying rights to gays, when we could be worrying about real problems. I mean, Jesus H. Christ.. talk about messed up priorities.By the way, it WOULD be denying a group rights, since, there is no reason they cannot have them except legalities.. (i.e. no naturally occuring thing prevents it) that is, if the amendment passes. Right now, the technical wording would be something like "omitting" which is not the same as outright saying "NO." I can understand why we have nothing in the constitution saying gays can marry.. we didn't think about it much back when it was first drafted. But hey, times change, Blacks and women can vote. I think this is a natural and inevitable part of changing history.

Sorry, I don’t practice Polygamy; I don’t know the inner workings of the family. I would think it would be a good way for bi-sexual to stay below the radar.I worded the question badly; I should have asked why do you feel that your morals should be forced on to others? By keeping the laws the way they are now it is discrimination. Correct me if I am wrong, but I did not think you could fire some one for being gay.

Oh, sure, believe what you want. No, actually, anyone with any common sense knows that the best environment for child-raising involves positive adult figures, regardless of gender, and the more positive figures, the better. Why is it though that it is theoretically good to have a female and male both? Well, exposure to different kinds of behaviors I suppose, so that they can pick and choose what ones they want to emulate. But really, any more, kids learn early on which gender parent they're supposed to become like (according to gender stereotypes they are exposed to almost constantly). Thusly, you get gender-rigid people who are unbalanced fundamentally. I mean, come on, like a y chromosome makes you inherently inconsiderate (a trait often blamed on merely being male).In fact, many MODERN studies (say, after 1990 or so) show that gender-rigid family environments (which make up most traditional families) are quite UNhealthy.. as they raise kids who learn to feel shame if they are not stereotypically male or female. To hear some horror stories of that degree, read Gender Shock by Phyllis Burke. She has case files of children admitted to "gender correction clinics" for things like girls not wanting to wear dresses.. the results were devistating. Kids given shock therapy.. being told to hate who they were.. it's sick. but anyways.. I just hate it when people say that kids do best with a mother and a father. How about just having good human beings raising them for a change? Who cares what gender their parents are, so long as they love and care for them? I for one think that people value the wrong things alot. People are lucky to get caring parents anymore, so why care if there is only one, or two of the same sex, as long as they do a good job?People.. -_- *sighs*May I also add, that your posts are generally not linear.. I can't follow them well at all. I might recommend learning better grammar.

Why would anything be considered a non-disorder? There original inclusion of it within mental disorders would have been a religious one (or at least a religious opinion back up with your 'not normal' defintion). It shouldn't have to be classified as a non-disorder.You define abnormal behaviour but state that you are defining a mental disorder, lets not mix terms here. First two points are irrelevant and are only included to attempt to put a preemptive link in. The first is too vague (as it states, not really sure why it bothers seeing as it is defining a mental disorder rather than abnormal really) and the second has nothing to do with the topic. Women exposing anything other than fingers and eyes is against social values in islamic theocracies, is this anything physiological?maladaptive behaviour isn't relevant as the majority of problems are caused by the intolerance and lack of acceptance from others (intolerance fits this definition far better, seeing as it is also against the norm and against the social values, should this be a mentla disorder). There is no compulsive or self destructive behaviour that results from homosexuality, there may be a correlation with some harmful behaviours but these are correlations and not consquences (but even then the studies listed here were a little dubious). Finally while a large number of people who feel anxious miserable and depressed may suffer from insomnia, but equally a lot may feel it because some event is making them feel miserable and anxious. Under that definition homosexuality may fit, but not very well. isn;t really a definitionGoing to the cinema, keeping fit, decorating your room and listening to music all have benefits to an individual but not to society in general. How is homosexuality worse than those? It doesn't actively harm someone like stock manipulation, is done with consent unlike voyerism and doesn't have the links to crime prostitution does. In fact it is unlike those at all, which is why it is better.I have no idea what I am talking about, you're the one saying tolerance has caused earthquakes, homosexuality is the same kind of thing as stock manipulation, giving defintions of disorder that actually include 'and some other stuff' as part of them. I think you are the one not entirely grounded in reality here. Exactly how is marriage the foundation of civilisation from those three compared to the actual basis of civilisation MAKING LIVING TOGETHER MORE BENEFICIAL THAN LIVING ALONE. Without the foundation of a society you have no advancement of the standard of living or any civilisation. Exactly how did marraige lead to the formation of writing, or could it possibly be that writing emerged as a way to pass information to people you live with and their descendants? Single parents clearly have no part in civilisation and are at the same level of development as cats and dogs, orgnaisms that have no marriage and thus no civlisation.

Obviously biased sources. We've already been through the Paul Cameron obituary study in particular, and why that study is a joke among those who deal with statistics. There's a reason why Paul Cameron has been censured by several sociological and pyschological professional groups, as well as by a federal judge....

He and two co-authors read through back numbers of various urban gay community papers, mostly of the giveaway sort that are laden with bar ads and personals.

Even though I have no issue with gays or gay marriage, JP is right - unprotected gay sex is less safe than unprotected heterosexual sex, especially in regards to HIV transmission.However, it should be noted that lesbian sex is safer then heterosexual sex in that regard as well.Believe it or not, most gay men are actually acutely aware of the risks of unprotected sex. It's not like how HIV is transmitted is a big secret.And HIV really does not care about who you are sleeping with. It is an equally opportunity killer. If you want to do something about HIV transmission encourage responsible sexual behavior regardless of your sexual orientation.The sex kills argument, is like, way lame.

Yes, lesbian sex is safter than heterosexual sex. Therefore, heterosexual marriage should be banned, as well as gay male marriage. Only lesbian marriages should be allowed, because sex between two women is the safest. (Not using my own logic and reasoning, of course)

The sex issue is irrevelant. As is disease. We do not bar straights from marriage on the grounds of disesese. If that was true, millions of people would not be allowed to marry because of hereditary, non-fatal STDs, mental disease and self-proclaimed diseases. None of that is true. If it was, marriage would be dissolved if either party contracted a disease. Laughable argument. Besides, if you wanted to cut down on disease, you'd let them marry. Marriage typically reduces partners, which plays a key part in reducing the spread of diease. It's quite hypocritical to say they have a higher risk of disease, and that's bad, therefore we should ban them from marriage.

But should that mean you just invent some interpretation because there is no real easily obtainable evidence. To do it properly you would first have to look at all deaths in a year (preferabley more, all deaths in a decade or so) and then see what percentage was homosexual. To correct this you would then have to find out what percentage of each population was probably gay but not openly so and do so at different age ranges.

The twenty year figure is so large as to be completely wrong is looked from a biological point of view. There is no way that could happen unless there was an obvious link between homsexual sex and something like lung cancer, instead there is a slight increase in chance of getting diseases that are commonly suffered by heterosexuals. However if you ignore a lot of factors and severly limit your sample group as far as finding homosexuals go then you are going to come out with an extreme and completely inaccurate result like the 20 years seems to be. You can't start something as big as your anti smoking without reliable evidence, and evidence collectedly in a way as bad as the magazine study isn't just slightly inaccurate but just plain wrong when it comes down to the interpretationAs for your list, I question the reliablilty of a website that starts with "The following is explicit material unsuitable for innocent minds, especially children." and includes S&M and bondage as homosexual, as well as syphilis and tuberculousis. Also a lot of the information is just plain inaccurate, they have been looking at diseases trasmitted due to fecal contamination - this won't be an issue in this case as this is a problem due to organisms living outside the body being able to feed and reproduce before being digested again. Direct transfer as in the case of the various anal sex methods wouldn't cuase this to happen (unless one of the partners is already ill).

JPSartre: There are no such things as gay diseases. These are sexually transmitted diseases, the only sure thing we can say about them, is that they are spread through sexual contact, and to be able to gurantee their 100% elimination, we would have to eliminate sexual contact. Using some simple strategies to be safe while having sex, goes a very long way in stopping them, however. More than 70% of AIDS cases around the world are from heterosexual contact, so it obviously can affect many heterosexuals. In Sub-Saharan Africa, where AIDS has hit by far the hardest, it is mostly spread by heterosexual contact...http://www.areyouhivprejudiced.org/f...ge=globalstatsWould you say in the regions where the outbreak mainly affects heterosexuals, that people should either practice homosexuality, or be celibate?By the way, there is no "gay bowel syndrome",(from one of the links). That is an outdated term used to describe a parasite anyone may get, regardless of the sex of the partners, from oral-anal contact.Also, sicle-cell anemia is seen mostly in African Americans, but that doesn't make it and African American disease.

Like Waxy, you're arguing semantics, not facts. If a high percentage of people getting a rare disease do so through an abnormal sex act, it's normal to link the two. I suggest that you do a little more research on AIDS in the US. African statistics skew any study that includes their numbers. They had contaminated blood supplies and superstitious beliefs that you could cure yourself of AIDS by having sex with a virgin. As a consequence, the XXXXXX infected many little kids all over Africa trying to cure themselves.The fact that "anyone can get it" doesn't mean that it isn't a predominantly gay disease. Anyone can shoot himself in the head, but those playing Russian Roulette are more likely to.No, sickel cell anemia isn't predominantly an African American disease. It originated in India, Africa and the Lower Med. thousands of years ago. And Sickle Cell Anemia is 100% preventable if two carriers don't have sex. emoticonXGood

Rare and abnormal are relative terms, I would expect that if you had the stats for the numbers of cases of disease, they would be very low compared to the number of cases of anal sex (both hetero and homosexual). The US mainly has a higher rate in homosexuals because the first ones to get it were homosexuals and it stayed within the group because except for a few bis, there are very few other ways a heterosexual would have it. Overall globally it is not a homosexual disease, and in the US it has nothing to do specifically with homosexuality other than a historical element.Doesn't make it a gay disease other than being shot is due to playing russian roulette. Banning russian roulette is hardly going to decrease gun deaths.Well at least your consistant, when you look at it most of the world's problems can be put down to sex. If no one did then within a few generations we would have eradicated murder and theft entirely ;)

With proper awareness and understanding AIDS could have been eradicated, however it was ignored for some time as a homosexual disease and is now in both populations (homosexuals juts had the misfortune of not being likely to use a condom as risk of pregnancy is quite low). If what you were saying were true then there would be no heterosexual cases, but there are. 'Bug chasing' is a complete fabrication, was on one of the other topics (think Rapture posted it).How is banning russian roulette going to stop you getting shot by a shotgun in a bank job?

The blood supply in the U.S. was infected, because before they knew what it was, they didn't know to test for it.If it hadn't first appeared in the gay community, it could have come to the U.S. by foreign heterosexuals. It just so happens that historically, as Tastyfish was saying, it first appeared in the U.S. among the gay community.Tastyfish's point about condom use is a good one. In the days before AIDS, people used condoms mainly for preventing pregnacy. Before AIDS, preventing other diseases, less serious and mostly curable, wasn't something as considered as now. The "bug chasers" was a fabrication...http://observer.guardian.co.uk/inter...882544,00.html

If what you were saying were true then there would be no heterosexual cases, but there are. 'Bug chasing' is a complete fabrication, was on one of the other topics (think Rapture posted it).How is banning russian roulette going to stop you getting shot by a shotgun in a bank job?

To me, what it seems JPSartre is insisting, is that gay people should change their identity simply based on fear. Fear is a strange thing to base one's identity on.

The blood supply in the U.S. was infected, because before they knew what it was, they didn't know to test for it.If it hadn't first appeared in the gay community, it could have come to the U.S. by foreign heterosexuals. It just so happens that historically, as Tastyfish was saying, it first appeared in the U.S. among the gay community.Tastyfish's point about condom use is a good one. In the days before AIDS, people used condoms mainly for preventing pregnacy. Before AIDS, preventing other diseases, less serious and mostly curable, wasn't something as considered as now. The "bug chasers" was a fabrication...http://observer.guardian.co.uk/inter...882544,00.html

The purpose of his argument is to remind people that homosexuality is wrong. It is not based on fear. Society used to consider it to be wrong but has since changed its mind. Now it is often not just tolerated but lauded. This is an argument against homosexuality (or the actions of homosexuals), not the homosexuals themselves. Please note the difference. Homosexuality is not a particularly worse type of immorality but people seem to have forgotten that homosexuality is even wrong at all. What if criminals adapted the model that the homosexual community used in "coming out" in society? Homosexuality has long been illegal in most, if not all, of the United States of America. Despite that, homosexuals announced their presence and avoided prosecution by claiming invasion of privacy and "consenting adults" arguments. Here is the example I'm trying to make: Get a group of the same type of criminals together, have them announce their crime at a large public gathering, call their crime a "lifestyle choice" or something similar, and make a lot of noise about fair treatment of all people (by fair treatment of all people they would mean special treatment for their group, but that would not be known to the public until the law was passed that gives the criminals special favors). Sound familiar?

But what everyone has been saying is that nothing is 'just wrong', things are wrong for a reason. The whole argument has been about the reason behind why homosexuality should not be tolerated and whether it should be.Your example is compeletly different as the criminals would have done something to harm others and their crime would have a reason to be against the law. You need a reason not to tolerate something not the otherway round.

I'm not sure that I buy the premise. There are many diseases transmitted via oral sex, but that's getting way off-topic.If we only engaged in 100% safe acts, we'd never get into our cars. By the same token, we don't all drive 100mph without seatbelts either.

Yes, lesbian sex is safter than heterosexual sex. Therefore, heterosexual marriage should be banned, as well as gay male marriage. Only lesbian marriages should be allowed, because sex between two women is the safest. (Not using my own logic and reasoning, of course)

You think you proved your point JP, but there's 3 or 4 people here, myself included, that are saying otherwise. In fact, I'm not sure you have a point at all as it relates to banning gay marriage if as you say "Whether a monogomous gay relationship is more or less risky wasn't my point."You posted this however -which perhaps does not read as you intended, but is fairly clear to me in its assertion that homosexual sex kills. When it comes to this assertion - You are wrong. Plain and simple. Heterosexual sex between two consenting, disease free adults is no more likely to kill someone than heterosexual sex between two consenting, disease free adults.Like I said - Unsafe sex kills.While some sexual acts performed by homosexuals (and heterosexuals as well) have greater risks of disease transmission, that does not make homsexual sex more deadly. What the education should be aimed at is increasing the awareness of these diseases and safe sex within the gay community. That and a recognition/affirmation of the monogamous lifestyle among homosexuals would reduce infection rates and increase the lifespan of the average homosexual.What you have proven, albeit somewhat tenuously, is that there is a higher disease rate among homosexuals that translates into shorter life spans. This in no way invalidates their right to marry, and even more significantly, the claim that it does would have massive ripple affects on the ability to marry based on health/fitness that could lead to sci-fi type results.Quite simply, higher disease rates among homosexuals is irrelevent to this debate IMHO, but if you want to start a new debate on whether or not we should allow people to marry based on their health, or potential risk of health problems, go right ahead. It should be interesting.Waxy

I understand how he performed his study. Do you think that "straight" papers would list the cause of death for gays in an easily documentable form? From a statistical standpoint, I agree that the study wasn't statistically rigorous, but I don't know how it could have been, as well.........I agree, they CAN, but they aren't in the percentages that gays are and the assertion was that homosexuality DIDN'T shorten the average lifespan. An assertion that is just plain false, even when AIDS is excluded.>20 years less, and that was excluding AIDS. Include AIDS into the picture and the figure is even more supportable.Again, my point was that homosexuality, as practiced today, decreases a person's lifespan and, therefore, there should be programs, like anti-smoking campaigns, aimed at reducing the practice. Whether a monogomous gay relationship is more or less risky wasn't my point. Waxy stated:" Homosexual sex itself doesn't kill anymore than heterosexual sex." My comments were to show that his assertion was false. The homosexual act itself is far more harmful than heterosexual sex and I have backed that up with medical exidence on the diseases that are found predominantly amongst gays.http://www.wfcr.com/diseases.html

JP,AIDS is NOT a homosexual disease. The situation in Africa was pointed out to you, and it clearly proves that. It's a disease that spreads by unprotected sexual contact of ANY kind. Plain and simple.Yes, the disease (in the US and Canada anyway) took root in the gay community due to a lack or awareness, education, and action, but the simple fact is, AIDS is an equal opportunity killer. Your assertion that no gays = no aids is totally absurd. It's unfounded and completely irrational fear mongering. Placing the blame for the creation and spread of AIDS solely, or even predominantly, on homosexuals is just ridiculous and shows a real lack of critical thought on the issue.Just because a majority of AIDS deaths are homosexuals, does not make aids a homosexual disease. The same goes for 99% of STDs. To claim otherwise flies in the face of all logic.Waxy

No, sickle cell anemia is not a black disease, it is a disease witha large percentge of black sufferers, the same is true for AIDS, it is not a homosexual disease as this would imply it is only a disease for homosexuals, it may have predominantly homosexual victims but it isn't the same. Mad cow disease (BSE) is a bovine disease (its different in both sheep and humans where it is scrapie and vCJD possibly) as only cows get it (not a great example as this may be a disease that crosses species but the brain leisons are specific to each type of disease and are different hence the different names).

Perhaps I am lost in the sematics. You make a blanket statement that homosexual sex kills, and then when I refute that, you claim that was never your assertion? Where do the semantics come in?I'm lost as to your point. Is your point that a greater number of homosexuals die from AIDS? So based on that your assertion is that AIDS is a predominantly gay disease? However, the majority of AIDS cases in Africa are heterosexuals, so your point then is that AIDS is a predominantly gay disease IN NORTH AMERICA. Is that your point? I'm assumimg it is, and I can't argue with that. The problem is, how do you go from there to stating that homosexual sex kills? You clearly stated that in your post. (or were you in fact dealing in semantics?)Sickle cell anemia is predominantly found in blacks. That doesn't make it a black disease. Furthermore, how does that translate to being black kills?Your mad cow disease example is very poor, as it is not the same disease in all cases, but variations of each according to the host.It comes down to this if I've read your point correctly- calling AIDS a gay disease because the majority of sufferers are gay is illogical IMHO. Same goes for sickle cell anemia being a black disease, or saying that breaking your leg is a rodeo disease. Unless the disease is EXCLUSIVE to the group, it's a pointless and misleading misnomer.

I can't believe you're accusing me of dealing in universalities and blanket statements. Your entire "point" so far is based on generalities and logical fallacies. You did "humour me", just not in the way you thought you were. ;)Wrong again. Homosexual sex does not have to consist of anal sex any more than heterosexual sex does. The fact is, anal sex has a greater risk involved, and the risks can be greatly mediated by using protection or abstaining.Further to that, the higher risk comes from the numbers already infected, and has very little to do with the sex itself. I'll go as far as to say that practicing safe sex is more important for homosexuals due to higher infection rates/transmissibility, but beyond that, the risks are the same IMO. Regardless of the above, unsafe sex is unsafe sex, and it has dire consequences. IIRC, I more than disputed your fiscal arguments, in fact, you couldn't back up your assertions in Canada or the US. Then, rather than face that reality, you chose to take your ball and go home. No problem eh.Waxy

No it would leave room for the majority.This isn't hearsay this is statistical facts. Do you want me post them up?Here is just one fact.FDA Committee Votes Against Relaxing Donor BanBy Becky Orfinger, Staff Writer For the past 15 years, any man who has had sex with another man since 1977 — even once — has been permanently banned from donating blood because of the high prevalence of AIDS in the gay male population. At a meeting yesterday of an advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration, government scientists voted to uphold this policy, cited as discriminatory by many gay rights activists. FDA medical officer Andrew Dayton asked the Blood Products Advisory Committee (BPAC) whether it was prudent to change the donor deferral policy to ban only men who disclosed having sex with another man within the last five years. Dayton and his colleagues analyzed the projected risk that relaxing the donor deferral rule would have on the nation's blood supply and presented the committee with this data. After much deliberation, the BPAC members voted 7 to 6 to maintain the current deferral policy. Dr. Rebecca Haley, interim chief medical officer for the American Red Cross, told the committee that the Red Cross did not support changing the current ban on blood donation by from men who have engaged in homosexual behavior during the past 24 years because of the risk of introducing HIV-positive blood into the national blood supply. Although Dayton's risk analysis found that "introduction of a five year floating deferral for male-to-male sexual behavior, even using conservative estimates, would result in minimal increased morbidity in the blood supply by HIV," the Red Cross urged caution in changing a policy that so far has kept the blood supply virtually free of tainted blood. http://www.redcross.org/news/archive.../9-15-00b.htmlHeterosexuality is goog in itself.

Which would only leave room for Ozzie and Harriott.This is very general hearsay. I have my own anectodotal evidence of the many gay people I know, myself included, who have never had health problems. I won't even say what any of us do, specifically, in our sexual activities, because that's no one's business.Heterosexuality in itself is not beneficial. Good families can be beneficial. Heterosexuality and heterosexual reproduction in and of itself, does not necessarily provide good families, free from abuse, abandonment, etc. Gay and lesbian people have ways of reproducing or adopting too, as Tastyfish mentioned. Heterosexuality is behaviour too. Nudists can be married. They can't be nude in public. Perhaps we should just outlaw all sexual behaviour. Replace it with clean, safe, artificial inseminatin. Otherwise, people risk liking sex for the sex itself, or as a means to be social, and end up doing things which may not have what some believe is the most noticable benefit, namely reproduction. We could also evaluate people under law, to ensure only those who can provide a good family environment may reproduce.These are all good reasons to fight prejudice.So was your original comment I responded to.Opinion polling numbers seem to change quite a bit.

Do you want me post them up?Here is just one fact.FDA Committee Votes Against Relaxing Donor BanBy Becky Orfinger, Staff Writer For the past 15 years, any man who has had sex with another man since 1977 — even once — has been permanently banned from donating blood because of the high prevalence of AIDS in the gay male population. At a meeting yesterday of an advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration, government scientists voted to uphold this policy, cited as discriminatory by many gay rights activists. FDA medical officer Andrew Dayton asked the Blood Products Advisory Committee (BPAC) whether it was prudent to change the donor deferral policy to ban only men who disclosed having sex with another man within the last five years. Dayton and his colleagues analyzed the projected risk that relaxing the donor deferral rule would have on the nation's blood supply and presented the committee with this data.

Men who kill women due to sexuality purposes usually are addicted to pornography which should be banned as well. Heterosexuality is genetic and beneficial to society. Homosexuality provides only personal gratification such as masterbation. Masterbation however is much safer.Laws regulate behavior. It doesn't matter if you were born addicted to heroine you still can't posses it. Behavior is regulated regardless of mentality.sickle cell is genetic and hereditary. Homosexuality is behavior and the put themselves at risk engaging in it.That is due to enviroment and behavior not genetics. Good try to distort the argument.

How do you define beneficial here? Is there ironclad proof of a heterosexual gene?Yes, it does provide gratification. Is there something wrong with that? Masturbation is the safest form of sex there is, whether a gay person or a straight person does it.No one is arguing that. There is no law against homosexual behaviour. What is your point?No one is arguing being gay isn't behaviour when put into action. Everyone who does not practice abstinance put themselves at risk.I wasn't trying to distort the argument. How do you mean it's due to genetics? They must genetically practice unprotected and risky sex?Lesbians do benefit society by raising families, and by having stable long-term relationships. Specific vaginal lesbian problems? And homophobic Iran, and many homophobic third-world countries.

Oral sex is done by both homosexuals and heterosexuals.5. Thus, generally, heterosexual male serial killers kill women, and homosexual male serial killers kill men, and usually homosexual men. (Homosexual serial killers sometimes deny that they are homosexual, or even say that they don't like homosexuals. It is uncommon though, for heterosexual male serial killers to prey upon homosexual males, or males in general.) Again, usually, serial killings are sex acts. http://www.indianaobserver.com/2001/09/gratuitous.htmlFor the past 15 years, any man who has had sex with another man since 1977 — even once — has been permanently banned from donating blood because of the high prevalence of AIDS in the gay male population.http://www.redcross.org/news/archive.../9-15-00b.html

Okay, kids, time to get back on track. When you start comparing countries in their cultures, you're not giving any logical input to this debate.See, the way I look at it, marriage is an agreement between two people to be devoted to each other and to remain faithful. Then, if it's a legal marriage, you have a piece of paper saying you are married, and blah blah blah. The main point here is, that regardless of our christian foundation in our culture, two people should be able to create a legal binding together if both people are willing to do so. No one can stop two people from swearing their love and devotion to each other, so to try and pretend we have any say so over it is pointless. People all over consider themselves married, even if they are not legally so. Has the foundation of our culture collapsed? I don't think so. And any problems in our society can be traced back alot further than lame excuses like "tv violence", or "alternate lifestyles".. so therefore those things cannot possibly be the cause. Sorry. so, long story short.. I thing gays should be allowed to marry. even if they had the same rights under a different name, I think that'd be okay.. but at the same time, I want people to understand that right now, "civil unions" do NOT entitle all the same rights and priviledges as marriage does.. so it's not equal yet. (for instance, there is no divorce process. ick, hu?)I just love how passionate people will get in denying rights to gays, when we could be worrying about real problems. I mean, Jesus H. Christ.. talk about messed up priorities.By the way, it WOULD be denying a group rights, since, there is no reason they cannot have them except legalities.. (i.e. no naturally occuring thing prevents it) that is, if the amendment passes. Right now, the technical wording would be something like "omitting" which is not the same as outright saying "NO." I can understand why we have nothing in the constitution saying gays can marry.. we didn't think about it much back when it was first drafted. But hey, times change, Blacks and women can vote. I think this is a natural and inevitable part of changing history.

That's a sounds theoretically possible but not probable. There is no evidence to support thst."Research shows the best environment for a child is one where both a mother and a father are present and committed to each other and the development of the child. Research also reveals that the presence of a father in the home determines a child's cognitive and verbal skills, academic performance and curbs high-risk behavior- not to mention the impact on a child's emotional and psychological health," Bydalek said.http://www.familyfirst.org/news_rele...adoption.shtmlThe ideal family environment for a child is to be raised by their married mother and father.Thirty years of social science research has shown the consequences for both children and adults when mother-father marriage is not present (crime, poverty, drug abuse, teen pregnancy, school failure, and mental, emotional and physical problems). Women and men bring together the different and complimentary gifts needed to most effectively raise children. By legally redefining marriage, we would be making a decision that marriage no longer has anything to do with making babies and that children no longer need either a mother or father in their lives.http://www.familiesnorthwest.org/dynpage.cfm?DPID=612Yes people are lucky if they have two parents. It does not change the fact that the best environment is two paren t household. That book is one study about a small percentage of the population suffering from disorders and you're making an inference about the meaning.People..

Oh, sure, believe what you want. No, actually, anyone with any common sense knows that the best environment for child-raising involves positive adult figures, regardless of gender, and the more positive figures, the better. Why is it though that it is theoretically good to have a female and male both? Well, exposure to different kinds of behaviors I suppose, so that they can pick and choose what ones they want to emulate. But really, any more, kids learn early on which gender parent they're supposed to become like (according to gender stereotypes they are exposed to almost constantly). Thusly, you get gender-rigid people who are unbalanced fundamentally. I mean, come on, like a y chromosome makes you inherently inconsiderate (a trait often blamed on merely being male).In fact, many MODERN studies (say, after 1990 or so) show that gender-rigid family environments (which make up most traditional families) are quite UNhealthy.. as they raise kids who learn to feel shame if they are not stereotypically male or female. To hear some horror stories of that degree, read Gender Shock by Phyllis Burke. She has case files of children admitted to "gender correction clinics" for things like girls not wanting to wear dresses.. the results were devistating. Kids given shock therapy.. being told to hate who they were.. it's sick. but anyways.. I just hate it when people say that kids do best with a mother and a father. How about just having good human beings raising them for a change? Who cares what gender their parents are, so long as they love and care for them? I for one think that people value the wrong things alot. People are lucky to get caring parents anymore, so why care if there is only one, or two of the same sex, as long as they do a good job?People.. -_- *sighs*May I also add, that your posts are generally not linear.. I can't follow them well at all. I might recommend learning better grammar.

This whole concept of "same sex marriage" is preposterous – an idea so silly it would have been laughed out of a courtroom or a legislature five years ago, 10 years ago, 20 years ago. Why is it preposterous? Why is it silly? Let's just talk about the same-sex marriage idea from a practical perspective. If it is, as proponents suggest, discrimination to deny same-sex couples the privilege of marriage, then it is also discrimination to deny the privilege to anyone else who wants to get married. Right? "Well," you say, "who else wants to get married but is denied by the state?" Many people. And as soon as this taboo is broken, watch them line up. How long do you suppose it will be, once same-sex marriage is a reality, before brothers want to marry sisters? How long do you suppose it will be before sisters want to marry sisters? How long do you suppose it will be before brothers want to marry brothers? How many same-sex marriage advocates want to go down that road? Are you still with me? If incestuous marriages don't scare you off, how about marriages involving more than two people? What possible reason could we find for "discriminating" against threesomes, foursomes, fivesomes, etc.? The truth is that most of us do believe in discrimination. In fact, we discriminate every day when we make choices. I'm not sure you can live without discriminating – between good food and bad, between safe conduct and unsafe conduct, etc. Discrimination can be a good thing – a necessary component of life. It's a bad thing only when we use it prejudicially against people because of immutable circumstances – like the color of their skin. People who are homosexuals, transsexuals, transgendered people, intersexuals, lesbians and metrosexuals are characterized in those ways because of their conduct, their behavior, their choices. Those folks have exactly the same rights as heterosexuals. They can marry one member of the opposite sex. No one forces them to do so. But they have that right. This system has worked pretty well for the last 6,000 years. We tamper with it at great peril to our society.

But your other examples are incorrect. Incest is illegal, homosexuality is not. Therefore it is preposterous to claim that approval of homosexual marriage would lead to approval of incestuous marriage.Polygamy would be unworkable under the current definition of marriage, the entire system would need an overhaul for multiple partners to be workable. This is obviously not going to happen.And for the record, I have no problem with either incestuous or polygamous (with changes in rights and benefits) marriage anyway, but it is not as pressing an issue.For the billionth time this is not equality. The law recognises that this is not equality, this is a daft argument continually espoused by people originally who didn’t want stuff like inter-racial marriage. Or women’s rights. Or other archaic forms of oppression. By this logic it would be perfectly equal and non-discriminatory for the government to imprison every one whose name is 'John'. After all if nobody has the 'right' to be called 'John' then isn't everyone equal?Actually for approximately the first 3,000 of those years polygamous and arranged marriage was the norm. No doubt there were people who said we tamper with that at our peril too.

This is obviously not going to happen.And for the record, I have no problem with either incestuous or polygamous (with changes in rights and benefits) marriage anyway, but it is not as pressing an issue.For the billionth time this is not equality. The law recognises that this is not equality, this is a daft argument continually espoused by people originally who didn’t want stuff like inter-racial marriage. Or women’s rights. Or other archaic forms of oppression. By this logic it would be perfectly equal and non-discriminatory for the government to imprison every one whose name is 'John'. After all if nobody has the 'right' to be called 'John' then isn't everyone equal?Actually for approximately the first 3,000 of those years polygamous and arranged marriage was the norm. No doubt there were people who said we tamper with that at our peril too.

I am sorry that is just daft, and totally socially unresponsible.What if you marry someone from abroad? Government recogniction is required to apply for emigration.What if your spouse was taken severly ill? Without government recognized marriage you don't have the right to take time off to care for them.What if you want to adopt? Surely marriage needs to be recognized as the best environment for this.What if you marry someone already with a child? It gives you rights over this child.What if your spouse dies before making a will? Who is responsible for any ophans? The biological parent even if the kid had been raised their entire life by their step-parent?The list is endless.

I usually have no opinion on this silliness...But I have a better idea...GET THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF THE MARRIAGE BUSINESS!That way if you find someone to marry you to the same sex, a lamppost, your dog, etc it has no bearing on society, taxes, etc.....Hell if the Government got out out of the marriage business even I would consider performing marriage ceremonies for gays.... (For the right price of course).

Work with me here for a secondThis will have to be worked out through a sworn affidavid program or something. Its workable...Its called "POWER OF ATTORNEY" which you can get for anyone on anyone the two party's desireYour still married. You can have a church certificate of marriage. Or just change the wording around on the applications to gather information of the social situation in that "family". Put those damn social workers to work."POWER OF ATTORNEY" or "LEGAL GUARDIANSHIP"Take some friggin responsibility for your own lives and make sure you get it done. Otherwise the courts will have to do it for you...So then you would rather have government fight over a cookie crumb right. A right wich they have no business making constitutional amendments on. A right that libs only care about during election years...

Simple. The government uses the Marriage system to regulate unfair taxes on certain citizens while giving "breaks" to others. I do not see what business the fedgov has in managing and controlling marriages in an effect to collect additional tribute. I noticed you did not touch my "POWER OF ATTORNEY" responses.

Unless you are a beleiver in a religion, then the whole Earthquake thing is irrelevant and if you are then this isn't the debate for you. I haven't been argued that homosexuality is right according to religious beleifs, but more often that your religious beleifs should have nothing to do with my life. Acceptance of homosexuality effecting plate tectonics? Time to come back to the real world, even if it is true, why should you worship a being that is quite happy to destroy homes and kill people for becoming more tolerant but is quite happy with the famine and AIDS situation and doesn't get involved with politics? The constitution is not magic, it has been changed because enough people wanted it done, if the majority wants to ignore or change a part of the consititution it will do.

It still doesn't show that people that oppose homosexuality are homophobic.Yeah but the way science has progressed if it was genetic they would have found it by now. They have found it to be more socialized than anything. Also the fact that people have changed is pretty concrete proof that it isn't genetic.There have been divorces from vermont's civil unions. everything indicates that homosexual relatinships are less stable. What aspect might be better?Not exclusively. Every law has a morality underlying it.

Xenophobes are not scared of foreigners (or at least not in the same way as someone is of spiders) it is the same thing with homophobia. breaking the word down to its latin components is pointless as this is not what the word means.Not a great deal of research has been done and even less by institutions that are neutral to the whole debate. It is a very complex issue involving a vast number of genes and interactions in the brain and there isn't a great deal of point in trying to find a 'cure' as someone with it will lead as happy a life as someone without (excluding the social problems dealing with acceptance)No one has, they just dispute that it worse for marriage. Their are aspects where they may be better, and those where it may not be.But you are not denying those because of the religion, but because it is harmful to others and more importantly, potentially to you. Homosexuality is not.The masses always win, you just need a certain sized mass, that is democracy and the constitution is just a way of limiting it and determining what size of mass you need.

You started off by saying that if it were proven genetic God would have to not be against being gay, and you would have to change your views.

Homosexuality is harmful and we personally care since this behavior is directly associated with higher rates of promiscuity, physical disease, mental illness, substance abuse, child sexual abuse, and domestic violence. There is no reason to reward such behavior by granting it society's ultimate affirmation--the status of civil marriage--or any of the benefits of marriage.

Garbage, and already refuted so many times in these particular forums. Some of these things you list are also very personal matters, even if they were associated with being gay, which they are not, they would still only affect you and your life if you are in fact gay. Other things you list are crimes with a clear victim and are obviously not associated with being gay.

Well not really. In fact not at all. In the eyes of the law bot sexes are equal, therefore it does not matter what the specific sex of the individuals are it concerns two people.In the eyes of the law two people are not the same as three people however. This is where the drastic overhaul is.In the eyes of the church homosexual marriage may be a drastic change, but not the law.

The point is that the benefits conveyed by marriage are automatic, and not questioned.If my wife gets in an accident, all I have to tell the ambulance driver is "I'm her husband" and I'll be riding with her. I just say "I'm her husband" at the hospital and I get appraised of her condition, consulted about her treatment, and get to see her.If my gay lover gets in an accident and I show up at the hospital and say "We're life partners and I've been granted power of attorney." the hospital staff will at best send me home to produce the paperwork, but most likely will just say "You're not related, go away."

And I refute your refutations. You implied that the Earthquakes were not a natural thing and dinviinly causedEven if there is a god, any 'loving parent' that kills some of its children to make a point, when they are fully capable of just changing the issue anyway is hardly deserving of worship.As for people changing, not only is that dubious anyway but not really proof of anything, there are alcoholics who recover and don't drink and that is definitely genetically influenced. You clearly have no real idea about the state of genetic research or how it works, we are nowhere near finding the purpose of everything. There doesn't appear to be one gene, but there is probably a combination that lead to a greater chance of being gay.@Rev, Power of Attorney would be fine, but giving that there is already favouritism shown to some people, why should that favouritism be arteficailly restricted.

Resnick, PhD, and Robert Blum, MD, PhD Objectives. This study examined the relationship between sexual orientation and suicide risk in a population-based sample of adolescents. Methods. Participants were selected from a cross-sectional, statewide survey of junior and senior public high school students. All males (n = 212) and females (n = 182) who described themselves as bisexual/homosexual were compared with 336 gender-matched heterosexual respondents on three outcome measures: suicidal ideation, intent, and self-reported attempts. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association between sexual orientation and outcome measures with adjustment for demographic characteristics. Results. Suicide attempts were reported by 28.1% of bisexual/homosexual males, 20.5% of bisexual/homosexual females, 14.5% of heterosexual females, and 4.2% of heterosexual males. For males, but not females, bisexual/homosexual orientation was associated with suicidal intent (odds ratio [OR] = 3.61; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.40, 9.36) and attempts (OR = 7.10; 95% CI = 3.05, 16.53). Conclusions. There is evidence of a strong association between suicide risk and bisexuality or homosexuality in males. (Am J Public Health. 1998;88:57*60) http://www.apha.org/journal/abstracts/remaf.htmMen who have sex with men may identify themselves as homosexual, bisexual, or even heterosexual. No matter what label is used, the fact is that these men are at increased risk for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, anal cancer, and psychologic and behavioral disorders.1The rate of men who had sex with men in the previous year was thought to be 1.7 to 2 percent. However, surveys from 1996 to 2000 indicate that the rate is at least 3.1 to 3.7 percent.2 This discrepancy indicates that male-male sexual behavior often is underreported, and that previous estimates of the number of men who have sex with men may be too low. Therefore, a typical family physician can expect 3 percent or more of his or her male patients to be men who have had sex with men in the previous year.Recent trends indicate a resurgence in risky behaviors that expose men who have sex with men to HIV infection and other STDs. The reported prevalence of men engaging in un-protected anal intercourse increased from 37 percent in 1993-1994 to 50 percent in 1996-1997.3 Disease risk frequently is not assessed, especially in younger men, in part because of numerous impediments to adequate care under the current health care system.4http://www.aafp.org/afp/20040501/2149.html4.3.1 Recent studies have reported Bisexual people to have worse mental health than their homosexual or heterosexual counterparts due to more adverse life events and less positive support from family and friends15. Bisexual people may also be at greater risk of STIs due to a lack of targeted health promotion activities.16http://www.ama.com.au/web.nsf/doc/WEEN-5GA2YXPsychiatric disorders were more prevalent among homosexually active people compared with heterosexually active people. Homosexual men had a higher 12-month prevalence of mood disorders (odds ratio [OR] = 2.93; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.54-5.57) and anxiety disorders (OR = 2.61; 95% CI = 1.44-4.74) than heterosexual men. Homosexual women had a higher 12-month prevalence of substance use disorders (OR = 4.05; 95% CI = 1.56-10.47) than heterosexual women. Lifetime prevalence rates reflect identical differences, except for mood disorders, which were more frequently observed in homosexual than in heterosexual women (OR = 2.41; 95% CI = 1.26-4.63). The proportion of persons with 1 or more diagnoses differed only between homosexual and heterosexual women (lifetime OR = 2.61; 95% CI = 1.31-5.19). More homosexual than heterosexual persons had 2 or more disorders during their lifetimes (homosexual men: OR = 2.70; 95% CI = 1.66-4.41; homosexual women: OR = 2.09; 95% CI = 1.07-4.09).

Why would anything be considered a non-disorder? There original inclusion of it within mental disorders would have been a religious one (or at least a religious opinion back up with your 'not normal' defintion). It shouldn't have to be classified as a non-disorder.You define abnormal behaviour but state that you are defining a mental disorder, lets not mix terms here. First two points are irrelevant and are only included to attempt to put a preemptive link in. The first is too vague (as it states, not really sure why it bothers seeing as it is defining a mental disorder rather than abnormal really) and the second has nothing to do with the topic. Women exposing anything other than fingers and eyes is against social values in islamic theocracies, is this anything physiological?maladaptive behaviour isn't relevant as the majority of problems are caused by the intolerance and lack of acceptance from others (intolerance fits this definition far better, seeing as it is also against the norm and against the social values, should this be a mentla disorder). There is no compulsive or self destructive behaviour that results from homosexuality, there may be a correlation with some harmful behaviours but these are correlations and not consquences (but even then the studies listed here were a little dubious). Finally while a large number of people who feel anxious miserable and depressed may suffer from insomnia, but equally a lot may feel it because some event is making them feel miserable and anxious. Under that definition homosexuality may fit, but not very well. isn;t really a definitionGoing to the cinema, keeping fit, decorating your room and listening to music all have benefits to an individual but not to society in general. How is homosexuality worse than those? It doesn't actively harm someone like stock manipulation, is done with consent unlike voyerism and doesn't have the links to crime prostitution does. In fact it is unlike those at all, which is why it is better.I have no idea what I am talking about, you're the one saying tolerance has caused earthquakes, homosexuality is the same kind of thing as stock manipulation, giving defintions of disorder that actually include 'and some other stuff' as part of them. I think you are the one not entirely grounded in reality here. Exactly how is marriage the foundation of civilisation from those three compared to the actual basis of civilisation MAKING LIVING TOGETHER MORE BENEFICIAL THAN LIVING ALONE. Without the foundation of a society you have no advancement of the standard of living or any civilisation. Exactly how did marraige lead to the formation of writing, or could it possibly be that writing emerged as a way to pass information to people you live with and their descendants? Single parents clearly have no part in civilisation and are at the same level of development as cats and dogs, orgnaisms that have no marriage and thus no civlisation. Really, at least pretend to understand the points people are making before you rubbish them

The American Psychiatric Association CoupHomosexuals commonly point to the fact that the 'medical community' and, more specifically, psychiatrists agree with them that homosexuality is a "normal human sexual response."It is certainly true that the American Psychiatric Association (APA) removed homosexuality from its list of "mental disorders" twenty years ago, in 1973. This is a fact that almost always comes up in debates with sodomites.What the homosexuals do not mention, of course, is that this sudden change in attitude was not based on any new scientific evidence. As described in the following paragraphs, it was a purely political move, induced by a relentless saturation campaign of deception, intimidation, and unethical collusion between the APA committee and activist sodomite groups.Preparing the Ground:In 1968, representatives of activist homosexual groups approached leading psychiatrists and the officers of psychiatric organizations and began to lay the groundwork for the reclassification of their perversions as normal manifestations of human sexuality. These activists correctly recognized that such a move was absolutely mandatory if they were to win public acceptance. After all, society in general would not look very kindly upon the subsequent lobbying done by a group whose members were officially recognized as "mentally disordered." In the three years during which the APA's Homosexuality Task Force was deliberating, it collaborated actively with several sodomite groups, including the Gay Activist's Alliance, the Mattachine Society, and the Daughters of Bilitis, while completely ignoring organizations with views that contrasted with the homosexuals. Abram Kardiner, former Professor of Psychiatry at Columbia University, revealed that "A powerful lobby of "gay" organizations has brought pressure on the American Psychiatric Association to remove homosexuality from the category of aberrancy. This is only one facet of the tidal wave of egalitarianism and divisiveness that is sweeping the country...."During this unethical collusion, Kinsey colleague Paul Gebhard said that anyone who was known to harbor the view that homosexuality was a disorder was systematically excluded from being a member of the Task Force or from even being able to present his views or evidence to it.In other words, the sodomites packed this committee in the same manner that pro-abortionist and fetal tissue harvesters do: Only those people with the "correct" viewpoint were allowed to voice an opinion.But the homosexuals did not focus on the APA alone; they intimidated psychiatrists all over the nation. While the APA Task Force ws preparing its report, any psychiatrist or psychoanalyst who dared present documentation that homosexuality was a psychological disorder (anywhere in the country) was shouted down and even physically attacked at public forums or at local and national meetings of mental health professionals.The APA Caves In:The years of hard work put in by the sodomites began to pay off in 1972. The "National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Task Force on Homosexuality Final Report" parroted Alfred Kinsey's proclamation that "exclusive heterosexuality" and exclusive homosexuality" were "sexual extremes," and that most people were basically bisexual.This report in turn exerted a great deal of influence on the APA. In order to make its final report appear to be scientific, the APA's Homosexuality Task Force sent a letter to all APA member psychiatritst. This letter did not ask whether or not homosexuality should or should not be declared "normal." It was signed by all candidates for the upcoming elections for the APA presidency and urged all members to "vote" that homosexuality was thereafter declared to be on a level with normal sexuality.This view was so voted by a very slim margin. The letter did not, of course, reveal the fact that it was written and funded by the National Gay Task Force. One of the letter's signers, in fact, later confessed that he knew that such knowledge would have been the "kiss of death" for a pro homosexual vote. Subsequently, the APA eliminated homosexuality as a mental disorder from the 1973 edition of its "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual."APA member Dr. Henry W. Reicken cut to the heart of the APA's motivation as he wrote a scathing dissent in the appendix to the above mentioned NIMH report entitled "Detailed Reservations Regarding the Task Force Recommendations on Social Policy:" "It is as if they 'the Task Force' said, "Here is a phenomenon about which we know almost nothing and about which there is a great deal of anxiety and concern; therefore, let us suggest a major revision in public policy for dealing with this phenomenon." I cannot escape the belief that this is an utterly unreasonable conclusion to draw from the sea of ignorance and misinformation in which we find ourselves."The Essential Point:The essential point to be made about this chicanery is that the sudden complete reversal in the APA position on homosexuality was not brought about as a result of a careful regime of scholarly research and study; it was a blatantly political move, a 'vote', of all things, on the status of a mental illness. Furthermore, this vote was undertaken in a climate of deception and intimidation.At no time before or since has the APA or any other psychological or psychiatric professional group 'ever' addressed a mental health question in this manner.Behind the Scenes:It is fascinating indeed to see what psychiatrists 'really' think about homosexuality when they are free of the restraints of intimidation and political pressure.Almost simultaneously with the 1972 National Institute of Mental Health report, the New York County District Branch of the APA's Task Force on Homosexuality produced a second report. According to APA member Charles Socarides, M.D., the document concluded that "....exclusive homosexuality was a disorder of psychosexual development, and simultaneously asked for civil rights for those suffering from the disorder." It is even more revealing to examine the results of polls of psychiatrists taken since 1973 regarding the issue of homosexual orientation. The original "voting" letter distributed by the APA Homosexuality Task Force in 1973 was answered by only about one-quarter of the recipients, leading one to speculate that the "volunteer bias" ignored by Kinsey in his original studies led to pro-homosexual results. It is quite certain that, if 'all' of the APA members had returned their "ballots," homosexuality would have remained a mental disorder in the view of the organization.A later series of private surveys which could be answered confidentially and without fear of retaliation showed that two-thirds of APA members psychiatrists regarded homosexuality as abnormal despite the parent organization's switchMore specifically, in 1977, four years after the APA 'switch,' the journal "Medical Aspects of Human Sexuality" revealed that it had polled 2,500 psychiatrists on their view of what "current thinking on homosexuality" was, and, by a lopsided margin of 69% to 18% (nearly four to one, with 13%undecided). the respondents answered that "Homosexuality was usually a pathological adaptation as opposed to a normal variation."This is certainly a more accurate poll than the original APA letter because the letter was subject to all of the "volunteer bias" that self selected populations exhibit.

Err I think you meant count

But what does it matter? Even if you are right (and I don't for an instant believe you are). Even if homosexuals are all suffering from a 'disorder', that is a product of society that is the single cause of aids and promiscuity and the high divorce rate and whatever other bollocks gets attributed to homosexuality. Even with all these things how is it still justifiable to deny them the right to marry? Heterosexuals who exhibit all of the above have that right, so where is the difference?

But still I fail to comprehend the problem here. It hurts nobody, and in fact places people within a secure and stable position within society, helping it on the whole. I've no doubt it would reduce promiscuity, and with it the spread of AIDS, two major reasons you list against homosexuality. Whatever you believe about their reasons is irrelevant, people marry for all kinds of dubious reasons, it is not our place to restrict this.

They always use science to back up their decisions in their reversals but in /dsm-IV they gave no scientific reason just political ones.

Resnick, PhD, and Robert Blum, MD, PhD Objectives. This study examined the relationship between sexual orientation and suicide risk in a population-based sample of adolescents. Methods. Participants were selected from a cross-sectional, statewide survey of junior and senior public high school students. All males (n = 212) and females (n = 182) who described themselves as bisexual/homosexual were compared with 336 gender-matched heterosexual respondents on three outcome measures: suicidal ideation, intent, and self-reported attempts. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association between sexual orientation and outcome measures with adjustment for demographic characteristics. Results. Suicide attempts were reported by 28.1% of bisexual/homosexual males, 20.5% of bisexual/homosexual females, 14.5% of heterosexual females, and 4.2% of heterosexual males. For males, but not females, bisexual/homosexual orientation was associated with suicidal intent (odds ratio [OR] = 3.61; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.40, 9.36) and attempts (OR = 7.10; 95% CI = 3.05, 16.53). Conclusions. There is evidence of a strong association between suicide risk and bisexuality or homosexuality in males. (Am J Public Health. 1998;88:57*60) http://www.apha.org/journal/abstracts/remaf.htmMen who have sex with men may identify themselves as homosexual, bisexual, or even heterosexual. No matter what label is used, the fact is that these men are at increased risk for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, anal cancer, and psychologic and behavioral disorders.1The rate of men who had sex with men in the previous year was thought to be 1.7 to 2 percent. However, surveys from 1996 to 2000 indicate that the rate is at least 3.1 to 3.7 percent.2 This discrepancy indicates that male-male sexual behavior often is underreported, and that previous estimates of the number of men who have sex with men may be too low. Therefore, a typical family physician can expect 3 percent or more of his or her male patients to be men who have had sex with men in the previous year.Recent trends indicate a resurgence in risky behaviors that expose men who have sex with men to HIV infection and other STDs. The reported prevalence of men engaging in un-protected anal intercourse increased from 37 percent in 1993-1994 to 50 percent in 1996-1997.3 Disease risk frequently is not assessed, especially in younger men, in part because of numerous impediments to adequate care under the current health care system.4http://www.aafp.org/afp/20040501/2149.html4.3.1 Recent studies have reported Bisexual people to have worse mental health than their homosexual or heterosexual counterparts due to more adverse life events and less positive support from family and friends15. Bisexual people may also be at greater risk of STIs due to a lack of targeted health promotion activities.16http://www.ama.com.au/web.nsf/doc/WEEN-5GA2YXPsychiatric disorders were more prevalent among homosexually active people compared with heterosexually active people. Homosexual men had a higher 12-month prevalence of mood disorders (odds ratio [OR] = 2.93; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.54-5.57) and anxiety disorders (OR = 2.61; 95% CI = 1.44-4.74) than heterosexual men. Homosexual women had a higher 12-month prevalence of substance use disorders (OR = 4.05; 95% CI = 1.56-10.47) than heterosexual women. Lifetime prevalence rates reflect identical differences, except for mood disorders, which were more frequently observed in homosexual than in heterosexual women (OR = 2.41; 95% CI = 1.26-4.63). The proportion of persons with 1 or more diagnoses differed only between homosexual and heterosexual women (lifetime OR = 2.61; 95% CI = 1.31-5.19). More homosexual than heterosexual persons had 2 or more disorders during their lifetimes (homosexual men: OR = 2.70; 95% CI = 1.66-4.41; homosexual women: OR = 2.09; 95% CI = 1.07-4.09).

There is far more to the homosexual agenda than just wanting to "normalize" same-sex unions --to understand fully what they are after, one must understand that the underlying motive of the homosexual lifestyle is a bizarre combination of rebellion and woundedness. The typical source of the "wound" that the male homosexual suffers from is usually some sort of deviant relationship with their father. It ranges from a father who is abnormally critical of their son, to a father who was simply not there for their son, either to do divorce, death, or just emotional distance. (Not to mention fathers who have forced sexual relations with their sons...) Because of the emotional wounds received at the hands of their father, they do what they can to find acceptance and love from other males. Sadly, the line between acceptance and sex often gets blurred, and the homosexual lifestyle takes root. But due to the tremendous cultural condemnation for homosexuality, they often find themselves not only desiring male acceptance, but become "rebels without a cause" knowing that society looks down it's nose at their lifestyle. Hence, they choose to rebel against society rather than the more painful and difficult task of changing their lifestyles. In sex with other males, they find the acceptance and the love that was denied to them from their fathers; as bizarre as that sounds. Giving up that lifestyle without first healing the wound that caused it, only results in emotional pain and suffering. If anything, this speaks to the non-negotiable need for fathers (and strong fathers at that) to be actively and positively involved in the lifes of their sons. This simple remedy, more so than anything else, does more to "prevent" homosexuality than anything else. The attack on men, and fatherhood in particular, in our Western society, is doing more to undermine the mental and emotional health of humanity as a whole than anything else. The rebels attack that which is really the thing that will do them (and us) most good.

There is far more to the homosexual agenda than just wanting to "normalize" same-sex unions --to understand fully what they are after, one must understand that the underlying motive of the homosexual lifestyle is a bizarre combination of rebellion and woundedness. The typical source of the "wound" that the male homosexual suffers from is usually some sort of deviant relationship with their father. It ranges from a father who is abnormally critical of their son, to a father who was simply not there for their son, either to do divorce, death, or just emotional distance. (Not to mention fathers who have forced sexual relations with their sons...) Because of the emotional wounds received at the hands of their father, they do what they can to find acceptance and love from other males.

mana'ia, the studies you've posted don't take into account the many which show that the rejection and the lack of support they receive is a factor in suicide among gay and lesbian people...Of the 10 studies, 6 explored risks for suicide by comparing attemptors and nonattemptors. They found that suicide attempts were neither universal nor attributable to homosexuality per se, but they were significantly associated with gender nonconformity,3 early awareness of homosexuality,3, 8, 11, 14 stress,12 violence,14 lack of support,8, 11, 14 school drop-out,12 family problems,8 acquaintances' suicide attempts,12 homelessness,12 and substance abuse3 or other psychiatric symptoms.6, 11, 14 Surveys large enough to examine sex differences among Minnesota15 and Massachusetts students19 found a significant association between homosexuality and suicidality in males only. Suicide risk factors such as gender nonconformity may be particularly detrimental to boys.15, 19 http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/282/13/1291Results. Homosexual and bisexual individuals more frequently than heterosexual persons reported both lifetime and day-to-day experiences with discrimination. Approximately 42% attributed this to their sexual orientation, in whole or part. Perceived discrimination was positively associated with both harmful effects on quality of life and indicators of psychiatric morbidity in the total sample. Controlling for differences in discrimination experiences attenuated observed associations between psychiatric morbidity and sexual orientation. Conclusions. Higher levels of discrimination may underlie recent observations of greater psychiatric morbidity risk among lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals.http://www.ajph.org/cgi/content/abstract/91/11/1869The studies showing more prevelence for mental health issues among some gays and lebians are nowhere near levels of pathology which would indicate that homosexuality itself is inherently pathological. Suicide down, acceptance of gays and lesbians may be a factor...http://www.advocate.com/new_news.asp...12/04-06/14/04Substance use:http://www.ajph.org/cgi/content/abstract/92/2/198Jaaaman, that one survey of yours from 1977, is out of date. More recent surveys have been done...It was reported that 47.3% of psychiatric training directors view homosexuality as normal or somewhat normal, 51.2% view homosexuality as neutral, and 1.5% view it as somewhat pathological or pathological. Townsend-1995, Academic Psychiatry 19:213-218Hispanic and white women have a higher lifetime prevalence of depression (24 percent and 22 percent, respectively) than black women (16 percent). Furthermore, when surveyed in 1991, nearly twice as large a share of Hispanic women (11 percent) reported being depressed as did black and white women (nearly 6 percent and 5 percent, respectively) (80). A 1993 survey found Hispanic women (53 percent) more likely to suffer from severe depression than either non-Hispanic black (47 percent) or white (37 percent) women (13). http://www.4woman.gov/owh/pub/woc/figure41.htmAlthough small shares of all female high school seniors in 1985-1989 reported current cocaine use (used one or more times during the preceding 30 days), by 1995, the largest reported use of both cocaine and crack (or freebase cocaine use) was among Hispanic females. In 1985-1989, 9 percent of American Indian/ Alaska Native and 4 percent of white female high school seniors acknowledged cocaine use during the preceding 30 days. About 3 percent of Mexican American, Puerto Rican and other Latin American, and Asian American females, along with 1 percent of black females, also reported use (161). However, in the 1995 YRBSS, Hispanic adolescent females were most likely to report ever having tried any form of cocaine (powder, crack, or freebase)—15 percent—and also ever having tried crack (12 percent). http://www.4woman.gov/owh/pub/woc/ad...SUBSTANCEABUSEI don't think we will be aborting Hispanic fetuses, despite these statistics.

Most pyschoanalysts don't even support this type of nonsense anymore...POSITION STATEMENT ON REPARATIVE THERAPYThe American Psychoanalytic Association affirms the following positions:1. Same-gender sexual orientation cannot be assumed to represent a deficit in personality development or the expression of psychopathology.2. As with any societal prejudice, anti-homosexual bias negatively affects mental health, contributing to an enduring sense of stigma and pervasive self-criticism in people of same-gender sexual orientation through the internalization of such prejudice.3. As in all psychoanalytic treatments, the goal of analysis with homosexual patients is understanding. Psychoanalytic technique does not encompass purposeful efforts to "convert" or "repair" an individual's sexual orientation. Such directed efforts are against fundamental principles of psychoanalytic treatment and often result in substantial psychological pain by reinforcing damaging internalized homophobic attitudes.http://www.apsa-co.org/ctf/cgli/reparative_therapy.htm

Didn't your parents teach you that's bad? =p Oh, that's right, although you're arguing about the gays who have promiscuous lifestyles and spread disease, you actually think any one of them is immoral.

More on this issue of suicide, including statistics from outside the gay community...An article in the December issue of APA's Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology points to a possible cause of seemingly higher rates of suicide among LGB and transgendered (LGBT) youth: discrepancies between what gay youth report about suicide attempts and what they're actually doing. The article, by Cornell University's Ritch C. Savin-Williams, PhD, reports on two studies that conclude that even though sexual-minority teens are more likely than heterosexual youth to report suicide attempts, half of those reports are false--that is, the young people had thought about suicide but hadn't acted on it. In addition, Savin-Williams found, many of the true attempts the young people reported weren't life-threatening. "When you ask in-depth questions about suicide attempts, the responses you get account for the rate differences between heterosexual and sexual minority youth suicide," Savin-Williams says. "The heterosexual youth had hardly any false attempts, while those with same-sex attractions had a lot of them." In one of the studies, 23 percent of 83 young sexual-minority women said they'd attempted suicide at least once. On further questioning, though, 29 percent of the reported attempts turned out to be false, and 80 percent of the true attempts were not life-threatening, Savin-Williams writes. The one exception was a small number of young women who were part of a support group, whose rate of actual suicide attempts was much higher than others in the sample. In the other study, Savin-Williams compared reported suicide attempts in 126 young sexual-minority young people and 140 young heterosexual men and women. Again, while sexual-minority men and women were far more likely to report suicide attempts than heterosexual subjects, the two groups showed similar rates of true suicide attempts. The findings suggest that gay youth are vulnerable to the media's and researchers' well-meaning but negative depictions of gay youth as highly troubled people heading on a collision course with life, Savin-Williams maintains. "There's a script we have in our culture--a 'suffering suicidal' script--that these kids have picked up on," he says. A better approach for researchers, teachers and other youth workers, he believes, is to treat all young LGBT people as ordinary kids with great potential, unless they show research-based or visible indicators of suicide risk. http://www.apa.org/monitor/feb02/newdata.htmlSuicide facts and figures * 11.3 per 100,000, or 30,575 Americans, completed suicide in 1998. * More people die from suicide than from homicide.

This is the bottom line:Marriage was a religious sacrament. It was very popular and was adopted by the government. The constitution is silent on marriage, there is no "right." If the gov't decided tomorrow to do away with marriage completly, there's nothing anyone could do about it.The law in the US right now says that in order to recieve a marriage license, there must be one man and one woman.

That's the purpose two different words were used - to distuinguish a difference - to say that they are not the same, but two different things! There never was a "right" for homosexuals to marry one another. The reason that marriage is in the gov't is because it was popular and became a pilar of society. That's how the people wanted it.

I don't disagree with them actually being married, as long as its legal and done the right way - NOT forcing their way into the pilar of society.

You are correct, the right never existed as such. But as far as I am concerned it is nothing more than a form of institutionalised discrimination. Nobody has a 'right' to many of the luxuries allowed by modern society as such, but when the government is discriminating against gender it must be changed.

Beneficial is defined as anything that is good for the health, safetly, or moral welfare.Everything is gene specific. However heteresoexuality is inherited. Everyones that was conceived naturally had parents that engaged in heterosexual sex. My point is personal gratification in and of itself isn't enough to merit special recognition. Polygamist like multiple relationships, Prostitutes like to have sex for money. Gun owners would like to carry guns everywhere. However their personal gratification doesn;t benefit society and even presents dangers taht society doesn;t want to be exposed to or endangered.There was before last summer.However heterosexuality is beneficial and necessary.You were inferring that genetics was the cause of the problem when ti was enviroment and behavior not genes.That's families not lesbian activity.Damage to vagina or genitals are genital problems.You keep making assertions taht everyone that disagree with homosexuality is homophobic. Do you beleive that anyone can disagree with someone;s behavior and not have a phobia of it?

How do you define beneficial here? Is there ironclad proof of a heterosexual gene?Yes, it does provide gratification. Is there something wrong with that? Masturbation is the safest form of sex there is, whether a gay person or a straight person does it.No one is arguing that. There is no law against homosexual behaviour. What is your point?No one is arguing being gay isn't behaviour when put into action. Everyone who does not practice abstinance put themselves at risk.I wasn't trying to distort the argument. How do you mean it's due to genetics? They must genetically practice unprotected and risky sex?Lesbians do benefit society by raising families, and by having stable long-term relationships. Specific vaginal lesbian problems? And homophobic Iran, and many homophobic third-world countries.

Beneficial is defined as anything that is good for the health, safetly, or moral welfare.Everything is gene specific. However heteresoexuality is inherited. Everyones that was conceived naturally had parents that engaged in heterosexual sex. My point is personal gratification in and of itself isn't enough to merit special recognition. Polygamist like multiple relationships, Prostitutes like to have sex for money. Gun owners would like to carry guns everywhere. However their personal gratification doesn;t benefit society and even presents dangers taht society doesn;t want to be exposed to or endangered.There was before last summer.However heterosexuality is beneficial and necessary.You were inferring that genetics was the cause of the problem when ti was enviroment and behavior not genes.That's families not lesbian activity.Damage to vagina or genitals are genital problems.You keep making assertions taht everyone that disagree with homosexuality is homophobic. Do you beleive that anyone can disagree with someone;s behavior and not have a phobia of it?

In otherwords, mana'ia, the answer is yes.

Well obviously you don't. I wasn't saying anything about religious people and homosexuality. My point was I find it offensive to have to listen to a tirade of how I'm damned and going to hell unless I repent every day, just as you find it offensive to see a homosexual. But just because I find it offensive does not give me the right to censer these peoples actions, in the end I just have to get over it.Your examples are irrelevant, they are all crimes. Homosexuality isn't. End of story.And somehow I doubt that crimes were only committed by the 'non-religious'.

The people who "make the effort" to be straight. It should not require a great deal of effort, if being heterosexual is your true sexual identity. We also may be just talking about changing behaviour, not authentic desires, not orientation. So that wouldn't be proof it is not genetic.Not that many, and these only apply to Vermont and are not marriages.When comparing all gay relationships to only heterosexual marriages perhaps, as you tried to do previously? Apples and oranges. How many heterosexuals marry the first person they have a relationship with?You are not telling anyone anything they don't already know here.It isn't harmful. Even if it were, why do you care if you are not personally gay?

You implied that the Earthquakes were not a natural thing and dinviinly causedEven if there is a god, any 'loving parent' that kills some of its children to make a point, when they are fully capable of just changing the issue anyway is hardly deserving of worship.As for people changing, not only is that dubious anyway but not really proof of anything, there are alcoholics who recover and don't drink and that is definitely genetically influenced. You clearly have no real idea about the state of genetic research or how it works, we are nowhere near finding the purpose of everything.

But what does it matter? Even if you are right (and I don't for an instant believe you are). Even if homosexuals are all suffering from a 'disorder', that is a product of society that is the single cause of aids and promiscuity and the high divorce rate and whatever other bollocks gets attributed to homosexuality. Even with all these things how is it still justifiable to deny them the right to marry? Heterosexuals who exhibit all of the above have that right, so where is the difference?

That is the only argument you have but it isn't supported by the facts. Show me if you can that it isn't. Also you're only specualting especially after you claimed it wasn't true.

So that little peice of geological trivia was just that, and had nothing to do with this debate or any points whatsoever?Perhaps some people are capable of thinking from another's point of view, if God is a loving parent I can't see how you can justify the view that anything lethal can be used as a punishment.I don't think you know how genetics works in this instance. Or do you think that the method of upbringing they have is purely responisble?I don't really see any real problem with polygamy itself, but it would have to be watched a little more carefully perhaps as the cultures that practise polygamy tend to be less focused on equality between sexs. As long as you make sure that the marriages are still volentary for both partners and that any person is fully able to leave if they want to then I can't really see the problem. However it is a lot more complicated if you are looking from the benefits point of view with respect to inheritance and other aspects (child support and suchlike) but these are realitively minor points that would just have to be worked out if this type of marriage was to be recognised

mana'ia, the studies you've posted don't take into account the many which show that the rejection and the lack of support they receive is a factor in suicide among gay and lesbian people...Of the 10 studies, 6 explored risks for suicide by comparing attemptors and nonattemptors. They found that suicide attempts were neither universal nor attributable to homosexuality per se, but they were significantly associated with gender nonconformity,3 early awareness of homosexuality,3, 8, 11, 14 stress,12 violence,14 lack of support,8, 11, 14 school drop-out,12 family problems,8 acquaintances' suicide attempts,12 homelessness,12 and substance abuse3 or other psychiatric symptoms.6, 11, 14 Surveys large enough to examine sex differences among Minnesota15 and Massachusetts students19 found a significant association between homosexuality and suicidality in males only. Suicide risk factors such as gender nonconformity may be particularly detrimental to boys.15, 19 http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/282/13/1291Results. Homosexual and bisexual individuals more frequently than heterosexual persons reported both lifetime and day-to-day experiences with discrimination. Approximately 42% attributed this to their sexual orientation, in whole or part. Perceived discrimination was positively associated with both harmful effects on quality of life and indicators of psychiatric morbidity in the total sample. Controlling for differences in discrimination experiences attenuated observed associations between psychiatric morbidity and sexual orientation. Conclusions. Higher levels of discrimination may underlie recent observations of greater psychiatric morbidity risk among lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals.http://www.ajph.org/cgi/content/abstract/91/11/1869The studies showing more prevelence for mental health issues among some gays and lebians are nowhere near levels of pathology which would indicate that homosexuality itself is inherently pathological. Suicide down, acceptance of gays and lesbians may be a factor...http://www.advocate.com/new_news.asp...12/04-06/14/04Substance use:http://www.ajph.org/cgi/content/abstract/92/2/198Jaaaman, that one survey of yours from 1977, is out of date. More recent surveys have been done...It was reported that 47.3% of psychiatric training directors view homosexuality as normal or somewhat normal, 51.2% view homosexuality as neutral, and 1.5% view it as somewhat pathological or pathological. Townsend-1995, Academic Psychiatry 19:213-218Hispanic and white women have a higher lifetime prevalence of depression (24 percent and 22 percent, respectively) than black women (16 percent). Furthermore, when surveyed in 1991, nearly twice as large a share of Hispanic women (11 percent) reported being depressed as did black and white women (nearly 6 percent and 5 percent, respectively) (80). A 1993 survey found Hispanic women (53 percent) more likely to suffer from severe depression than either non-Hispanic black (47 percent) or white (37 percent) women (13). http://www.4woman.gov/owh/pub/woc/figure41.htmAlthough small shares of all female high school seniors in 1985-1989 reported current cocaine use (used one or more times during the preceding 30 days), by 1995, the largest reported use of both cocaine and crack (or freebase cocaine use) was among Hispanic females. In 1985-1989, 9 percent of American Indian/ Alaska Native and 4 percent of white female high school seniors acknowledged cocaine use during the preceding 30 days. About 3 percent of Mexican American, Puerto Rican and other Latin American, and Asian American females, along with 1 percent of black females, also reported use (161). However, in the 1995 YRBSS, Hispanic adolescent females were most likely to report ever having tried any form of cocaine (powder, crack, or freebase)—15 percent—and also ever having tried crack (12 percent). http://www.4woman.gov/owh/pub/woc/ad...SUBSTANCEABUSEI don't think we will be aborting Hispanic fetuses, despite these statistics. I don't think we'll be aborting African American fetuses, because they are more likely to suffer from sickle-cell anemia.

We do have laws that enable dyslexia (or at least try to reduce disablity), and you are mixing non acceptance and intolerance up. Dyslexia isn't encouraged, but it is accepted as an unfortunate but inescapable condition. No one is actively encouraging homosexuality, they are just saying that it is an inescapable condition adn therefore shouldn't be discriminated against.

Their disorder is taken into account so they are given extra time, in the gay marriage case the 'disorder' is taken into account and they are allowed to marry someone fo the same sex. The different test senario would mean that they are getting a benefit straight people do not have for a different action - like a gay being able to receive the same legal benefits for marriage if they own a house and a caravan while a straight person does not but can receive it for being married.

That is not the case for all though. Unless we are going to qualify people's relationship then it would be basically endorsing behavior that is more detrimental than beneficial. Heterosexuality is not more detrimenatal than beneficial.True many poeple do inherit heterosexuality but are socialized into homosexuality.. Not always but usually. it is also for the process of procreation. It is also very healthy according to studies.I've already shown that homosexuality is risky behavior.Those benefits are outweighed by the risks.Religion does benefit society.

That's very broad and can be subjective. I can see how gay people in stable comitted relationships, able to look after one another, financially, emotionally, would be beneficial.Obviously not everyone inherits heterosexuality.Heterosexuality involves personal gratification.Right. Well there are no dangers to homosexuality. I can see how there would be benefits, as stated above. I don't see how religion benefits society. Should we take away religious rights?Yes, well there were laws on the books that were rarely enforced. In many of the states the laws could also be used against heterosexuals who had oral sex.Not necessarily in and of itself. Again, "beneficial" is a broad, subjective measure.I meant to show that heterosexuals can have problems too, depending on what they do and how they do it.As it is with families with heterosexual parents. Their heterosexual activity in itself, does not create a good family environment.Couldn't heterosexuals who do essentially the same activties also have these problems?It depends on the specific behaviour, and the reasons for the disagreement.

So on average, you assert, heterosexuals are just better. A fantasticly simple, bigoted argument! I had no idea. Thanks for the good news. Do you think Matt Damon could be socialized into being gay? Seriously though, no one can be made gay, unless they had those desires within themselves to begin with.Heterosexuality isn't always for personal gratification? What is it then, a duty? Perhaps for closet cases who really want to be gay, not for truely straight people. Very rarely.Healthy relationships can be healthy. Even good sex itself can be healthy.No, it is not. Like anything, it depends on what you do, and how you do it.Based on your subjective measure, and on your bigotry.There have been studies showing gay people are healthy and productive too. Oral sex is a form of sex.Certain types of sex, sure. There are also studies that show it is healthy for gay people to have sex.Give me a break. Any heterosexuals here willing to say they don't have sex primarily for self-gratification? I doubt it, if they are being honest and not hypocritical.There are many, many ways to have healthy, safe, gay sex.Right. However, when gays are promiscuous this is not separate from their homosexuality, right? I'm supposed to just take your biased word for it?They are the same.Oral and/or anal sex? So what, they do. Lesbians generally engage in the least risky of all sexual activities, in most cases. So should they only be allowed to be married?Homophobia is actually generally understood as the politically correct term to describe a plain old bigot or hatemonger. So when we call you "homophobic", we are being kind and generous to you, even if you do not deserve it.

That is not the case for all though. Unless we are going to qualify people's relationship then it would be basically endorsing behavior that is more detrimental than beneficial. Heterosexuality is not more detrimenatal than beneficial.True many poeple do inherit heterosexuality but are socialized into homosexuality.. Not always but usually. it is also for the process of procreation. It is also very healthy according to studies.I've already shown that homosexuality is risky behavior.Those benefits are outweighed by the risks.Religion does benefit society. It has been proven prayer is healthy and religious people are more productive and less absent from work.It banned oral sex not sex.Yes in and of itself studies have shown it is healthy for men and women to have sex. Beneficial is a broad term including many things. Self gratification if low on beneficial while health and safety are much higher.I agree certain behavior is harmful like homosexuality.

No I'm not asserting heterosexuals are better. I'm asserting certain behaviors are better than others.You know this because? How is someone that is gay going to tell people that are not theat they only can be gay if they ahve the desires within. Mnay men in prison perform homosexuality when in prison for the first time but never do it agian after they leave prison. Socialization is so complicated as are people and so no one can say for certain whos is susceptible and who is not.People do it to create families. Don't you ever hear stories of people that plan out to have sex to have kids?How od you know? How many times does a couple have sex before they get pregnant? I know couples that tried years before they conceived.My point is then that religion is beneficial and there are less disadvantages than advantages.Ask a potential sex partner about high-risk behaviors that might increase his or her risk for a blood disease (such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV) that is transmitted by sexual contact. High-risk behaviors include intravenous (IV) drug use, anal or homosexual sex, sex with a prostitute, sex with a partner who has high-risk behaviors, or exchange of sex for money or drugs.http://www.pamf.org/teen/healthinfo/...ml_id=hw195680Most sexual activities carry a risk of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) from gonorrhoea and herpes, to hepatitis B and HIV. There is evidence that anal intercourse carries a higher transmission risk than almost any other sexual activity. Information about these risks is given below.http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/menshealth/facts/analsex.htmThe AIDS virus can be transmitted via any of these fluids, but only the first two -- semen and blood -- are likely to be involved. Anal sex is the most commonly perceived method of transfer, but vaginal sex has been repeatedly shown to transmit HIV.

Sexual activities, not sexual orientation, transmit the virus.http://www.stacken.kth.se/~virgin/sex/artiklar/std.htmlSexual activity transmit it. So don't act gay and you won't have the problem.The benefits are outweighed by the harm.Yes but it is not sex.

They might not cause harm all the time but it will still happen. Poeple having completely safe gay sex wihtout any problmes are the exceptions not the norm.No promiscuity is promiscuity. People don't act on their urges for moral purposes. If you wait until you're married to have sex then it is for a religious purpose. Waht religion accpets gay marraige and waiting until gay marraige? Also what gays believe in this religous practice? How many gays you know wait until they are married to live together?THat it make a conclusory statement without any evidence or any general knowledge existing about that.Lesbians engage in vaginal fisting as well.Nno homophobia is generally know as afraid of homosexuals.

On the issue of same sex marriage, a few things need clarified. Marriage is a legal contract, the lack of which does NOT render any sexual union illegal. Homosexuality is not prohibited under current law. What is being discussed is whether benefits and protections for married couples should be extended to include same sex couples by allowing them to marry.Another point that has been discussed before is the notion that if you grant same sex couples the “right” to marry then such a “right” in principle has to be granted to incestuous couples as well. If this is troubling to gay marriage advocates then they will come up with some rationalization as to why gays have such a right while other “non-traditional” couples don’t. I can’t see getting around this one.Perhaps an analogy will suffice to make a point. Suppose I choose to drive on the left side of the road and a cop tickets me for a traffic violation. Am I entitled to equal protection under the law for my driving preference? Don’t left side drivers have the same rights as right side drivers?

Of course not. Those who "Prefer" to drive on the left side of the road are endangering right side drivers.Homosexuals are NOT endangering any heterosexual.You may think your analogy is simplistic and in that altruistic. But what you have forgotten is logic. The reason there are laws is to protect people. Laws against Homosexual marriage protects NO ONE. It does the opposite. It denies protection to one specific group of people out of hate, misunderstanding and fear. There are no laws against persons who write with their left hand, but if a southpaw says that it was his/her right as a left hand writter to murder someone, that's going outside the bounds of logic and reason. To allow homosexual marriages is not at all on the same level of allowing syblings to marry either. Syblings run a high risk of passing on genetic mutations to subsequent offspring. Physical and biological mutations which could be life threatening.Homosexuals cannot reproduce in a sexual encounter between themselves. They are physically and physiologically able to reproduce, but not with each other. Homosexuals do have offspring, but the likelihood of passing on genetic mutations is no higher or lower than that of heterosexuals who are non-related by blood.

Right. Safe sex practices are better behaviours than unsafe sex practices, whether you identify as gay or straight.Prison is a whole different issue. You only seem to define being gay by behaviour. That isn't correct. People identify as gay without any sexual experience.People do it for pleasure.Very little of the sex that takes place leads to reproduction, or is intended for reproduction.There are studies showing the opposite about religion, and studies refuting the mehodology of studies that say it is beneficialAre you really this ignorant? There are many ways to act gay. Unprotected vaginal or anal sex is high risk for transmission of HIV. World-wide HIV is mainly transmitted by heterosexual sex. Hetero women indeed are more at risk than men in the worst hit areas for HIV in Africa. Here's some education....http://www.unaids.org/bangkok2004/factsheets.htmlThere is no harm. Do you ever get tired of using these simple fallacies?Oral sex most certainly is sex. It also takes place between a man and a woman.No, it doesn't harm. These are just more fallacies of unproven hasty assumptions coming from you.More unproven assumptions. The promiscuity issue is irrelevent. One can be a comitted monogamous relationship without religion, and without a religious marriage, or without a marriage.It was in answer to your conclusory statement. Something we've gone around about before earlier, and you have been shown to be wrong.

Something tells me you're a 12 year old who hasn't hit puberty yet. Most people have sex for fun. Heck, prostituion has been around since the dawn of time. People aren't having sex to have kids, they are having sex because it's FUN, something you'll learn when you hit puberty. If sex was to produce kids in the mindset of everyone, then those incapable to producing kids wouldn't have sex. hahhahahahaha.Except when it justifies the murder of thousands and millions, which has happened many times throughtout history. Except for the homosexual part (heterosexual couples do anal), all of that can easily apply to straights. You're not using this argument aganist straights. Hypocrite.

Dang Mana'ia: What drugs have you been doing? Haven't you ever been told that if you're going to come to the party stoned that you had at least bring enough for the rest of the party? WOW.See, your blatent misconceptions, ironious misinformation and high school lockerroom type "facts" are exactly the problem. ALL SEX HAS SOME RISK FACTORS INVOLVED.Period.Gay, straight, bi-sexual...whatever...ALLWhether it's pregnancy, disease or emotional harm, all sexual acts carry the potential to cause some sort of harm. It's all in how, when, with whom, and what precausions are taken to prevent said harm that can counter potential risk factors. Knowing the risk factors before engaging in sexual activity also lessens the risk factors. So lets run down a list of a few potentially risky behaviors:1) Unprotected sexual contact with bodily fluids of any sort is a potential risk.2) Using foreign objects other that sexual organs is a potential risk.3) Using foreign objects other than human body parts of any sort are potential risks.4) Using latex condoms with oil or silicone based lubricants is a potential risk.5) Anal sex, no matter the gender of the partners involved, is a potential risk.6) Oral sex, no matter the gender of the partners involved, is a potential risk.7) Manual sex, no matter the gender or the partners involved, is a potential risk.8) Non-sexual organ involved behaviors which transfer body fluids, mainly blood, is a potential risk. (ie Vampirism)9) Intravienious drug use from a shared needle is a potential risk.10) Medical care where someone could be exposed to bodily fluids, is a potential risk.Notice the last three are not even sexually related, but are still concidered risk factors. So, really the only way to be completely 100% sure is to not come in any contact with other humans or animals whatsoever. Might as well just live in a bubble. Even then you can't be sure because the veggies you will eat may have been bled on or been near enough to animials copulating to carry potential risk factors. So no matter what, you're screwed.
