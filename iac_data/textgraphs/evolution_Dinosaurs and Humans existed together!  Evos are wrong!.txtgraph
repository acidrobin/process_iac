I'm dissapointed in you Liminus. I would think you could come up with a more rational argument for rejecting EDO's evidence for his claim. You know as well as I do that hippos don't have plates lined down the length of their backs as Stegs do. And nothing about that pictograph resembles a hippo. It also begs the question about how primitive men with no archeological or paleontologic knowledge could have hewn an accurate rendition of a creature into the stone that became extinct sixty some od million years ago. WEIRD HUH ? And the age of the ruins it was found in have been confirmed and established I believe.http://www.bible.ca/tracks/tracks-ca...stegasarus.jpgNotice the downward sloping head with the upward swinging plate at the very top of the forehead as only a stegasarus had. And have you ever seen a hippo with a tail that long ? I think not. No hippo, and neither can it be a Rhino as it has no cone shaped horn protruding upward from above its snout. So how does a pictograph of a long extinct creature show up on ruins from the 12th century ? That is the question for debate. Is it possible that there are realities in our past that we just aren't aware of with our current level of understanding ? I believe there are, and many. And just mocking EDO and scoffing that the suggestion is crazy isn't a response to the photographic evidence that approximately 800 years ago some primitive artisan cut an allegedly long extinct animal into a wall for this generation to see and recognize for the type of animal and classification it belongs to.

*Slaps head* believe it or not I actually didn't notice the spinal plates! So my apologies for such an abrupt dismissal of the picture, which does resemble a hippo/rhino analogue species if you ignore the plates. I actually can't believe I did that...emoticonXEmbarrassed Still, my overarching point is that just because it is a picture of a lizard with spinal plates in no way suggests that this is a dinosaur. less still specifically a stegosaurus; there are many extant lizards with spinal features such as iguanas, and many large creatures were hunted to extinction by early man, some of which we have fossils of.The main argument I would use is that representative carvings of animals do not invalidate the very reliable fossil record, which shows not a single dinosaur, ever, after the K/T boundary. I would conclude that the picture either represents1) a creature imagined to exist after that ancient culture itself found a fossil, or2) an entirely imaginary mythological creature, of which we have many western examples; the dragon, the griffon, the hydra, the pegasus.I have been following a debate on IIDB where a certain creationist keeps asserting that the most reliable facts about the past come from human-created records, in that case specifically written records, but equally applicable to his argument would be this carving. I disagree with this premise because 1) Humans have imagination and2) Physical evidence is more conclusiveIt is puzzling, but geology and paleontology are fields that offer mountains of evidence which suggest that the creature represented here cannot be a dinosaur - if there were dinosaurs in that area in the time that carving was made, it is highly probable that their remains would have been found in the most recent geological layers, a discovery that would make the finders instantly famous. Until such evidence arises (and I suspect that it will not) there is no way a carving will convince me, in much the same way that, if someone showed me a very convincing picture of a car from 1000 years ago, I would look for another explanation than a very precocious inventor or time travel.You understand? The paleontological evidence is so mountainous, and so self-consistent that a carving of an exotic-looking reptilian, while puzzling, does not, for me, ask the question "Is this a dinosaur?" It asks the questions "What could this reptilian creature be?" and also, particularly, "Does this carving even represent a real creature?" I know nothing of early SE asian culture, but it is quite possible that this is a mythological beastie or a large lizard that is not a dinosaur but is nevertheless extinct. Given extra evidence, such as the authenticity, reliability and extent of the fossil record, that 'quite possible' becomes 'very probable'.

Don't feel bad, Liminus, I didn't even see them either until you just said something. Looking more closely, I suggest first that everyone look at the website and scroll down to where the dark-haired guy is leaning against the pillar next to the carving. Take note of the two carvings beneath it - two other creatures there, both with the same "fins", but both obviously different from the "stegosaurus" That suggest to me a sort of decoration, rather than plates (especially becuase the carving very notably lacks the tail spikes of the stegosaurus - a very noticeable feature that is conspicuously absent).No, I think it is a carving of something like this guy (notice, besides the "plates", that the head looks similar as well - it even has that first "bump" thing):

Does the depiction of gargoyles on churches prove their existance?Or does the book 'Day of the Triffids' mean that they were running around in the mid 1900s?Primitive peolpe have always imagined monsters to be lurking in the shadows. So, this carving vaguely resembles an image that modern day scientists imagine a stegasaurus may have looked like by extrapolating from fossil findings. At best this suggests that dinosaurs might have been around at the time. It is far from proof. It's a shame that there is far more evidence to the contrary.:) Smiley:) It did make me laugh though.

Congratulations, Supersport. You just "proved" that the Hindu God Indra exists.To those who don't "get" it, look down on the webpage where you can see the carving of Indra - then later down, it shows that same God on one of the sides of the column (right near the "stegosaurus" AKA iguana)

Liminus, what if all of the so called mountains of evidence is based on incorrectly interpreted evidence ? What if scientist have made errors in just one aspect of how they have dated fossils or interpreted the Geological evidence ? Wouldn't one mistake in estimating the Age of the Earth or the Age when life first arrived on the Planet have changed all of the results that you base your perspective of reality on ? What if all of the huge and massive assumptions your science is based on is wrong from start to finish and I am right that fossils could never last 65+ million years intact.SP has a ridiculous thread right now about a fungus that has survived 400+ million years. Now realistically thinking, how many years would an object lie on the surface before it was naturally buried by the sedimentary process ? Would a fungus survive the hundreds of years at least that it would take before being buried by the natural elements ? But none of you have questioned that at all. It seems totally rational to your mindset. Is it absolutely impossible for you to consider something objectively, from the perspective of an open mind allowing for the possibility that you might not have all the answers you think you have ? And then there's this dung from SP... Now if any of you will look at what she is referring to you wont see anything like she is describing at all. No consistent use of plates attached to the animals as is shown in the close up picture I posted. Here it is again.http://www.bible.ca/tracks/tracks-ca...stegasarus.jpgNow, why should we believe that any of the so called evidence that evos base the mass extinctions on is any more reliable, given their personal investment in having their lifes work recognized when a fraud like SP will reinterpret the same reality we can all see right here in EDO's link in post 1 that she is outright lying and blatantly misrepresenting what we can all clearly see is not what she say's it is.

In usual Archibald fashion, we see a post by him filled with deceit.I assume you are talking about the humongous fungus thread? I did not see anyone there claim that a fungus survived 400 million years. A fossil of a fungus, yes, but not a fungus itself. Oh, and who says it would take hundreds of years to become buried? I live near a natural (not controlled) river, and when it floods it lays down quite the layer of mud and silt, and often covers up my garden completely. But that is an issue that is off-topi, so keep it in the other thread.Then there's this dung from Archibald, who HIGHLIGHTS THE WRONG PART OF THE INSTRUCTIONS.If you actually READ what SP wrote (as I did), you would have no problem finding the part in question - I found it right away (funny how I don't see a dark-haired guy leaning against a column in your picture). Here is what she wrote: Funny how you bolded the wrong part - was this deliberate, or did you not see this? By following SP's directions, I found the picture that is attached to this post, in which I see several creatures with these "plates".So, the question remains - were you being deliberately decietful in this post, or did you just not read it through (as with most posts you respond to)?

Why is beyond reach. But one would think it was sculpted using the rock cuttting technology of the day. Probably stone hammers of various sizes combined with chisels (bronze?) and perhaps a bit of abrasion. There is also the question of WHEN the image last saw a bit of work.Too bad somebody did not take a high resolution digital image.\\\

What if your (AAs) entire body of evidence has been misintrepreted? If every intrepretation is wrong then the overall is wrong. No a few errors would not damage the structure of what we understand about evolution. Errors there will be.There is no reason to think that fossilized remains could not last virtually indefinitely. They are after all of the same composition as rocks in general, they are often buried in relatively begnin environments etc.If you wish to play the WHAT IF game then be prepared to have your opponents play it too.For example WHAT IF there is not and never has been a GOD?

From the Enchanted Learning site: Every picture I've seen of a stegosaurus shows the same long, lean skull. Quite different from the square rhino head in the carving. Perhaps 1000 years ago a living example of a brand new species of stegosaur was found. Somehow I don't think so.The carving proves nothing other than that it is a representation of an animal. Latching on to that as some sort of proof of creation is... (the words drowning man and straws come to mind.)

This thread really puts the 'fun' in 'fundie science'!NO! NO! NO!You don't *need* to base anything on one piece of evidence unless that piece of evidence be that there are certain physical laws. If these physical laws *aren't* the case then we're pretty much screwed on knowing anything including whether the world really exists, Bible and all, and whether we're actually having this conversation at all.You can correlate data from different methods of dating. Let's say radioactive decay rates were different in the past. Why have their rates all changed in lock-step so that they're all proportionatly the same today? How come we can correlate carbon dating with dendrochronology? Why do rates of deposition and erosion appear to correlate with the timescales we're looking at here.BTW even if that *was* an actual stegosauraus, so what? Theoretically it would be possible for a stegosaurus population to have survived until historical times. It's unlikely. It isn't the most likely explanation for that carving, but it *could* have happened. That hardly represents good evidence for the YEC case.

Let me clarify my original statement SP. You have attempted to incorrectly misinterpret the photos to serve your warped and inaccurate perspective which is your attempt to lie and deceive by twisting what the pictures below the picture in question reflects, and apparently G.O. is your equally dishonest sidekick now. In the 2nd one down, it's the hair of a man that is shown in the hewn rock. The creature above the man I don't recognize but the design on the edges of it are nothing like decorative carving that can be attributed to the sculptor adding plates for effect and not for a specific reason. So you are attempting to distort the sculptors depiction of the creatures he created in stone simply because creating a perfectly detailed image of anything in stone with the accuracy of a photo is impossible, so why not reinterpret it to serve your own perspective, right ? And I did look at the right picture with the man standing by the wall, so I didn't base my critique on your deception on the single picture I reposted for effect. Here's the picture in question for all to see.http://www.4forums.com/political/att...2&d=1184903199So in response to your demand for an apology, slander is slander only if it's based on a lie or inaccurately describing someone. And in your case, I'm right on the money because you have attempted to distort what is represented in the two lower carvings in that wall in order to distort the accuracy depicted in the Steg carving. Very dishonest, deceitful and typically SP and now, your cohort in deception and misinformation too, G.O. . Thank's for once again lowering the bar of a debate with your blatant yet shallow dishonesty.

Glad to help, now let's get serious...Not true at all Otto. The misinterpretation of data surrounding our origins, the age of the Earth, the Universe etc. etc. needn't change the basic facts that we have discovered at all. I don't deny that Dinos existed at all. But I deny that Dino Fossils can reasonably be expected to have survived from 65 to 350 million years while at the VERY SAME TIME scientists are unable to discover a cadre of fossil evidence that is between the age of 5000 and 50,000 years young. Why didn't the younger fossils survive enmasse while the older ones are everywhere ? In great Flood debates right on this forum by your own allies it has been argued that no fossil evidence of a Worldwide flood exists. I say that at the level of strata that the most fossils are found at and attributed to the event of 65 million years ago is actually the event of the Great Flood which has been misunderstood by science.I suggest to you that the alleged older fossil record is really the younger evidence that has ALWAYS been misinterpreted by evos. Again, the inventors of these technologies has every motivation to base their accuracy on results that reflect ages in the multiple millions of years of fossils. And those scientists who test and use such devices would send back as defective any device that reflected ages of T-Rex for example 5 to 50,000 years old. So it is the preconceived notions within the scientific community that determines the ages of fossils, not the devices they use to confirm their findings.I'm not even insisting that the Radiometric and Radiocarbon devices that have been invented can't be valid technology that can actually work. What I'm saying is these machines are still calibrated by men who have preconceived notions as to the acceptable outcomes, and have all heard about how every new technology that originally came out with much younger numbers than were expected were redesigned and re-calibrated to reflect the expected outcome before they were considered reliable and accepted by scientists in the field. In addition to all of the other historical records of sightings around the World from diverse and numerous Societies that had no contact or knowledge of the others existence over that past 2000 years, it is not only likely but very probable that man has coexisted with Dinos and they weren't wiped out by a major event 65 million years ago at all, but were hunted to extinction by our very own ancestors. This would explain the voluminous amounts of evidence from around the World in pictorial depictions by innumerable societies that these creatures were real to them and not mythical in any way. I mean, common sense should tell us that primitive man had no means by which to accurately portray, draw, depict or recreate an accurate rendition of creatures they had absolutely no reason to believe ever existed at all if they had been extinct for 65 million years or so. Trust your ability to reason and deduce rationally rather than place your faith in machines that are created and used by people who without doubt have a huge personal investment in the outcomes they claim to support. And just ask these questions I'm asking. Make no claims, but ask for answers to these questions that the powers that be in these sciences insist you must never even ask. Why must we not ask questions that conflict with the known alleged evidence they are asking us to take on faith ? Ask yourself that question if the evidence they put forth is so strong.

Let me clarify my original statement SP. You have attempted to incorrectly misinterpret the photos to serve your warped and inaccurate perspective which is your attempt to lie and deceive by twisting what the pictures below the picture in question reflects, and apparently G.O. is your equally dishonest sidekick now. In the 2nd one down, it's the hair of a man that is shown in the hewn rock. The creature above the man I don't recognize but the design on the edges of it are nothing like decorative carving that can be attributed to the sculptor adding plates for effect and not for a specific reason. So you are attempting to distort the sculptors depiction of the creatures he created in stone simply because creating a perfectly detailed image of anything in stone with the accuracy of a photo is impossible, so why not reinterpret it to serve your own perspective, right ? And I did look at the right picture with the man standing by the wall, so I didn't base my critique on your deception on the single picture I reposted for effect. Here's the picture in question for all to see.http://www.4forums.com/political/att...2&d=1184903199So in response to your demand for an apology, slander is slander only if it's based on a lie or inaccurately describing someone. And in your case, I'm right on the money because you have attempted to distort what is represented in the two lower carvings in that wall in order to distort the accuracy depicted in the Steg carving. Very dishonest, deceitful and typically SP and now, your cohort in deception and misinformation too, G.O. . Thank's for once again lowering the bar of a debate with your blatant yet shallow dishonesty.

The trouble with arguing with creationists is that you always have to start at the beginning. And I mean at the very beginning. Every single time...First of all are you really asking why there are fewer fossils available for a 45,000 year period as compared to a 360 million year period?! Secondly there's plenty of fossil evidence of Holocene life. Check the La Brea Tar Pits. That's not to mention the unfossilized remains of (e.g. mammoths) that have been found in permafrost. Generally fossilization takes much longer than 5-50,000 years.Suggest away old bean. Building a house on foundations of sand is a bad idea I hear. Oh dear. The inventors of radioactive decay? And they're all in cahoots with each other? All of the inventors of different methods of dating? So who was it that faked all of those tree rings? That must've been an epic job.I'd have to write an entire thesis to disbuse this notion and I can't really be bothered. There are no historical records or sightings that could unequivocally be a dinosaur, nor even the most likely explanation. Oh dear...

Glad to help, now let's get serious...Not true at all Otto. The misinterpretation of data surrounding our origins, the age of the Earth, the Universe etc. etc. needn't change the basic facts that we have discovered at all. I don't deny that Dinos existed at all. But I deny that Dino Fossils can reasonably be expected to have survived from 65 to 350 million years while at the VERY SAME TIME scientists are unable to discover a cadre of fossil evidence that is between the age of 5000 and 50,000 years young. Why didn't the younger fossils survive enmasse while the older ones are everywhere ? In great Flood debates right on this forum by your own allies it has been argued that no fossil evidence of a Worldwide flood exists. I say that at the level of strata that the most fossils are found at and attributed to the event of 65 million years ago is actually the event of the Great Flood which has been misunderstood by science.I suggest to you that the alleged older fossil record is really the younger evidence that has ALWAYS been misinterpreted by evos. Again, the inventors of these technologies has every motivation to base their accuracy on results that reflect ages in the multiple millions of years of fossils. And those scientists who test and use such devices would send back as defective any device that reflected ages of T-Rex for example 5 to 50,000 years old. So it is the preconceived notions within the scientific community that determines the ages of fossils, not the devices they use to confirm their findings.I'm not even insisting that the Radiometric and Radiocarbon devices that have been invented can't be valid technology that can actually work. What I'm saying is these machines are still calibrated by men who have preconceived notions as to the acceptable outcomes, and have all heard about how every new technology that originally came out with much younger numbers than were expected were redesigned and re-calibrated to reflect the expected outcome before they were considered reliable and accepted by scientists in the field. In addition to all of the other historical records of sightings around the World from diverse and numerous Societies that had no contact or knowledge of the others existence over that past 2000 years, it is not only likely but very probable that man has coexisted with Dinos and they weren't wiped out by a major event 65 million years ago at all, but were hunted to extinction by our very own ancestors. This would explain the voluminous amounts of evidence from around the World in pictorial depictions by innumerable societies that these creatures were real to them and not mythical in any way. I mean, common sense should tell us that primitive man had no means by which to accurately portray, draw, depict or recreate an accurate rendition of creatures they had absolutely no reason to believe ever existed at all if they had been extinct for 65 million years or so. Trust your ability to reason and deduce rationally rather than place your faith in machines that are created and used by people who without doubt have a huge personal investment in the outcomes they claim to support. And just ask these questions I'm asking. Make no claims, but ask for answers to these questions that the powers that be in these sciences insist you must never even ask. Why must we not ask questions that conflict with the known alleged evidence they are asking us to take on faith ? Ask yourself that question if the evidence they put forth is so strong.

Wonderful, you completely validate my claim by maintaining your ridiculous assertion that the artisan was attempting to depict an Iguana by placing 6 plates on its back rather than the thin spines found on your Iguana Picture here. Look at them again and insist you're right, but don't try to convince me of your foolishness.

Here Otto, I'm not the only one who believes as I do regarding your dating methods and their reliability. Here's an excerpt and the link.http://www.answersingenesis.org/crea...17/i3/pigs.aspThe pigs took it allby Marvin L. LubenowA popular myth is that radioactive dating methods confirm the geologic time-scale and the concept of human evolution. The methods appear so impressive that many Christians accept them as evidence that the earth is very old. The best way to expose this myth is to study the dating of the East African KBS Tuff strata and the famous fossil KNM-ER 1470.1Richard Leakey, son of famed palaeoanthropologists Louis and Mary Leakey, visited the fossil deposits east of Lake Rudolf (now Lake Turkana) in northern Kenya in 1967. He immediately organized an expedition to search for hominid fossils.The most important fossil discovered there is KNM-ER 1470. Skull 1470 is modern in appearance, but was originally estimated by Richard Leakey to be about 2.9 million years old.One early geologist with Richard Leakey at East Rudolf was Kay Behrensmeyer. Seeking to unravel the geology of the area, she discovered a layer of volcanic ash or tuff that became known as the Kay Behrensmeyer Site (the KBS Tuff).If the KBS Tuff were anywhere else, no one would give it a second thought. At East Rudolf it is of utmost importance. First, although human fossils and artefacts (tools) cannot usually be dated radiometrically, the KBS Tuff can. It contains radioactive potassium 40, which decays to argon 40. Second, artefacts have been found in association with the KBS Tuff. The assumption is that the tuff gives an estimate of the age of the stone tools. Third, hundreds of Homo and australopithecine fossils have been found above and below the KBS Tuff. The date of the tuff thus becomes a maximum age for fossils found above it and a minimum for fossils below it.The first attempt to date the KBS Tuff was in 1969, well before the discovery of skull 1470. Richard Leakey supplied rock samples to F.J. Fitch (Birkbeck College, University of London) and J.A. Miller (Cambridge University) — recognized authorities in potassium-argon (K-Ar) dating.Fitch and Miller's first analysis gave evolutionary dates from 212 million to 230 million years of age. Concerning this they said, 'From these results it was clear that an extraneous argon age discrepancy was present ...'.2 How did they know? The associated fossils told them. In spite of our being assured that dating methods constitute independent confirmation of evolutionary dates, associated fossils had already determined the 'acceptable' dates. Based on their alleged evolution, the australopithecine and other mammalian fossils found beneath the KBS Tuff had determined that the rocks should be between 2 and 5 million years old.Dates of 212 to 230 million years old were far off. Without the associated fossils, however, there would be no way for an evolutionary geologist to know if these were 'good' or 'bad' dates. Under other circumstances, and without fossils to guide them, evolutionary geologists could have accepted these dates as 'good'.Fitch and Miller requested new samples. From these they concluded from pumice lumps and feldspar crystals that the age of the KBS Tuff was 2.61 million years.3 It was because Leakey found skull 1470 below this tuff after it had been dated at 2.61 million years and above rock dated at 3.18 million years that he estimated the skull to be 2.9 million years old.DATING PIGS AND ELEPHANTSIn 1972, before skull 1470 was announced, Vincent Maglio (Princeton University) published in Nature a chronology of the hominid-bearing sediments east of Lake Rudolf, which included the KBS Tuff.4 His work was based on lineages of two species of pig and one of elephant. Maglio's dates were compatible with the radiometric date arrived at by Fitch and Miller, and were considered to confirm their date.In 1974, a third chronology of the area was published in Nature, based on palaeomagnetism.5 The conclusion of 2.7 to 3.0 million years seemed to represent a 'bulls-eye' for the correlation of the various dating methods.6By late 1974, the KBS Tuff had been dated five different times by four different dating methods. The alleged compatibility of the different methods would seem to be a geologist's dream.However, under the surface, skull 1470 with its estimated date of 2.9 million years presented the evolutionary world with an intolerable situation. The theory of human evolution did not allow a skull so modern to be that old. Nevertheless Richard Leakey continued to fight for this original date. If skull 1470 was 2.9 million years old, he had discovered the oldest member of the genus Homo; if it wasn't, he hadn't! Hence, he resisted lowering the age of the skull.Meanwhile, another study by G.H. Curtis and his associates (University of California, Berkeley) claimed to distinguish two tuff units. One gave an age of 1.6 million years and the other, where skull 1470 was found, gave 1.82 million years — both considerably younger than the five previous studies had reported.All of the above-cited articles spoke of the great difficulty in getting rock or crystal samples that were not altered, weathered, or derived from older rock. The question arises, How does one know when one has good samples for dating? The answer is that 'good' samples give dates in accord with evolutionary presuppositions. 'Bad' samples give dates not in conformity with evolution — a classic illustration of circular reasoning.On March 20, 1980, two more dating studies in Nature criticized the earlier work and claimed that the age of the KBS Tuff was 1.87 or 1.89 million years. Then in late 1981, Ian McDougall published his study of the KBS Tuff, giving a date of 1.88 million years. At that point, the 10-year controversy over the date of the KBS Tuff came to a close with agreement on the more recent date.And here's a more in depth link with additional findings and evidence.http://earthage.org/EarthOldorYoung/...he%20Earth.htm

Unfortunately the landmasses have tended to move about quite a bit (we call it plate tectonics). At times I believe there has been no ice on the ice caps at all. Other times (we call ice ages) lots.As for the rest. What point are you actually making. I can't be bothered to read a load of cut and paste. Put a bit of commentary in.

I didn't say "Ice preserved beneath the Earth surface" But the surface as below the surface ICE that is 2000-4000 years old. But why would I expect you to get that. I was speaking of an example like this. But this core deals with weather patterns, not life as the first example I posted about Ice Cores.Record ice core gives fair forecast18:00 09 June 2004NewScientist.com news serviceFred PearceAs long as humans do not mess it up, the Earth's climate is set at fair for the next 15,000 years. That is according to information extracted from the oldest ice core ever drilled.The Antarctic core is the first to reach as far back as a warm period with characteristics similar to our own interglacial. So it should help make more accurate predictions about when to expect the next deep freeze.The ice core, drilled from a feature in central Antarctica called Dome C, is around 3 kilometres long and 10 centimetres wide. Changes in the relative proportions of hydrogen isotopes in the ice layers allow scientists to compile a complete record of Antarctic temperatures going back 740,000 years.The core shows the waxing and waning of eight ice ages. Most critically for making predictions about our climate, it is the first core to record a period known as Termination V, around 430,000 years ago.Warming patternAt this point, the world moved from a glacial period into a long, warm interglacial, similar to this era. The previous longest ice-core record, drilled by the Soviet Union at Vostok in Antarctica between 1980 and 1988, went back only 420,000 years."All interglacials are slightly different, but we believe Termination V is the most similar to our own," says chief author of the new study, Eric Wolff, at the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, UK. It mirrors the pattern of solar warming between seasons and at different latitudes that are caused by fluctuations in the Earth's orbit known as the Milankovitch cycles.It shows that the Termination V interglacial was unusually long, lasting 28,000 years. The current interglacial is now 12,000 years old, and some scientists feared that we might be heading for an ice age soon since at least one post-Termination V interglacial lasted just 10,000 years.But the new findings suggest that even without the human hand in global warming, a new ice age would be unlikely for perhaps another 15,000 years, Wolff says.Ice blanketThe core also sheds light on how ice ages have changed over the past million years. Since Termination V, ice ages have been very intense, with periods of cold weather that blanketed much of the northern hemisphere in ice for 80,000 years punctuated by short interglacials lasting typically 20,000 years.But the new core shows that, prior to Termination V, the cold and warm periods of the glacial cycle each lasted around 50,000 years but were much less intense."Marine deposits suggested some of this, but it stands out much more clearly in the ice record," Wolff says.Meanwhile, European and US scientists are discussing plans to survey for a site in Antarctica that will extend the record still further. "We want to go back at least 1.2 million years next time," Wolff says. "But we have to find somewhere that we can do it."Journal reference: Nature (vol 429, p 623)

We see just about every other common animal in bible stories, but no dinosaurs. When dinosaurs roamed the earth, they were as common as any other animal we see today. Funny how we would not see common mention of them in the bible. As well, take for example the Native Americans. They have been existing in North America for about 25k-30k years. For the most part, the Native American culture preserved it's history through paintings, dance, oral history, and song. We find no mention of Dinosaurs by the Native American people. Yet according to you two, there should have been dinosaurs walking around in 1186 AD. Forget the overwhleming mountain of evidence that you refuse to look at critically.Forget the detailed science that you dismiss as error ridden, agenda driven garbage.Forget geology, anthropology, paleontology, biology, physics, chemistry, mathematics, history, and archeology.Forget that the Roman civilization had long since been alive and kicking, and as much history as we know about the roman civilzation, we see nothing of them walking with dinosaurs. (1186 would put it, if I recall my history, in the time between the 2nd and 3rd crusades, during the Byzantine Empire at the time of the Angelan Dynasty ruled by Isaac II) Simple common sense tells us that what you are contending is a load of horse dung. But you go on thinking that dinosaurs and man walked around together if it makes you happy. At least it gives me something to laugh about.

Unfortunately the landmasses have tended to move about quite a bit (we call it plate tectonics). At times I believe there has been no ice on the ice caps at all. Other times (we call ice ages) lots.As for the rest. What point are you actually making. I can't be bothered to read a load of cut and paste. Put a bit of commentary in.

No you didn't, here's what you posted -What am I to infer or understand based on the underlined? It says "Ice lay beneath the surface"????????What surface? The surface now? The surface 65 million years ago?Are you still trying to assert that the ice from 65 million years ago should somehow be present today?How am I supposed to get "surface as below the surface ICE that is 2000-4000 years old" from that?Type what you mean clearly Arch, we can't interpret your convoluted thinking.Are you asking about the land under the ice which they are now coring? Google "arctic geology" "antarctic geology" or "greenland geology" for the answers to that.What does this have to do with anything? I'm completely lost. Maybe it's me.Waxy

I didn't say "Ice preserved beneath the Earth surface" But the surface as below the surface ICE that is 2000-4000 years old. But why would I expect you to get that. I was speaking of an example like this. But this core deals with weather patterns, not life as the first example I posted about Ice Cores.Record ice core gives fair forecast18:00 09 June 2004NewScientist.com news serviceFred PearceAs long as humans do not mess it up, the Earth's climate is set at fair for the next 15,000 years. That is according to information extracted from the oldest ice core ever drilled.The Antarctic core is the first to reach as far back as a warm period with characteristics similar to our own interglacial. So it should help make more accurate predictions about when to expect the next deep freeze.The ice core, drilled from a feature in central Antarctica called Dome C, is around 3 kilometres long and 10 centimetres wide. Changes in the relative proportions of hydrogen isotopes in the ice layers allow scientists to compile a complete record of Antarctic temperatures going back 740,000 years.The core shows the waxing and waning of eight ice ages. Most critically for making predictions about our climate, it is the first core to record a period known as Termination V, around 430,000 years ago.Warming patternAt this point, the world moved from a glacial period into a long, warm interglacial, similar to this era. The previous longest ice-core record, drilled by the Soviet Union at Vostok in Antarctica between 1980 and 1988, went back only 420,000 years."All interglacials are slightly different, but we believe Termination V is the most similar to our own," says chief author of the new study, Eric Wolff, at the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, UK. It mirrors the pattern of solar warming between seasons and at different latitudes that are caused by fluctuations in the Earth's orbit known as the Milankovitch cycles.It shows that the Termination V interglacial was unusually long, lasting 28,000 years. The current interglacial is now 12,000 years old, and some scientists feared that we might be heading for an ice age soon since at least one post-Termination V interglacial lasted just 10,000 years.But the new findings suggest that even without the human hand in global warming, a new ice age would be unlikely for perhaps another 15,000 years, Wolff says.Ice blanketThe core also sheds light on how ice ages have changed over the past million years. Since Termination V, ice ages have been very intense, with periods of cold weather that blanketed much of the northern hemisphere in ice for 80,000 years punctuated by short interglacials lasting typically 20,000 years.But the new core shows that, prior to Termination V, the cold and warm periods of the glacial cycle each lasted around 50,000 years but were much less intense."Marine deposits suggested some of this, but it stands out much more clearly in the ice record," Wolff says.Meanwhile, European and US scientists are discussing plans to survey for a site in Antarctica that will extend the record still further. "We want to go back at least 1.2 million years next time," Wolff says. "But we have to find somewhere that we can do it."Journal reference: Nature (vol 429, p 623)

To be looked down upon by a XXXXX isn't such a bad thing snakepit. In fact one gets used to it when dealing with small minded people.Now what are you going to say when I produce descriptions of Dinos in the bible snakepit, and even Dragons ? How loud will you scoff then ? And mock and insult me rather than accept that it describes them. The word Dinosaur didn't exist until the 19th Century so it isn't in the bible but explain these descriptions if you can. See Behemoths, Leviathans and Tanniyn (Dragon) as described in the bible.http://www.clarifyingchristianity.com/dinos.shtml Behemoth has the following attributes according to Job 40:15-24It “eats grass like an ox.”It “moves his tail like a cedar.” (In Hebrew, this literally reads, “he lets hang his tail like a cedar.”)Its “bones are like beams of bronze,His ribs like bars of iron.”“He is the first of the ways of God.”“He lies under the lotus trees,In a covert of reeds and marsh.”Some bibles and study bibles will translate the word “behemoth” as “elephant” or “hippopotamus.” Others will put a note at the edge or bottom of the page, stating that behemoth was probably an elephant or a hippopotamus. Although an elephant or hippopotamus can eat grass (or lie in a covert of reeds and marsh), neither an elephant or a hippopotamus has a “tail like a cedar” (that is, a tail like a large, tapered tree trunk). In your kid’s dinosaur book you will find lots of animals that have “tails like a cedar.”Leviathan has the following attributes according to Job chapter 41, Psalm 104:25,26 and Isaiah 27:1. This is only a partial listing—just enough to make the point.“No one is so fierce that he would dare stir him up.”“Who can open the doors of his face, with his terrible teeth all around?”“His rows of scales are his pride, shut up tightly as with a seal; one is so near another that no air can come between them; they are joined one to another, they stick together and cannot be parted.”“His sneezings flash forth light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. Out of his mouth go burning lights; sparks of fire shoot out. Smoke goes out of his nostrils, as from a boiling pot and burning rushes. His breath kindles coals, and a flame goes out of his mouth.”“Though the sword reaches him, it cannot avail; nor does spear, dart, or javelin. He regards iron as straw, and bronze as rotten wood. The arrow cannot make him flee; slingstones become like stubble to him. Darts are regarded as straw; he laughs at the threat of javelins.”“On earth there is nothing like him, which is made without fear.”Leviathan “played” in the “great and wide sea” (a paraphrase of Psalm 104 verses 25 and 26—get the exact sense by reading them yourself).Leviathan is a “reptile [a] that is in the sea.” (Isaiah 27:1)[a] Note: The word translated “reptile” here is the Hebrew word tanniyn. This shows that “Leviathan” was also a “tanniyn” (dragon).Unlike behemoth, who is huge, Leviathan is ferocious and terrifying. Many references (we have not listed them all) refer to the sea, so Leviathan is probably a sea creature. Although some bibles refer to Leviathan as an alligator or crocodile (and both of these are fierce) neither of these is a sea creature. They like the water, but they spend much of their time on land. Further, the question “Who can open the doors of his face. . . .” implies that nobody can open Leviathan’s jaws. Although an alligator's jaws cannot normally be forced open, a punch to their sensitive snout or poke in eye might startle them enough to release their grip.[2] Although this is a good description of an alligator characteristic, it does not fit perfectly with the description of Leviathan, which in the context of the Bible was supposed to describe an essentially impossible event, and we are not done yet.The description of the scales is interesting. Several verses describe these great scales. Compared to Leviathan’s armor, iron is like straw and arrows ca not make it flee. Let’s face it, an arrow can do a lot of damage to a crocodile or alligator. This is not a description of either of them—or any living animal we are aware of.And now for the key ingredient: fire. It is hard to read Job 41:18-21 without realizing the Bible is telling us that Leviathan breathes fire. That alone will eliminate almost every living animal. Yes, there is one animal like that in today’s world. It is called a bombardier beetle. This beetle is a native of Central America, and has a nozzle in its hind end that acts like a little flame thrower. It sprays a high-temperature jet of gas (fueled by hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxide with oxidative enzymes) for protection. Now, if a Central American beetle can do it, so could Leviathan. By the way, crocodiles and alligators are out of the picture on this one, don’t you agree?Before we leave the topic of fire, there are two more notes you may find interesting:The history of every culture is filled with stories of fire-breathing dragons. If you think about it, in all the past ages wouldn’t someone have made up a story of a fire-breathing lion or something? Nobody did because the dragon stories are based on truth, and only “dragons” breathed fire. It is easy to imagine Leviathan as a member of the dragon (tanniyn) family. (Plus, Isaiah 27:1 strongly implies this connection.)Many fossil dinosaur skulls contain unexplained, empty passages. Scientists have not been able to guess the reason for these passages. Would it make sense that some dinosaurs used these passages as “gas tanks” for the combustible mixture used to “breathe fire?” We believe it does.Comparing all this information to the description in your kid’s dinosaur book, you may come up with the conclusion that Leviathan is a kronosaurus. We have heard (and read) other suggestions, but the kronosaurus is the best match of any known creature to the description of Leviathan.

As for American Indian reports. Dispute this one source I found in 3 seconds. http://www.lilith-ezine.com/articles...aserpents.html[/QUOTE]Sea Serpents of Canada By Charles Alexander MoffatUnbeknownst to many Canadians and foreigners, Canada actually has an abundancy of sea-serpent/dragon myths, otherwise known as "Loch Ness Monsters". Like their Scottish relative, these Canadian sea serpents dwell in coastal waters and inland lakes. It is widely believed that if these sea serpents exist, then they are actually dinosaurs that somehow avoided the mass extinctions of the Cretaceous Period.In the case of Canadian Sea-Serpents, the native myths and legends about them have existed for thousands of years. Recorded sightings of such creatures date back to the 1700s.Jacques Cartier, the French explorer who mapped much of the St. Lawrence river, kept a journal of everything he did. He and members of his crew saw what they described as "a giant finned snake" that moved like a caterpillar, using its side fins to propel itself forward in the water. Cartier's crew tried to capture the beast, but it moved too quickly and dove beneath the waters.When Cartier consulted with natives in the region, they called the creature "Gaasyendietha". This was the first recorded sighting of any sea serpent in North America.But it would not be the last. Across Canada and the United states, there are numerous large lakes (most notably the Great Lakes, which was an inland sea during the last ice age) and a variety of sea-serpent myths to go with them.Gaasyendietha:According to Seneca myths, Gaasyendietha is said to be a dragon that dwells in Lake Ontario. Although it is seldom described, it is said to be quite large. Legends say this dragon could fly on a trail of fire, and it could also spew fire.Argont:According to Huron myths, Angont is a vicious, poisonous reptile who supposedly dwelled in desolate places such as caves, forests, lakes in the Lake Ontario/Lake Erie region. Its skin is poisonous, walks on four legs (very similar to a Komodo dragon from China) and is approximately the size or a horse or donkey. Legends say it also causes disasters and diseases.Amhuluk:Amhuluk supposedly lives in a lake in British Columbia or perhaps as far south as Oregon (there are multiple locations and sightings of Amhuluk). The most celebrated location is near Forkend Mountain in Oregon, where native americans greatly fear the beast. It is described as a very large sea serpent with horns.One story accounts how Amhuluk impaled two of three children on its horns and took them into the lake. The father visited these children, and for five days they appeared by the water. However, afterward, they disappeared and remained with Amhuluk. Many believe that this dragon's passion is to catch and drown things. The story is likely meant to scare children away from swimming in the lakes.Ancient Serpent:According to Piute myth, the Ancient Serpent lived in the Lake Pyramid and reportedly like to snatch victims. When the Piutes saw whirlpools in Lake Pyramid, they would not go near the lake, for they were afraid that the Ancient One was looking for another victim to snatch.The Bentinck Sea Serpent:Not actually a sea serpent, this endangered species is actually a very large snake, comparable to an anaconda. It is found in Bentinck township in Grey County, Ontario. It is a very large black snake that inhabits swamp areas, feeding on fish and other aquatic life. The largest Bentinck Black Snake ever found was thirty feet long, and was found in 1955.Kolowisi:The Zuni myths tell of Kolowisi, a huge water serpent with fins along its body, and small horns. One of the tales involves a young girl who goes to a spring. There, she found a small baby there and rescued it from the water. Without telling her parents, she took the baby and slept with it by her side.The "baby" was really Kolowisi, who then transformed into his true shape. He stole the girl and took her back to the spring. There, he made her his wife.In another story, however, Kolowisi held back the flood waters for a family to get up the mountain. By doing this, Kolowisi allowed these people to live, and then allowed the flood waters to fill the valley.Msi-Kinepeikwa:Sometimes called just "Kinepikwa", this dragon/serpent was a Shawnee myth. It was described as being a large serpent, much like a snake, that inhabited a lake. The Msi-Kinepeikwa achieved its form slowly. This massive serpent shed its skin and grew the next, growing larger each time. It is said that the first stage of this creature was a fawn with one red and one blue horn which was inside of a lake. This fawn grew and moved toward the water's edge, changing and growing until it became the serpent that the natives saw.Palulukon:The Hopi believe that hue water serpents with large plumes, and are revered as nature spirits, believed to be able to cause natural disasters when angered or hurt.The Spoonville Beach Sea Serpent:The Spoonville story appears to be one built by tourists and local area residents, in an effort to boost tourism. Descriptions of the beast sound more like a traditional dragon story, and may be completely fictionalized. There is no native myth about a sea serpent in that region, suggesting that this is just fabrication. The sea serpent is described as a huge creature with red, bloodshot eyes. The scales were said to be green, and smoke was said to billow out of its nostrils.Gloucester's Sea Serpent:On August 22, 1817, a publication in Boston entitled "A Monsterous Sea Serpent: The largest ever seen in America" was published. It reported a sea serpent that appeared in the harbor to be about forty-five to fifty-five feet in length with a head similar to a horse. Other sightings of the creature reported up to one hundred feet long and that the head was more snake-like.In Massachusetts, literally hundreds of people saw this creature. So many saw this sea monster that the government was forced to investigate. The Linnaean Society of New England created a special committee to investigate. Members included the judge John Davis, the doctor Jacob Bigelow, and the naturalist Francis Gray.According to hundreds of reports, it moved like a caterpillar, had a neck as thick as a barrel and approximately 45 to 100 feet long.Stvkwvnaya:Also called the "Tie Snake". According to the Seminole, it is reputed to have a single horn, which is said to be an aphrodisiac. It is described as being at least the size of a horse, and at least 20' in length, with 4 fins on its sides.There are many more legends and sightings across North America, such Ogopogo in British Columbia, and the Lake Champlain sea serpent in Pennsylvania. I am not listing all of them on here.Sea serpent legends/sightings are only found in temperate parts of Canada and the United States. When they are sighted, most people don't even know the proper name of the creature because they didn't even know that the region had a sea serpent myth.Most police forces do not keep track of such sightings either, firmly believing that people are just pulling their legs.It would be difficult to tell just how many sightings occur per year, because most people likely don't report the sightings, and even if they did, most authorities wouldn't even bother to write up a report. They have murderers and rapists to worry about. Tracking down a so-called sea serpent, which may or may not be a prank, is considered to be a waste of time.And even if they did find one, it would most certainly be an endangered species, likely eat fresh-water fish, and is nothing much to worry about.It is important to note that this planet has many unusual creatures that we don't learn about in grade school. Schools tend to teach animals that fit into the ABCs (A is for Anteater, B is for Bird, C is for Cat, etc). The Komodo dragon (a poisonous reptile about the size of a horse) and 50' long giant squids are real creatures, but they are rarely ever seen. No one has ever made a high-quality photo of "big-foot" and sasquatches, but we know they exist because we have fossils of them (in the scientific community, the fossils are known as homo gigantus).We know that sea-serpent-ish dinosaurs did once exist, because we have fossils of them. We also know from these fossils that they ate fish.We even have one preserved "sea serpent" that was found in the nets of a Portuguese fishing boat off the coast of Newfoundland in 1989. It was partially decomposed, and is believed to either have been hit by a passing ship (its fins were torn badly) or it had been preserved in ice for millions of years and had only recently melted.Every religion has flood myths, and they also have some form of sea serpent/dragon myth, including the bible. Either these religions made up these myths to explain the bones of dinosaurs, or people have actually sighted such creatures.And like every good fish story, the tale tends to get longer and more impressive with the telling. Before you know it the lowly sea serpent has sprouted wings and can spit fire.

Yes, there is one animal like that in today’s world. It is called a bombardier beetle. This beetle is a native of Central America, and has a nozzle in its hind end that acts like a little flame thrower. It sprays a high-temperature jet of gas (fueled by hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxide with oxidative enzymes) for protection. Now, if a Central American beetle can do it, so could Leviathan. By the way, crocodiles and alligators are out of the picture on this one, don’t you agree?Before we leave the topic of fire, there are two more notes you may find interesting:The history of every culture is filled with stories of fire-breathing dragons. If you think about it, in all the past ages wouldn’t someone have made up a story of a fire-breathing lion or something? Nobody did because the dragon stories are based on truth, and only “dragons” breathed fire. It is easy to imagine Leviathan as a member of the dragon (tanniyn) family. (Plus, Isaiah 27:1 strongly implies this connection.)Many fossil dinosaur skulls contain unexplained, empty passages. Scientists have not been able to guess the reason for these passages. Would it make sense that some dinosaurs used these passages as “gas tanks” for the combustible mixture used to “breathe fire?” We believe it does.Comparing all this information to the description in your kid’s dinosaur book, you may come up with the conclusion that Leviathan is a kronosaurus. We have heard (and read) other suggestions, but the kronosaurus is the best match of any known creature to the description of Leviathan.

Hey waxy, he asked why the bible doesn't mention dinos if they're real and I showed him that it does. But I know your side would mock and scoff at that which you can't prove wrong because no matter what you do, you can't deny the age of the bible and attribute it to anyone other that the Jews of that period in History. Do you want stories from China too ?

To be looked down upon by a XXXXX isn't such a bad thing snakepit. In fact one gets used to it when dealing with small minded people.Now what are you going to say when I produce descriptions of Dinos in the bible snakepit, and even Dragons ? How loud will you scoff then ? And mock and insult me rather than accept that it describes them. The word Dinosaur didn't exist until the 19th Century so it isn't in the bible but explain these descriptions if you can. See Behemoths, Leviathans and Tanniyn (Dragon) as described in the bible.http://www.clarifyingchristianity.com/dinos.shtml Behemoth has the following attributes according to Job 40:15-24It “eats grass like an ox.”It “moves his tail like a cedar.” (In Hebrew, this literally reads, “he lets hang his tail like a cedar.”)Its “bones are like beams of bronze,His ribs like bars of iron.”“He is the first of the ways of God.”“He lies under the lotus trees,In a covert of reeds and marsh.”Some bibles and study bibles will translate the word “behemoth” as “elephant” or “hippopotamus.” Others will put a note at the edge or bottom of the page, stating that behemoth was probably an elephant or a hippopotamus. Although an elephant or hippopotamus can eat grass (or lie in a covert of reeds and marsh), neither an elephant or a hippopotamus has a “tail like a cedar” (that is, a tail like a large, tapered tree trunk). In your kid’s dinosaur book you will find lots of animals that have “tails like a cedar.”Leviathan has the following attributes according to Job chapter 41, Psalm 104:25,26 and Isaiah 27:1. This is only a partial listing—just enough to make the point.“No one is so fierce that he would dare stir him up.”“Who can open the doors of his face, with his terrible teeth all around?”“His rows of scales are his pride, shut up tightly as with a seal; one is so near another that no air can come between them; they are joined one to another, they stick together and cannot be parted.”“His sneezings flash forth light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. Out of his mouth go burning lights; sparks of fire shoot out. Smoke goes out of his nostrils, as from a boiling pot and burning rushes. His breath kindles coals, and a flame goes out of his mouth.”“Though the sword reaches him, it cannot avail; nor does spear, dart, or javelin. He regards iron as straw, and bronze as rotten wood. The arrow cannot make him flee; slingstones become like stubble to him. Darts are regarded as straw; he laughs at the threat of javelins.”“On earth there is nothing like him, which is made without fear.”Leviathan “played” in the “great and wide sea” (a paraphrase of Psalm 104 verses 25 and 26—get the exact sense by reading them yourself).Leviathan is a “reptile [a] that is in the sea.” (Isaiah 27:1)[a] Note: The word translated “reptile” here is the Hebrew word tanniyn. This shows that “Leviathan” was also a “tanniyn” (dragon).Unlike behemoth, who is huge, Leviathan is ferocious and terrifying. Many references (we have not listed them all) refer to the sea, so Leviathan is probably a sea creature. Although some bibles refer to Leviathan as an alligator or crocodile (and both of these are fierce) neither of these is a sea creature. They like the water, but they spend much of their time on land. Further, the question “Who can open the doors of his face. . . .” implies that nobody can open Leviathan’s jaws. Although an alligator's jaws cannot normally be forced open, a punch to their sensitive snout or poke in eye might startle them enough to release their grip.[2] Although this is a good description of an alligator characteristic, it does not fit perfectly with the description of Leviathan, which in the context of the Bible was supposed to describe an essentially impossible event, and we are not done yet.The description of the scales is interesting. Several verses describe these great scales. Compared to Leviathan’s armor, iron is like straw and arrows ca not make it flee. Let’s face it, an arrow can do a lot of damage to a crocodile or alligator. This is not a description of either of them—or any living animal we are aware of.And now for the key ingredient: fire.

I'll just point out here (since no one else seems to have) that even if dinos are still roaming the earth, it doesn't affect the ToE a lick. Did the ToE fall to pieces when the coelacanth was "discovered" in the 20's? Nope. Now, show me a fossil mammal (say, a wolf or dog-there's lots of them around) that is contemporary with a trilobite fossil, and it's time to rethink things.

I normally would take offense to someone calling me a small minded XXXXX, but in your case I will consider the source (someone attempting to make the rediculous argument that dinosaurs lived together with man, that fire breathing dragons exist or ever did exist, that MYTHS of sea serpents prove that dinosaurs and man coexisted, etc etc etc), and I will simply smile and nod. How about: "My, what a vivid imagination you have!"I am not so much attempting to mock or insult you, rather the rediculous notion that dinosaurs walked with man. I can't help the little snicker that comes out every time I think that people actually believe this stuff, and will bend the word of their own spritual book to prove it. Even most christians find the irrational claims of new earth creationists to be a distasteful twisting of the bibles words. But hey, you hav every right to believe whatever you want. Don't mind the occasional bouts of uncontrollable laughter from the rest of the world. I guess that is just your cross to bear.Then why would the bible not now use the word Dinosaur? I mean come on, it's translations over the years have changed so greatly, you would think that there would be a lot of mention of dinosaurs in the bible, since it would bolster the thoery of creationism. Yet the majority of christianity will not touch that one with a 10ft pole. Odd. The ambiguous language of "behemoths, leviathans, and tanniyn" is used, who's translations vary greatly from text to text. Sure, with a great deal of imagination, you can make it sound like just about anything you want it to. I would love to see a Brachiosaurus or Apatosaurus lie under a lotus tree, or hide amongst the reeds and marsh. Sure. That would be akin to hiding an elephant under a christmas tree.Sounds like a crocodile to me.As for psalm 104:25. This sea-great and wide; there are creeping things and innumerable beasts, both small and large.26. There the ships go; You formed this leviathan with which to sport.What about this says "giant fire breathing sea dragon"?The saltwater crocodile is able to travel a great distance over open sea. Their great distribution is probably due to this trait.The saltwater crocodile can be found in coastal waters between Northern Australia and the southern coast of India. They can also be found in freshwater rivers and swamps.http://www.thebigzoo.com/Animals/Sal..._Crocodile.aspThe saltwater crocodile is the largest crocodilian and the largest living reptile. Male saltwater crocodiles can reach lengths of 23 feet and females reach lengths of over 10 feet. They have a very large head and very strong jaws. You go pry open the jaws of a saltwater croc, even try punching it in the nose first. Don't cry to me when you pull away a bloody stump if you even live. In Taiwan, a man whose arm was bitten off by a crocodile has had it surgically reattached. The veterinarian was trying to treat a 440-pound Nile crocodile. The animal, apparently, wasn't tranquilized enough. Another zoo worker shot the crocodile to get it to let go of the veterinarian's arm. Zoo officials said the crocodile is all right. The bullets did not penetrate his skin.  http://www.nbc5.com/news/11856998/detail.htmlActually, it does not shoot fire. It is not a "flamethrower". It shoots a high pressure jet of water and 3 chemicals mixed together, that creates a pressure jet of basically hot water and steam. There is no flame involved. http://www.answersingenesis.org/tj/v17/i1/beetle.aspA beetle that shoots a pressure jet of steaming chemicals proves fire breathing dragons? I think not. You're reaching...and falling far short.Probably because lions are something that many people had seen at the time, and knew for a fact that they did not breathe fire. A dragon on the other hand, was mythical creature that adventurers and story tellers could protray as they wished in their songs and stories. Making it breathe fire certainly makes it more interesting and exciting than a dragon that just walks around eating animals all day long. You don't sell the steak, you sell the sizzle.Or possibly, oh, I don't know...maybe sinus passages? Who would think?A Plesiosaur, not a dinosaur, who's remains have been found in Australia and Colombia and is beleived to have been extinct since the end of the Cretaceous period (65 million years ago)? You mean that Kronosaurus? A far cry from the middle east in the last 4500 years...don't you think? Wow, actual research and critical thought, not just cut and paste regurgitation of anothers flawed theories.

This has been a rather interesting thread so far. In reading it, I was reminded of an essay I read a while back, by the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges. In "The Argentine Writer and Tradition" he writes:And what does this have to do with the Bible and dinosaurs? The way I see it, Borges' approach to the Koran could be applied to any religious texts that claim a historical basis. So, if we apply this same line of thinking to the dinosaurs and dragons of the Bible, we're left with two options:1) Dinosaurs and Dragons existed when these verses were written.Dinosaurs, when they did exist, were very common animals. More abundant than camels, even, and in all parts of the world. If dinosaurs were so common when these Biblical passages were written, why would it be necessary to write about them in such detail when the average reader of the time would already be quite familiar with such creatures? The authenticity of the Bible is therefore called into question.2) The Bible is authentic* and the depictions of fantastical creatures are just that: fantasy.The author(s), for whatever reason, felt it necessary to introduce mythical creatures that had no basis in reality, much as Homer used mythical creatures like the cyclops, sirens, etc. in the Odyssey. Things that seem to resemble dragons and other strange, mighty creatures did not actually exist and were products of the author's imagination.I am curious what you think of this, Archangel. Can you be a Christian without dragons?*NOTE: I am not necessarily conceding that the Bible is the literal word of God. However, I will concede that there is some degree of historical authenticity.

Technically, the bible doesn't say that the Earth itself is 6000 years old at all. It says that God separated the firmament from the Heavens from the Waters, created life and put it all together but it doesn't say He formed the Globe at that time anywhere. I personally believe the creation event took place more like between 10 and 25,000 years ago. But that's only my opinion. Theologians base the age of humanity on the geological records from Genesis to David to Jesus but I believe they haven't, and couldn't account for the gaps in the written record because we don't have any way of knowing how long or how many gaps there are. So I have never placed much faith in the 6,000 to 8,000 year estimate. But that doesn't mean I'm dumb enough to believe in evolution. I mean talk about a foolish and unbelievable fairy tale. emoticonXConfused Dinos coexisting with humanity is far more believable than that, dontya know. emoticonXGood See, the Earth was void of life and without organized form and darkness was everywhere so the Sun wasn't in its current location yet but Gods spirit was hovering over the face of the waters. What was holding the waters in place ? This means the Earth is its crudest form was here but void of all life. God put it all together at that time, at the time of our creation.

The irony is so thick, you could choke on it. As a matter of fact, I wish...The funny thing is that I am not making the argument against creationism. People believe that god created everything including the dinosaurs...and I am fine with that. I don't believe it, but I will not argue against that. You don't have to believe that man and dinosaurs coexisted in order to believe creationism. What I will argue against however is the rediculous notion that the earth is ~6k years old, and that dinosaurs were walking around in the 12th century.

Here we go again with the "well, at some unspecified date far off in the future when we are all long dead and gone I will be proven right, which is the best I can do as I have no solid evidence of this rubbish I'm spouting" argument.If that is the best you can do, then what is the point in debating anything with you?Blah, blah, blah . . . .

Yeah, well time will tell who the ignorant primitive is charlie, and I wouldn't want to be you on that day any more than you'll want to be you.

OK, prove these. Wow, that took about 3 seconds as well.Let's review:The word "Myth" is used 12 times. I assume you know what the word myth means.There is no tangible evidence of sea monsters, only myth and legends. Perhaps there is a reason for this? The vast majority of the photographs of sea monsters have been shown to be either faked or to be photos of something else that can be mistaken as a sea monster (kinda like a piece of toast that looks like Elvis).Gaasyendietha according to legend can not only fly on a trail of fire, but can transition between the earth and heaven on it's trail of fire. Please don't tell me you believe that too.Argont causes natural disasters? Sure it does. Is this trying to say that argont is not just a sea monster, but has magical powers as well? Please.Amhuluk: One story accounts how Amhuluk impaled two of three children on its horns and took them into the lake. The father visited these children, and for five days they appeared by the water. However, afterward, they disappeared and remained with Amhuluk. Many believe that this dragon's passion is to catch and drown things. The story is likely meant to scare children away from swimming in the lakes. Impaled 2 kids and took them to the lake. Then the dragon let's these kids visit dad for 5 days, and then kept them. Even the little blurb states that the story was likely meant to scare children away from the lakes. The Bentinck Sea Serpent: According to the story, a large species of black snake. Hmmm, some sea monster there.Kolowisi: One of the tales involves a young girl who goes to a spring. There, she found a small baby there and rescued it from the water. Without telling her parents, she took the baby and slept with it by her side. The "baby" was really Kolowisi, who then transformed into his true shape. He stole the girl and took her back to the spring. There, he made her his wife. In another story, however, Kolowisi held back the flood waters for a family to get up the mountain. By doing this, Kolowisi allowed these people to live, and then allowed the flood waters to fill the valley.Did you read these before you posted it? Laughable.Msi-Kinepeikwa: A fawn (baby dear) that lives in the lake with 2 colored horns, and eventually grows into a sea serpent. Does that sounds rediculous to you?Palulukon: Again, causing natural disasters when angry? Sure.The Spoonville Beach Sea Serpent: The Spoonville story appears to be one built by tourists and local area residents, in an effort to boost tourism. There is no native myth about a sea serpent in that region, suggesting that this is just fabrication. Fabricated legend to boost tourism? Great evidence.Gloucester's Sea Serpent: One of the busiest commercial fishing posts in the US. You would think someone would have a picture of video or something tangible as actual proof. But no proof...none whatsoever. Thought by many to be something to draw tourism to the area. Also, if an actual reality, likely to be an Oar Fish. Stvkwvnaya: I guess someone actually caught this thing, and that's how they learned that the horn was an aphrodisiac? Sure they did.The cut and paste post states that most people would likely not report the sighting? Does that sound realistic? If I saw something like this, I would scream to high hell about it. Big foot: We have big foot fossils? No we do not. We have fossils of Gigantopithecus (quadrupedal, rather than bipedal) and Homo Erectus that some have theorized could be big foot. We have never found fossilized remains of either of these species in N. America. Simply people offering an explanation, not proof. There is again no tangible proof of big foot.We don't have fossils of sea-serpentish dinosaurs. We have fossils of sea going plesiosaurs, which are widely considered to not be closely related to dinosaurs. Dinosaurs were terrestrial creatures.The preserved sea serpent caught by the fishing boat: While I found no mention of the 1989 incident in Newfoundland, I did find the 1977 mention of the "sea serpent" caught by the Japanese fishing boat of the coast of New Zealand. It turned out to be a basking shark. There have been other "sea serpents as well" that have been proven to be nothing more than a rotting basking shark, or a basking shark that was cut up by a boat prop.And my absolute favorite from the entire post:And like every good fish story, the tale tends to get longer and more impressive with the telling. Before you know it the lowly sea serpent has sprouted wings and can spit fireThere is a large difference between myth and reality which most people can easily seperate. Myths are a part of every culture. What I asked for was some sort of reliable information that would lead one to believe that the Native Americans walked around with dinosaurs. You have failed to give me evne the slightest hint of evidence on the subject. Instead, you choose to muddy the issue by posting myths about sea serpents, which even if they did exist, are not dinosaurs. Perhaps you should actually read things before you post them. I myself would have been embarrased to post something like that. A complete red herring to the issue at hand, and laughable to boot.

As for American Indian reports. Dispute this one source I found in 3 seconds. http://www.lilith-ezine.com/articles...aserpents.html[/QUOTE]Sea Serpents of Canada By Charles Alexander MoffatUnbeknownst to many Canadians and foreigners, Canada actually has an abundancy of sea-serpent/dragon myths, otherwise known as "Loch Ness Monsters". Like their Scottish relative, these Canadian sea serpents dwell in coastal waters and inland lakes. It is widely believed that if these sea serpents exist, then they are actually dinosaurs that somehow avoided the mass extinctions of the Cretaceous Period.In the case of Canadian Sea-Serpents, the native myths and legends about them have existed for thousands of years. Recorded sightings of such creatures date back to the 1700s.Jacques Cartier, the French explorer who mapped much of the St. Lawrence river, kept a journal of everything he did. He and members of his crew saw what they described as "a giant finned snake" that moved like a caterpillar, using its side fins to propel itself forward in the water. Cartier's crew tried to capture the beast, but it moved too quickly and dove beneath the waters.When Cartier consulted with natives in the region, they called the creature "Gaasyendietha". This was the first recorded sighting of any sea serpent in North America.But it would not be the last. Across Canada and the United states, there are numerous large lakes (most notably the Great Lakes, which was an inland sea during the last ice age) and a variety of sea-serpent myths to go with them.Gaasyendietha:According to Seneca myths, Gaasyendietha is said to be a dragon that dwells in Lake Ontario. Although it is seldom described, it is said to be quite large. Legends say this dragon could fly on a trail of fire, and it could also spew fire.Argont:According to Huron myths, Angont is a vicious, poisonous reptile who supposedly dwelled in desolate places such as caves, forests, lakes in the Lake Ontario/Lake Erie region. Its skin is poisonous, walks on four legs (very similar to a Komodo dragon from China) and is approximately the size or a horse or donkey. Legends say it also causes disasters and diseases.Amhuluk:Amhuluk supposedly lives in a lake in British Columbia or perhaps as far south as Oregon (there are multiple locations and sightings of Amhuluk). The most celebrated location is near Forkend Mountain in Oregon, where native americans greatly fear the beast. It is described as a very large sea serpent with horns.One story accounts how Amhuluk impaled two of three children on its horns and took them into the lake. The father visited these children, and for five days they appeared by the water. However, afterward, they disappeared and remained with Amhuluk. Many believe that this dragon's passion is to catch and drown things. The story is likely meant to scare children away from swimming in the lakes.Ancient Serpent:According to Piute myth, the Ancient Serpent lived in the Lake Pyramid and reportedly like to snatch victims. When the Piutes saw whirlpools in Lake Pyramid, they would not go near the lake, for they were afraid that the Ancient One was looking for another victim to snatch.The Bentinck Sea Serpent:Not actually a sea serpent, this endangered species is actually a very large snake, comparable to an anaconda. It is found in Bentinck township in Grey County, Ontario. It is a very large black snake that inhabits swamp areas, feeding on fish and other aquatic life. The largest Bentinck Black Snake ever found was thirty feet long, and was found in 1955.Kolowisi:The Zuni myths tell of Kolowisi, a huge water serpent with fins along its body, and small horns. One of the tales involves a young girl who goes to a spring. There, she found a small baby there and rescued it from the water. Without telling her parents, she took the baby and slept with it by her side.The "baby" was really Kolowisi, who then transformed into his true shape. He stole the girl and took her back to the spring. There, he made her his wife.In another story, however, Kolowisi held back the flood waters for a family to get up the mountain. By doing this, Kolowisi allowed these people to live, and then allowed the flood waters to fill the valley.Msi-Kinepeikwa:Sometimes called just "Kinepikwa", this dragon/serpent was a Shawnee myth. It was described as being a large serpent, much like a snake, that inhabited a lake. The Msi-Kinepeikwa achieved its form slowly. This massive serpent shed its skin and grew the next, growing larger each time. It is said that the first stage of this creature was a fawn with one red and one blue horn which was inside of a lake. This fawn grew and moved toward the water's edge, changing and growing until it became the serpent that the natives saw.Palulukon:The Hopi believe that hue water serpents with large plumes, and are revered as nature spirits, believed to be able to cause natural disasters when angered or hurt.The Spoonville Beach Sea Serpent:The Spoonville story appears to be one built by tourists and local area residents, in an effort to boost tourism. Descriptions of the beast sound more like a traditional dragon story, and may be completely fictionalized. There is no native myth about a sea serpent in that region, suggesting that this is just fabrication. The sea serpent is described as a huge creature with red, bloodshot eyes. The scales were said to be green, and smoke was said to billow out of its nostrils.Gloucester's Sea Serpent:On August 22, 1817, a publication in Boston entitled "A Monsterous Sea Serpent: The largest ever seen in America" was published. It reported a sea serpent that appeared in the harbor to be about forty-five to fifty-five feet in length with a head similar to a horse. Other sightings of the creature reported up to one hundred feet long and that the head was more snake-like.In Massachusetts, literally hundreds of people saw this creature. So many saw this sea monster that the government was forced to investigate. The Linnaean Society of New England created a special committee to investigate. Members included the judge John Davis, the doctor Jacob Bigelow, and the naturalist Francis Gray.According to hundreds of reports, it moved like a caterpillar, had a neck as thick as a barrel and approximately 45 to 100 feet long.Stvkwvnaya:Also called the "Tie Snake". According to the Seminole, it is reputed to have a single horn, which is said to be an aphrodisiac. It is described as being at least the size of a horse, and at least 20' in length, with 4 fins on its sides.There are many more legends and sightings across North America, such Ogopogo in British Columbia, and the Lake Champlain sea serpent in Pennsylvania. I am not listing all of them on here.Sea serpent legends/sightings are only found in temperate parts of Canada and the United States. When they are sighted, most people don't even know the proper name of the creature because they didn't even know that the region had a sea serpent myth.Most police forces do not keep track of such sightings either, firmly believing that people are just pulling their legs.It would be difficult to tell just how many sightings occur per year, because most people likely don't report the sightings, and even if they did, most authorities wouldn't even bother to write up a report. They have murderers and rapists to worry about. Tracking down a so-called sea serpent, which may or may not be a prank, is considered to be a waste of time.And even if they did find one, it would most certainly be an endangered species, likely eat fresh-water fish, and is nothing much to worry about.It is important to note that this planet has many unusual creatures that we don't learn about in grade school. Schools tend to teach animals that fit into the ABCs (A is for Anteater, B is for Bird, C is for Cat, etc). The Komodo dragon (a poisonous reptile about the size of a horse) and 50' long giant squids are real creatures, but they are rarely ever seen. No one has ever made a high-quality photo of "big-foot" and sasquatches, but we know they exist because we have fossils of them (in the scientific community, the fossils are known as homo gigantus).We know that sea-serpent-ish dinosaurs did once exist, because we have fossils of them. We also know from these fossils that they ate fish.We even have one preserved "sea serpent" that was found in the nets of a Portuguese fishing boat off the coast of Newfoundland in 1989. It was partially decomposed, and is believed to either have been hit by a passing ship (its fins were torn badly) or it had been preserved in ice for millions of years and had only recently melted.Every religion has flood myths, and they also have some form of sea serpent/dragon myth, including the bible. Either these religions made up these myths to explain the bones of dinosaurs, or people have actually sighted such creatures.And like every good fish story, the tale tends to get longer and more impressive with the telling. Before you know it the lowly sea serpent has sprouted wings and can spit fire.

Fine. 6,000, 10,000, 25,000...who cares. It is rediculous either way. And what exactly do you mean geographical records from gensis to David to jesus? What record exist within christian theology that tells when the creation occured? I would like to see that. Dumb enough to believe in evolution would probably be a promotion in your case.No, I don't know. I have seen absolutely no evidence of dinosaurs coexisting with humans, but much evidence to the contrary. Hey, if I actually was presented with credible proof that they actually did coexist, I would be the first one to admit that I was wrong. I'm not too proud. But I feel that I have little to worry about in this case.I have considered it, and found it to be irrational, rediculous, and without tangible supporting evidence. I don't consider radiocarbon dating to be a huge assumption. I consider it to be tangible scientific proof. This is only one of many pieces of proof and evidence that have convinced me of my belief in evolution. I have yet to see one solid piece of evidence for creation by a divine god.

Technically, the bible doesn't say that the Earth itself is 6000 years old at all. It says that God separated the firmament from the Heavens from the Waters, created life and put it all together but it doesn't say He formed the Globe at that time anywhere. I personally believe the creation event took place more like between 10 and 25,000 years ago. But that's only my opinion. Theologians base the age of humanity on the geological records from Genesis to David to Jesus but I believe they haven't, and couldn't account for the gaps in the written record because we don't have any way of knowing how long or how many gaps there are. So I have never placed much faith in the 6,000 to 8,000 year estimate. But that doesn't mean I'm dumb enough to believe in evolution. I mean talk about a foolish and unbelievable fairy tale. emoticonXConfused Dinos coexisting with humanity is far more believable than that, dontya know. emoticonXGood See, the Earth was void of life and without organized form and darkness was everywhere so the Sun wasn't in its current location yet but Gods spirit was hovering over the face of the waters. What was holding the waters in place ? This means the Earth is its crudest form was here but void of all life. God put it all together at that time, at the time of our creation. In my humble opinion anywho. So all this evo talk about the age of everything proving they are right is only rational and reasonable if all of their huge assumptions are in line with what really happened in the beginning. Just something to consider is all. emoticonXAngel

I guess the Young Earth Creationist missed my question, did the dino's make it onto the ark?I was at the link on the first page and its says that the culture who built the Temple existed 8AD to 14th century. This says to me that the dinos must have made it onto the ark. The Ark must of been one hell of a big ship if it contained animals such as this. I don't want to scoff at anybodies beliefs on this board, but is frankly ridiculous to believe that Dinosaurs existed at the same time as Humans. It is almost like taking the Flintstones to be accurate depiction of our history.

In bible College I studied the complete Old Testament as I did the New. On the day that we closed the book on the Old Testament after completing our study of it, do you know what happened to me ? As I sat back, let out a sigh and looked up at the ceiling in contemplation of what I had learned. In my minds eye I saw a perfect picture of the Jewish Messiah, the Savior of Humanity. Jesus Christ. The Old Testament is Jesus story which foretold His Coming, His Ministry and His Glorification. So no where have i ever said I deny or reject the OT as anything less than the New Testament. Together they give a complete picture of Gods plan for humanity. Alone, or separately, they only give a partial picture of our Heavenly Father. So I am also embedded in my American Culture. I drive, shop, own things, enjoy skiing, the beach, hiking, camping, movies, dancing, dining out and many other activities that define modern day people. But I reject the downside of the flesh as in anything that attempts to separate me from a closer walk with my Father. I seek balance in life and my basis for determining that balance is if it draws me away from Him then it is bad for me. It's as simple as that.

Wrong again Kronus. I insist that Gods truth is the only truth, not mine. And there is no other mediator between God and Man except for Christ Jesus our Savior, so I'm not arrogant for submitting before Him but very humble in admitting my need for His grace and Mercy. It's you who is arrogant for rejecting the God of all that is by insisting that you are as good as Him and not in need of His Grace at all. And also Kronus, the determination of which of us is arrogant wont be determined by the readers as their opinions are irrelevant. In the end, only God will determine which of us was arrogant or humble, and only His judgement will matter.

Good luck then- but its unfair to say that if indeed you already knew of the New-Testament. One could not I think extrapolate the new testament given only the old! The two are simply too far apart in their basic principles and concepts. New testament philosophy and ethics is a far cry from that of the old. Indeed one can postulate that Christ was attempting to make an even bigger break from the traditions of the old testament than he managed to pull off. Much of the original intent was lost as the RCC buried christianity under the ponderous structure of Roman institutions up to and including the old Roman office of Pontifex maximums (ie the Pope). And of course as the leadership adopted the necessary overlays of theology and such to draw the population of Italy and Europe into the fold. Much of the original impetus and vitality of christianity was destroyed in this transition.

But of course. Since the idea is fundamentally irrational, change what the Bible says by pretending that you are using logic.Not according to the Bible. Gen 6:19 says, "And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every [sort] shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep [them] alive with thee; they shall be male and female." How did Noah tell if it was a male or a female inside the egg? I'm wondering. Have you ever actually read the Bible - specifically genesis?And then there is Gen 6:20 that says, "...of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every [sort] shall come unto thee, to keep [them] alive." I'm wondering how it is that these eggs came unto Noah. Did the little animal inside poke its developing legs out and scamper up the ramp onto the ark?And then Gen 7:2 says, "Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that [are] not clean by two, the male and his female." Never mind that the idea of clean/unclean was first expressed in mosaic law (Noah wouldn't have known about that), the concept of the male and his female implies breeding pairs, unless you wish to use a less than literal reading of the Bible. I could go on citing verses that state that Noah took aboard male and female. Nowhere are eggs mentioned. It's just that the idea of two of every living kind (or 7 pairs in some cases) is so illogical that you actually see the need to reduce these to male and female eggs. Are you aware that the sex of many reptiles is determined by the temperature at which the eggs are incubated? What did Noah do about that?It isn't christians that are being scoffed at. It is creationists who favor mythology over reality. Get over yourself.

Yes tis a handy but extremely flawed argument - since its much overused and known to everyone.

Nice job trying to confuse, distort and misinterpret what the bible actually means regarding Genesis Pandion. You forgot one aspect of theequation though, and that is God Himself. If God could bring the Animals according to the specific individuals he wanted to be saved, couldn't he also have brought the pregnant beasts and had them leave eggs for Noah to care for ? But of course it requires FAITH to believe this and you are sorely lacking in that department. But thanks for the atheists perspective. That is always valuable in a spiritual discussion. emoticonXFrazzled

But of course. Since the idea is fundamentally irrational, change what the Bible says by pretending that you are using logic.Not according to the Bible. Gen 6:19 says, "And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every [sort] shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep [them] alive with thee; they shall be male and female." How did Noah tell if it was a male or a female inside the egg? I'm wondering. Have you ever actually read the Bible - specifically genesis?And then there is Gen 6:20 that says, "...of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every [sort] shall come unto thee, to keep [them] alive." I'm wondering how it is that these eggs came unto Noah. Did the little animal inside poke its developing legs out and scamper up the ramp onto the ark?And then Gen 7:2 says, "Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that [are] not clean by two, the male and his female." Never mind that the idea of clean/unclean was first expressed in mosaic law (Noah wouldn't have known about that), the concept of the male and his female implies breeding pairs, unless you wish to use a less than literal reading of the Bible. I could go on citing verses that state that Noah took aboard male and female. Nowhere are eggs mentioned. It's just that the idea of two of every living kind (or 7 pairs in some cases) is so illogical that you actually see the need to reduce these to male and female eggs. Are you aware that the sex of many reptiles is determined by the temperature at which the eggs are incubated? What did Noah do about that?It isn't christians that are being scoffed at. It is creationists who favor mythology over reality. Get over yourself.

First of all Pandion, It isn't I who claim what a true or cultural christian is but the bible that defines it. And I have shown verses as evidence of this claim numerous times. See ?Secondly, learn what the No true Scotsman argument is before throwing it out there. I am not claiming to be the final authority on anything, but defend the bible as Gods final authority on spiritual issues. The No true Scotsman argument is not defined by one appointing themselves up as the final authority anyway so you have it wrong as usual. Here is the definition so you'll stop abusing the term in every debate.

So now we have ferocious lizards, who would probably guard their eggs with their lives queuing up to hand them over to some wally who just built a big boat on dry land. These explanations get funnier by the minute."Don't worry about me mister, I know I'm about to be wiped out by a vengeful god, but at least a couple of my eggs will be saved. I hope these two will be enough to propogate the whole species again".Er . . . . . . . . . . . . . no. I don't think so.And don't give us all this 'it requires Faith' ####.

Why make it so complicated. Since GOD created all the animals etc why save anything at all including Noah et al. Just wipe it out, and recreate the necessary species etc. No need to build the arc, no need for Noah, and it would be an opportunity to start over given tha Man did not turn out all that well.

Can you show some objective evidence that the story you are claiming is 'God's holy and perfect word' is more than a child's tale? All we get from you is claims of stories (claims, not evidence), that are often shown to be lies, exaggerations, or just plain delusions.Let's see if you can come up with something of substance.

Well, since he got banned...What about it AA or SS. Do either of you perhaps want to finish what your alter EDO started? Can anyone define these terms?

And just what exactly are the "windows of heaven" and the "fountains of the deep"? Are they tangible physical things on earth, or supernatural spiritual hoodoo? Please define these two terms.Oh...and it seems odd that AA uses the same big red letter in posts when he repeats himself just like you did. Methinks you is one and the same.

Perfect! So we have proof that dragons exist, too. And sphinxes, and manticores, and all sorts of monsters, because there are carvings of them. Wait! It gets better! We have proof that the Greek and Hindu and Egyptian and all those other gods exist. And proof that the Christian God doesn't exist, too, now that I think of it, otherwise why would there be no carvings of it/him/whatever.emoticonXFrazzled Thank you, thank you, EDO.emoticonXBye

Here, everyone who doubts God's word on how He created everything in six days. Here is evidence that humans once saw dinosaurs - a carving in a Cambodian temple of a stegosauris dinosaur: http://www.bible.ca/tracks/tracks-cambodia.htmHow do you Darwinists who believe dinosaurs existed millions of years ago and not with humans explain this?Here is the actual picture:

Apparently if some human somewhere can imagine a creature then it somehow becomes palpably real. This effect is a true mystery to biologists.

When the science of biology is written in a book so that one can learn, research, critique, and form a considered opinion, then much of the mystique disappears and one can reliably hold forth on a variety of biological topics.The same is true with fairy tales. The truth is in the writing down, don'tcha know? emoticonXHoho
