I think if you man guns criminals will just keep using guns. Production of illegal firearms in Britain is apparently through the roof. They are converting starting pistols and "non firing" replicas into regular weapons.Trying to prevent criminal use of firearms by making firearms illegal is stupid. Idiotic. I cannot even think of astrong enough word to describe the stupidity of that moronic mindset.

I think it is exactly the same idea, and in addition to huge amounts of alcohol still being produced and consumed in this nation, prohibition also gave rise to organised crime, which we still have to deal with today.There was never really a problem with gun crime in england until the ban. There were certainly isolated incidents, but you didn't see nearly the number of incidents as are reported now. I read a story the other day from some british newspaper about a guy who had been arrested by british cops for taking starter pistols and turning them into firing weapons. they suspected he had done dozens of them. Since they have outlawed guns, a man with a gun in his pocket has become a powerful figure. He can move secure in the knowledge that the average, law abiding, joe on the street cannot hope to counter his destructive capability, and that is a guy with a converted starter pistol in his pocket. Theives and criminals who are inclined to violence, and have practice in beating and bludgening people, have a decided advantage over your average citizen.In all reality, it is a rather brutish way to live,not a more civil one. Power at the street level is decided by who is bigger, who is the alpha male, who is the better fighter. From a reasonable standpoint, your average citizen has no real hope if a bad guy decides to target them. Here in America, having a gun in your hand doesn't make you especially powerful, because there are so many others who also have them. It has been said that god created man, and Sam Colt made them all equal. There is some truth to that. Without weapons, we are ruled by brute force. Those who are bigger, stronger, and more violent, are free to prey on the rest of us (with the exception of the 20% or less that the police actually manage to catch).While having the government protect you is a good idea, it has never been one that actually worked. There has always been crime, and there likely always will be. There is no escaping this. Nobody can babysit you 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, but you. Even in Soviet Russia, where penalties for crime were in many cases barbaric, there was still crime (it could also be argued that the really nasty criminals were running things). It would be nice if someday we evolved to the point that such things were unneeded, but it is unlikely, and we certainly haven't gotten there yet. We are still just animals, and as such are ruled by animal instincts and passions. Sure, we wrap our darker impulses in a think cloak of "civilization", but they are still there, and in many people that thin cloak tears rather easily.

I have no problem with you receiving your RKBA back. States have specific rules governing the restoration of rights stripped from people convicted of a felony. In Virginia (where I live), you must first petition the Governor for restoration of your civil rights (like your right to vote). Once he does that (and your case seems a likely one for restoration), then you are allowed to further petition the Circuit Court of your city or county for restoration of your RKBA. You end up with a nice certificate from the Governor and an order from a judge restoring your rights. Your convictions still exist for record checking purposes, but the VCIN/NCIC criminal record history database would also list your rights as restored.

A gun is a tool. A VERY effective tool. nowhere near as effective as a knife. It increases your chances of being successful in a crime. The less likely you are to be successful, the less likely you will be to attempt the crime.The catch 22 is that is just as effective on both sides of the law. therefore the only way to improve the situation is to increase enforcement.

Nor am I sure he could support his claim of illegal firearm production.These facts would seem to contradict his view.The U.S. has a high gun murder rate, whereas a country like England with strict gun controls has almost no gun murders and a very low murder rate. Homicide rates per million (rounded upwards) -The first figure is for homicides by firearm per millionthe second is total homicides per millionand the last figure is the percentage of households which contain gunsUSA 37 57 39%UK 1 14 4%It should be further noted that of the 4% of British households which contain guns, almost none would hold handguns of the sort which might be concealed. They would very likely be fowling pieces, or other sporting rifles which are locked away in a gun cabinet.So, you are a British criminal who intends breaking into a country house. You see no need to obtain a firearm, (very difficult to obtain a pistol, even illegally, and a rifle or shotgun is not easy to conceal,) or the necessity to carry one, as you are unlikely to encounter an irate householder armed with a Magnum, or Smith & Wesson. If the robbery goes wrong, you flee the scene, and even any policeman you may encounter is certain to be unarmed.The same situation in the USA, is fraught with the dangerous situation of (a) the householder being armed, and (b) the burglar being similarly armed because the householder is likely to be. The robbery goes wrong, and either one or both of them are likely to be shot and killed.And even in the event the robber flees the household, any police he encounters is certain to be armed, and the same possiblity of injury and death exists.(You are 57 times more likely to be shot dead in the USA than in Britain, even though the murder rate is only a little under 3 times as high.)The British police were recently given the choice of carrying firearms, and universally refused on the basis that it would only encourage the criminal element to do likewise.How then can it be preferable to have a high incidence of guns, especially hand guns, in any society?Leo

Yes, I meant ban guns, and yes, I am right. The segment I saw on the production of illegal firearms in Britain mostly involved converting starter pistols and non firing replicas. Here are a couple of articles that touch on it it:http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2640221.stmhttp://www.ncis.co.uk/ukta/2002/threat07.asphttp://www.dvc.org.uk/~johnny/dunblane/replicas.htmlI know that somewhere you can search transcript of BBC shows (that is where I saw it). You are using a common anti gun logical fallacy here in assuming that a lower murder rate automatically means lower gun crime. This is not the case. The vast majority of gun crimes do not end in a death.Those facts have nothing to do with my view.Here are a few more interesting articles regardig Britains gun control idiocy. http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/news/fil...014_guns.shtmlhttp://www.thevanguard.org/thevangua...woolrich.shtmlhttp://www.gunblast.com/British_Crime_Soars.htmAnd in a really idiotic twist:http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3617372.stmWhat will the brits think of next? no wonder they lost the world.

AFIK, if you are a farmer and have obtained a registration for it, you may keep a shotgun, or single shot rifle such as a .22, in your house, provided it is in a locked gun cabinet.But I am not absolutely sure about this.

Well, I don't think it is a good thing for society for anyone, criminal or otherwise, to be shot and killed. But I was referring to the danger to the home owner from an armed robber, and the danger to the public, from a shootout between police and criminals.The statistics quoted were extrapolated from figures on this site -http://www.guncite.com/gun_control_gcgvinco.html(Figures were given per 100,000 people, but the figure for Britain was so small, I extrapolated them to a million.)As this thread is about the desirability, or otherwise, of gun control, I have only researched sites which dealt with gun-related crime. I am not trying to demonstrate that the USA is a lawless society, I am only commenting on the comparative incidence of firearm homicides between to extremes. The USA, where firearms are readily available within the law, and Great Britain, where hand guins are well-nigh impossible to obtain legally.The fact that you are 57 times more likely to be killed by someone with a firearm in the US, than in the UK, cannot be completely discounted in this discussion. All these statistics are on a per capita basis, so the comparative populations are irrelevant.I know I am not going to change the mind of any gun-toting American, and you are entitled to your opinion. But please do not insult the intelligence of the civilised world, by suggesting that a higher incidence of firearms makes for a safer society.Leo

One can debate the gun , no gun issue, until the moon turns to sand and to me , it is quite a moot debate . I am a gun owner, I grew up way out in the country with guns behind every door in the old house I was raised in . I was taught gun safety the old fashion way and with the simplest of instruction regarding the handling of a firearm. That one line instruction was: DO NOT point the muzzle , loaded or not, at ANYTHING you do not want to DIE. One sentence of instruction, and it lasted me 42 years without a gun mishap yet. I hunted game from the time I was 9 , stop killing animals when I reached 30, and started shooting paper competively, and found that to be more fun. I dont shoot anymore, but have most of my guns still in the house, and I am very passionate about them and the privilege of getting to own them in my home country (USA) . ..At 52 years old now, I will say this about guns . IF FOR THE SAKE of not one more person ever being hurt or killed by a firearm , and IF ALL the guns in the whole WORLD could be tossed in to the ocean tommorrow, and NEVER again another one could be made, I would load all of my guns on that gun dumping boat today. But people, that scenario is NOT EVER going to happen in this world, SO in light of that, I prefer to remain armed in a society that has deemed money and self imposed power, more sacred than human life. all jmo

If that doesn't count in your opinion, then why does homocide rates? Both show numbers between societies with differing amounts of firearms ownership.Those are actually low estimates, high estimates hit 2.5 million. That said, these numbers are research and supported by a number of people, one of the most popular would probably be John Lott.Why? If some comes at you a with a bat or knife and you own a firearm within easy reach, are you going to shoot or ask them to please stop? Shooting someone who makes an attempt on your life, no matter the weapon, is self-defense and you are allowed to defend yourself with a gun. Many police defend themselves from instruments other than guns with gun fire every year, and are justified.Big surprise; more guns equals more use in crime. Take them out of society, the crime proceeds as normal with new weapons. It can even increase crime because you prevent people from defending themselves and criminals loose the deterent of the home owner resisting with deadly force. Say, how's knife usage over there in the UK? Aus has already put heavy regulations on swords due to 'incidents'.Facts: Reducing guns in society does not stop crime. Crime rates in the US are declining. Crime rates in the UK and Aus are increasing.Inconvenient? Nah. Useless? Yep.

Clearly, the reason for discussing the incidence of gun related crimes, and homicide in particular, between societies with differing incidence of firearms, is to examine whether the greater incidence of firearms results in a greater incidence of firearm related crime.The comparison between the UK and the USA would appear to support the latter conclusion.You seem to be arguing that, in the USA, a high incidence of gun ownership, by virtue of its deterrent value, contributes to making it a less violent society. Accepting an already high incidence of firearm ownership, you may well be correct, but only under the particular circumstances obtaining in your society. Let us assume, for the purposes of discussion, that your assumptions are correct within American society. Can you not see that these assumptions do not apply to a society such as Great Britain, wherein gun ownership is virtually non-existent? Starting from the point that firearms are extremely rare here, extensive gun ownership would make this society, (and many others around the world,) less safe than they are now. It may have no effect upon the incidence of criminal behaviour, but an armed criminal fraternity as well as an armed population and police force, would certainly increase the incidence of lethal assault, (whether intentional or in self defence.) There are not many incidents of 'drive-by coshings, or knifings'. Are there?Furthermore, under British law, you are not entitled to use any more force than absolutely necessary to deter would be robbers and thieves. So if you shoot someone who is in the process of breaking into your home, you will be charged with either manslaughter or assault, depending upon whether you kill or merely injure him. Similarly, if you shoot and kill someone who is attacking you, but unarmed with a lethal weapon, you will be charged with manslaughter at the very least, and are liable to be charged with murder. Reasonable force is all that British law allows to be employed.There was a case some years ago of a farmer who lay in wait, with a hunting shotgun, for a group of teenagers who were breaking into his home. He waited until they had actually broken in, and then shot and injured one of them. He went to gaol for a very long time.I am sorry, but I haven't the foggiest idea of who John Lott is! But what I am questioning is the methodology employed to estimate crimes which might have been committed. Such estimates can only be a matter of surmise.A correct assumption, in the event that you have a firearm to hand. And such action would be supported by any court of law, provided that it was obvious that the assailant intended taking your life. Under British law, you would have to prove his intention to kill you, beyond any reasonable doubt. Not always an easy task, given that the victim is dead and cannot testify to his intention. The weapon utilised would have to be of an unequivocally lethal nature, and you would have to prove not only his intention, but his ability to do you lethal harm. An attack with a deadly weapon is a crime under our law, but it is not automatically equated with the intention to commit murder. Furthermore, as I am sure you are aware, the British police do not carry firearms, and they defend themselves equally well against attacks from criminals armed with lethal weapons. The difference lies in the fact that fewer criminals, and policemen, are shot dead in the UK. Surely this is a preferable situation?Mirabile Dictu! We may actually agree upon at least one point! :) Yes, more guns do equal a greater incidence of firearms in crime. Thank you for making my point for me. :) I also take your point about the deterrent effect of armed home owners upon those intent upon burglary. As for knife usage in the UK, I am not sure quite what you are implying. Britain is not known as a violent society, and certainly not known for knife related assault. So I suspect that implication was a case of clutching at straws.As for Australia and swords, I can only assume you are joking. Australia is a highly developed modern society, and at no time in its history has the sword been a weapon of choice. The number of even ceremonial swords extant in Austra;ian society would be negligible. I know of the legislation to which you are referring, which came about as a reaction to one ioncident, and was simply a part of a larger crackdown on all weapons which could prove lethal. The idea that Australians are charging about the place weilding broadswords is more than a little fanciful.No! That is opinion. Something to which you are entitled, but do not confuse it with fact. Be that as it may, I have not, at any stage, contended that reducing the number of firearms in society has an effect upon the overall incidence of crime. I do, however, contend that an increase in the number has the effect of increasing the incidence of firearms used in the committing of crimes, something with which you have agreed in an earlier paragraph.Again, that is a matter of somewhat convenient opinion. I have seen no statistics or evidence to support those contentions. During a recent holiday in the USA, I saw the Bronx and Harlem. So let us not hear about how violent are the societies of Great Britain and Australia!Leo

If that doesn't count in your opinion, then why does homocide rates? Both show numbers between societies with differing amounts of firearms ownership.Those are actually low estimates, high estimates hit 2.5 million. That said, these numbers are research and supported by a number of people, one of the most popular would probably be John Lott.Why? If some comes at you a with a bat or knife and you own a firearm within easy reach, are you going to shoot or ask them to please stop? Shooting someone who makes an attempt on your life, no matter the weapon, is self-defense and you are allowed to defend yourself with a gun. Many police defend themselves from instruments other than guns with gun fire every year, and are justified.Big surprise; more guns equals more use in crime. Take them out of society, the crime proceeds as normal with new weapons. It can even increase crime because you prevent people from defending themselves and criminals loose the deterent of the home owner resisting with deadly force. Say, how's knife usage over there in the UK? Aus has already put heavy regulations on swords due to 'incidents'.Facts: Reducing guns in society does not stop crime. Crime rates in the US are declining. Crime rates in the UK and Aus are increasing.Inconvenient? Nah. Useless? Yep.

Actually it does. Following your same pattern, inversed, you could surmise that the lack of guns leads to a higher amount of violent crime. One argument is just as legitimate as the other with the numbers provided.I'm not saying what works here will work there, but if you can make assumptions based off numbers, the same ones can be made right back at your society. Neither really addresses why the numbers are what they are, even the best researchers haven't figured that out. But if you proved firearms increase the crime rate, you would be the first to do so. Can't say I've ever seen a drive by myself, but they are rare when it comes to crime. Most confrontations happen within 7 yards according to statistics, this what police and self-defense instructors train for. A knife is very lethal at that range and is of utmost concern for police, because your typical bullet-resistant vest won't stop a knife.This isn't the UK. In the US, you have a right to protect yourself and your family. My state constitution specifically grants me the right to firearms for self-defense. If the person breaks into your house and had the means to kill you, chances are in a shooting that you will get the benefit of the doubt in a court case because they broke into your house and started the confrontation. Many people are killed with hands and feet every year, they are lethal devices if used in such a capacity, especially to an old person or a female of small stature. Other weapons offer varying degrees of lethality that only get greater with use.You can clearly see that wasn't self-defense.http://www.johnrlott.com/Not when it comes to protecting my family since there are no police where I live. You have to remember, the US populat is approximately 50% in a rural area with no police force. Our police are also no responsible for our welfare, they are there to enforce the law and act after a crime has taken place. Too late if it was your murder. Police deaths in the US only number around 300 or less I believe, not a large number by any means.Might want to look into that. I've talked to other people from the UK who seem to run into knives a lot more than anything else. Heck, there is even a group over there trying to get all knives carried on your person banned (you did know this right?). You get a lengthy sentence for anything with a blade over 3", and a slap on the wrist for possesing a 3" or less blade. I'd hate to see the looks on their face when they found out my Remington pocket knige had two 4" blades.How does passing a law on one incident, limited to swords, crack down on other crimes? Seems like an excuse for further government controls rather than something useful to society.Try finding some evidence that contradicts my "opinion", if you find it you'll have made history. Once again, when firearms aren't available, criminals find other means of causing crime. Otherwise, how did crime exist before the late middle ages?You just visited two of the most gun regulated areas in the US. Guns are basically banned in those areas, but that doesn't seem to stop their use. Now, try traveling somewhere south to Virginia or even my home of Kentucky. We have some of the laxest gun laws in the nation, but violence is relatively rare.

how are there 4% of homes with firearme, my understanding is that the laws require all privetly owned guns to be stored at a "shooting club", and can not be at your home.

Since I am a true anti-car-battery-crusader, I cannot be convinced that people kill people. That would be an admission that there is something evil that exists in violent people. We're all equal, right? The crack dealer, cop-killer, I, and the lawful car battery owner are all the same, except we don't all have access to car batteries. The lawful car battery owner will sooner or later become a killer. (still tongue in cheek, of course)Consider this:Tonya Harding was such a sweet little skater until she was arrested for assault. Last year, I think? She whacked her ex in the head with a hubcap. That just goes to show you- leave a hubcap sitting around the house long enough, sooner or later someone will be assaulted with it. Who keeps a hubcap lying around the livingroom anyway????? There's gotta be a "you might be a redneck if..." joke in there somewhere.I wonder if this really is true. I'd like to see if there is a causal relationship between the number of salvage car parts in the home, and violence. The VPC should check this out.

From the BBC world news service @http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4581871.stmDoctors' kitchen knives ban call  Doctors say knives are too pointedA&E doctors are calling for a ban on long pointed kitchen knives to reduce deaths from stabbing. A team from West Middlesex University Hospital said violent crime is on the increase - and kitchen knives are used in as many as half of all stabbings. They argued many assaults are committed impulsively, prompted by alcohol and drugs, and a kitchen knife often makes an all too available weapon. The research is published in the British Medical Journal. The researchers said there was no reason for long pointed knives to be publicly available at all. They consulted 10 top chefs from around the UK, and found such knives have little practical value in the kitchen. None of the chefs felt such knives were essential, since the point of a short blade was just as useful when a sharp end was needed. The researchers said a short pointed knife may cause a substantial superficial wound if used in an assault - but is unlikely to penetrate to inner organs. Kitchen knives can inflict appalling woundsIn contrast, a pointed long blade pierces the body like "cutting into a ripe melon". The use of knives is particularly worrying amongst adolescents, say the researchers, reporting that 24% of 16-year-olds have been shown to carry weapons, primarily knives. The study found links between easy access to domestic knives and violent assault are long established. French laws in the 17th century decreed that the tips of table and street knives be ground smooth. A century later, forks and blunt-ended table knives were introduced in the UK in an effort to reduce injuries during arguments in public eating houses. The researchers say legislation to ban the sale of long pointed knives would be a key step in the fight against violent crime. "The Home Office is looking for ways to reduce knife crime. "We suggest that banning the sale of long pointed knives is a sensible and practical measure that would have this effect."Government response  Home Office spokesperson said there were already extensive restrictions in place to control the sale and possession of knives. "The law already prohibits the possession of offensive weapons in a public place, and the possession of knives in public without good reason or lawful authority, with the exception of a folding pocket knife with a blade not exceeding three inches. "Offensive weapons are defined as any weapon designed or adapted to cause injury, or intended by the person possessing them to do so.

"[Only isn't the classic line "guns don't kill people, people kill people"? Therefore: yours should read in reverse.....]"Nope. Since I am a true anti-car-battery-crusader, I cannot be convinced that people kill people. That would be an admission that there is something evil that exists in violent people. We're all equal, right? The crack dealer, cop-killer, I, and the lawful car battery owner are all the same, except we don't all have access to car batteries. The lawful car battery owner will sooner or later become a killer. (still tongue in cheek, of course)Consider this:Tonya Harding was such a sweet little skater until she was arrested for assault. Last year, I think? She whacked her ex in the head with a hubcap. That just goes to show you- leave a hubcap sitting around the house long enough, sooner or later someone will be assaulted with it. Who keeps a hubcap lying around the livingroom anyway????? There's gotta be a "you might be a redneck if..." joke in there somewhere.I wonder if this really is true. I'd like to see if there is a causal relationship between the number of salvage car parts in the home, and violence. The VPC should check this out.

I'm surprised the current administration hasn't seized the opportunity to spawn another giant bureaucracy in their quest to expand government control - knife registration. Banned on airliners, a close ally (UK) calling for it and Muslims having access to them could easily be used as rationalization.

From the BBC world news service @http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4581871.stmDoctors' kitchen knives ban call  Doctors say knives are too pointedA&E doctors are calling for a ban on long pointed kitchen knives to reduce deaths from stabbing. A team from West Middlesex University Hospital said violent crime is on the increase - and kitchen knives are used in as many as half of all stabbings. They argued many assaults are committed impulsively, prompted by alcohol and drugs, and a kitchen knife often makes an all too available weapon. The research is published in the British Medical Journal. The researchers said there was no reason for long pointed knives to be publicly available at all. They consulted 10 top chefs from around the UK, and found such knives have little practical value in the kitchen. None of the chefs felt such knives were essential, since the point of a short blade was just as useful when a sharp end was needed. The researchers said a short pointed knife may cause a substantial superficial wound if used in an assault - but is unlikely to penetrate to inner organs. Kitchen knives can inflict appalling woundsIn contrast, a pointed long blade pierces the body like "cutting into a ripe melon". The use of knives is particularly worrying amongst adolescents, say the researchers, reporting that 24% of 16-year-olds have been shown to carry weapons, primarily knives. The study found links between easy access to domestic knives and violent assault are long established. French laws in the 17th century decreed that the tips of table and street knives be ground smooth. A century later, forks and blunt-ended table knives were introduced in the UK in an effort to reduce injuries during arguments in public eating houses. The researchers say legislation to ban the sale of long pointed knives would be a key step in the fight against violent crime. "The Home Office is looking for ways to reduce knife crime. "We suggest that banning the sale of long pointed knives is a sensible and practical measure that would have this effect."Government response  Home Office spokesperson said there were already extensive restrictions in place to control the sale and possession of knives. "The law already prohibits the possession of offensive weapons in a public place, and the possession of knives in public without good reason or lawful authority, with the exception of a folding pocket knife with a blade not exceeding three inches. "Offensive weapons are defined as any weapon designed or adapted to cause injury, or intended by the person possessing them to do so. "An individual has to demonstrate that he had good reason to possess a knife, for example for fishing, other sporting purposes or as part of his profession (e.g. a chef) in a public place. "The manufacture, sale and importation of 17 bladed, pointed and other offensive weapons have been banned, in addition to flick knives and gravity knives." A spokesperson for the Association of Chief Police Officers said: "ACPO supports any move to reduce the number of knife related incidents, however, it is important to consider the practicalities of enforcing such changes."

short bladed knives were used to kill 2500 people in the u.s. in sept, 2001. Oughta ban those too. Didn't they ban knives in ancient China? I read somewhere they were allowed one knife per village, or something like that.

Whenever people bring up the crime differential between the US and the UK, I'm reminded of the fact that 100 years ago, neither country regulated firearms at all.Yet the US had a higher murder rate.Basically we've always had a higher murder rate, even when guns were as easy to obtain in the US as the UK.Here are a couple of interesting posts that seem relevant.http://posseincitatus.typepad.com/po...ed_crimin.htmlhttp://posseincitatus.typepad.com/po...gnificanc.htmlI also think Leo's got a rather strange fixation on firearms. What does it matter if you are more likely to die from a gunshot in the US than in the UK? Dead is dead.You're more likely to die in an auto accident in either country.As has been pointed out before, most US crime is concentrated in urban areas and it is often criminals killing other criminals.I actually agree that the UK shouldn't immediately go to a wide open gun ownership society simply because its people are ready to handle the responsibility of gun ownership. It would have to be a gradual process of reversing their loss of rights.But I think it would help lower crime rates and increase the safety of the British people in general.

Something that people on this thread might find interesting.It's a scatter chart comparing the rate of homicides per 10,000 people to the percentage of homes containing firearms.It quite clearly indicates that the volume of firearms is not at all related to the rate of homicide.Who'd a thunk it?

For those who argue that in the U.S. more guns = more gun violence….See the latest 10 year survey of firearm violence statistics conducted by your government:http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/guns.htm#findingsThis is a sample of what you would find:“Firearm-related crime has plummeted since 1993.”“Nonfatal firearm crime rates have declined since 1994, reaching the lowest level ever recorded in 2002 and 2003.” ”After 1994, the proportion of nonfatal violent incidents involving a firearm declined.”“Incidents involving a firearm represented 7% of the 4.9 million violent crimes of rape and sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated and simple assault.”Now compare this trend of decline in firearm-related violence with the following ATF website, which lists new firearms manufactured for sale by domestic firearms manufacturers from 1998 to 2003 (the latest years available):http://www.atf.treas.gov/firearms/stats/index.htmFrom 98 to 2003, 19,185,247 new firearms were produced for consumer retail in the U.S. by domestic firearms manufacturers. Of these, 5,098,722 were handguns. I can’t say how many were produced from 1993 to 1997, because the web page stats only went back to 1998. Yet, if you look at the year to year stats from 1998 to 2003, you will see a markedly similar number of firearms produced each year by categories of handgun, rifle, and shotgun, which strongly suggests the number of newly available firearms each year from 1993 to 1997 increased at near the same rate. [note: a very small percentage of these firearms were exported out of our market, but likewise this survey does not include the larger number of firearms imported to our market from abroad. Additionally, these statistics exclude NFA controlled firearms like the weapons which were produced for military/law enforcement and not civilian consumption)When you set these two surveys side by side, what you see is this:In the last ten year study, we had a marked decline in firearm violence during a period in which we added millions of new firearms to those available for criminal mischief--nearly 20 million new firearms alone from 1998 to 2003. How then do we square the argument that more guns = more gun violence with these studies?

Frankly I think banning guns outright in America may not work. The culture of violence is too strong.But if it can be slowly reduced, there are straightforward advantages. In countries where burglars don't believe they will be shot are less likely to eliminate the houseowner or carry the means to do so. Also, while we have police marksmen in Britain they are specially deployed and strictly controlled, unlike the problems highlighted on http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory...otings/2698952 where 1/3 people shot in a certain area were unarmed.There were also 800 fatal accidental shootings in 1998 http://www.enotes.com/guns-crime/

Lets see... Less likely chance of being eliminated, but more burglaries or less burglaries and people being harmed in general... I'll pick the latter! You do know the UK has higher crime rates than the US, right? We just have higher homocide rates.

This statement implies that there is a gun control success story out there somewhere. If there is, I haven't seen it.If you look at the UK, it's violent crime levels were lower before Britain adopted gun control. As it has grown tighter, crime has in fact increased.I'm not going to say that one led to the other, but please don't claim that gun control has made the UK safer.What, helpless victims? Governments free to starve their citizens to death at will?When someone says something like that, one would expect facts to back them up. In fact they do the opposite.A British household is far more likely to be targeted for break-in while the occupants are home than the US. In fact, most burglars in the US flee when they realize someone is home - and they very rarely stick around for a shootout of the homeowner is armed.Criminals are cowards, pure and simple, that's why they strike at night.What does this have to do with gun control?Which means what...?If we ban swimming pools we will save far more lives. People die of lots of things and with 300 million Americans, you can get a big, scary number on almost any topic if you try hard enough.People do a lot of stupid things and when they do, death often results.What I find interesting is that guns are getting safer every year, in fact the number of fatal firearms accidents is reaching all-time lows.Yet the number of guns out there is at a record high. How do you square the two?

Yes. It is true. This truth is evidenced in part by the FACT that Kennesaw, Georgia USA has a lower crime rate than the rest of the country. In Kennesaw, the law is that every home must have a working firearm. Criminals evidently know this.

Personally, I have no problem with the criminal being possibly shot and killed by either the homeowner or the police. Mine showing us where you got your numbers from? Also, feel free to display crime rates (not just guns) as well. You'll find that while we have higher homocide rates, all incidents of robbery, assault, rape, etc. are less likely in the US. Also, a survey of prison inmates by the DoJ found that an overwhelming percent of inmates were less likely to break into a home if they thought the owner had a gun.

You may be jumping the gun on that one. There could easily be a host of factors that cause low crime rates, such as higher property values, good education system, properly funded police, good social services, a number of things. Having a high gun ownership ratio may merely be a part of why crime is low, it may not be the reason.

NOt that they are more likely to break in.the reason our police don't carry guns and use them so much is because the criminals don't carry guns, because they're illegal and because they don't need them to fight against citizens with guns.If you get yourself drowned its your problem. Not so if you shoot someone. People do stupid things and so shouldn't have guns if they can't use them responsibly.The fact that guns are getting safer doesn't mean they're not dangerous. Modern cars may pollute less, but that doesn't mean cutting the amount of cars wouldn't help too.

Not quite. The UK and the US has very similar gun laws a century ago. The UK has only in the last 20 years attempted to ban almost all civilian firearms.If gun control works, one would expect those to be the most peaceful, low-crime decades, right?However, one finds that the opposite is true: As gun control was imposed, crime continued to rise.One cannot necessarily argue that gun control caused the rise in crime, but one can assert that it failed to stop it.No, it is not the "only reason," but it does make it a lot easier.Access to arms is what differentiates citizens from subjects. It is interesting to note that in the US, the ability to own guns and full citizenship rights have paralleled each other.Blacks were not really full citizens until they could own guns - and it was their ownership of guns that helped reinforce the need to redress the wrongs inflicted on them.In the face of a terroristic attacks and a racist and unresponsive police force, it was armed black Americans who policed and protected themselves.It's a fascinating theory, but it doesn't work for several reasons.The first is that a criminal with a gun is equal to  a citizen with a gun. Criminals hate equality. The last thing they want is to engage in a shootout, which is why most criminals flee when confronted with a gun (and "most" in this case means in excess of 95 percent of the time).In a gunless society, by contrast, a criminal with a gun gains superiority. He need not care if the victims are home or not because he has a gun and they don't.Again, this is probably why British homes are more likely to be attacked when someone is home than American ones.Furthermore, your argument is predicated on the assumption that because law-abiding citizens have easy access to firearms in the US, criminals do as well.Yet evidence shows this is not the case. Operation Falcon  netted more than 10,000 felons, many of them wanted for violent crimes. Despite the fact that these were in many ways the elite, the hard core of the criminal world, only 243 firearms were recovered.Think about that for a second. You have a huge cross section of the criminal world - exactly the people who would find guns most useful, yet they were outgunned by private citizens by around 25 to 1.That is half of Americans own guns, but only 1 in 25 criminals do.Now if you disarm law-abiding Americans, the ration shifts to equality - a situation that therefore favors the criminal.The UK has aways been less violent than the US, even when both countries has the same gun laws.What is interesting is that the UK is getting more violent and more of its police are carry guns. Do you dispute this?What about if you drown someone else?Right, so you want to punish millions for the actions of the very very few. How utterly unreasonable.Lots of things are dangerous. Knives are dangerous, too. So are hammers, power tools and even swimming pools.That is why one must use reason and a sense of proportion in evaluation how to deal with certain problems.Gun accidents are, statistically speaking, a non-issue. Most involve guns that were handled in an inappropriate way. That is no reason to deprive millions of people of their possessions.Furthermore, guns prevent hundreds of thousands if not millions of crimes.If you want to crunch numbers, you will find few items with a stronger cost-benefit ration in their favor.Unless it's your car that someone else wants to take away.

Overally crime has fallen in recent years, and as we started restricting guns before they were often used in crime (100 years ago, they were less reliable and more expensive) its not all that comparable.I don't think that the UK today needs vigilantiasm to protect itself or that the government will starve the people. But maybe the US has bigger problems with such things.And obviously if citizens can own guns and it has symbolic meaning in America (as Homer Simpson says, without it the King of England can come and boss you around), then it will be co0nnected to citizenship.But the equality of two unarmed people tends to lead to no death, unlike the probability of two armed people. And the fact they found no guns didn't mean they weren't there. And criminals in Britain rarely carry guns, particularly burglars.Violent crime is rising for various social reasons. The guns of police are still much more controlled than the US.Possible, but usually you swim in a pool, while usually you don't shoot guns at yourself but other people/things.No, it was a reaction to 'people do stupid things' in the previous post. I was puzzled by this being said by someone wanting to give said people weaponry.None of those things are as dangerous as guns. Stabbing people to death is possible but a lot more psychologically difficult than pulling a trigger. Could teenagers slaughter dozens of pupils and teachers with a knife?The fact guns were handled in an 'inappropriate' way is implied by the fact that they accidentally kill someone. It doesn't justify it.Prove that guns prevent that many crimes.I don't have a car. I might have to get one, because the public transport system is underfunded because of the assumption people use cars. If we raised taxes on cars, lessened the numbers and spent more on public transport it would be far more efficient in terms of money and environment.

Really? If crime is so much lower, why are more cops carrying guns and why are cameras sprouting up all over the UK?The right to self-defense has nothing to do with vigilantism - unless you think the state is supposed to intervene in every shove, bar fight and other inconvenience you may experience.You make a lot of assumptions there, none of them backed up by any evidence.For example, do rapists need to kill their victims to succeed? That seems to be your implication. For me (and I think most people) I would rather that my wife, daughters and female friends shot and killed an attacker than that they be raped.What, all 10,000 hid them so cleverly that it was beyond the ability of state, local and federal law enforcement officers to find them? Please.From what I read in the press, though, the number of armed criminals is growing, not falling. Particularly in demand are replica pistols and "reactivated" ones.But it is true that in the UK criminals don't need to have a firearm since all their victims are disarmed and therefore at their mercy. An iron bar will do just as well and I have seen no evidence that British thugs are particularly sqeamish about using violence to accomplish their ends.I suggest you deal with the social reasons then and leave guns alone.So people who accidentally kill themselves in a pool's lives are worth less?And once again, you are arguing minute numbers. For every life taken in a gun accident, hundreds of crimes are stopped. Even the most conservative numbers you can find shows a ratio of 80 to 1.Indeed, and I see no need to protect people from themselves because it can't be done.You cannot require people to put away all the sharp pointed things in their house, rubberize their bath tub or accident-proof their car.You want to deal with a social problem by blaming an object. It doesn't work.But true to form, the UK is trying knife control because banning guns didn't make crime go away.It has happened.More to the point, 30 years ago it was legal in the US to buy an M-1 Garand through the mail without proof of age. Many schools had rifle clubs and kids openly brought guns to school to show and trade.Amazingly, school shootings were unknown.In fact, of all the school shootings in the US, none of them were perpetrated by kids who actually owned their own guns and passed a firearms safety class - all of them were stolen or appropriated in some way.Banning or controlling guns merely turns them into desireable objects of forbidden power. The way you deal with sick kids is to treat them, not try to reorder society as a mental institution.Any object that is misused can kill, and many objects kill more people and more easily than guns.Guns require safe handling, but it is remarkably simple to avoid accidents. Treat every gun as if it was loaded, point it in a safe direction and keep your figure off the trigger until you are ready to shoot.There, you just prevented almost all firearms related accidents.I will point out that if you are around someone who doesn't know how to handle a gun you are STUPID and deserve what you get.I have watched newbies pick up a gun and point it in the wrong place. The response from seasoned shooters is immediate and forceful.So yes, people who get hit often deserve what they get, just as people who clown around in and around swimming pools can expect to die.If guns caused accidents and death simply by their mere presence, the two most dangerous places in the world would be shooting clubs and gun shows. Funny, they are among the safest places out there.http://www.guncite.com/gun_control_gcdguse.htmlOnce again you miss the point: No one should be deprived of rights because of the actions of a very small criminal minority.Speech can be used to incite hatred and death, in fact there's a pretty solid track record of hateful speech killing lots of people in Europe in particular.Does this mean we should embrace state control over everything written, broadcast or spoken?

But maybe the US has bigger problems with such things.And obviously if citizens can own guns and it has symbolic meaning in America (as Homer Simpson says, without it the King of England can come and boss you around), then it will be co0nnected to citizenship.But the equality of two unarmed people tends to lead to no death, unlike the probability of two armed people. And the fact they found no guns didn't mean they weren't there. And criminals in Britain rarely carry guns, particularly burglars.Violent crime is rising for various social reasons. The guns of police are still much more controlled than the US.Possible, but usually you swim in a pool, while usually you don't shoot guns at yourself but other people/things.No, it was a reaction to 'people do stupid things' in the previous post. I was puzzled by this being said by someone wanting to give said people weaponry.None of those things are as dangerous as guns. Stabbing people to death is possible but a lot more psychologically difficult than pulling a trigger. Could teenagers slaughter dozens of pupils and teachers with a knife?The fact guns were handled in an 'inappropriate' way is implied by the fact that they accidentally kill someone. It doesn't justify it.Prove that guns prevent that many crimes.I don't have a car. I might have to get one, because the public transport system is underfunded because of the assumption people use cars. If we raised taxes on cars, lessened the numbers and spent more on public transport it would be far more efficient in terms of money and environment.

According to statistics from the British Crime Survey that I have seen, crime has been going down in the UK in recent years. And those numbers from guncite seem doubtful because there are other studies that give much, much lower estimates of guns being used to stop crime. That fact is that the UK has a lower murder rate than the US so I don't see how guns have made the US safer. You might argue that guns are inanimate objects, but inanimate objects can help people accomplish certain things. Glasses help people to see better.

Really? If crime is so much lower, why are more cops carrying guns and why are cameras sprouting up all over the UK?The right to self-defense has nothing to do with vigilantism - unless you think the state is supposed to intervene in every shove, bar fight and other inconvenience you may experience.You make a lot of assumptions there, none of them backed up by any evidence.For example, do rapists need to kill their victims to succeed? That seems to be your implication. For me (and I think most people) I would rather that my wife, daughters and female friends shot and killed an attacker than that they be raped.What, all 10,000 hid them so cleverly that it was beyond the ability of state, local and federal law enforcement officers to find them? Please.From what I read in the press, though, the number of armed criminals is growing, not falling. Particularly in demand are replica pistols and "reactivated" ones.But it is true that in the UK criminals don't need to have a firearm since all their victims are disarmed and therefore at their mercy. An iron bar will do just as well and I have seen no evidence that British thugs are particularly sqeamish about using violence to accomplish their ends.I suggest you deal with the social reasons then and leave guns alone.So people who accidentally kill themselves in a pool's lives are worth less?And once again, you are arguing minute numbers. For every life taken in a gun accident, hundreds of crimes are stopped. Even the most conservative numbers you can find shows a ratio of 80 to 1.Indeed, and I see no need to protect people from themselves because it can't be done.You cannot require people to put away all the sharp pointed things in their house, rubberize their bath tub or accident-proof their car.You want to deal with a social problem by blaming an object. It doesn't work.But true to form, the UK is trying knife control because banning guns didn't make crime go away.It has happened.More to the point, 30 years ago it was legal in the US to buy an M-1 Garand through the mail without proof of age. Many schools had rifle clubs and kids openly brought guns to school to show and trade.Amazingly, school shootings were unknown.In fact, of all the school shootings in the US, none of them were perpetrated by kids who actually owned their own guns and passed a firearms safety class - all of them were stolen or appropriated in some way.Banning or controlling guns merely turns them into desireable objects of forbidden power. The way you deal with sick kids is to treat them, not try to reorder society as a mental institution.Any object that is misused can kill, and many objects kill more people and more easily than guns.Guns require safe handling, but it is remarkably simple to avoid accidents. Treat every gun as if it was loaded, point it in a safe direction and keep your figure off the trigger until you are ready to shoot.There, you just prevented almost all firearms related accidents.I will point out that if you are around someone who doesn't know how to handle a gun you are STUPID and deserve what you get.I have watched newbies pick up a gun and point it in the wrong place. The response from seasoned shooters is immediate and forceful.So yes, people who get hit often deserve what they get, just as people who clown around in and around swimming pools can expect to die.If guns caused accidents and death simply by their mere presence, the two most dangerous places in the world would be shooting clubs and gun shows. Funny, they are among the safest places out there.http://www.guncite.com/gun_control_gcdguse.htmlOnce again you miss the point: No one should be deprived of rights because of the actions of a very small criminal minority.Speech can be used to incite hatred and death, in fact there's a pretty solid track record of hateful speech killing lots of people in Europe in particular.Does this mean we should embrace state control over everything written, broadcast or spoken?

Obvious Child & VoiceofreasonLets take a step back from this never-ending back-and-forth banter for a second and re-evaluate our positions.Do you claim that gun control, as implemented by the UK, actively reduces the homicide rate?Do you claim that more firearms, or more lax firearm control, such as exercised by the USA, actively increases the homicide rate?Without a clear position, and clear points being made to support it, no-one gets anywhere. Take a step back, outline your position, outline the facts you have that support it, and outline why you have taken this position.Please. It makes forum life so much easier for the rest of us.

That's pretty much what I've been trying to drive home. Despite the US having more guns than ever, accidents, violent crime, murder - all of these things are going down.It isn't the guns that cause crime.There are a couple of things that caught my eye, though:There was a poor choice of words on my part. Blacks didn't "police" themselves in the sense of develop their own code, enforce it and so forth. They simply acted to protect themselves from extralegal violence - lynchings and intimidation.When confronted with racists willing to kill, guns are the only way to survive. One of the little-told stories about how and why civil rights succeeded in the US was because the victims were armed and could fight back.When Malcolm X asserted that it was a choice between the ballot or the bullet, he was right. That is why I don't agree with the argument that the police make guns unnecessary: Sometimes you need guns to protect yourself from them.An amusing choice of words. Are you saying the federal government is too stupid to find the guns, or that they're lying?Or are you simply choosing to disbelieve a fact that doesn't fit with your preconceptions?Where do you get that they are thefts? Once again, you refuse to confront the facts.Some of those crimes may well be murders and rapes.When you take away guns, you disarm victims at a far greater rate than you disarm criminals. It's elemental logic.100 percent of law-abiding citizens will hand in their guns if you ban them. That is why we can them "law-abiding."You may make it harder for criminals to get guns, but a far lower percentage will be affected. Furthermore, you guarentee that criminals will gain an advantage: The ones with guns now have a monopoly, making guns something highly sought after since even the cops don't have them. That's why replica guns are the going thing.But you also make clubs, knives and bare hands more effective since old, frail or weak people can't protect themselves.The violent crime rate in the UK is already higher than that in the US. You're more likely to be mugged in London than New York.Now you can counter that you're less likely to be murdered, but even that isn't strictly true. Murders aren't equally distributed across the US. In fact, if you discount the urban nightmare, the US is actually safer than most of the world in terms of murder rate and violent crime.Hold on there. You can't blame suicides on gun availability. Other countries with far less gun ownership have far higher suicide rates. People will kill themselves with whatever is handy. Same with accidents. Anyone stupid enough to play with a loaded gun is probably stupid enough to play with a downed power line. You can't ban stupidity.Innocents bystanders killed by gun accidents are so rare as to be statistically insignificant.Yes, every death is a tragedy, but more children are drowned in buckets  than killed by guns in the US.When you advocate a policy, you can't just rely on emotionalism.So are knives, electricity and medical science.Yes, doctors kill more people than guns. Quite a bit more, actually.The problem is that you are blaming the object for failings on the part of parents and schools.If you look at the school shootings in the US, all of them were preventable. All of them should have been stopped well before they happened. These kids did everything but spray paint the date and time of their rampage on the side of the building - and in some cases they came damn close to doing that much.Nothing will stop that. If you disarm citizens, they'll steal the guns from cops, as they did in Minnesota.Blaming guns allows the real criminals to walk away and pretend the problem is solved. It isn't.It's also worth mentioning that several of those shootings were stopped by private citizens using their own guns or kids who knew enough about guns to tackle the shooter when he had to reload.One final thing: I used to buy into gun control. The problem is that it doesn't work, has never worked and will never work.In my home state we passed a shall-issue concealed carry law making it easier for people to carry concealed handguns. What do you think happened?Violent crime went down. Shocking.Maybe the law didn't do it. Maybe 100,000 more people carrying guns in their pockets didn't deter criminals or stop crime.But they didn't make it worse, which is what all the gun control people were swearing would happen.So when you frame your policy position, please explain that this inconsistency - and why concealed pistol license holders are some of the least violent people in society.

If you ban guns crime rates will not decrease. In fact crime rates will probably increase because the criminals will still use guns. Really they don't need guns., Many things will work slingshots, potato guns, throwing knives, blowguns,or air soft guns work. So do paintball guns. That me two sents. emoticonXChicken

If criminals were using these weapons it would be preferable to guns. Guns make it easier to kill. According to statistics, victims are less likely to die if their attackers are armed with knives rather than guns. I think that's why the US generally has a higher homicide rate than other nations in the developed world. Criminals here are much more likely to use guns when committing a crime. And that's because they have greater access to guns in the US.

Though guns may not be the cause of crime, I think they make crime more deadly. I'm not sure about if violent crime and murder are falling in the US. If that's true then you could reasonably ask if the violent crime and murder would have fallen faster without guns. You may be more likely to be mugged, but your mugger is less likely to be armed. And thus you have a greater chance of escaping with your life. We can hypothesize about all sorts of scenarios. We could hypothesize that if guns are banned then law abiding citizens who usually didn't carry or own guns before the ban will be less likely to face armed opponents. Thus they will have a greater advantage than before. However, I think if you look at the empirical evidence you find that the US generally has higher homicides rates than other developed nations and it's hard to prove that gun control affects non fatal crime one way or the other. Well if you don't include urban areas then you shouldn't include urban areas in other nations. However, you did that to prove your point about muggings. More correctly, people will attempt to kill themselves with what is handy. Whether they succeed in their attempt or not depends a lot on what method they use. People are much more likely to survive a suicide attempt if sleeping pills are used rather than guns. A person who takes a lot of sleeping pills may regret what they've done and may be able to call 911. But if you use a gun to kill yourself then it kind of hard to call 911 if you already have a bullet in your brain. One study done on the matter concluded that "Ready availability of firearms is associated with an increased risk of suicide in the home. Owners of firearms should weigh their reasons for keeping a gun in the home against the possibility that it might someday be used in a suicide."http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/327/7/467Hmm... doctors and guns? Using that logic it seems you could conclude that doctors are more dangerous than terrorists. But I think you have to take into consideration that many of these patients would have died anyway without medical treatment. And doctors also save lives. Stealing guns from cops? Because it happened one time you assume it will happen everytime. Evidence of this? I don't know of anyone that advocates gun control who thinks it's okay for the criminals to walk away. Sounds like a false dilemma- like you can't both support gun control and be in favor of strict penalties for criminals at the same time.

If you disarm citizens, they'll steal the guns from cops, as they did in Minnesota.Blaming guns allows the real criminals to walk away and pretend the problem is solved. It isn't.It's also worth mentioning that several of those shootings were stopped by private citizens using their own guns or kids who knew enough about guns to tackle the shooter when he had to reload.One final thing: I used to buy into gun control. The problem is that it doesn't work, has never worked and will never work.In my home state we passed a shall-issue concealed carry law making it easier for people to carry concealed handguns. What do you think happened?Violent crime went down. Shocking.Maybe the law didn't do it. Maybe 100,000 more people carrying guns in their pockets didn't deter criminals or stop crime.But they didn't make it worse, which is what all the gun control people were swearing would happen.So when you frame your policy position, please explain that this inconsistency - and why concealed pistol license holders are some of the least violent people in society.

do you have any idea how little violent crime involves guns? less than 10%. the US has violance problems, how about trying to controle the violance, not the tools.

Though guns may not be the cause of crime, I think they make crime more deadly. I'm not sure about if violent crime and murder are falling in the US. If that's true then you could reasonably ask if the violent crime and murder would have fallen faster without guns. You may be more likely to be mugged, but your mugger is less likely to be armed. And thus you have a greater chance of escaping with your life. We can hypothesize about all sorts of scenarios. We could hypothesize that if guns are banned then law abiding citizens who usually didn't carry or own guns before the ban will be less likely to face armed opponents. Thus they will have a greater advantage than before. However, I think if you look at the empirical evidence you find that the US generally has higher homicides rates than other developed nations and it's hard to prove that gun control affects non fatal crime one way or the other. Well if you don't include urban areas then you shouldn't include urban areas in other nations. However, you did that to prove your point about muggings. More correctly, people will attempt to kill themselves with what is handy. Whether they succeed in their attempt or not depends a lot on what method they use. People are much more likely to survive a suicide attempt if sleeping pills are used rather than guns. A person who takes a lot of sleeping pills may regret what they've done and may be able to call 911. But if you use a gun to kill yourself then it kind of hard to call 911 if you already have a bullet in your brain. One study done on the matter concluded that "Ready availability of firearms is associated with an increased risk of suicide in the home. Owners of firearms should weigh their reasons for keeping a gun in the home against the possibility that it might someday be used in a suicide."http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/327/7/467Hmm... doctors and guns? Using that logic it seems you could conclude that doctors are more dangerous than terrorists. But I think you have to take into consideration that many of these patients would have died anyway without medical treatment. And doctors also save lives. Stealing guns from cops? Because it happened one time you assume it will happen everytime. Evidence of this? I don't know of anyone that advocates gun control who thinks it's okay for the criminals to walk away. Sounds like a false dilemma- like you can't both support gun control and be in favor of strict penalties for criminals at the same time.

on this topic, I think pretty much if you want to hurt/kill someone with no regard as to whether you get away with it or not, unfortunately you can probably do it. Possible exceptions are people like the President, with so much security. banning guns will not help, as they will either get them illegally, or use another tool such as a knife or even a car. Running someone over could do just as much as a gun.The one problem I see is spontaneous anger. Someone erupts in a fit of rage, has a temporary lapse of judgement, and kills someone. But in my opinion that's not enough to ban it, especially since we shouldn't punish people who wouldn't do that simply because some people may lose their temper. We punish people for committing crimes, not for having a chance to commit a crime.

But most murders are committed with guns. So if you think it's important to reduce the murder rate, I don't think that guns can be ignored. Well, that seems to be a very subjective understanding of punishment. If gun control laws decrease our chances of being murdered then I don't think these laws are punishing us. They are protecting and helping us. Afterall, people leave the state of nature and enter a civilized society because they recognize that the government can better protect their rights than they can.

I’ve posted this before, but since it seems to fit the current topic on this thread I’ll chime in again on it.In my opinion, there are fundamental problems with cross-national/cultural comparisons of firearm homicide rates. I believe you really are talking about apples and oranges when we try to do this. You can’t compare the Netherlands or England, for example, with the United States and draw any logical conclusions without considering the vast difference in social and economic issues which drive the violence rates. The same problem arises when those on my side of the debate try to compare America with Switzerland, which has an extraordinarily high percentage of private gun owners while enjoying an extraordinarily low violent crime rate. You can’t compare these nation’s crime rates with America’s because the social and economic issues which drive violent crime in these countries are different. If you compare violent crime statistics from these nations, you will see that America has a much higher violent crime rate then these other nations, whether a firearm is involved or not. We do not have a gun violence problem in America, we have a violence problem in general, and the presence of the weapon does not give rise to the motive to use it for criminal ends. There are no evil little voices calling from the gun cabinet to plague American homeowners. England and the Netherlands have not avoided these sinister voices advocating gun violence with a ban on guns. The people of Switzerland are not collectively so hard of hearing that they have proven immune to the subliminal demands of their guns to be loaded and unleashed on the innocent.I have seen people on my side of the debate argue that if a crime rate drops after a state passes a CCW statute then the deterrent effect of armed citizens must be responsible for the drop. Listen, I am as strong a supporter of the individual RKBA as there is, but I cannot find sufficient evidence to prove that crime rates go down just because we pass a CCW bill. It’s the same problem gun control proponents have: we all want to believe what we want to believe, and we are prepared to claim that a statistical correlation equals cause and effect when it suits our purpose. What I do know, however, is that the overall violent crime rate in America is not tied to the number of privately available firearms. More guns does not equal more violence. Here is why I say this:First see the latest 10 year survey of firearm violence statistics conducted by your government:http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/guns.htm#findingsThis is a sample of what you would find:“Firearm-related crime has plummeted since 1993.”“Nonfatal firearm crime rates have declined since 1994, reaching the lowest level ever recorded in 2002 and 2003.” ”After 1994, the proportion of nonfatal violent incidents involving a firearm declined.”“Incidents involving a firearm represented 7% of the 4.9 million violent crimes of rape and sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated and simple assault.”Now compare this trend of decline in firearm-related violence with the following ATF website, which lists new firearms manufactured for sale by domestic firearms manufacturers from 1998 to 2003 (the latest years available):http://www.atf.treas.gov/firearms/stats/index.htmFrom 98 to 2003, 19,185,247 new firearms were produced for consumer retail in the U.S. by domestic firearms manufacturers. Of these, 5,098,722 were handguns. I can’t say how many were produced from 1993 to 1997, because the web page stats only went back to 1998. Yet, if you look at the year to year stats from 1998 to 2003, you will see a markedly similar number of firearms produced each year by categories of handgun, rifle, and shotgun, which strongly suggests the number of newly available firearms each year from 1993 to 1997 increased at near the same rate. [note: a very small percentage of these firearms were exported out of our market, but likewise this survey does not include the larger number of firearms imported to our market from abroad. Additionally, these statistics exclude NFA controlled firearms like the weapons which were produced for military/law enforcement and not civilian consumption)When you set these two surveys side by side, what you see is this:In the last ten year study, we had a marked decline in firearm violence during a period in which we added millions of new firearms to those available for criminal mischief--nearly 20 million new firearms alone from 1998 to 2003. I cannot say that millions more guns in the civilian marketplace is the cause of this crime rate drop. (in fact, I have another theory for the crime rate drop). What I can say, however, is that adding millions of new firearms to our civilian market did not cause the streets to run red.---“The right of self-defense is the first law of nature; in most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest possible limits...and [when] the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any color or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction.” Sir George Tucker, Judge of the Virginia Supreme Court and U.S. District Court of Virginia, in I Blackstone COMMENTARIES, Sir George Tucker Ed., 1803, pg. 300.“As civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens, the people are confirmed by the [second] article in their right to keep and bear private arms.” Tench Coxe, Remarks on the First Part of the Amendments to the Federal Constitution.

Gun crime is an irrelevat statistic. A gas station attendant doesn't care if he is held up by someone with a knife, a gun, or a bloodfilled syringe. A murder victim doesn't care if they were stabbed, bashed, or shot.Here in Australia, we tightened our firearms laws in 1996 as a response to a shooting spree. In 1997, the rate of armed robbery doubled. Yes, doubled. Assault, serious violent crimes, homicide and armed robbery are all at higher rates today than they were in 1995-1996. But at least the criminals aren't using guns, right?

I'm not convinced that America has a much higher violent crime rate compared to other developed nations. "Whether measured by surveys of crime victims or by police statistics, serious crime rates are not generally higher in the United States than England."http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/htm...ew96/highs.htmI don't think that anyone is arguing that guns increase the motive to commit crimes. I do think they increase the means to commit murder. If criminals are not armed with guns then their intended victims have a greater chance of escaping with their life. You can outrun a person with a knife, but try outrunning a bullet. While the total number of guns has been increasing, so has the population. To counter the argument you present above, gun control advocate David Hemenway points out that the actual percentage of the population owning guns in the US has been decreasing. More and more of the population is moving into urban areas where they feel less of a need to own a gun.

I agree to an extent, however if you can stop guns being imported or manufactured illegally, the criminals will not have any guns. In countries such as Britain where guns are banned the police are generally not doing enough to stop illegally obtained weapons. Which is why the ban is a bit of a poor compromise, they've banned guns for law abiding people but they've not done enough to make sure criminals don't have them.Basically, gun bans don't work because the police haven't done enough, therefore the ban increases crime rates.While removing the ban is one solution, another is to increase the police's efforts to crack down on guns.Of course I'm not saying it's a perfect solution, there are various problems with it just don't judge the ban when it's not properly enforced.

See, this is great stuff. Solid, well-thought-out arguments of a gun control supporter’s view from Galileo. Who says gun control supporters don’t have the spine to engage in reasonable debates on this cite which is dominated by pro-gun supporters? Bravo. This deserves a response, and I’m sorry it has taken me so long to get back to the blog.I’ve seen the study you cite comparing England’s crime rate with America’s. I believe the reason why England was compared with America was because England was a European aberration which caught up with America in some crime statistics, most notably the per capita robbery rate. The other industrialized countries do not share the across the board violent crime rate we do. The survey you cited was performed in 1998 using statistics which ended in 1996, which ended a period in which England saw a dramatic increase in certain crimes (particularly robbery) that caught it up to American crime rates. This study has been cited by gun proponents before as support for the tempting cross-national assumption that: “England severely restricts gun possession and sees a rise in robbery rates that now exceeds armed America.” But I think there are too many problems with the survey methods for my gun supporting brethren to argue anything concrete, and certainly not enough to suggest cause and effect exists from a supposed correlation. One significant fact to note from this survey is that our per capita murder rate is approximately 8 times higher than England’s. Now firearms are used in American homicides about 68% of the time according to the survey, and that sounds right because the firearm murder rate (as a percentage of total homicides) has steadily hovered in the middle to upper 60% range. Yet if you remove every single American firearm related murder from this survey (and assume that no homicide occurs due to the lack of the firearm) you still have a murder rate nearly three times that of England’s. But again, I think all comparisons are suspect for the reasons below… There is a more comprehensive survey of crime rates from 1981 to 1999, which was performed in 2004: http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/cnscj.htm. One of the issues it addresses is the difficulty of cross-national comparisons of crime rates. For example, there is no uniform definition of certain crimes in other countries, and other statistical references like victim surveys of weapons used are not uniform and vary widely in reporting methods depending on the country. In the end, I find cross national comparisons (whether cited for or against gun possession) to be suspect. In America, the increased population dilution effect theory you cite is interesting, and arguably between the 1990 and 2000 census you see a population growth of approximately 37 million compared to approximately 20 million new firearms produced. Yet I don’t think it tracks crime statistics very well. For example, see the survey released in 2000 for firearm injury and death from crime, (from years 1993 to 1997) which can be found here: http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/fidc9397.htm. Even with the steady rise in both population and available firearms, the total number (not per capita) of reported gunshot wounds from crimes fell 39% during this period. To state it otherwise, during a period in which we put millions of new firearms into the market to be purchased by an ever-increasing population, we see that the total number of crime-generated gunshot wounds drop by nearly 40%. See also the survey of the types of weapons used in violent crimes from 1993 to 2001: http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/wuvc01.htm. For the total number (not per capita) of non-fatal violent offenses, those involving use of a firearm fell 63% during this period. I don’t think we can say that the percentage of population growth during this period outpaced the percentage of newly produced firearms by 63%. And the rates of firearm-use for non-fatal violent crime remain low: For the total number (not per capita) of violent assaults/rapes/robberies that were reported during the entire survey, the percentage of those committed by a firearm wielding assailant was 8.3% for handguns and 1.2% for other firearms. By contrast, about twice that number, (16.4%), were committed by an assailant with a weapon other than a firearm, while the vast majority of these crimes, (65.9%), were committed by an unarmed assailant. (assuming, again, that victim reporting of the types of weapons used is accurate enough to be relied upon). Where firearms continue to lead the pack, however, is in the percentage of total homicides. I just don’t think we can make any assumption that more guns = more gun crime. Likewise, I don’t think we can make the deterrent argument that more guns = lower violent crime rates based upon these studies. What I can argue is that it appears the vast majority of violent crime is committed by assailants who are either unarmed or armed with a weapon other than a firearm. Common sense tells us that when such a person is confronted by a victim armed with a firearm it is the assailant who is placed at a disadvantage. ---“False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that would take fire from men because it burns, and water because one may drown in it; that has no remedy for evils, except destruction. The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity, the most important of the code, will respect the less important and arbitrary ones, which can be violated with ease and impunity, and which, if strictly obeyed, would put and end to personal liberty--so dear to men, so dear to the enlightened legislator--and subject innocent persons to all the vexations that the guilty alone ought to suffer? Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man. They ought to be designated as laws not preventative but fearful of crimes, produced by the tumultuous impression of a few isolated facts, and not by thoughtful consideration of the inconveniences and advantages of a universal decree.” Thomas Jefferson, Commonplace Book, 1774-1776, quoting 18th century criminologist Cesare Beccaria in On Crimes and Punishment, 1764

Under $100 in the us, or roughly $120 AUD despite their idiotic bans there. I don't know about in England. The only illicit weapon I have ever seen priced in England was a P228 (sig) and it was $250 (USD), which is still a couple hundred cheaper than a new one in the states. You can't put the genie back in the bottle. That being the case, guns make for a more civilized world.
