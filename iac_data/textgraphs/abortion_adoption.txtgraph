Why do women opt for abortion over adoption?

adoption

I personally opted for abortion over adoption for two main reasons.1. I had no intention to get pregnant. I faithfully took the pill, and by fiance always used a condom. Despite these precautions, we experienced that "percentage failure" of contraception. I found out I was pregnant several weeks in, and my fiance and I made our decision together.2. We had no money. We are both in college (finishing up our Masters degrees in a few weeks now), and have enormous student loan fees as well as numerous other monetary problems. Right now the most we can do is finish up school and pay to keep our apartment. Pregnancy is a very expensive thing (which is why I find it ridiculous that pro-lifers offer adoption as if it was such a great option, because adoption itself can be free, but they don't take into consideration everything before adoption), and we couldn't afford to have a child to give up for adoption let alone actually raise one.To add to the obvious costs of pregnancy, there is also the loss of pay as I would not be able to work (I'm a geologist - this involves quite a bit of strenuous outdoors work), which would even further affect us.Hope everything was clear to you, if you have any questions, just ask. Those were my reasons, and there are many many more that apply to different women in different ways.

What if the costs associated with the pregnancy were paid for along with a stipend? Would that have changed your mind? if not, why not. If so, why?Huck

Right now, I might consider it, as I am now a few weeks away from my graduation. Back then, I would not, as I had just begun college (I was in my sophomore year for my BS - now I'm about to get my MS). However, there is also that other major part of my decision - I never had the intention to become pregnant, and we even took steps to make sure I wouldn't. That also is a major factor in any of my decisions on it. Another decision that involves my work is that from about my fifth month on (acording to the doctors I spoke with) - I would be unable to work - that's four months, and while right now I am in good standing with my company and they might even allow me to do that, back then I was just starting out, and would be unable to do so.So, I'd say that at the moment if that were to happen, and that I was paid a stipend (I know of no place near me that does so) and then gave the baby up for adoption, my fiance and I would seriously consider the prospect.I know that in the future - in five years or so - we expect to be able to have paid off all our loans, and we will then consider actually having a baby.So in summary - now I would consider it, but back when I had the actual abortion (6 years ago or so) I would not consider it.

Because they are unable to maintain a pregnancy - money, job and education security, health (physical, mental and emotional).

Because they are unable to maintain a pregnancy - money, job and education security, health (physical, mental and emotional). I do feel that more open adotion would help. A lot of women can't go through the pregnancy and then just have the baby disappear into the wild blue unknown.

I don't really care if you believe I am selfish, because it is not for you to determine. I could also care less if you care for me or not - you're not the type of person I usually associate with.

Some pro-lifers twisted views of "moral people" are more like "crazy people".The pro-life dogma is an example of how primitive and unintelligent modern humans are. One person thinks they know better than another person or group of people, when really, they don't. I hope someday that we as a species will out grow this kind of illogic, but it is most likely not going to happen anytime soon.The abortion issue is just a matter of opinion, as are many other things. However, abortion does not have an extreme negative impact on society, and sometimes can have a positive effect. In instances like this, the public should be free to decide. It would be like denying the public the right to eat strawberry ice cream on moral grounds, or because strawberry ice cream is considered to be a human being or something of that sort. There are also many other arguments that refute the pro-life line of thinking, but they continuously are being ignored despite the overwhelming evidence. It is much like the southerners from the 1800s and racism, they held on to it with their last ounce of strength despite the overwhelming evidence that it was obsolete. They thought they were right and the others were wrong. However, they cannot help it because they grew up with it. This kind of dogma is unavoidable to people who grew up with it. They are almost instantly victimized by it because they have no intention of fighting it. They were taught that this closed-mindedness is the correct way to think, when it is really not. The same goes for the pro-lifers.My point is, pro-lifers can claim all the holier-than-thou moralness (if thats even a word) all they want, however the truth is that they are not. They are only moral in their opinion, and not everyone else's. The I'm-right-and-you're-wrong line of thinking is an unfortunate flaw in the human species. Its the thing that the founding fathers tried to protect us against, and now the pro-lifers are undermining that principle as well as what this country was built on.

I hope that we never grow into such a callous society that we don't value our progeny except when it's "convenient" to do so. Your attempting to equate apples with oranges, or in your example, strawberries. Do you really think that eating ice cream is the moral equivalence of abortion?emoticonXWow The principles that this country was founded on were life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Who speaks for the right to life of the fetus? And before you claim that a fetus has no rights, do your legal homework or I'll inundate you with examples to the contrary.And, for the record, I'm not a rabid anti-abortion advocate, but I am moral enough to recognize that aborting a fetus because you're not exactly comfortable with your present situation isn't a moral choice. We aren't talking about a rape victim or a life-threatening episode, we're talking about "bad timing" ONLY. emoticonXCensored

Thanks. I guess I need you to clarify your question a bit - what does "it" in your question refer to? There are two things that I can think that the word might refer to (how I felt about the abortion, or how I felt about adoption are the two possibilities), so I'll need you to expand on that for me to give you a good answer. ;)

So, it was a form of birth control?This is an answer based on either BS or ignorance.Those without money can use Medicare or Medicaid to virtually pay for the entire pregnancy. WIC also supplements your own feeding IIRC with proteins and calcium products. I've known several people (including hard core conservatives) who've had to go this route 'because they couldn't afford a pregnancy'. And if your morality/ ethics prevents you from taking gov't funding, think of it as stuff you already paid for with taxes (now and later), you're just getting some of what you put in back.Furthermore, there are several agencies that would easily pay for all your needs provided you put the child up for adoption. Pregnancy isn't expensive at all unless you're conned into thinking it has to be. If it were, poor people couldn't have the kids they do. Medical costs can be paid for by others. It's the luxuries many yuppy types seem to think they need that makes the after effects costly. In most cases of putting a pregnancy up for adoption, there is NO cost incurred to the mother.If putting the child up for adoption, this can be covered too. However, you havingto take time out per doctors instructions is something you might not desire as it could affect career opprotunities in certain lines of work.As an adoptive parent of 3 with decent knowledge of how 'the system' works, it's these annoying BS answers that tick me off. Perpetuating ignorance if not outright deciet to justify a decision to abort.As for caring for the kid once they're here, that can be costly. More so for time. If you're poor, EIC and earned child tax credits and deductions help alleviate the child's cost (the gov't wants another generation of consumers and tax payers). You can get your liability to near 0 and have the gov't kick back some money. But, we're talking adoption.On top of these decisions, you also have consider the health risks fo carring the child to term OR the risks involved in getting an abortion. It's nice to think that you'll 'plan' a child later but, life seldom works that way. I'd hate to think that once you're finally ready to have a child, your uterus has been scarred to infertility or have sever complications in conception, carrying the child to term or delivery. I'd be ironic for another yuppy type who can't have children on their own due to an abortion to have to incure greater medical costs to have one or legal costs to adopt...and maybe even seeking a foreign child as there aren't any easily to be had here...since they were all aborted. Also, the older you get, the more health issues possible for the child.As for the intellectuals who wait to have birth later in life, watch Idiocracy starring Luke Wilson. Then smile as it IS the XXXXXX who are inheriting the world. But, what would you care? You won't be here...and most likely, neither will your decendents.If you want to kill it, then just kill it and say 'What's it too you?' or even 'Yeah, so I'm selfish and didn't want to take time out of my life to be bothered with details, bugger off ya wanker!'

Though I haven't faced any such tough choices myself, I can hazard a guess about some of the reasons why women choose to abort instead of adopt:1. Many, if not most women, don't feel that abortion in the first trimester (where the great majority of abortions happen) is that very wrong in the first place. They may feel uncomfortable about it but that may be a small consideration compared to the other factors involved. 2. Many women have very critical reasons for wanting to abort - ex. there is a serious threat to their life or health, they are victims of rape or incest, the fetus may be deformed, etc. - reasons that even many pro-life proponents agree with. These are reasons that might make it very difficult to carry a pregnancy at all.3. There are serious reasons why a woman does not want to be a mother of that new child. Yes, in those situations, she would also have the option to adopt, so those are the situations that this question most addresses. So, what are some of the reasons she would choose abortion over adoption?a. Going through a pregnancy and birth can be a harsh ordeal. It certainlyis not something that is easy to go through. b. Pregnancy can be expensive. If adopting parents cover those costs, then this reason is null.c. Most adoptions mean that the mother looses all track of her offspring. For most women, this would be very hard to take. Open adoptions would help in this situation.d. There is still somewhat of a negative stigma attached to a mother who adopts out her child. Yes, she may have the satisfaction of knowing that she benefited the adopting couple and probably gave her offspring a better life, but she will also probably often be asked and ask herself "How could you have given up your own child? Your flesh and blood?". From what I have heard, many adopting mothers feel a sense of guilt. Perhaps some major changes in societal perceptions could help this.e. Carrying a pregnancy in public when she is not going to keep the childshows to the world an embarrasing part of her life (i.e. getting pregnant accidentally) that can leave the woman open to a lot of societal criticism that she would prefer to avoid.

Thus, 'virtually'.I am familiar with KY and IN legalistics. But, your point is taken. The slack can also be covered for by the adoptor of the child on a case by case basis.

If you wanted to be picky about it, I guess you could say that it was a form of last-ditch birth control, after the other forms failed.Ah, now I am the ignorant one or I am lying?! There is no way in heck I would be eligible for Medicare - first off, I am well below 65 years old, and second off, I am not disabled, I do not have end-stage renal disease, nor do I have any sort of other thing that would apply. As to Medicaid, we have actually attempted to look into it, but as we are above the "poverty level" locally, along with several other factors (which are frankly none of your dang business), we are not eligible for Medicaid either. So you can insult me or call me a liar all you want - your views of a perfect little world where every woman will be taken care of are just not reality.Oh, really, pregnancy is not expensive? Have you gone through a pregnancy? I talked with numerous friends who went through pregnancies, and the costs were astonishing - from the doctor visits, to the actual delivery which can cost well into the thousands (tens of thousands if there are difficulties with the birth). Just the visit I made shortly before getting an abortion was expensive. As for adoption, there very well may be no cost in the actual procedure- but there certainly are numerous costs - both monetarily and physically- before it. If you think otherwise, you are sadly mistaken.Yes, it certainly would affect my career opportunities, and that was one of the things I took into consideration (note that every thing I listed was something I considered).As I have pointed out, the only BS here is your accusations.Yep, it certainly cann be quite expensive.Yes, I certainly did consider these risks, and the risks at the time were far higher for continuing pregnancy than getting an abortion.I'll have you know that the abortion went without a hitch, and my uterus is perfectly healthy, thankyouverymuch (not that it is any of your emoticonXCensored business), and yes, I do plan to have a child in the future, and don't really care what you think about it.I'm not selfish, whether you or your buddy JP like to think so or not - I just look at actual reality rather than a fantasy world.As Another_opinion hinted, another factor is the fact that until around the end of the second trimester, I do not believe that a foetus is a person - something that made the choice to abort much easier for me than it is for some women whose religions have brainwashed them to worship the holy fertilized egg.

You won't be here...and most likely, neither will your decendents.If you want to kill it, then just kill it and say 'What's it too you?' or even 'Yeah, so I'm selfish and didn't want to take time out of my life to be bothered with details, bugger off ya wanker!'

But it does go to show that addressing the reasons will do more than condemnation or criminalization. Not sure where you stand on those issues - but I am a strong proponent of doing more of this as a way to address abortion. All kinds of energy goes into the legalities. I think there are so many ways that both sides could work together.

Thus, 'virtually'.I am familiar with KY and IN legalistics. But, your point is taken. The slack can also be covered for by the adoptor of the child on a case by case basis.

If you wanted to be picky about it, I guess you could say that it was a form of last-ditch birth control, after the other forms failed.Ah, now I am the ignorant one or I am lying?! There is no way in heck I would be eligible for Medicare - first off, I am well below 65 years old, and second off, I am not disabled, I do not have end-stage renal disease, nor do I have any sort of other thing that would apply. As to Medicaid, we have actually attempted to look into it, but as we are above the "poverty level" locally, along with several other factors (which are frankly none of your dang business), we are not eligible for Medicaid either. So you can insult me or call me a liar all you want - your views of a perfect little world where every woman will be taken care of are just not reality.Oh, really, pregnancy is not expensive? Have you gone through a pregnancy? I talked with numerous friends who went through pregnancies, and the costs were astonishing - from the doctor visits, to the actual delivery which can cost well into the thousands (tens of thousands if there are difficulties with the birth). Just the visit I made shortly before getting an abortion was expensive. As for adoption, there very well may be no cost in the actual procedure- but there certainly are numerous costs - both monetarily and physically- before it. If you think otherwise, you are sadly mistaken.Yes, it certainly would affect my career opportunities, and that was one of the things I took into consideration (note that every thing I listed was something I considered).As I have pointed out, the only BS here is your accusations.Yep, it certainly cann be quite expensive.Yes, I certainly did consider these risks, and the risks at the time were far higher for continuing pregnancy than getting an abortion.I'll have you know that the abortion went without a hitch, and my uterus is perfectly healthy, thankyouverymuch (not that it is any of your emoticonXCensored business), and yes, I do plan to have a child in the future, and don't really care what you think about it.I'm not selfish, whether you or your buddy JP like to think so or not - I just look at actual reality rather than a fantasy world.As Another_opinion hinted, another factor is the fact that until around the end of the second trimester, I do not believe that a foetus is a person - something that made the choice to abort much easier for me than it is for some women whose religions have brainwashed them to worship the holy fertilized egg.

Yep - that's someting that many "pro-lifers" also never take into account.Yes, it is very easy to worry about making ends meet while being above the "impoverished level". The "impoverished level" is just some choice made by some government officials - it really has no bearing on how someone actually lives. As to "we", that is just my natural way of talking about myself while also thinking of my fiance.Maybe the BS you smell is coming from somewhere else (hint: anti-choice), because everything I have stated is fact and truly happened to me. If you want to call me a liar, go ahead - your view just has no basis in reality.There may very well be such things near you, but at the time I knew of none near me - besides the fact that the actual cost was just one of the many factors.Dude, I already said I considered numerous things, so I don't know why you keep complaining about this.Well, you didn't have my experiences, now did you? Each woman who has an abortion coul have innumerous circumstances and experiences.Yep.Yes, I did. Which is why I am disgusted by JP's trivializing of everything, as well as calling me immoral (that post, by the way, was reported and the admin deleted it).Yes, we should definitely make sure abortions are all that safe and have low-risk to the women.

However, it is no more a person than my kidney.

I am not talking about anyone's specific circumstances - I just answered the initial question in general.

Thank you for proving my point.Well, thats just a matter of opinion, and thats my point. It is ok to disagree with someone, but abusing a majority power to force your opinions on someone even though it does not concern you at all, and does not harm society. Ice cream fits both of those criteria, and so do embryos.Last time I checked, doesn't an embryo not have a brain? Or even a mental existence? Why would you speak for an organic inanimate object.We are not playing a legal duel. I can show you precedents for denying blacks the right to vote, but we'd both disagree with that.I agree, however an extremely miniscule percentage are in this situation. Some 50% of abortions are because of contraception or protection failure. And countless others are because they would need to neglect the child they already have for another. To me, it is unfair to both the child that does exist and the mother to do something like that to them. And of course, many women aren't emotionally or financially stable to handle a pregnancy, so to have a baby would be out of the question. Sometimes the mother is 14 and cannot handle a child. Again, I'm for protecting our youth that already exist over a growing cell. And sometimes its all four. The point is, until you know every woman's circumstances, you are in no position to judge her or to shape the course of her life like that.Thats still a pretty broad definition.

I hope that we never grow into such a callous society that we don't value our progeny except when it's "convenient" to do so.

Who speaks for the right to life of the fetus? And before you claim that a fetus has no rights, do your legal homework or I'll inundate you with examples to the contrary.And, for the record, I'm not a rabid anti-abortion advocate, but I am moral enough to recognize that aborting a fetus because you're not exactly comfortable with your present situation isn't a moral choice.

The thread's title was adoption and this was clearly the better option, albeit an inconvenient one, but life is rarely convenient in the real world.Bad timing is a broad definition? I agree, but I've also posted the statistics above. The majority of abortions in the US are for selfish reasons.

In the web site's answer to that view, it states:What this tells me is that these messages from the outside (friends, family, television, etc.) still exist - i.e. there is still some stigma. By the way, it was fairly difficult to find any web site addressing concerns of parents giving up their baby. The great majority of sites I found were of addressing emotional concerns of the parents who would adopt the child.

Let's put this in perspective here. Here's the salient point"three-fourths say that having a baby would interfere with work, school or the ability to care for dependents". So, what we're talking about is the killing of a human fetus because it would require some adjustments to one's life. That's part of the sacrifices that almost every parent in the world makes. In the specific instance discussed above, we weren't talking about anything more than the inconvenience of going through pregnancy and then giving the baby up for adoption. Now, I know that you're going to start in on how pregnancy is more than an inconvenience, yadda, yadda, yadda, but the fact remains that billions of women have given birth without issue and it is the exception, not the rule, that there are problems. Plus, the poster stated that she intends to have children in the future, so that argument is voided. As for your "gestation or death" comment. Don't you think that's a tad melodramatic? I don't see millions of mothers out there in the real world dropping like flies because of bearing children. :)

One thing all of your arguements assume is that abortion at any stage is so very bad that one needs an awfully good reason to have one. That is something that most on the pro-choice side would disagree with you on - particularly with regards to abortion in the first trimester (where the great majority of abortions are done).About 2/3rds of Americans would keep abortion legal in the first trimester - which suggests that they don't have too much of a moral problem with first trimester abortions. If they don't view first trimester abortions as a big moral negative, then most reasons (including what you call selfish reasons) are sufficient for them. It is your responsibility, then, to convince them that abortion in that first trimester is so morally bad they have to have awfully good reasons to have one. As far as I know (since I haven't read too many of your posts), you have not been convincing on that point. Start with that and the rest will follow.

I'm not trying to convince anyone of anything. Not once did I state when a human life began, I made a statement that abortion was performed, in the majority of instances, for selfish reasons and that it was an inherently immoral act. You can argue the value or validity of those selfish reasons, but dems are da facts. I do like your qualifier about first trimester abortions and its morality.

When contraception failed in my monogamous long term relationship, I heavily researched both options, as well as parenting. I looked into requirements for Medicaid, WIC, and other subsidized assistance offered in my community. I called a few clinics around town. That's an interesting story, but not for here.I had heart to heart talks to many different people with different viewpoints.I decided to have an abortion because I was sick all the time. I had diagnosed migraine headaches constantly, and my seizure disorder that had laid dormant for years returned. I couldn't leave my house. I lost my job. I was in the middle of my education (it was early summer) and if I continued my pregnancy it would have put me back a semester, thus costing thousands of dollars. The father did not want me to continue the pregnancy because he was concerned about my physical health.Just thinking about that time period makes me nauseated.I understood the merits of adoption, especially since my father was adopted. I talked to my aunt about adoption and foster care, since she has participated in both. I also thought about parenting, the love and all the things I have to offer. I knew that the father would have supported my decision to parent, I knew that our financial hardships could be dealt with, and I knew that my education could be continued later.I came to the conclusion that abortion was the best choice for me and my health. I appreciate that some may find this decision selfish, and essentially it is, since it was made with my best interests in mind. I would also hope that even if they consider it selfish, they understand the reasons why I made that decision. And if it was your wife, daughter, friend, and she was dealing with what I was, you would not expect her to continue a pregnancy.

Why do women opt for abortion over adoption?

However, your used the term "selfish" in suggesting that selfish reasons were not valid reasons. The great majority of decisions people make every day are selfish reasons - from decisions on career, to decisions whether to try to get pregnant at a particular time, to decisions on what food to eat - that does not make those decisions bad.As a comparison, people who use contraception do so because they want to enjoy the emotional and sensual pleasures of sex without the consequence of pregnancy. This includes the great majority of married couples as well. The sex acts which are for the main purpose of procreation are by far in the minority - for both married and single couples. Inherently, then, the great majority of sexual acts and use of contraceptives in those sexual acts are for technically selfish reasons. Does that make it wrong to have sex outside of reasons of procreation, or to use contraceptives when one does?I would suspect that you would not object to the selfish reasons that people have for using contraceptives because I would guess that you do not think of the use of contraceptives as being morally bad. However, I am assuming that you do view the selfish reasons that people have for aborting as being bad because you DO view abortion as being morally bad. The bottom line is that selfish reasons are only viewed as bad if they are used to support an immoral act. You have not proven that first trimester abortions constitute an immoral act.Since you seem to value "life" as by far the most critical aspect of the embryo/fetus, I am not surprised that it makes no big moral difference for you if abortions are performed in the first trimester or the last. Pro-choice proponents do not see "life" as the most critical aspect but start placing more moral value on the fetus once other things come into play (ex. mental existence). In other words, we do see a big moral difference between aborting a zygote vs aborting a fetus one day from birth. Why? Because it is not merely "life" that we value but other things that come into play later on in a pregnancy.

Thanks. I guess I need you to clarify your question a bit - what does "it" in your question refer to? There are two things that I can think that the word might refer to (how I felt about the abortion, or how I felt about adoption are the two possibilities), so I'll need you to expand on that for me to give you a good answer. ;)

Thats a rather HUGE assumption. These things are not necesarily negated by a few little adjustments. You're trivializing again. Losing a job or a scholorship or income isn't just a mere adjustment - ESPECIALLY when providing for dependents. Your missing my point. You call everything going on in a pregnant woman's life short of her death a selfish convenience matter, this tells me that you think very little of the activities of woman who are alive unless they happen to be pregnant. I mean those selfish bitches are out there getting educated, working, providing for families. How dare they!!!???

Let's put this in perspective here. Here's the salient point"three-fourths say that having a baby would interfere with work, school or the ability to care for dependents". So, what we're talking about is the killing of a human fetus because it would require some adjustments to one's life. That's part of the sacrifices that almost every parent in the world makes. In the specific instance discussed above, we weren't talking about anything more than the inconvenience of going through pregnancy and then giving the baby up for adoption. Now, I know that you're going to start in on how pregnancy is more than an inconvenience, yadda, yadda, yadda, but the fact remains that billions of women have given birth without issue and it is the exception, not the rule, that there are problems. Plus, the poster stated that she intends to have children in the future, so that argument is voided. As for your "gestation or death" comment. Don't you think that's a tad melodramatic? I don't see millions of mothers out there in the real world dropping like flies because of bearing children. :)

I would expect nothing less from the women in my life. They've been raised with a different value system, evidently. My wife threw up every morning before going to work when she was pregnant and still managed to work and have 2 more children afterwards. And when she got large with the first one, she lost her job as the youngest assistant regional manager for a major young women's chain because she didn't portray the look that they were promoting. We took it in stride and sacrificed to make ends meet since I had just graduated and was starting out as a chemist.....but we did the right thing.

When contraception failed in my monogamous long term relationship, I heavily researched both options, as well as parenting. I looked into requirements for Medicaid, WIC, and other subsidized assistance offered in my community. I called a few clinics around town. That's an interesting story, but not for here.I had heart to heart talks to many different people with different viewpoints.I decided to have an abortion because I was sick all the time. I had diagnosed migraine headaches constantly, and my seizure disorder that had laid dormant for years returned. I couldn't leave my house. I lost my job. I was in the middle of my education (it was early summer) and if I continued my pregnancy it would have put me back a semester, thus costing thousands of dollars. The father did not want me to continue the pregnancy because he was concerned about my physical health.Just thinking about that time period makes me nauseated.I understood the merits of adoption, especially since my father was adopted. I talked to my aunt about adoption and foster care, since she has participated in both. I also thought about parenting, the love and all the things I have to offer. I knew that the father would have supported my decision to parent, I knew that our financial hardships could be dealt with, and I knew that my education could be continued later.I came to the conclusion that abortion was the best choice for me and my health. I appreciate that some may find this decision selfish, and essentially it is, since it was made with my best interests in mind. I would also hope that even if they consider it selfish, they understand the reasons why I made that decision. And if it was your wife, daughter, friend, and she was dealing with what I was, you would not expect her to continue a pregnancy.

I would argue that you're trivializing the value of a life. Would you kill your son to get a better job? finish your education? Of course not, he's a teenager, right? Well, if you believed that a fetus is a life, there's little difference between him and the fetus.Come on now, Jito. You know better. I've told you about the women in my life. Nobody has encouraged their independence more than I have and that includes my wife who has her own successful business, my oldest daughter that's finishing her masters in May on her way to a law AND PhD Psychology degrees and my youngest daughter that's a 4.0 student at MSU and will probably also go on for some advanced degrees. So, don't try to paint me as a sexist pig, all of the women that know me well would laugh at such a ridiculous claim.

Thats a rather HUGE assumption. These things are not necesarily negated by a few little adjustments. You're trivializing again. Losing a job or a scholorship or income isn't just a mere adjustment - ESPECIALLY when providing for dependents. Your missing my point.

Anyone who says that pregnancy is just a matter of convenience does not know what they're talking about.Pedophilia has extremely negative impacts on society, as well as the victims being harmed.I am against abortion in the third trimester.Current law? Well, there are none of that sort, but could you condone the laws listed here? This isn't about bringing up crazy laws, I'm debating the issue itself.Do you think thats even remotely close to devoting yourself to someone for 18 years plus 9 months of pregnancy and hundreds of thousands of dollars?IMO, shadow had a completely legitimate reason.Majority? I don't believe that, let me check those stats again.

And just what point is that? That we have already become so callous that we don't value life that isn't "convenient"?emoticonXConfused My opinion is that pedophelia is wrong. Do I have the right to try to prevent it if it isn't directly affecting me?emoticonXConfused I said fetus, YOU said embryo. Show me a current law. I'll be glad to reciprocate. Here's a concept for you. If a "woman" isn't emotionally or financially stable to handle a pregnancy" then maybe she's not stable enough to have a sexual relationship.And I don't judge EVERY woman's circumstances, but when this particular case study was presented, it was a fairly obvious call. The thread's title was adoption and this was clearly the better option, albeit an inconvenient one, but life is rarely convenient in the real world.Bad timing is a broad definition? I agree, but I've also posted the statistics above. The majority of abortions in the US are for selfish reasons. Instead of denying the facts, maybe you should try arguing in favor of the concept of selfishness.

Did contraception fail? In other words, maybe a difference between your situation and mine is that I was not intending to have children and took appropriate steps that failed.And I wasn't just vomiting, that would've been cake. I did the right thing.

JP - you can't see past your own experiences and that is what is driving me NUTS. Not everyone has the support system you do. Not everyone has had your options. Of course I would not kill my child for a better job. However if I were unable to support him for some reason there are options available as he is a seperate entity. THIS IS NOT THE CASE FOR A FETUS. And, yes, I would kill one if it meant I was unable to care for myself or my son.And I have told you before - just because you are positive about the wome in your life does not mean you are about them ALL. The fact that you refuse to validate ANY issue a pregnant woman faces speaks volumes more about your regard for women than how you treat your wife and daughter(s). Most people are nice to their loved ones.No, no - your not. You WITNESSED it. I have witnessed pregnancy too. Not the same as being pregnant. Not by a long shot. Can give a pregnant woman ANY credit?

Whenever people choose not to sacrifice themselves for others, it can be considerered selfish. That does not mean that they have to make that sacrifice or that the lack of sacrifice is automatically bad and immoral. For example, there are a tremendous number of needy people in this world and most of us in this rich country (USA, or most Western countries) could probably sacrifice a lot more than we do in terms of our money and time to help those people out. Most of the reasons we would give for not giving most of our money or time to charity are ultimately selfish - mainly a reduction in our own lifestyles and needs. I doubt that you also give as much of your time or money as you could.The degree of "badness" of a selfish reason depends on what you are comparing to and what the expectations are. Nobody really expects people to give the great majority of their not-absolutely-essential money or time to charity and people who don't are not viewed as immoral despite the fact that the reasons they don't do so are selfish reasons. However, pro-life proponents like you view abortion instead of adoption as selfish because you have the expectation that the woman SHOULD sacrifice herself for that early fetus or embryo. I personally have not seen you make a good case as to why these women should have to sacrifice themselves for what, at that particular stage of their pregnancies, is only just a body with "nobody home". Unless you come up with good supported reasons, then I will continue to think that it should be her choice whether or not to make that sacrifice, not yours.Jitobear, ShadowPikachu, simone, ...If I can interject here, don't be so afraid of admitting that many of the reasons that women abort instead of adopting out are selfish. I am talking in general not specifically about your situations. Like I said to JPSartre12, a lot of the decisions we make in life are ultimately selfish - ex. not giving most of our non-absolutely-essential money or time to charity, not always giving money to potentially deserving beggars on the street, not being only give and no take in a relationship, etc. That doesn't make those decisions automatically bad. It would be a nice world if we were all altruistic but that is not reality. I don't think I have even met a fully altruistic person in my life. Selfishness is only bad if one is not fulfilling a universally acknowledged expectation or if the selfish reasons contradict one's own morality. I don't think that there are well supported reasons to expect that a woman pregnant with an unwanted embryo or early fetus HAS TO carry that pregnancy to term. Do you? If not, then why worry that someone is calling your reasons selfish. Simply because of different world views, you do not have the same expectations or view of responsibilities as they do. Their world view says that it is a responsibility of a pregnant woman to carry that pregnancy to term. Your world view does not.

OK. Then they shouldn't get so indignant when people tell them that their actions are selfish.

JP - I have never had an abortion. The types and availability of assistance available varies from state to state. I was living in New Mexico at the the time - medical assistance was not available to non-New Mexico residents (technically I was a Minnesota resident). I wa also very close to finishing school and did not want to have to quit and add more to my student loans. I also wanted my baby. I talked to profs to work out the school stuff, and a lady down at the welfare office lied to the state about my residency. I received medical assistance througout the pregnancy and financial and daycare assistance for about 6 months after so I could graduate. For years I shared small apartments and lived in basements until I was established enough at my employer to make enough of an income to own my own home. Don't accuse me of taking the easy way out. But I certainly know what it is to be pregnant without support and know how hard that it is. If one can't get the damned support all your preaching and laws mean NOTHING. They DO NOT HELP. They won't change a thing. NOT TRUE. Just because Mr and Mrs Smith are willing to pay for your pregnancy doesn't mean they are willing to pay your mortgage or daycare for your other kids, etc.No argument there. They sure ain't men.A lot of the homeless women and children are less visable as they are generally the first to get into shelters (shelters are not a home).OK - let me be specific. I will end any pregnancy that will end my life or cause me major medical harm. I will also end a pregnancy that will not allow me to work and support myself and my son (I had to stop working at five months last time.) I will end a pregnancy from rape.I also want no more kids - hence the tubal.

How come illegal aliens can get prenatal care and you couldn't?emoticonXConfused Or was it that you weren't resourceful enough and took the easy way out?And the title of this thread is ADOPTION. That was an option that you could have pursued, right?I think that you know my feelings on abusive spouses already. I sheltered an abused mother and her two kids in my house for 6 months and prayed that the husband came looking for her at my front door. When he actually did, I tried my best to belittle him to the point that he would take a swing at me so I could beat him into bad health, but he wasn't even enough of a man to do that. emoticonXCensored 99% of the homeless here are male, so I don't see many pregnant homeless people. Absolutely NOT the government.Well, if by your health and life, you mean your survival, then I'd agree. And you're using nebulous terms again. "Take precedence"? What specifically does that mean? If he can't buy a new car because you are having a baby, then he takes precedence? Or are you speaking about his life or death as well?

Why is it selfish if a woman chooses to have an abortion so that her other children can have a better life?Is that selfish? Are you so stupid as to believe that that is a selfish reason?Why is it selfish if woman chooses to have an abortion in order to advance in her career?Why don't you ask if a man is being self if he chooses to ignore his wife and children in order to advance in his career?Do you ever ask that question? Do you have the balls to ever ask if men are being selfish when they tromp all over everyone else in order to succeed?Do you ever ask that question?

Thank you for your story and for supporting my belief that "where there's a will, there's a way." emoticonXGood I could see the mortgage part, but I'm a little fuzzy on the daycare for other kids part. How would being pregnant impact the fact that you already are paying for daycare? If anything, daycare costs would go to zero if you were forced to not work. emoticonXConfusedThey're an embarrassment to MY gender, IMO. emoticonXAngry OK, I concede the point.It sounds like you are doing the responsible thing by insuring that you can't get pregnant again. I applaud that. emoticonXGood

Simone:I'm not sure if I was the one you were addressing with these questions since you didn't specify. Since your post followed soon after mine, I will assume that it was. Anyway, any reasons which puts ones own interest ahead of others is a selfish reason. That doesn't make it bad. I think you automatically think "selfish = bad". I will restate that I view selfishness as bad only if one is not fulfilling a universally acknowledged expectation or if the selfish reasons contradict one's own morality. After all, is it bad not to give all of ones not-absolutely-necessary income to charity, not to give money to every beggar one walks past, not be all give and no take in a relationship? No, but most of the reasons behind our not being altruistic are ultimately selfish reasons. I think part of the problem is that many people automatically view "selfish" as being bad even though, if they examined their lives, they are being selfish all the time. We probably need a more specific word than "selfish".As for your specific questions:Many women do not wish to be mothers of a new child in order to keep the family size limited and give a better life to the other children. That is fine. The topic of this thread being adoption, she would also have the choice of adopting out the child and still leaving her family size and support unaffected (excluding health risks that limit her capabilities of mothering, etc.). Therefore, her choice not to adopt out may be based on other factors - some of which may be selfish factors in that they might have to do with burdens that she could potentially take on but that she doesn't want to. That doesn't make her decision bad. Her choice is about herself over the potential baby - which is again ultimately a selfish choice because it concentrates on her needs. That doesn't make her choice bad unless one thinks that she is shirking a moral requirement to carry an unwanted pregnancy (as pro-life people do but which I do not since I do not view it necessary to have to sacrifice oneself for a fetus and early embryo which, at that point, is still only a body with no mind).I think that action on the part of the man is selfish in a bad way, unless the wife and children are not emotionally negatively effected by his absence. He is hurting others (his wife and kids) in his decision when he doesn't have to.Either way, that last question had nothing to do with the abortion debate. There are probably millions of such questions one can ask of people that have nothing to do with the abortion debate. As to questions of whether selfish reasons are bad or ok where abortion is concerned, that depends on whether you think anyone is being hurt by an abortion and whether you think there is a moral requirement for a woman to carry her pregnancy to term. As I have already stated, I think that there is no moral requirement for a woman to carry her pregnancy to term, so I don't think that selfish reasons for stopping a pregnancy are immoral reasons. In other words, in that situation "selfish" does not equal "bad". Also, I don't think anybody is being hurt in early abortions - just a body that has the potential of becoming a person who can be hurt but is not one yet.

Because she's killing a life? emoticonXConfused See aboveSee aboveI think that's a good example of being selfish, too. The difference is that nobody's dying as a result of his conscious decision. Sure do. Personally, I'd be much higher up in my organization if I put my job ahead of my family, but I refused to do so. Those that did, went further. And I have ZERO regrets because I have a great wife and three well-balanced adult children as a result of my conscious decision NOT to be selfish. emoticonXGood All of the time.

But I don't believe that. I was 24, smart, resourceful, educated and had some good folks around me. I wasn't the 13 year old girl pregnant by her dad (with the mother's consent) my sister in law saw in her shelter. I wasn't (at the time) in a dangerous relationship. I had understanding profs - what if I didn't? What if that gal had not lied to the state? Women's lives are really complex. I don't believe there is always a way. I would like to change that. That is how I think we should tackle abortion. That is how I think it will work.Fine - but there are other bills and my point stands.Would like to see more women and men be careful.

Simone you do not help the position with such emotional rants. I believe your questions were more than adequately answered by others so I will not attempt to do so. However, please look at how you approach the topic. You do not advance the position and in fact, your defensiveness only perpetuates a stereotype that hinders.

She is no worse than some of the rants we hear from the other side. The the words "convenience" and "selfish" get tossed around with absolutely no serious regard for the details of women's lives and comments like "she should have kept her legs closed", etc. are equally ineffective emotional rants that hinder discussion and perpetuate stereotypes.

But some people add to the discourse while others just throw more fuel on the fire. You and I rarely agree, but at least we can see the other's viewpoint. We may not agree which is more important, but at least we aren't so blind that we can't acknowledge its existence.For example, you see the risk to a woman's health (both physical and mental) as being much greater than I do. Why? Because our experiences have been dramatically different. I was intimately involved in all three of my wife's pregnancies. I went to the doctor with her, took LaMas(sp?) class, coached during delivery, even got to cut the ambilical cord on the last one. And throughout their growing years, I was always there and couldn't imagine NOT being there.As a result, I guess that I view childbirth and raising children differently from someone that had to struggle alone from pregnancy onward.

Generally speaking, I agree with you Jito. However, Simone rarely provides any kind of logical argumentation. The others I see do provide logical argumentation but they also throw in the emotional rants. It is usually a debate technique intended to throw the opposition into a frenzy on emotional points that add nothing to the debate. It is specifically a technique used by experienced debators. Simone's arguments are almost exclusively of that nature. She will only occasionally avoid them and use logic and evidence to support her positions. Her reputation for providing decent argument is low in this regard.Yours is much better. Even in this post where you are clearly bothered, you approach it very level headed and without the hystrionics that frequently compose the posts of simone. You make a legitimate point and support it with reason and analysis. I am faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrr more willing to see your side of things and to listen to you with an open mind. Simone's posts have a tendancy to shut the door to my mind before I even read them.Others who say some of the vile things you referenced will typically turn me off once I read them, but I will usually push through the rest of the post so that I can read and evaluate that which does indeed have substance.Also, I don't read everything. Not enough time in the day. Simone I take notice of because I have had arguments around such rants and believe she has some really legitimate points and would like to see her use them far more constructively so that they are given some due weight.Huck
