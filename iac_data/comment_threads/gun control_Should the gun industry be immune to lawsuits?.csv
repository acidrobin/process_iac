0,Should the gun industry be immune to lawsuits?,gun control,support,"Right now the NRA is trying to push a bill through congress that would make gun dealers and gun manufactures immune to most lawsuits. Many victims of gun violence have sued gun manufacturers and gun dealers.

Others industries are not immune to lawsuits. Why should the gun industry be a special exception?",0,1,topic_stance_votes_1
1,Should the gun industry be immune to lawsuits?,gun control,attack,"The firearms industry should not be except from faulty workmanship, material, and unsafe design. If their products injure people for those reasons then they should be sued.
But if someone uses a firearm to intentionally injure someone and the weapon performs according to it's specifications, then sueing the manufacture is crazy. Another example of out of control law suits.",1,2,topic_stance_votes_2
2,Should the gun industry be immune to lawsuits?,gun control,support,The bill would also protect gun manufacturers and dealers that have allowed their weapons to fall into the hands of criminals through their own negligence.,1,3,topic_stance_votes_1
3,Should the gun industry be immune to lawsuits?,gun control,attack,"It is easy to understand the logic behind the bill. It remains ridiculous to find the manufacturer liable for the acts committed by those who might purchase their products. Suing the gun manufacturer for a defective product, when the product performs as designed is absurd. This is simply another attempt to minimize the personal responsibility of the American population. Creating a society, where all responsibility rest in the government, will undoubtedly reduce those rights and personal freedoms we enjoy. By creating a predator/prey system that only the government can combat, as gun ownership becomes impossible, more and more police services will be needed. As the problem persists, it is easy to justify a police state, in order to care for a population whose right to self defense has been infringed.
Yes, the agenda is quite clear. Let me put it into perspective. Let me compare past results, with the possible future of a nation that risks being disarmed. Let me ask an important question and have you evaluate which ideal state seems safer.
Which system would you rather have; a system where the public is armed, and gun deaths occur in a random fashion, at a low percentage of the population, or a system where the police and military are the only sector of the population allowed access to weaponry? In the latter system, the police and military usually merged into one entity. Other civil rights enjoyed by the population can be effectively reduced, since no forcible opposition is able to exist. Finally, gun violence occurs at an alarming rate, as mass graves are filled with those who represent potential opposition to a corrupt regime. History provides ample evidence for all the characteristics of a system that finds itself disarmed.
I know that the prospect for peace and tranquillity remains a tempting offer by those who vocalize an anti-gun stance, but I ask you this. Do the premises match the conclusion? Will the elimination of your rights to own guns, or the gun manufacturer's rights to produce guns, make you safer in any way? The answer is no. Criminals will continue to break the laws by using previously existing guns. As a law-abiding citizen you will not have the right to self-defense. Therefore, murder and mayhem will reign. Military and police can then form a strong public interest to advance the powers that they hold. A bloody coupe could succeed in replacing the last remnants of democracy in America. Finally, those who resist such an illegitimate act could be rounded up and shot, without any viable resistance.
Ask yourself; do you support the constitution, or are you an enemy of its design? Only those who hate the outline of America's political system would condone such a ridiculous attack on the gun industry. Those who tell you that the second amendment was designed so hunters could hunt, not for the purpose of providing a final system of checks and balances to impeded the natural flow of government towards tyranny. These people are the same liberals who defend our enemies. These are the same people who march in opposition to the war in Iraq. Their purposes are becoming more and more obvious, as they align themselves with our true enemies. They are the fifth column, and represent a domestic threat to the U.S. political system. Do you really want to advance their cause by supporting just one of their harebrained ideas?",1,4,topic_stance_votes_2

6,Should the gun industry be immune to lawsuits?,gun control,attack,"A little town just outside the Afgan border, can't remember the name, is known world wide as an arms manufacturing center. In small one and two man shops very skilled gunsmiths can build any firearm you want from any time period with tools no more advanced than a hammer and file. No power tools, no milling machines, sometimes not even a roof over their head.
The barrel would be the most difficult thing to make. If decent rifled barrels can be made, then making the rest of the AK-47 would be easy. The AK-47 was purposely designed to have sloppy tolerances for easy manufacture.
Perfect example that when guns are wanted, determined people will get them.",1,7,topic_stance_votes_2
7,Should the gun industry be immune to lawsuits?,gun control,attack,"I do not think they should be immune from them but I believe that in the cases where they are sued and win that the plantiff should have to cover any cost incountered by the defendant becuase of the lawsuit in other words LOSER PAYS. This would stop alot of wreckless lawsuits by making them expensive if you loose, so that you would not feel to good about filing one if it was not sure to win. The BATF does not suggest that gun manufactures try to find out what dealers are selling them illeagly as this would interfere with and possibly obstruct the investigation launched by the BATF or other Gov't agencies. So what are the manufacturers supposed to do? I say that if you sue them becuase they made a product and a criminal used against you or you were stupid and shot yourself then you (or the criminal) are the only ones responcible.",1,8,topic_stance_votes_2

12,Should the gun industry be immune to lawsuits?,gun control,attack,"Voice of Reason, perhaps you should think for a moment. Who should be held responcible for crimes, criminals or innocent people. Should the manufacturer of a get away vehicle also be sued if a bank is robbed, what about the manufacturer of their clothes and the shoe company that made their shoes. This assigning responciblity to others who had no part in the crime is very stupid indeed. If you sell your car legally and I get into an accident with the person you sold it to should I also sue you for selling it to that person of course not, now do you see how stupid it is to hold a manufacturer responcible for the actions of consumers.",1,13,topic_stance_votes_2
