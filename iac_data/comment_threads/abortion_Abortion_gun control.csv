Vote on whether you're pro-life and for or against gun control, pretty much any form.
Same with pro-choice.",0,1,topic_stance_votes_2
1,Abortion/gun control,abortion,attack,"Well I'm English so I hope you don't mind me replying.
Anyway I am pro-life and for gun control (In that you need a licence to own one).",1,2,topic_stance_votes_1
2,Abortion/gun control,abortion,attack,I don't mind anyone replying. More philosophical question than political.,2,3,topic_stance_votes_2
3,Abortion/gun control,abortion,support,"I am pro-choice and relatively nuetral on the guns. As long as we don't hand out permits to criminals and complete XXXXXX who won't bother to be safe with their weapons, I don't really care. I don't want a gun in my house - but that's my perogative. I have never quite understood what I have seen as a predominantly male fascination with hand guns anyway. But whatever....",3,4,topic_stance_votes_2

I'm very pro-life and very pro-gun....but I bet you guessed that.

8,Abortion/gun control,abortion,attack,"Why are you folks pro-gun and against gun control? Philosophically I mean, not ""it's in the constitution"".",8,9,topic_stance_votes_2
9,Abortion/gun control,abortion,attack,"I'm VERY Pro-Life. And I'm for people being able to own guns, but I don't want machine guns out on the street, and I think you need a permit. But you should have the right to own a gun.",9,10,topic_stance_votes_1
10,Abortion/gun control,abortion,attack,Why should we have the right to own a gun? Why shouldn't the gov't be able to decide whether or not you can?,10,11,topic_stance_votes_2
11,Abortion/gun control,abortion,attack,"To me, owning a gun is no less a right than owning a refrigerator. To equate gun ownership to abortion is absurd",9,12,topic_stance_votes_1
12,Abortion/gun control,abortion,attack,"Eh? I'm not equating them, I'm seeing if there is any correlation between them. That would be absurd :P",12,13,topic_stance_votes_2
13,Abortion/gun control,abortion,attack,"I was responding to this 
and it seemed to me that you kinda were. Your point appeared to be that if the government can ""control a woman's body"" then why can't they tell us what to do with guns",11,14,topic_stance_votes_1
14,Abortion/gun control,abortion,attack,"In a way I was, as far as the poll goes. Abortion and gun control use very similar arguments about personal responsibility and gov't intrusion into private lives, but the different sides, conservative and liberal, switch who use them. I wanted to see if what I observed would show up here.
With what you say, you can flip it. Why can the gov't legislate morals in one area but can't in another. It's just the subject that changes.
Both parties pick and choose their battles, it seems to me, and they sometimes contradict themselves. This is partly why I never subscribe to one or the other :P",14,15,topic_stance_votes_2
15,Abortion/gun control,abortion,attack,"""it's in the constitution"" is a good argument IMO, but that is not what you wanted. Ok i feel that gun control is just a nother way for a few people to tell outhers what to do. like probition, or outlawing pot, and hundrids of outher issues. Guns are not dangrous, they need some one to make them dengrous, just like knives, hammers and outher objects.
why are you for gun control.",14,16,topic_stance_votes_2
16,Abortion/gun control,abortion,support,"""it's in the constitution"" is a good argument for making it legal, but says nothing about personal opinions on the matter. It's akin to saying ""I think it should be legal because it's legal"".
Thank you for your opinion :) The poll grows muahahaha",16,17,topic_stance_votes_2

I don't really care what you do with your kids.... I'm not giving my guns up...
I don't plan on having kids, neither does my cook.",19,20,topic_stance_votes_2
20,Abortion/gun control,abortion,support,I'm for kook control. A kook with a fork troubles me far less than one with a large caliber automatic weapon. I'm also pro-choice but feel abortion is sad thing and a sorry form of birth control.,20,21,topic_stance_votes_2
21,Abortion/gun control,abortion,support,"Pro-choice without a doubt.
I differ on gun ownership depending on which country you are taking about. In the States I think tighter control would be impossible to enforce but here in Britain I wouldn't like to see the law loosened. Voted anti-control as I took it from a US pont of view.",21,22,topic_stance_votes_2
22,Abortion/gun control,abortion,attack,why do you even have guns?,22,23,topic_stance_votes_1
23,Abortion/gun control,abortion,attack,As part of the poll you mean? It was because while in the gun control forum I saw a lot of the same arguments for abortion that are used against gun control and since pro-life and pro-gun are usually entwined (Republican leaning issues) I wanted to see if what I observed was correct.,23,24,topic_stance_votes_2
24,Abortion/gun control,abortion,attack,"It's safe to say that most conservatives don't see a contradiction here because unlike abortion, gun ownership doesn't involve taking a life. Perhaps that will be seen as overly simplistic since some will argue that guns increase the likelyhood of death but that is my analysis.",24,25,topic_stance_votes_1
25,Abortion/gun control,abortion,attack,"I certainly agree that conservatives don't see a contradiction :P Liberals don't see a contradiction between arguing for more gov't involvment in gun control and less gov't in abortion issues, either, so it cuts both ways. 
Like I said though, the arguments are similar. Taking the gun ownership argument to it's philosophical points, conservatives usually say that the gov't has no business being intrusive on our lives. That is the liberal position in regards to abortion, that pregnancy is one of the most personal of issues and that the gov't should have no involvment in it. It goes the other way too. The point of the poll is to see if the pro/anti gun control crowd lines up with the pro-life and pro-choice crowd. So far the pro-choice crowd is split, but there have been very few votes. Pro-life seem more against gun control, as would be expected.",25,26,topic_stance_votes_2
26,Abortion/gun control,abortion,attack,"The difference between controlling abortion and controlling guns is that: Just because I onw a gun, does not mean I am killing a person. I don't think you can argue the same about abortion.",26,27,topic_stance_votes_1
27,Abortion/gun control,abortion,attack,"Actually, you can. The Supreme Court decision Roe vs Wade made it clear that the fetus is not considered a person under the constitution.
However, that isn't the point. Obviously gun ownership and abortion are two separate issues, but taking both to their broad philosophical ends and the arguments look similar. This poll can measure if the outlook changes on the issues, or if the outlook is consistent throughout the issues.",27,28,topic_stance_votes_2
