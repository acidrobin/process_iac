10,Guilty!  Should he die?,death penalty,support,I say let him rot in prison. Why should he get off so easy as to have what he did die with him in the short 10-15 years it would take to submit to the death penalty. Let him live on and just hope that his cell-mates know what he did and punish him even further.,10,11,topic_stance_votes_2
11,Guilty!  Should he die?,death penalty,attack,"Peterson was found guilty of first and second degree murders. I say we trust in the justice system. If there was enough evidence to support a double murder, which there was, then there should be enough evidence to support Capital Punishment. The publicity does not matter. It doesnt' matter because justice is not about revenge, but rather finding out if a wrong has been committed and punishing it accordingly. The man has shown no remorse for what he has done, and showed obvious attempts to hide his acts, so we can only assume that if he had gotten away with it, he just might do it again. That is why I see it as necessary to execute him. He did a viscious (spelling....argh!) act, has shown no remorse, and has fought the courts after being caught. While it is a tough thing to debate whether or not he can be rehabilitated, I say that not only will the punishment of death fit the crime, but it will further the cause of crime prevention. People see too many murderers on television getting off. Let them know that we have laws and will enforce them.",10,12,topic_stance_votes_1

15,Guilty!  Should he die?,death penalty,attack,"I agree on how you feel what he did was HORRIBLE and terribly wrong, but think about it, which would suck more for you if you were him dying and getting it over with, or living the rest of your life thinking about what you did? which is more punishing?",1,16,topic_stance_votes_2
16,Guilty!  Should he die?,death penalty,attack,"This may be true for a case that hasn't already been decided. It's a good argument for doing away with the death penalty and their expensive trials. However, his trial is over.
Now that we've been through the expensive trial, we've yet to go through the expensive appeals after the sentencing. After we get through that, if he still retains the death penalty, it's a lot cheaper to kill him than to keep him up 'til he dies in prison. The latest estimate I've heard for keeping a prisoner alive is between 50 and 75 thousand dollars a year.
He's taking up space in a perfectly good cell. He's using up perfectly good oxygen, food, clothing, heating and cooling energy, medical attention, etc.
He should be killed straight away. Henry VIII would have no problem with lopping off his head! Neither would I.",9,17,topic_stance_votes_1

Yeah, the appeals are magically more complicated and expensive for the death penalty. There are appeals of the sentnce (IIRC) and of the ruling.
O they don't make space anymore. They'll just put him in a cell with pot growers and crack addicts. He'll be lucky if he gets a spot on the floor to sleep on.

You're right it'll be fighting the war in Iraq. )Nah, really it'll be from social security, etc etc.
Let me clear this up for you.
Wasteful DEFENSE spending is the only reason we have trouble funding the ""war on terror."" Which by the way has nothing to do with the $200b+ we have spent so far in Iraq (which is by no means the war on terror). 
The entire budget of the EPA is only $7b? I would have thought it was more than that. (That would be 15% of the increase in the defense budget from 2002 to 2003 according to this page:

2003 Defense Budget Request: Large Increase in Funding, Few Changes to Plans
I do believe that the crusader (a huge cumbersome howitzer) that was deemed not mobile enough for the new transformed military.
http://www.army-technology.com/projects/crusader/
Anyway, this is apples and oranges.
We are talking about the war on terror which is and should be primarily fought through intellegence gathering and law enforcement agencies. 
So these increases in defense spending are likely not going to the right places, all the while Porter Goss is revamping the CIA to be a tool for the white house.
http://www.startribune.com/stories/587/5090052.html
http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/8086
Well, so anyway, if the EPA were totally streamlined and cut their budget in HALF. That would be a pittly $3.5b to throw onto the defense pile. If we totally got rid of the EPA and we went back to acid rain and smog everywhere
that would be $7 billion dollars to buy a few B2 bombers)

20,Guilty!  Should he die?,death penalty,support,"Beyond my objections to the death penalty based on the execution of the innocent, I think death is an all too pleasant reprieve.

25,Guilty!  Should he die?,death penalty,support,Let's remember that the more inhuman the environment the harder it would be for the guards as well. I believe this is why sex between inmates is overlooked.,25,26,topic_stance_votes_1
26,Guilty!  Should he die?,death penalty,support,"Thisis why we provide those things. You have to give the guys enough to keep them occupied, or your guards are as good as dead. You can't use 150 (total) guards to control 3000 inmates unless the inmates are willing to be controlled. Figure 50 guards on shift at a time, what do you really think their odds of survival would be in a full scale revolt and break out attempt at a prison. 
Cable TV is cheaper than the 2-1 guard ratio, gun emplacements, and armored units your would need to controll a prison full of folks who were really intent on getting out.
This does not even include the additional police officers and all the extra gear that THEY would need in order to actually capture those criminals, since a guy facing hells island is a LOT more likely to be willing to resort to violence to escape than a guy facing time in a decent prison.
This is something that confuses me about America (actually, it doesn;t confuse me that much). We have this bizarre preoccupation with crime and punishment. The DOJ ahs been issuing studies since the 50's that show that once your penalties reach a certain height, violent crime goes up, as criminals who are unwilling to result to violence to avoid 2 years of probation are certaily willing to do so when facing 10 years in a federal prison.

28,Guilty!  Should he die?,death penalty,attack,"In 1992 I was on a hunting trip in Wyoming and one of the party was a manager from a California maximum security prison. A man about middle 40s in age, he had started his career as a line guard and stayed with it. Typical prison career (his words) in that he took a degree and then post-grad degree while employed and used that to climb the civil service ladder.
His comments were eye opening to say the least. This was around a campfire in the middle of nowhere and I can't recall one member of the party that could remotely be referred to as liberal in a social sense, especially after drawing blood with firearms and consuming not a few libations. 
Prison guards in a maximum security setting provide window dressing and control mostly automated systems that separate the guards from the
general prison population. He said we've basically put a fence around a bunch of psychopaths and they do pretty much as they want with little interference from society. Drugs and sex are rampant, drugs smuggled in by guards for small monetary gain and avoidance of threats of bodily harm to their families by outside associates of inmates, with sex according to inmate status, also related to violence. TV, exercise equipment and other 'niceties' are, as mentioned by other posters, replacements for guards in that they reduce thinking and provide a semblance of structure. 
Like Daewoo, if I was facing 10-years in one of those places without a professional criminal background, I'd do whatever I could to avoid it. The US has the highest per-capita prison population of all developed countries. Our judicial system long ago reached a point of saturation where a majority of criminal cases are resolved by plea bargaining under federal sentencing guidelines to avoid further clogging of the courts. And we've finally reached a point where it's less expensive to imprison a murderer for life than to execute them, regardless of the nature of the crime, quite a comment on our system of government that we're using armed aggression to instill in other countries.",27,29,topic_stance_votes_2

31,Guilty!  Should he die?,death penalty,attack,"Capital Punishment and Deterrence: Examining the Effect of Executions on Murder in Texas. Authors John Sorenson, Robert Wrinkle, Victoria Brewer, and James Marquart examined executions in Texas between 1984 and 1997. They speculated that if a deterrent effect were to exist, it would be found in Texas because of the high number of death sentences and executions within the state. Using patterns in executions across the study period and the relatively steady rate of murders in Texas, the authors found no evidence of a deterrent effect. The study concluded that the number of executions was unrelated to murder rates in general, and that the number of executions was unrelated to felony rates. (45 Crime and Delinquency 481-93 (1999)). 
Deterrence, Brutalization, and the Death Penalty: Another Examination of OklahomaÃ•s Return to Capital Punishment. In this study, author William Bailey speculated that if executions had a deterrent effect in Oklahoma, it would be observable by comparing murder rates and rates of sub-types of murder, such as felony-murder, stranger robbery-related killings, stranger non-felony murder, and argument-related killings, before and after the resumption of executions. Bailey examined the period between 1989 and 1991 for total killings and sub-types of killing. After controlling for a number of variables, Bailey found that there was no evidence for a deterrent effect. He did, however, find that there was a significant increase in stranger killings and non-felony stranger killings after Oklahoma resumed executions after a 25-year moratorium.
