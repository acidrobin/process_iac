Well roe vs wade actually was a case which was undertaken by the plaintiff to get the gov out of womens bodies (metaphorically speaking). And thats what it did - it removed government controls it did not add them. It provided a wider range of options not a narrower range. Indeed a range of options more in accord with reality than before. And by the way a dictator is classically a single individual (see ancient greek history) not a panel of 9 drawing decisions by majority vote. That would I believe be a nonarchy or nonaship not a dictatorship. And of course the court provided relief to the plaintiffs from an existing set of restrictive laws which had been on the books for a long time meaning that the involvement of gov in womens bodies predated RvW by many decades.
And why do you think that Medicare/Medicaid puts the government in womens bodies - those are insurance programs designed to protect the economic welfare and health of the patients who have them. Granted there are restricitions and limits, but frankly the programs are pretty good about covering a whole bunch of medical needs.

56,life,abortion,support,"There are a wide variety of views on abortion. Pro-lifers only constitute one extreme - not allowing abortion at all stages of pregnancy except for very few exceptions (most allowing for risk of mother's death, some allowing for rape, incest and risk to mother's health). This seems to largely be driven by a particular brand of religious belief - such as a belief of a soul entering at conception.
The statistics show some of the range of views on abortion:
from http://pollingreport.com/abortion.htm , from a CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll. Jan. 10-12, 2003. N=1,002 adults nationwide. MoE ± 3.:
So, if politics reflected majority views instead of the views of particularly vocal political interest groups, then first trimester abortions would be legal, second and third trimester would be generally illegal (appart from the usual exceptions). The current distribution of abortions reflect these views as well, where the great majority of abortions (~87%) occur in the first trimester and only 1.4% occur after 20 weeks gestation (and those usually for serious health issues). Note that I did not pick and choose polls that suite my view since I disagree with the majority stance on second trimester abortions, though I agree with the stance on first and third trimester abortions.
