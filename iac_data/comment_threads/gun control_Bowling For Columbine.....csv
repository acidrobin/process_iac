1) Did the NRA and KKK ever burn a cross together?

3) Did Chuck Heston ever say ""From my cold dead hands in Denver""?
4) How many edits does it take to make a point? If it is a documentry then why minipulate a speech?
1) That is a cartoon? Do you believe in cartoons? My nephew believes that things he sees in Bugs Bunny is real. Do you? Moore manufactured a monster from the NRA.
2) Lockheed Martin builds optical spy and commerical satellites. Why the nukes, bombs, and missiles in the movie? I recall seeing nukes and bombs? Please refresh my memory and help me out? What was the message you got? The current generation of optical spy satellites is launched only by the Space Shuttle. Why no footage of the Space Shuttle or communication satellites? Because commerical satellites and the Space Shuttle is not menacing enough.
3) Chuck Heston never said, ""From my cold dead hands in Denver"". Why and where did he say that? Not in Denver. This is what he said in Denver: ""So, we have the same right as all other citizens to be here. To help shoulder the grief and share our sorrow and to offer our respectful, reassured voice to the national discourse that has erupted around this tragedy."" Moore manufactured a monster.
4) Why did his ""documentry"" have to edit speeches together? Documentries have a higher level of honesty and unmaniplulated foothage. See photos from Moore's movie:

The Peace Keeper is not manufactured anyhwere. Lockheed once made it. No one makes makes the Peace Keeper anywhere. 
ICBMs are not manufactured anywhere in this country. There has been no budget to manufacture any ICBMs in this country for at least 10 years.
There are NO nuke componets manufactured at Littleton CO. There are no ICBM's manufactued in Littleton, WERE is different from ARE. Moore's own website says so. Of course that is not the message in the movie is it?

Charlton Heston's Speech to the NRA
04 May, 1999
By Charlton Heston 
CNS Information Services
(Editor's Note: The following remarks by NRA President Charlton Heston were transcribed by CNS from a RealVideo presentation of his speech before the NRA's national meeting in Denver, Colorado May 1.)
Thank you. Thank you very much. Good morning. I am very happy to welcome you to this abbreviated annual gathering of the National Rifle Association. Thank you all for coming and thank you for supporting your organization.
I also want to applaud your courage in coming here today. Or course, you have a right to be here. As you know, we've cancelled the festivities, the fellowship we normally enjoy at our annual gatherings. This decision has perplexed a few and inconvenienced thousands. As your president, I apologize for that.
But it's fitting and proper that we should do this. Because NRA members are, above all, Americans. That means that whatever our differences, we are respectful of one another and we stand united, especially in adversity.
I have a message from the mayor, Mr. Wellington Webb, the mayor of Denver. He sent me this and said don't come here, we don't want you here. I said to the mayor, well, my reply to the mayor is, I volunteered for the war they wanted me to attend when I was 18 years old. Since then, I've run small errands for my country, from Nigeria to Vietnam. I know many of you here in this room could say the same thing. But the mayor said don't come.
I'm sorry for that. I'm sorry for the newspaper ads saying the same thing, don't come here. This is our country. As Americans, we're free to travel wherever we want in our broad land.
They say we'll create a media distraction, but we were preceded here by hundreds of intrusive news crews. They say we'll create political distraction, but it's not been the NRA pressing for political advantage, calling press conferences to propose vast packages of new legislation.
Still they say don't come here. I guess what saddens me the most is how that suggests complicity. It implies that you and I and 80 million honest gun owners are somehow to blame, that we don't care. We don't care as much as they do, or that we don't deserve to be as shocked and horrified as every other soul in America mourning for the people of Littleton.
Don't come here. That's offensive. It's also absurd because we live here. There are thousands of NRA members in Denver, and tens upon tens of thousands in the state of Colorado.
NRA members labor in Denver's factories, they populate Denver's faculties, run Denver corporations, play on Colorado sports teams, work in media across the Front Range, parent and teach and coach Denver's children, attend Denver's churches and proudly represent Denver in uniform on the world's oceans and in the skies over Kosovo at this very moment.
NRA members are in city hall, Fort Carson, NORAD, the Air Force Academy and the Olympic Training Center. And yes, NRA members are surly among the police and fire and SWAT team heroes who risked their lives to rescue the students at Columbine.
Don't come here? We're already here. This community is our home. Every community in America is our home. We are a 128-year-old fixture of mainstream America. The Second Amendment ethic of lawful, responsible firearm ownership spans the broadest cross section of American life imaginable. 
So, we have the same right as all other citizens to be here. To help shoulder the grief and share our sorrow and to offer our respectful, reassured voice to the national discourse that has erupted around this tragedy.
One more thing. Our words and our behavior will be scrutinized more than ever this morning. Those who are hostile towards us will lie in wait to seize on a soundbite out of context, ever searching for an embarrassing moment to ridicule us. So, let us be mindful. The eyes of the nation are upon us today.",2,8,topic_stance_votes_2

I guess you never watch the news. Or any other documentaries.
... and there goes the baby with the bathwater...
Show me a documentary film that doesn't edit for clarity or to make a point. That is the purpose of documentary film. If you have been watching documentaries your whole life thinking you weren't being ""manipulated"", wake up. Film is manipulative, books are manipulative, people are manipulative. There is not such thing as objectivity. The question is: whose point of view do you want to believe?
That isn't the same thing as outright fabrication. But Moore didn't photoshop Heston's face onto someone else's body, he didn't change Heston's words. Heston dug himself into his own hole.
They were rockets. Rockets that carry.... satellites. Don't you feel silly? 
From the same website I linked to above, because some people refuse to go read things themselves-
The Truth: Lockheed Martin is the largest weapons-maker in the world <suntimes_20030617.php>. The Littleton facility has been manufacturing missiles, missile components, and other weapons systems for almost half a century. In the 50s, workers at the Littleton facility constructed the first Titan intercontinental ballistic missile, designed to unleash a nuclear warhead on the Soviet Union; in the mid-80s, they were partially assembling MX missiles, instruments for the minuteman ICBM, a space laser weapon called Zenith Star, and a Star Wars program known as Brilliant Pebbles <lockheed.php>. 
In the full, unedited interview I did with the Lockheed spokesman, he told me that Lockheed started building nuclear missiles in Littleton and ""played a role in the development of Peacekeeper MX Missiles."" <movie.php?mov=lockheed-03> 
As for what's currently manufactured in Littleton, McCollum told me, ""They (the rockets sitting behind him) carry mainly very large national security satellites, some we can't talk about."" (see him say it here <movie.php?mov=lockheed-01>) 
Since that interview, the Titan IV rockets manufactured in Littleton have been critical to the war effort in both Afghanistan and Iraq. These rockets launched advanced satellites that were ""instrumental in providing command-and-control operations over Iraq...for the rapid targeting of Navy Tomahawk cruise missiles involved in Iraqi strikes and clandestine communications with Special Operations Forces."" (view source here <aviationweek.php>). 
That Lockheed lets the occasional weather or TV satellite hitch a ride on one of its rockets should not distract anyone from Lockheed's main mission and moneymaker in Littleton: to make instruments that help kill people. That two of Littleton's children decided to engineer their own mass killing is what these guys and the Internet crazies don't want to discuss. 
Well then Moore should have considered your nephew before making this movie! emoticonXRolleyes And you shouldn't let him watch Bugs Bunny, either, until he understands that cartoons aren't real- Bugs Bunny cartoons are awfully violent. 
Do you believe everything you see in cartoons are real? Do you believe that the intended audience for this film was little kids? If so, better take a reality check...
The Truth: Heston took his NRA show to Denver and did and said exactly what we recounted <movie.php?mov=heston>. From the end of my narration setting up Heston's speech in Denver, with my words, ""a big pro-gun rally,"" every word out of Charlton Heston's mouth was uttered right there in Denver, just 10 days after the Columbine tragedy. But don't take my word – read the transcript of his whole speech <heston.php>. Heston devotes the entire speech to challenging the Denver mayor and mocking the mayor's pleas that the NRA ""don't come here."" Far from deliberately editing the film to make Heston look worse, I chose to leave most of this out and not make Heston look as evil as he actually was. 
Why are these gun nuts upset that their brave NRA leader's words are in my film? You'd think they would be proud of the things he said. Except, when intercut with the words of a grieving father (whose son died at Columbine and happened to be speaking in a protest that same weekend Heston was at the convention center), suddenly Charlton Heston doesn't look so good does he? Especially to the people of Denver (and, the following year, to the people of Flint) who were still in shock over the tragedies when Heston showed up. 
As for the clip preceding the Denver speech, when Heston proclaims ""from my cold dead hands,"" this appears as Heston is being introduced in narration.  It is Heston's most well-recognized NRA image – hoisting the rifle overhead as he makes his proclamation, as he has done at virtually every political appearance on behalf of the NRA (before and since Columbine). I have merely re-broadcast an image supplied to us by a Denver TV station, an image which the NRA has itself crafted for the media, or, as one article put it, ""the mantra of dedicated gun owners"" which they ""wear on T-shirts, stamp it on the outside of envelopes, e-mail it on the Internet and sometimes shout it over the phone."" <latimes.php>. Are they now embarrassed by this sick, repulsive image and the words that accompany it? 
about documentaries- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary
some definitions of ""documentary"" from a filmmaker's perspective- from http://www.realityfilm.com/study/definitions.html
Documentary Definitions 
The word ""documentary"" poses many challenges in providing an quick definition. Here are some definitions from various reference guides and textbooks: 
""Documentary is the creative treatment of actuality.""
-- John Grierson, Cinema Quarterly 2.1, 8. 
""Documentary defines not subject or style, but approach. ... Documentary approach to cinema differs from that of story-film not in its disregard for craftsmanship, but in the purpose to which that craftsmanship is put.""
--Paul Rotha, Cinema Quarterly, 2.2, 78. 
""A non-fiction text using 'actuality' footage, which may include the live recording of events and relevant research materials (i.e. interviews, statistics, etc.). This kind of text is uually informed by a particular point of view, and seeks to address a particular social issue which is related to and potentially affects the audience.""
--Paul Wells, ""The Documentary Form: Personal and Social 'Realities,'"" An Introduction to Film Studies, 2nd ed., ed. Jill Nelmes, 212. 
""[A]ny film practice that has as its subject persons, events, or situations that exist outside the film in the real world.""
--Steve Blandford, Barry Keith Grant, and Jim Hillier, The Film Studies Dictionary, 73. 
""A nonfiction film. Documentaries are usually shot on location, use actual persons rather than actors, and focus thematically on historical, scientific, social, or environmental subjects. Their principle purpose is to enlighten, inform, educate, persuade, and provide insight into the world in which we live.""
--Frank Beaver, Dictionary of Film Terms, 119. 
""A nonfiction film about real events and people, often avoiding traditional narrative structures.""
--Timothy Corrigan, A Short Guide to Writing About Film, 4th ed., 206. 
""Film of actual events; the events are documented with the real people involved, not with actors.""
--Ralph S. Singleton and James A. Conrad, Filmmaker's Dictionary, 2nd ed., 94. 
""A documentary film purports to present factual information about the world outside the film.""
--David Bordwell and Kristin Thompson, Film Art: An Introduction, 5th ed., 42. 
""A film or video presentation of actual events using the real people involved and not actors.""
--John W. Cones, Film Finance and Distribution, 154. 
""A film that deals directly with fact and not fiction, that tries to convey reality as it is instead of some fictional version of reality. These films are concerned with actual people, places, events, or activities.""
""A type of film marked by its interpretative handling of realistic subjects and backgrounds. Sometimes the term is applied widely to include films that appear more realistic than conventional commercial pictures; at other times, so narrowly that only films with a narration track and a background of real life are so categorized.""
--Edmund F. Penney, Facts on File Film and Broadcast Terms, 73. 
""A term with a wide latitude of meaning, basically used to refer to any film or program not wholly fictional in nature.""
--James Monaco, The Dictionary of New Media, 94. 
Note that none of these definitions say ""unedited"". That is because at least half of documentary film-making is the editing process.",10,11,topic_stance_votes_1

It may be photographed in actual occurrence, or may employ partial re-enactment, stock footage, stills, animation, stop-motion or other techniques, as long as the emphasis is on fact and not on fiction.

The whole text of his speech is sympathetic to the vitcims of the shooting. Which is what Moore left out. But he left in, ""From my cold dead hands."" Which never took place in Denver. The ""Cold dead hands"" quote took place 1 year later in response to Heston receiving a gift of a musket from the NRA. The speech before he received the musket detailed how he was aware of how little time he has left to live to continue the fight. He was aware of how his health was failing and was sad to not be able to continue to serve a noble cause. As a response to his failing health and short time left on Earth, when he received the gift his reply was ""From my cold dead hands"".
""My cold dead hands"" is a sentiment of the members and of the NRA.
""Screw the people of Columbine"" is not a sentiment of the NRA. Which is clearly the message Moore is trying put into Heston's speech.

This movie isn't focused on missle payloads. This post was started to show the many fabrications of truth that were portrayed as fact in the movie.",37,38,topic_stance_votes_2
38,Bowling For Columbine....,gun control,attack,If guns were not so readily available in America there would be far less shootings. Countries like UK and Germany do not have so many shootings. Why? Because guns are illegal It's rather obvious! Well to most people with a few exceptions.,38,39,topic_stance_votes_1
39,Bowling For Columbine....,gun control,attack,So how will you make guns less available?,39,40,topic_stance_votes_2
40,Bowling For Columbine....,gun control,attack,"I cannot personally. I am not a control of America.
It is up to the American government to reduce the availability of weapons to the public. 
Prohibit the sale of weapons and ammunition except only hunting rifles from Government approved stores and with much higher prices, strictor licencing, higher taxes on weapons, etc.",40,41,topic_stance_votes_1

That they are now used in non-lethal acts (although all they are doing is hitting a different target) does not disprove this fact.",46,50,topic_stance_votes_1
50,Bowling For Columbine....,gun control,attack,"Mine must be defective. I have shot in excess of 4,000 rounds a year for the last 4 years. I have killed no one. 
How did you come up with that idea? You must be so prejudiced against firearms that you do not see any other uses for them. You are not the first example of a very prejudiced anti-gunner. Prejudice is based on irrational thought. Your above quote is irrational. You are irrational.",44,51,topic_stance_votes_2

52,Bowling For Columbine....,gun control,attack,"Hmmmm? Can you name the WMD Pentagon payload built at Lockheed that inspired the killers at Colubine?
Tell me. Do you think that any objective is justified even you have to lie and cheat to the American public to get it?
Please see the anti-gunners link in above post by Montaban. That may help you find the supposed WMD Pentagon payload that Moore says inspired the killers at Columbine.",37,53,topic_stance_votes_2

Hey my target assault rifle is NOT designed to kill. It is manufactured to such tight tollerance that it is sensitive to dirt and ammo. It is designed to punch paper surgically at long range. As a battlefield weapon it would be a piece of junk.

59,Bowling For Columbine....,gun control,attack,"I see this entire site is argueing about gun control. I know, that's the post of the thread. However, there are a few other points of the documentary that I would like to question. I posted a thread under government before knowing that ""Bowling for Columbine"" was also there, and I'm just focusing on a different point.... ANYways.
The film wasn't just about guns. It was about the fear of the people. I agree with him. We are afraid of one another. Now is that really necessary? It's one big vicious circle. We are afraid of one another, this causes to brash actions and reactions, and therefore we are even more afraid of each other.
The town I live in.. Everyone locks their doors. Well, my dad deliberatley took every single lock out of this house. We have never been robbed. So I just wondering what society is trying to tell us.
I'd just like a few more opinions on that.",59,60,topic_stance_votes_1
60,Bowling For Columbine....,gun control,attack,"Please inform the anti-gunners here that look upon Canada as a model because they do not unlock thier doors, that in the USA they do the same thing too. 
I live in a gated upscale community. I am quite safe. I sleep with a gun on the night stand next to the Bible for the same reason I wear a seat belt. Just in case.
The fear you talk about is a problem with society and should not be solved as a government program or law. You can not legislate good citizenship. At least I can not think of a good citzen anti-gun law that does not violate civil rights. The purpose of law and justice system is to punish and try to fix damages only AFTER a crime. The purpose of government is to not stand in the way of people trying to get by with life, not help or hurt people who are doing just fine. The newest crop of anti-gun good society laws simply do not work(Brady). If the violence is society is not fixed first, such a law will be going against human tide of behavior. If the law in not in the hearts of society and people, then the law is useless. Violence is a behavior problem, not a gun problem. I'll have to give credit where it is due, Brady works in well with the instant background check, but with nothing else.",60,61,topic_stance_votes_2
