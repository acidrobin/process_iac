0,Why is abortion acceptable?,abortion,support,"I have noticed arguments for allowing abortion tend to fall broadly into two camps:
Some claim that the foetus is in some way in itself different morally to a fully grown human
Others use arguments such as the 'violinist argument' to say that person A cannot be compelled to allow another person B to use A's body to sustain B's life.
Where do those believing abortion should be allowed on this forum stand?",0,1,topic_stance_votes_1

2,Why is abortion acceptable?,abortion,support,"Speaking strictly morally, it’s somewhat of both for me. I believe the fetus is in a morally different situation than a born child, and I believe that one cannot force a woman to sustain the life of another against her will and without her consent. However, it is not strictly the violinist argument, which mixes up the legal and moral aspects, and I do not start with the premise that the fetus is a ‘person’.",2,3,topic_stance_votes_2

8,Why is abortion acceptable?,abortion,support,"I believe that both play a role. There has to be a balance between a woman's right to her own body and any person's right to their own life. Before the fetus is a person worthy of rights which, for me, starts when a fetus first can gain a mental existence, then the mother's right to her own body supercedes any rights of a ""potential"" person. After the fetus becomes sufficiently a person, then its right to life supercedes the mother's right to her own body, except in cases of threats to the mother's life and severe health threats.",8,9,topic_stance_votes_2
9,Why is abortion acceptable?,abortion,attack,"I don't support it, largely because my idea of ethics is not rights-based and, essentially, I would prefer to be forced to be plugged into someone else for nine months than be killed because someone was able to cut me off in the same situation.",7,10,topic_stance_votes_1

17,Why is abortion acceptable?,abortion,attack,"The analogy is not applicable. It should read:
You, as a world famous violinist can have some random person plugged to you for nine months. You may die, and will experience physical pain and discomfort as a result of this. If you choose not to have this person plugged to you, they will die. Which do you choose?

My argument is that you should make moral decisions essentially blind to the difference between yourself and the other person. I am neither a violinist or a woman, but I think that if you abstract away from the situation, then the effects of pregnancy are considerably better than death
My point is that if the fetus is accepted as equal, then I reject the pro-choice argument based on rights.",20,21,topic_stance_votes_1
21,Why is abortion acceptable?,abortion,attack,"i would choose the option where i dont die. i agree that something is wrong with the way you worded the question
moral weight on specific situations vary from person to person. in another thread we discussed that morals are taught, and there really isnt any default morality that is common to everyone, except that which is commonly taught. because of this, one can learn to not give a lot of moral weight to abortion. people can convince themselves that there's nothing wrong with abortion, and then morality isnt an issue.
beyond that, there is a default instinct of survival, both personally and for the species in general, that i believe is present in humans as in all other living things. most of what we consider to be moral really are just scenarios that fit into the survival instinct. for example, killing is considered morally wrong because it thrathens the species survival. stealing is considered morally wrong because it threatens the need for security. 
while abortion does threaten the survival of the species, it also threatens the personal need of comfort and security. and in cases like these, morality is ambiguous",14,22,topic_stance_votes_2
22,Why is abortion acceptable?,abortion,attack,"See my post above. Were I to treat the fetus as equal, I still would not believe it can be attached to the woman against her will.",21,23,topic_stance_votes_2
23,Why is abortion acceptable?,abortion,support,"The question is whether we as a society want to wrest dominion over the ovum from the female of the species whom God gave it to and hand it over to a government. On religious grounds I oppose that. 
I do not know what the Creator intended when he decided to have the female carry the ovum instead of having us hatched, but I figure that if he trusts the female with that obligation then I trust the female as well – at least more than a government. 
We cannot give the government control of the procreation process. If the government has a right to impose compulsory gestation and forced parturition, then it must also have the right to impose mandatory termination as well. God gave responsibility to the female of the species and it is between the female, the husband, God, their family and their spiritual advisors, not politicians.",23,24,topic_stance_votes_2
24,Why is abortion acceptable?,abortion,support,But god gave us both male and female and the minds that would inevitably lead to a system of government. He knew the issue would come up so arguably he wants this debate and one choice or the other anyway. Its not possible to decide one way or the other based on what God wants.,24,25,topic_stance_votes_2
25,Why is abortion acceptable?,abortion,support,"I agree. God will take care of the baby after it is born, so momentary discomfort is the only issue. 
I think making moral decisions blind to the difference between ourselfs and others, not looking to our own interest first is good, but I'm worried it leads to communism, which is bad.
God bless.",21,26,topic_stance_votes_1
26,Why is abortion acceptable?,abortion,support,"I was not basing anything on what “God wanted”, I was basing things on what God did – place the ovum in the body of the female and giving her dominion over it. That isn’t difficult for me to discern. You are basing your statement on what God wants, “so arguably he wants this debate”. I agree that we are having the debate – and I am taking a position in that debate, namely that it is not the belief that it is in the best interest of our species to remove the responsibility for the ovum from the female of the species and hand that power over to a government. I believe that the power of government should be limited on some things and the right to impose compulsory gestation and forced parturition or mandatory termination is not something I would like us to hand to a government.",25,27,topic_stance_votes_2
27,Why is abortion acceptable?,abortion,support,"Ok then - God did give us minds that ended us up here, and the ability to alter the original action. Why is it more likely that God put the ovum in the female body and then built a male one so that it would naturally dominate in early societies if the intention was not for man, or the society to be the ones who are really responsible.
Seems nasty to me, but I'm not God (..yet ;)) so who am I do guess what the original intentions were?
I agree with you in general but for different reasons (well probably not, but as far as these current positions go)",27,28,topic_stance_votes_2
28,Why is abortion acceptable?,abortion,attack,"Sure. Nice principal. But you should not make those decisions blind to the surrounding circumstances. Pregancy is certainly better than death. But how does this mean that the woman should be required to be pregnant? Why should she be required to provide support for the baby? Sure, it will die if she doesnt. But we aren't, nor should we be required to do things against our will to attempt to ensure as many people as possible live. We aren't all required to donate a percentage of our wages to charity. We aren't required to spend time as aid workers in developing nations, and we aren't required to be pregnant to give someone else a chance at life.
I don't feel that this principal is broadly applicable.",19,29,topic_stance_votes_2
29,Why is abortion acceptable?,abortion,support,"This is based on utilitarian principles which I reject
a) Value is subjective. A feti's death or an mother's forced pregnancy are not inherently ""good"" or ""bad"", they are a matter of personal judgement. A legal system based on your ideas of good or bad is merely the imposition of your value system onto others who do not share it.
b) Interpersonal calculations of utility are impossible, because utility is subjective - it has no units of measurement - not even the subatomic particles known as utils. The fact person A dies and person B finds a penny allows us to say nothing about whether people overall are better off. Pareto optimality is the only criterion that renders such a statement meaningful, and forcing someone to do something is rarely pareto optimal.
c) We have a limited ability to predict the future, so even if problem b) did not exist, we would have no way of knowing which course of action would lead to the greatest benefit for all people.
d) You seem to think of the law as a sort of divine intervention that transforms human action into accordance with moral code. Legislation is a threat, nothing more. You are not saying ""Women should not have abortions"", you are saying ""Women should not have abortions, and those that do should be imprisoned"". The likely repercussions of thinking of state power in this fashion is the creation of a dystopia. Even assuming a), b) and c) were not insurmountable problems in their own right, and we could add up all the utils in the world and had precise knowledge of the future consequences of our actions, we would need to incorporate into this sum the cost of the abortion-police, abortion-jails, including lost productivity from young mothers-to-be who now have a jail term and a criminal record, psychological costs to friends and relatives, etc. ""Sorry kids, your mum's in jail, because I have calculated that a fetus life is worth more than a pregnancy, there is now a dead fetus AND your mum is in jail, the best of both worlds. You can go work as slaves on plantations now, since I have calculated that slavery is less bad than the 6 Rwandan's lives you will save. Don't try to escape or We'll shoot you - we're creating a moral world"". This is the result of the consistent application of the principles you put forward.
e) Finally a charge of hypocrisy, you are posting on this board instead of saving lives, by your own principles you should be legally punished for this action. A system which by its own principles should have advocacy of it punished seems to me to have inherent problems.
In contrast, a rights based system built on the principle of self-ownership does not carry these problems - it is firstly value-free, and so compatible with the subjectivity of value, it does not attempt impossible interpersonal calculations of utility, it does not require any knowledge of the future, it can be consistently advocated, and it does not require a totalitarian state apparatus to enforce.",29,30,topic_stance_votes_2

33,Why is abortion acceptable?,abortion,attack,"Actually, the idea of being essentially blind to the difference between Self and Other exists in deontological ethics, religious ethics... for this reason I am ignoring (b) and (c) which belong in a utilitariansim debate.
Well, of value is subjective, you can't say me imposing my value system is wrong
I'm talking about the ethics of abortion, and whether the personhood of the fetus is the ultimate issue. Not about practical legislation
The concept I could be out there saving lives is a tad oversimplistic. And even if I could, the idea that there would be no point when arguing such principles would:
1) cause good by spreading ethics
2) be harmless as nothing better can be done
In any case, at a practical level there is a difference, just as there is a difference between watching someone drown because you don't want to get wet and failing to volunteer to drive lifeboats
If it is morally binding, its not value free. It requires mental gymnastics which lead to clearly non-optimum solutions (such as having to starve someone to death rather than directly kill them, use a more damaging treatment that stops the woman supprorting the fetus rather than killing it etc.) The rest of your points seem to assume my

There is no cut and dry fetus vs. mother “ultimate issue” with regard to abortion. There are situations when abortion is a perfectly ethical choice and there are situations when it is not. If a family discovered that their baby had brown eyes and they wanted a baby with blue eyes and therefore decided to abort the fetus, that might be arguably unethical.
