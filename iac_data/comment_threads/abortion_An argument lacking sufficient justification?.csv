0,An argument lacking sufficient justification?,abortion,support,"I think the argument that a woman has the right to determine what is done with her bodily 
resources during pregnancy lacks justification. For those who do:
Do you assume that this is an absolute right and the moral good at any 
time and in every circumstance (even before the 14th amendment existed 
and even in countries where it does not apply)?
Do you agree that breast milk is a bodily resource of the mother?
If the answers to these questions are yes:
Imagine a time when artificial formula did not exist. According to this reasoning it would be legitimate for a woman who suddenly decided she did not want to donate her bodily resources to withhold nutrition until the infant died. In fact, she should be able to dispose of that tissue some call infants through any of the same means as done in abortions (that would be sticking scissors in the head, burning, ect). Infanticide would be a moral option for any woman who does not wish to donate bodily fluids to her newborn “parasite” and does not have access to formula at any moment because of various reasons. I am sure there are women in the world today who do not have access to formula. Are these women justified in deeming these babies as life unworthy of life and disposing of them?

The 14th Amendment:
Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. 
Section 2. Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age,(See Note 15) and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State. 
Section 3. No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.

3,An argument lacking sufficient justification?,abortion,support,"Sorry Jim's Trucking, please allow me clarify.
The belief that a woman has a right to abort because she is granted under the 14th amendment the right to do what she wishes with her bodily resources lacks sufficient justification.
This belief is based upon a common pro-choice interpretation of the 14th amendment. Some say that these rights include the right to choose to abort a pregnancy. They say that this right is afforded under the 14th amendment (ie: ...nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law...). It is applied to say that a woman has a right to do what she wishes with her bodily resources. 
For this to be a consistent pro-choice argument, and assuming this to be a rightful interpretation and application of the 14th amendment there would be necessary conclusions. Those who hold this as an absolute belief must extend the right of a woman’s right to choose the allocation of her bodily resources beyond pregnancy and into every instance of life. Therefore the pro-choice line of reasoning that says that a woman has the right to choose to abort because she does not wish do share her bodily resources can be extended to conclude also that a newborn infant can be aborted if a woman decides not to donate her bodily resource of nutrition and she has no access to formula (no other factors involved).",3,4,topic_stance_votes_1
4,An argument lacking sufficient justification?,abortion,attack,"The Due Process Clause is cited in response to the pro-life assertion that the gov't should have the power to force a woman to donate bodily resources against her will and without her consent.
Mr. Justice Harlan once wrote: ""[T]he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution. This `liberty' is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property; the freedom of speech, press, and religion; the right to keep and bear arms; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures; and so on. It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints . . . and which also recognizes, what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must, that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment."" 
Justice Potter Stewart, a judge on the Roe v Wade case said in his concurring opinon: ""Several decisions of this Court make clear that freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage and family life is one of the liberties protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. . . . As recently as last Term, in Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438, 453, we recognized ""the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child."" "" 
That right necessarily includes the right of a woman to decide whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.
That is an erroneous line of reasoning because it fails to take into account the myriad of other options open to a women after birth to remove the newborn from her care without any ill effects (physically anyway). Killing in the instance of a newborn is not justified because of those other options open to her. By contrast, a pregnant woman has exactly one option open to her to remove the fetus from her care and that is abortion. I would contend that the same line of reasoning that allows for adoption can be used here, that no one must donate their resources to a dependant.
Your reasoning that a woman, using the same line of reasoning that pro-choice people employ, can withhold her bodily resources ""until the newborn dies"" as if that is equal to withholding bodily resources in pregnancy is faulty.",4,5,topic_stance_votes_2

No, infantcide is vastly different from abortion. The existance of the myriad of options open after birth versus the existance of one option during pregnancy to remove the dependant from your care are not comparable.
The pro-choice argument applies to today's world, chloe, and usually what we talk about is the United States. What you are talking about is more philosophical and has no bearing on abortion today. Even if you show pro-choice arguments were hypocritical and inconsistant (which you haven't, and I really don't believe you can) hundreds, thousands, or millions of years ago, you have accomplished nothing but show that the world was different hundreds, thousands, or millions of years ago.
What argument is that? I'm afraid I've lost track.
What have I done to disprove myself?
It is consistent after birth. Part of the argument is that a woman should not have to donate bodily resources, the argument is not asking to kill indiscriminately. The desire is for choice of whether to share the body, not the desire to kill. After birth, the woman can give the baby up for adoption, give it to friends, to strangers, leave it with a fire-station or hospital under Safe Haven laws, etc. All of those fufill the desire to not have to donate bodily resources without harming the baby.
There perhaps are. But any situation I can think of where there is literally no choice is an extreme and specific situation. To use something like that and say ""there, see, you're wrong"" is really dishonest and does nothing to address the issue.",13,21,topic_stance_votes_2

If I provided an example that was worthy enough to win your approval what would your answer be? Pleease Sigma? C'mon just answer for cryin out loud :) 
Yes, a consistant pro-choice view is that a woman would be justified in killing a newborn baby, or ""allowing it to starve"" (to be politically incorrect) if she did not want to offer her bodily resources as nutrition and if there were no other options.

I asked earlier:
What makes anyone who is pro-choice so confident that the argument holds true in the case of pregnancy?
To which you replied:
What I was referring to was the belief that pro-choicers hold that it is morally ok to have an abortion soley because the woman does not want to donate her bodily resources.

However, you can simply state that my stance is a moral miscalculation. How can either of us prove this? 
Could not the pro-life stance be one of simple moral miscalculation as well? How can one know one way or the other? Why not simply allow those that can morally have abortions to have them if they so wish?
I answered already: Yes, I would answer if the example you provided applied.
Having no other options after childbirth in the sense you are talking about would be an extreme situation and is not a fair criticism of the pro-choice argument. It would be akin to me asking you ""If you knew that you were pregnant with a child that would grow up to kill hundreds of thousands of people and usher in a age of darkness and immorality the likes of which you've never seen, would you have an abortion?"". Whether you answer yes or no, it is an unfair question about an unrealistic and extreme circumstance that does not address the issue.
You're right, it was ""ok"" to them. It was not ""ok"" to us, and we used our military power to stop them. What is your point?
No, that is not the whole of the pro-choice argument. It is only part of the argument that women should not have to donate their bodily resources. Another part is that the gov't should not have the power to force women to continue their pregnancy against their will. The gov't should not have the power to violate individual rights, even to ensure the survival of another. The gov't is not and should not be in the business of enforcing morality. It is unconstitutional to institute a national ban on abortion. Motherhood should not be entered into because one has no other choice. Etc. The arguments range from political to philosophical to legal to biological to medical.
You say If they grant that it is possible for an instance where the claim might not be true, I just can't understand what makes them so confident this the argument holds true in the case of pregnancy.
Like I said before, there is virtually no argument that is true in all instances. There are extreme situations where most pro-life people would say that abortion is the right choice.

46,An argument lacking sufficient justification?,abortion,attack,"Hi zachvac. We were discussing this claim:
The belief that a woman has a right to abort because she is granted under the 14th amendment the right to do what she wishes with her bodily resources lacks sufficient justification.
This belief is based upon a common pro-choice interpretation of the 14th amendment. Some say that these rights include the right to choose to abort a pregnancy. They say that this right is afforded under the 14th amendment (ie: ...nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law...). It is applied to say that a woman has a right to do what she wishes with her bodily resources. 
For this to be a consistent pro-choice argument, and assuming this to be a rightful interpretation and application of the 14th amendment there would be necessary conclusions. Those who hold this as an absolute belief must extend the right of a woman’s right to choose the allocation of her bodily resources beyond pregnancy and into every instance of life. Therefore the pro-choice line of reasoning that says that a woman has the right to choose to abort because she does not wish do share her bodily resources can be extended to conclude also that a newborn infant can be aborted if a woman decides not to donate her bodily resource of nutrition and she has no access to formula (no other factors involved).
Why should they? Persons in the womb should have the right to life unless they were PROVEN not to be human life. 
Right, we should recognize the rights of all the men and women regardless of their size or location (this would include men and women living in the womb). 
Why is that?
There are moral absolutes, and therefore a way to tell right from wrong. 
I too think the mother should have control of her own body, as well as the father his own body. I just don't think they should have control over the person in the womb (ie: the right to abort it) that is not their body.

Because my own personal morals compel me to fight for women's rights. You seem to have a problem with the concept of personal morals. The lack of objective morals does not preclude personal morals.
I would be upset, because I believe a woman's right to her body should be greater than what is growing inside her. 
I do not believe so, no. When will you drop this Nazi line of reasoning?
Ok, wow, you're really getting out there. This board is about abortion, not philosophy. Laws keep our society together, punishment for their abridgement ensures (or tries to ensure) that the number of those who break them remain low. 
Agreed. If Hitler had won he would have been the winner. By definition :)
It isn't right or wrong objectively. My own personal morals say whether or not it is right or wrong to me. 
You are trying to draw a moral comparison between vastly different situations, that of a fetus and a born child. There is no reasonable comparison.
I am certain abortion is morally allowable to me. I do not believe it is right or wrong objectively.
You may be right? No, I know my own morals better than you do :)
In any case of uncertainty, I side with women's rights. We know for certain that she is a person, that she is a citizen, and that she deserves rights. To make her a second class citizen to an uncertainty as you wish to do is unreasonable.

I answered this before, yet you didn't respond. Does that mean you can't answer what I said about it, so you are trying it on someone new? That's pretty amusing emoticonXClown 
You misunderstand what the 14th amendment does in relation to abortion. It does not apply as you state here. 
You are assuming America, since you are using the Constitution. In America, women do have the choice after birth to remove the newborn from her care. Adoption, safe-haven laws, leaving it with family and friends etc. all ensure a woman can remove the newborn from her care without any physical ill effects.
Human life? Nothing hinges on whether it is human life. Those in the womb are not ""persons"" whether or not it is proven to be human life. 
Even if we did, none should have more rights than anyone else. Those ""living in the womb"" should not have the right to live off another without their desire or consent. I do not have that right, you do not have that right, the fetus does not have that right. 
If they do exist, how are we to know them? According to these moral absolutes, perhaps I am right and you are wrong. In the case of uncertainty, we should side with the woman, given we know she is a citizen and is deserving of rights.

Sigma,
You are all about women’s rights, as am I. However, our difference seems be that when you say that you are for a woman’s right to choose that you are really saying you are for a certain group of women’s right to choose (ie: those women who are a certain age, size, development). You are discriminating against the women (and men) in the womb. They have the same rights as every other woman. You are discriminating on the basis of size and environment. This was the same thing that happened in the holocaust, slavery, and other genocides. These people had their ""personhood"" status stripped from them on the basis of those who viewed them as ""underdeveloped"" race. And it wasn't just race specific. The handicapped were aborted on this basis as well.",48,49,topic_stance_votes_1
49,An argument lacking sufficient justification?,abortion,attack,"Sorry it takes me so long to reply, I am at work :)
And I disagree :) Exactly how do we get past this impasse?
Truly? Every poll I've seen puts the majority of America closer to pro-choice than pro-life. Could you please back this up? No pro-life site, please, they have no credibility. 
Then I admit it. If you had asked that in the beginning I could have cleared that up :) If Hitler lived in a world where everyone agreed with him then no one would say he is wrong. 
Think of it this way, with the old philosophical question: If a tree falls in the forest and no-one is around, does it make a sound? ""Sound"" is a label we have created; it requires an ear to exist just as morals require the human mind to exist. The vibrations exist, but whether they are ""loud"" or ""soft"", ""pleasant"" or ""unpleasant"" is a completely subjective experience.
The vibrations exist objectively, just as Hitlers actions exist objectively. He killed (or caused to die, or ordered killed, or however you want me to phrase it) millions. Whether these actions are ""right"" or ""wrong"" exist totally within the mind of those viewing the actions.
Certainly, if there was a law banning abortion I would think it was both of those things.
I have laid it out for you and others before. When a child is born there are a myriad of different options open to the woman to remove that infant from her care either temporarily or permanently without harming the infant. There is exactly one choice to remove the fetus from the woman’s care during pregnancy and that is abortion. A situation where there are many options open that does not harm anyone cannot be directly compared to a situation where there is no other option.
In a certain sense, yes. The 14th amendment has no authority in the Sudan, so the legal argument of “right to abortion” does not apply outside our own country.
It has been ruled so.
That does not follow. Those on welfare do not live off of your bodily resources and you do not provide complete organ support for them as the woman does for the fetus. You do not provide the body for them as the woman does for the fetus. 
You will ignore it, as other pro-life people do when I suggest this. Pro-life people flatly do not want women to be able to control their own body in this matter. There are some, such as yourself, that think themselves clever saying “but it’s not her body it’s the fetus’ body!”, but that’s just empty rhetoric. If it were true then the woman would still be allowed to deny the fetus her own bodily resources. 
You have given no evidence of this. You argue solely for fetal rights, while I am arguing for women’s rights. If you were concerned for women’s rights, you would not argue that they should be removed, reduced, or violated by the gov’t in favor of what is growing inside her.
Are you serious? A fetus in the womb cannot make a choice, it has no concept of choice. No legislation or lack of legislation can change this. It is dishonest to lay this charge at the feet of those who are pro-choice, and I am disgusted that you attempted to make this point.
There is plenty of precedence to show that those who cannot make decisions have their decisions made by others, usually closest kin. In this case it is the mother who has that right.
Your charge has no basis. To back up this argument you would have to show that it is wrong for others to make decisions for those who cannot make decisions.
“Personhood” was never stripped of the fetus; the Supreme Court ruled that it was never considered a “person” under the Constitution. Slavery is more closely aligned with the pro-life argument, since they wish for women to have no choice in whether they will remain pregnant and give birth to a child. Slaves had every aspect of their lives chosen for them, including their reproductive lives. Are you making my point for me? Shall women be slaves?",49,50,topic_stance_votes_2

90,An argument lacking sufficient justification?,abortion,attack,"My essay:
“They are endowed by their creator with certain inailiable rights...”
Edowed: inherited through existence
Inalienable: incapable of being alienated, surrendered, or transferred
We have heard these words many times and have undoubtedly passed over them a time or two. However, it is necessary and vital that we pause and consider these words which reflect much about the governmental paradigm our forefathers and the worldview which shaped this nation. 
We hold these truths to be self evident.  
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.
Our forefathers viewed these (all assumptions underlying the previous statements) as truths which were observable (self-evident) and indisputable. They viewed that there are certain rights that transcend society and culture. This phrase, which comes straight from the declaration of independence and is revisited in the constitution, is the cornerstone of our constitution. Therefore, it can be said that this concept (that there are transcendent rights endowed by someone higher than government) is the foundation of our entire government. In the declaration we read the very purpose of the structure of government as viewed by our forefathers. The purpose of government is:
That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,  
Because these rights (life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness) transcend all of humanity, we must recognize that it is any government’s responsibility to secure those rights for all members of the human race. 
So where do these rights come from?
Well, if you ask a theist they will say they were endowed by God (the creator). If you ask a naturalist they will say they were created in the mind of man (endowed by nature). If you ask a transcendentalist they will say they were endowed by the force, Luke. However, rarely will someone who is reasonable deny they exist. Wherever you might like to say these rights originate, you are foolish to deny the existence of these certain inalienable rights (if not for the sheer purpose and means of self preservation!).
It is essential to recognize that these rights do not come from government but are merely recognized by government. Therefore, we conclude that since they do not come from government, they should not be taken away by government.
Let us examine these rights.
We should be careful to observe any place where the concept of rights is mentioned in the documents. In observing we must look and seek to understand each right in the light and context of this statement: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. 
First, let us examine the right to life. It is interesting to note that this right is mentioned first, and that it is mentioned first for a reason. The right to exist is a fundamental right. Once one obtains the genetic code that is specific to the human race, one exists. From this point on one has a right to continue to exist and this right no one can dispute.
Now, lets examine the right to liberty. What is liberty? What is true freedom? Bottom line, this must be defined as free choice in every circumstance. However, does the possibility exist that there is a type of liberty which transcends all of the experiences of mankind? Is there an ultimate freedom which frees mankind from oppression? I leave this for the reader to examine.
Finally, the right to the pursuit of happiness. This is the “whatever floats your boat” right. Happiness is different things to different people and has been viewed as a celebration of individuality. However, is it possible that a true and ultimate happiness exists which transcends all of mankind? A certain happiness that enthralls men and brings them unsurpassing joy? Again, I leave this for the reader to examine.
An understood and observed logical hierarchy of rights.
We can observe within the constitution and declaration a hierarchy of rights. This hierarchy is based upon one foundational right and that is the right to life. All rights derive themselves from this fundamental right. It is reasonable to say that without this right there would be no other rights. 
For example, let us consider one scenario within the constitution. We have the right to bare arms. This right would not exist were it not for (partly) a right to defend oneself. The right to defend one’s self would not exist were it not for the right to liberty and property. The right to liberty and property would not exist were it not for the right to life (were it not for the right of a human to continue to exist).
It is reasonable for one to acknowledge that in order to be happy one must be free to be happy(whatever one’s definition of happiness), and in order for one to be free to be happy one must exist to be free.
What happens when the rights of two persons appear be in conflict?  
Upon casual reading one may conclude that all rights are of equal quality. However, this cannot be the case. It must be noted that the right to life is of a different quality of all other rights. The right to life is a right of sanctity and dignity while the right to happiness is a right which determines the quality of that sanctity and dignity. 
Whenever we see a confliction of rights within our culture there is always a right which takes precedent. Your right to bare arms stops with my right to defend myself. A rapist’s right to happiness stops with the victim’s right to liberty. A murderer’s right to happiness stops with the victim’s right to life. In every conflict of rights, it is necessary that the more fundamental right take precedent. 
Let us a look at the mother’s right to choose whether or not to donate her bodily resources vs. the baby in the womb’s right to life (the right to continue to exist). The conflict of rights between the mother’s right to happiness and freedom may sometimes be in conflict with the baby’s right to life. Comparing these to rights as equal is impossible and unreasonable. The right to life is of a different quality then all of the other rights. The right to life is the assumption of all other rights, and to assume it to be equal to any other right is to commit a fallacy.
When it comes to a fundamental right to life(the sanctity and dignity of a human life) vs. a right to happiness (the quality and personal desires of a human life). Which one should win? Well which one is more fundamental? Upon the fundamental right to life hang all other rights bestowed upon humanity and all laws which government can ethically mandate.
So, my question remains:  
Why is there even an option of abortion (other then when the baby’s right to continue to exist conflicts with the mother’s right to continue to exist)?
Here is what I think. Those whose transcendent fundamental right to life is being trampled upon are being denied their right to life because they have no voice. Neither do they have the power to stand up for themselves. They are the most innocent among us. They are the weakest of the weak. They are the smallest of the small. Therefore no one notices when fundamental incomparable right to life is denied to these voiceless human beings. While so many are choosing the road of selfishness in exchanging another’s right to continue to exist for their own posh lifestyle and convenience, let those who have a voice and a heart cry out for equal justice under law for all. 
There may come a day when out of duty America’s citizens must make application of this statement found in the declaration.
That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.

I do not agree. That it was mentioned first speaks more of the writers alliterative desires than anything else. As you mentioned above, rights are recognized by the gov't, and the gov't does not recognize ""rights of the unborn"". Nowhere in the Constitution is there any clear indication that any freedoms were meant to extend to those in the womb.
What is your point here?
What is your point here?
Rights do not ""derive"" themselves from the right to life. One does not have other rights because one has the right to life. If the right to live is taken away, it does not mean the other rights are taken away. 
Perhaps, perhaps not. There is no A-B-C connection here.
Again, this is false. We don't have other rights because of the right to life.
Agreed, one must live to be free, but the right to live is not a prerequisite. It's absence would be peculiar, but there is no dependence of rights here.
Especially in the case of pregnancy. In most cases, both rights can be upheld but that is not the case in pregnancy. One or the other's rights must necessarily be reduced or removed.
I disagree that the right to life is a different quality right.
No, not always.
What? Defending oneself has little do to with other's right to bear arms. It is only if someone is attempting to use that arm against you is there conflict.
There is no right to happiness. There is a right to freedom (spelled out in many amendments), but no right to happiness. You are right that the rapist's right to freedom of action stops where it interfere's with the woman's right to freedom of action. In fact, the rapists right to life stops where it interferes with the woman's freedom of action.
Again, there is no right to happiness. A person's right to freedom of action does stop where it interfere's with another's right.
There is no fundamental right. If you needed to attach yourself to someone else in order to live, your right to life is not greater than another's right to freedom of action. There is no right to live attached to another person. When your right to live is in conflict with another, right to life does not automatically take precedence.
The fetus currently has no right to live, and there is no right to live attached to another person.
Your premise is false. The right to life is not an assumption of all other rights. The right to life is not of a different quality than all other rights. If the fetus had the right to live, comparing the rights as equal is unreasonable, but only because of the circumstances of the pregnancy relationship. One right must take precedence.
So you wish to speak for them? A good and noble goal, except you forget that when you speak for the fetus you are also speaking for the woman. The arrogance and disrespect inherent in deciding for those who have every ability and right to choose for themselves is abhorrent. The right to life is not more fundamental than the right of everyone to make decisions for themselves. When they are in conflict, depending on the circumstances, it is decided in favor of one or the other.
Selfishness is not illegal, so what justice do you speak of? You wish to punish women for selfishness, you wish to force women to be selfless? Is forced selflessness really selfless? 
Yet you gloss over the fact that the gov't must reduce, remove, and violate woman's rights to get toward the end you wish. I would say that is destructive of those ends. Currently, the gov't violates no-one's rights, not even the fetus' rights. The gov't does not perform abortions. To ban them the gov't must violate women's rights and the gov't does not have the power to do this. The gov't may or may not have an interest in preserving the life of the fetus but if they must violate other's rights to do so then it cannot act.

if you are dead then you don’t have any rights. You must exist and continue to exist in order to have any right and to continue to have any right. A gov must make it first priority to secure the right to continue to exist (right to life) in order to secure any other rights. If someone takes another person’s life they not only deny them their right to life, but also every other conceivable right.
i think it is. It is the cornerstone upon which all other rights rest upon. You remove that the house falls. You cant compare any other right with the right to life because it is of a different quality.

You are condemning me for “speaking for those women” yet you allow that they can speak for those in the womb(some of whom are women). You say that because they (those in the womb) are incapable of voicing or exercising their rights that those rights do not exist. Yet, we both know that these rights exist even if they cant be voiced or exercised. This is inconsistent.

Not quite true, since wishes put down before death can apply after death.
Also, not having a right to life does not automatically make you dead, which is my point. You can have other rights without having a right to life, there is no requirement to have the right to life before any other right. Given how fundamental you believe it is, it does not appear anywhere in the Constitution let alone as an all-important right that the gov't can violate all others for.
Yes, but you do not need the right to life. I notice you keep saying ""exist"" instead of ""life"". Somewhat amusing, since you place so much stock in exactly how things are stated.
The phrase ""Life, Liberty & the Pursuit of Happiness"" was set forth in the Declaration of Independence. As such, these rights are not legally protected by the federal gov't.
True, but that in no way proves that the right to life is a prerequisite to having other rights, only that when you die you cannot consciously exercise rights (even if you can still have them).
You have not proven it is of a different quality. The right to live does not trump all other rights, it can be violated and it can be less important than other rights.
It is the basis of our society. The notion that there is one over-riding interest of the government and they can violate any individual right they wish in order to persue that is the antithesis of our value system. The system you are describing is fascism.
There is no right to happiness. Liberty is spelled out in many amendments and my existance on these boards to not threaten that in any way. If it did, then we would have to examine the circumstances of that and my existence on these boards may indeed be terminated.
It does not have any more value.
Or... in my system the fetus' (currently non-existent) right to life would not be more important than the woman's liberty. Given that the woman is a citizen and that forcing her to continue the pregnancy would violate her rights, the gov't cannot and should not act. The woman can and should choose for herself.
You have not. You have simply stated ""the right to life is of a different quality"" but have not provided evidence, only examples. I have also provided examples where the right to life is not more important than another's freedom of action.
I could have guessed ;)
No human has the right to continue their life attached to another person. None. No-one. No how. Not even the fetus.
And I believe I am right. If I did not have the right to live, at this very moment, it would not mean my other rights disappear. I would not die the moment I did not have the right to live. My right to bear arms would not be affected, my right to a trial by jury would not be affected and my right to free speech would not be affected. In fact, nothing would change, given that the ""right to life"" does not appear as a right in the Constitution, taking away this implied right will in no way affect the rights I do have.
To continue, the fact that the gov't would be violating her rights to force her to continue the pregnancy means that the gov't cannot and should not be involved.
I repeat: selfishness is not illegal, so no law applies. Why do you wish to punish women for being selfish?
No, the right to life does not automatically trump freedom.
The gov't does not and should not have the power to make the decision for the woman.
There is much precedence where those who cannot speak for themselves have closest kin speak for them. In this case, that is the woman. No other should have the legal or moral authority to speak for the fetus. The woman also has the moral and legal authority to speak for herself.
No, I am saying those rights do not exist and they would be incapable of exercising them should they have them. If they did, the woman would still have the moral authority to exercise the decisions on their behalf. The gov't should have no involvment.
Whether the fetus has the right to life or not is really meaningless, given the circumstances. Even if it did, it would not have the right to live attached to the woman against her will and without her consent. No one has that right.
The gov't is not violating the fetus' (currently non-existent) rights. The gov't does not perform abortions. The gov't cannot and should not get involved. The Supreme Court ruled that the gov't has no place in deciding one way or the other about a woman's most intimate part of her life.
You say the gov't exists to protect our rights, yet you advocate the gov't violating women's rights in the most invasive of ways. Currently, the gov't violates no-ones rights. In order to protect the fetus' (currently non-existent) rights, it would have to violate hers. Because the gov't cannot Constitutionally do this, the gov't has no power to act in this case.
If the gov't were to ban abortion, it would be violating the woman's rights, which, as you said: That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.

Substantive rights are general rights that give the individual the power to possess or to do certain things despite the government’s desire to the contrary. These are rights like freedom of speech and religion. Substantive due process requires sufficient governmental justification to take these away, reagardless of the process used to remove them.

Substantive due process also protects us from arbitrary use of gov't power.

This ordinance recognized only a few categories of related individuals as a family. A woman lived in East Cleveland with her son and her two grandsons, who were first cousins rather than brothers.

But where are these rights? What rights are they? Who knows?...the judges are supposed to tell us.
The judges are supposed to interept the constitution...this is true. But the question is, do we use the ""living"" constitution idea or the idea of using the text as it was written when it was written. If you do the latter then there is not question that substantive due process doesn't exist. If it does exist then the judges make up something and assumed a power not granted to them. How can the judges say that ""due process"" means ""due substance"" when the people that created had no intention of this?

SCOTUS has original jurisdiction when we the people submit cases. It's appellate jurisdiction can be regulated by Congress. Exactly how can they run amok? Their power is directly proportional to how much we trust them to be impartial.
I am much more afraid of Congress and the President sharing the same political ideology. The fact that this president did not use his veto power even once in his first term scares me.

The Supreme Court does decide what rights are fundamental enough to warrant sufficient gov’t justification, you are correct.
Substantive due process brings us closer to the idea of the Constitution how it was written when it was written more than anything else. The Constitution was designed to limit Congressional legislative power; substantive due process does the exact same thing.
Who decides what the intention of the Constitution is? The Supreme Court. You said yourself: The judges are supposed to interept the constitution...this is true. The intention of the Constitution is clear: the gov't is not to have any more power over us than is listed in the Constitution. The “substantive due process” interpretation is exactly in line with this.
It is completely within the spirit of the Constitution and of the due process clause. It is also well within the Supreme Court’s power.
Correct. The Supreme Court decides what rights are fundamental enough to require sufficient justification to take away in addition to the procedure of law.
You’re absolutely right, that is not the power of the court and it shouldn’t be. However, that is not substantive due process. Substantive due process would only protect that as a right if it was a recognized right. Your example does not fit very well because a free cheeseburger as a right would not be in the Constitution.
Agreed, that is how to make laws.
This is exactly how it still is. Substantive due process is a basic concept that is perfectly within the power of the Court to assume. It protects freedoms and rights from being arbitrarily taken away, even if the law was legally made. Such freedoms as the freedom of speech cannot be taken away from us without a good reason. This interpretation gives us more protection by requiring Congress to not only create a law but provide a ""compelling need"" in order to strip us of certain rights.

Under the ""Fundamental Rights"" theory, where the Court adopts whatever substantive rights it thinks are so basic, natural and fundamental that they must be protected even without reliance on any particular provision of the Constitution. Instead the Court is said to root these guarantees directly in the word ""Liberty"" in the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause
So are you gonna help me lobby :p
This is not the case. Substantive due process has to have a living constitution in order to be maintained. A nonliving constitution would be a legal document that can't be changed (without amendments). So everything is right there. Substantive due process allows courts to decide which rights can't be taken away without good reason and which can't. The judges also get to decide what good reason is. It doesn't say in the constitution what good reason is and it doesn't say what rights can't be taken away. In fact, it doesn't say anything about substantive due process at all!

Without due process of law means just that...the procedures of law (such as trail by jury) to take away life, liberty, or property. This was put in for a reason, to show you can have life taken away like the death penalty, liberty taken away like being incarsarated(sp), or property taken away like a fine. A very simple term. Now, substantive due process may be a good idea...but that doesn't mean it is in there. To get this changed the judge can't assume the power to do so but has to be given it by amending the constitution.
This brings me to abortion. There is nothing in the constitution about abortion. In fact, when all the amendments were written abortion was illegal (well most of them). So what makes one think that the 14th amendment on back meant abortion? The orginalist theory that I keep talking about says when it was written and what was written. Like my death penalty example. How can one say they meant to apply abortion when the amendment was created? One needs the living constitution in order to fulfill this. The amendments grow to apply abortion due to what the judges think. We can't say that amendments grow into something else when we have no standards to base this on. How do judges know the ""standards of decency""? You can change a law...such as make abortion ok...just by asking the congress to do so. How can 9 judges say what something means now when it didn't mean it back when written? The death penalty is ok now..but will it not be constitutional in 10 years? Who decides this? What standards, what criterion?",123,124,topic_stance_votes_1
124,An argument lacking sufficient justification?,abortion,attack,"How is the Constitution changed? Interpreting the due process clause to mean that certain rights require justification to strip from us does not change the Constitution in the slightest.
Your exaggerations weaken your point. These freedoms are hardly ""untouched"", they are just harder to strip from us. This is a valid interpretation of the Due Process Clause. It was intended to protect the people's ""privileges or immunities"" from abridgment by the gov't, and substantive due process is a valid interpretation of that. It has not rewritten the Constitution and is within both the power and responsibility of the Supreme Court to do.
This isn't about being a representative of what Americans want, but of what the Constitution was meant to protect. The Supreme Court interprets what the intent of the Constitution is and was, and they have done exactly that.
You're right, and that's exactly why they aren't elected and serve for life. They judge impartially.
Who is ""he""? To judge based on the Constitution, they decide what the Constitution means. As you have said yourself, interpreting the Constitution to judge cases is what they were created to do.
They have. The Due Process Clause was intended to protect our rights from the gov't by requiring the due process of law. The Supreme Court took the intent of that (protect our rights from the gov't) and decided that in order to protect our rights as was originally intended, the gov't would have to provide sufficient justification to abridge our rights, even if the law was legally changed. Given that the gov't should have sufficient justification when they make the law (we both know this does not happen, they're slaves to special interests), this is a valid interpretation.
I don't know the case, and this isn't relevant to the issue of abortion. The amendment states: ""Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted"". It doesn't mention age, so what prohibits it from applying to those under 18? Is your only argument that it has not before?
Regardless, this is a different issue.
Who is ""him""? Exactly what doomsday do you fear coming? Are we supposed to trust them? Are we supposed to trust those making the laws, the Congress? What checks does the Constitution list for the Supreme Court?
My backing? Have you read it? Both the Constitution and Bill of rights state what the gov't cannot do. One interesting one in section 9 is that citizens have the right not to be held against their will without sufficient justification. I wonder who determines that justification, eh? ;) They devote an entire section of the Constitution to the limits on Congressional power, and the Bill of Rights continues it.
The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people
The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble
The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated (an interesting word, unreasonable. I wonder who determines that)
No, this is due to the fact that they create laws. That obviously would give that branch more power than any other, since we are a society of laws.
And one of the checks is and was intended to be the Supreme Court. If it was everything you say, why would there be any checks or balances?
And what powers does the Constitution say the Supreme Court has? Where does it say it is limited?
Yes it does.
All liberties deemed ""fundamental"". The Court adopts whatever substantive rights it thinks are so basic, natural and fundamental that they must be protected even without reliance on any particular provision of the Constitution
Agreed.
Lobby what?
Living in the sense that it can be interpreted, yes. Even you admit justices must do this to fulfill their Constitutional duty. The document has many vague terms that require interpretation, so I do not see what the issue is with that.
Yet even this would require interpretation. Due Process can still be interpreted to mean sufficient justification, given the Constitution uses it in other areas.
Essentially correct.
All rights can still be taken away, and you're right that the constitution doesn't say what ""sufficient justification"" is. Such vague terms were used deliberately, imo, so the document can adapt to different times.
Because it was original intent. 
And rights can still be taken away. The Supreme Court (and I) believe that some freedoms should require careful scrutiny of gov'ts needs to justify their abridgment.
The Constitution has not been changed.
Which means the Federal gov't should not be able to ban it.
Could you provide evidence of this?
It didn't. In fact, the Supreme Court decision had nothing to do with abortion, per se. The decision was that the gov't did not have the power to violate women's freedom to choose what to do with her pregnancy.
It didn't, it applied to freedom. The original intent was to protect our liberties from gov't infringment, the Supreme Court extended this.
You are drifting from the subject. What do standards of decency have to do with anything? If an amendment says ""citizens are free to do anything they want"" and we discover more things we can possibly do, does the amendment grow or was its original intent meant to cover these new things as well?
Are you kidding? Our freedoms do not depend on Congress to recognize. Our freedoms exist despite what Congress wishes. The Bill of Rights specifies this for that very reason, so we are not dependent on Congress to have freedoms.
I can hardly believe you just said that.
Because that is their job! How many times must I say it, and you agree with it? The Supreme Court has every power to interpret the Constitution and apply it to cases.

It is a relevant issue. For this reason--> The courts found, from substantive due process no less, that you can't kill someone under 18 because it was cruel and unusual. They claim was that the right to life couldn't be taken away for someone under 18 via the death penalty....because this is a right that is covered under substantive due process. And you said it...where did that come from? It doesn't say anything about it. This applies to abortion in the same sense. The same logic in a way is used. Should abortion be legal? Well, opinion I guess...but legally there is nothing that talks about it in the constitution.
I am not sure what you mean...I use him as a unisex kinda deal by the way. What doomsday so I fear? Well mostly the constitution becoming meaningless. Are you supposed to trust the people making laws you ask...well it would be nice to have them be trustworthy but some are not...But we have the ability to get rid of them!! A key point <----. Judges you can't get rid of and therefore shouldn't have any ability to decide something that is not law (this may be unclear, if so just ask me for further detail). You also ask what check does the constitution have on the SC...which is my whole point!! I personally think we don't have enough checks however that is not relevant here. The checks are that congress and impeach them...thats about all and thats hard to do. They also appoint them. But as you have seen it has become who is conservative and who is liberal...not who reasonable and who is not. If a conservative gets on the court and makes things up his way I would be just as ******...For example, what if roe vs wade went like this--> The court decides that the fetus is a person and the right to life can't be taken away without good reason as defined with substantive due process. Now this would be the same thing as the court decided. They created a fetus being a person..which is not in the constitution, and they created a right to life which is not guarnteed by the constutition because it can be taken away just by due process. Now the court really ruled that they can't claim what a fetus is...that is probably a good call. Then they say that a women has a right to privacy that can't be taken away because of substantive due process....Where did this come from? It just doesn't exist and there was no intent for it to. How does a slavery amendment have the intent of right to privacy? Does one really think that they were thinking about womens privacy rights while creating this amendment?
I believe you are referring to Habeas Corpus... In which this means you can't be held in jail without being charged with something. This is straight forward. It is obvious whether or not you have been charged with something..you can't screw that up (although it has been done sadly). 
I think you misunderstood me and I you when I said the constitution is supposed to limit the powers of the Congress. I took it to mean that the constutitions only purpose was to limit congress...this is not the case as it limits government in general. I explained somewhere else that the DOI is a mission statement of sorts...and laws should be consistent with the thoughts of it....the constitution is more of a standard operation procedures..in the sense of how you can create the law, enforce the law, carry out the law. 
Come on sigma :p they create the law because they are directly elected. They represent us.
The checks and balances are set up to make sure to avoid abuse of power. The Supreme court is not a check...it is a branch of government(atleast part of one). It has checks on it just like the other 2.
I meant to say that subsantive due process doesn't cover just the liberties in the constitution....never the less...You say they court adopts the rights they deem basic and natural, with what restriction? How can they decide which rights are basic and natural when they aren't even elected? We are supposed to just trust them? This shouldn't be a stance you like, it lets an unelected government tell you which rights are basic and natural and which arent!
OH :( I thought you would help me lobby free cheeseburgers for me.
But there is a difference in what a judge wishes it to mean and what it meant when written and by who wrote it. I give the dealth penalty example again. The judges NOW have said that cruel and unusual punishment is someone under 18...when it was written it didn't mean this now did it?

then you said...it hasn't been changed.
I never said the constitution was changed..because it wasn't. This is the point. If it wasn't changed why did the judges assume the power that does not exist in the constitution?
I totally agree with this...We want the document to adapt to the times...in fact the constitution gives a way for this to be done. Amending, not judges deciding new standards of deceny and what not.
Not all of the Supreme Court...and only within the last 30-40yrs. In fact, this may be a good idea. But that doesn't mean they can just do it. There is no power that says they can. Due process means just that...procedures for a trial. 
No doubt, unless a consitution amendment says so. However, this is why it should be left to the states.
You asked me to provide evidence that abortion was illegal when amendments were written. I was referring up until the 14th which is all that matters. I probably shoulda been more clear in the fact that it was not legal by the federal government for an abortion and the courts did not strike down any abortion laws that were found in states. Most states banned abortion (with some exceptions)...I can't give you one page that says this because you have to go to all the states laws (if that makes sense).
Well, what law says this?
Your example is not very relevant in the fact that abortion was around then. For new things of course we have to adapt. 
But nothing is said about abortion...Some say rights exist outside of government (in fact I do) however they have to be reconginzed by out government in order for us had court cases about it :p
But by creating something that doesn't exist you go by the feelings and opinions of 9 individuals who are not elected. There job is to interpret based on when the laws were written and what was written. To create ideas that may or may not have been in those laws is in a sense creating a new law.
Maybe not directly but the same ideas apply. If the death penalty is legal today and ok today why would it not be 10 years from now with no laws being changed? The same with abortion...there were laws against it for so long, so what changed to make it ok? The constitution didn't change to make it ok...the ideas of the judges did. And this can't happen.

144,An argument lacking sufficient justification?,abortion,attack,"What you object to here is the Court’s decision, not substantive due process. Substantive due process would only mean that “cruel and unusual” punishment protection cannot be taken away without sufficient governmental justification. The decision that you disagree with is applying cruel and unusual to the death penalty for those under 18.
Or is that what you object to? Do you object what their interpretation of “cruel and unusual” was, that they interpreted it at all, or that they said that the protection of the “cruel and unusual” clause cannot be taken away without sufficient governmental justification?
Do you have a quote where they said that?
The amendment doesn’t say what “cruel and unusual” applies to and the Supreme Court is free to interpret what it means. I agree with you in a limited sense, that if it doesn’t apply to adult capital punishment why should it apply to those under 18? However, I do not know their rationale. For all I know I may see it in a new light.
It doesn’t change your objection and it doesn’t change my defense. Substantive due process protects rights and freedoms from being stripped from us without a good reason.
Agreed. All that means is the Federal Gov’t cannot prevent us from having the freedom to have one.
“Them” would be non-gender specific and would be more grammatically correct, given there are more than 1 Supreme Court justice.
You have more to fear from Congress than the Supreme Court for this.
The same Constitutional mechanism that shields justices from political pressure also necessarily shields them from political fallout. It is because of the power they have to interpret the Constitution that they must be able to be impartial. 
That said, they can still be removed. As you have said, Congress can impeach them, and that is no small thing. If their decisions are destructive to our freedom, or contrary to the interests of the nation then they can be removed.
Exactly what doomsday do you fear?
The only checks that are in the Constitution are that Congress can impeach them and the President appoints them. They are intended to have life-time appointments (barring bad behavior) and they are intended to interpret the Constitution as they see it applies to cases presented to them. 
“That’s hard to do”? Was it supposed to be easier?
Agreed, and I think that is not a good thing. However, this has nothing to do with the “substantive due process” interpretation.
So you actually have no objection to abortion, merely that the Supreme Court used substantive due process to protect individual rights? 
Do you really think the Fourteenth amendment was created to apply solely to slavery? It would not have been written in such broad terms if it was not meant to apply to apply to rights in general. However, what you or I think does not matter; we don’t have the authority, power or duty to decide what the law means or how to apply it. That is judges have been empowered to do.
The “right to privacy” was not created with the Fourteenth amendment. I think they were thinking to protect individual rights from the gov’t. The phrasing of the amendment supports that, when it starts “no State shall abridge…” it is intending to protect our rights. The Supreme Court went along the same intent with “substantive due process”. That you disagree is of course your right, but it is within their power to make this interpretation. 
Indeed I was. The definition I saw was “without just cause” but nevermind. It was described by the Supreme Court in Fay v. Noia, saying its ""function has been to provide a prompt and efficacious remedy for whatever society deems to be intolerable restraint”. Albert Dicey, a noted constitutional theorist, said it “declare[s] no principle and define[s] no rights, but [it is] for practical purposes worth a hundred constitutional articles guaranteeing individual liberty”. Requiring justification (that changes as society changes, no less) for legal action is nothing new.
In the people’s favor, I agree.
If you wish. This is certainly a valid interpretation.
I don’t think they create the law because they represent us.
They all have checks, they are each other’s checks. Each branch is a check on the other in some manner. The way this breaks down is when they are all controlled by the same ideology. Then the destruction of our rights can begin. Currently, Congress and the President are destructive enough… the Supreme Court is our only safe-guard atm. Soon enough, this will not be the case, and that’s when I seriously consider buying a gun.
What horror will come about if they can protect what rights they believe are fundamentally important? Come now… worse case scenario.
I trust them more than I trust Congress or the President but there aren’t enough of us to get rid of them. If enough of the country did not trust the Supreme Court, Congress can impeach the Justices.
What is your support that the Supreme Court runs the gov’t? They can decide which freedoms require a compelling reason to strip from us, and that in no way implies they run the gov’t. They can’t even use their power unless they are presented with a case; they can’t arbitrarily strike down laws. They have power and they have the Constitutional duty to use it to decide cases. They are, and they were intended to be, the final word on how the law is applied. 
Nope.
Haha, and who decides what it meant when it was written and by who wrote it? Judges! That’s what they were created to do!
Honestly, I’m amazed the “cruel and unusual” clause didn’t apply to those under 18. Tell me, steve, should that phrase not apply to those under 18 in this day and age? And tell me, how could Congress have changed it to apply equally to everyone? This isn’t a problem of wording (that Congress can amend) but a problem with application, which the Supreme Court can (and has the authority to) change.
I do agree with you that Congress should make laws that represent the will of the people. They have dropped the ball and dropped it badly. They are ruled, not by the people’s will or a desire to truly help, but by special interests and are concerned about their re-election above all else (and not re-election by pleasing the people, but by smoke and mirror bills and giving campaign promises that none deliver on). I think you are a fool to put your trust in elected officials.
 The idea that the constitution can be changed over time by judges is a power not granted to them and How is it orginial intent when the constitution keeps changing by the whim of the judges. To which I responded it hasn’t been changed. It has been interpreted, which is a valid power SCOTUS has.
Which power? “Substantive due process” is an interpretation, not a power. Interpretations are within their power.
I don’t know what you’re talking about with “decency”. You miss my point. Existing amendments also change because of vague terms that take on different meanings depending on who interprets it. “Unreasonable”, “unjustified”, “cruel and unusual” etc. All of these terms need to be interpreted by judges and those interpretations change with the times.
No, “due process” refers to any procedures used to take away rights. This includes a trial and also includes the process used to make laws (since laws can and do take away rights). Since it is implied that such laws would be justified, I do not see a problem with the Supreme Court interpreting the Due Process Clause to include Substantive Due Process. 
And it is left to the states, if they can provide a compelling reason to do so.
I’m glad at least one pro-life person realizes it is unconstitutional to have a national ban on abortion 
It was illegal after the Fourteenth amendment as well. Until Roe v. Wade.
It doesn’t matter too much to me. Tell me, do you know if the Supreme Court had heard any cases on abortion prior to Roe v. Wade? I can look it up, but I’m at work right now.
The Constitution implies it.
Sigma says: You are drifting from the subject. What do standards of decency have to do with anything? If an amendment says ""citizens are free to do anything they want"" and we discover more things we can possibly do, does the amendment grow or was its original intent meant to cover these new things as well? 
To which you replied:
Your example is not very relevant in the fact that abortion was around then. For new things of course we have to adapt.
I do not understand your response, abortion wasn’t around when? Yes, for new things we do need to adapt. 
Why are you harping on this? The fact that the Constitution says nothing about abortion means the Federal Gov’t cannot ban it. We have a recognized right to have powers and freedoms that are not specifically given to the gov’t in the Constitution.
Absolutely right. This was how it was designed. Those 9 individuals who are not elected give their feelings and opinions on the Constitution. 
No, it is creating a new interpretation. In a sense it is a law in that it is legally enforceable, but that is how SCOTUS was designed. Their job is to interpret the Constitution and apply it to cases today.
It depends on society. The judges view the Constitution through the lens of their own prejudices and experiences of growing up in our society. This, again, is how it was designed (and is inevitable, given judges are human).
Honestly, I don't think anyone took an honest look at it. Like the law against non-family members living together, it was an archaic law that had no place anymore. The Constitution never forbade abortion, so the Constitution did not have to change to allow it.

No, I can't unelect congress.
How many supreme Court justices have been impeached in the last 20yrs? They do use political pressure now. This is why judges now are given a litmus test to see if they are liberal or conservative...that is ****...it politics aren't a part of it then why should this matter? So they are not impartial, the idea of substantive due process gives them power to decide what rights are ""on the top"" so to speak. If you choose base on political views what makes you think they won't use that to decide what rights are ""on top"". I mean, Scalia would never be a justice today. The democrats would filabuster him for years. This is only because of his ""political views"" and not if he will follow the law and constitution.
I think it does actually. I think substantive due process created this idea. Because if judges have the ability to decide what rights are ""on top"" like I said then congress will appoint the ones that have their own views...and this is not how it should be done. I will admit, if judges were completely reasonable and absent of political pressure then substantivedue process might work..however this is not the case.
From a law perspective the only beef I have with roe vs wade is that it was done ""unconstitutionally"" in my opinion. I have a problem with abortion for my own moral reasons. I would always be against abortion but I would respect a law in a state that allowed it...this was the case prior 1973. In other words, legally speaking, I think it should be a state issue.
Yeah, it did just apply to slavery...It was inbetween 2 other slavery amendments and this one actually dealt with it too. It was not written in broad tersm at all. It was created to say ""ya know what, if you are born here you are a citizen, you can't have your rights taken away like how did we did during slavery unless you break a law then we give you due process...or trial...and then some rights are taken away...also, everyone is equal when it comes to the law.""...The 14th amendment really had nothing to with womens rights or abortion or substantive due process. It really is straight forward. This is kinda why we had the 19th amendment. It was realized that the 14th amendment didn't cover a womens right to vote..so they created their own amendment. The due process was clearly a procedural guarntee and shouldn't have been misused. They just wanted the slaves to have the same rights as the whites. This was the purpose.
hehe, it seems any limit on the government would probably work in our favor these days..:p (joke)
This is exactly why you don't want political judges!
Well, they could get rid of the death penalty for one...This would be creating a law without any backing. In a sense it makes it so they could create laws.
Anyone can bring up a case if they don't like something. Such as abortion...with your theory, they could just as easily say that a fetus is a person and that it is a fundemental right to protect it. Personally, I wouldnt want the SC to run things...I would want Congress and the President mainly...however I think that we should outlaw political parties and work it from there.
Very true!! However, which one are you more accountable to? What the judges wishes are or what the judge finds out is written about the law. The latter would be a more reasonable way to do it..in fact it is the way they are supposed to. Read what was written when it was written. This way you would get a lot less of the judges view and more of the ""view"" of the law.
In response to the first paragraph...Cruel and unusual didn't apply back when it was written. Therefore, it shouldn't apply today. What has changed? Congress could easily have made a law banning the death penalty for someone under 18 however it is not the job of the judges to do this.
IN response to the second paragraph...I by no means have faith in our elected officals. This is why I believe in getting rid of the poltical parties and some few other changes (maybe look at the UK system for electing). In fact, I have faith in only 2 elected officals. My congressmen, because I know him, talk to him, and he does represent my district...the other is my state rep. He actually takes the time to read everything, get the opinions of the people he represents and makes an informed decision. There might be some more, I just don't know them. My senators, governor, state senator, president, Board of Vistors at VT, and just about the rest of them all stink and can't be trusted. President Bush almost had my trust but then decided to cut Amtrak so that ended that (somewhat sarcastic).
HOWEVER!! Ones feelings about the elected officals doesn't matter. Just because you don't trust them doesn't mean we let the judges decide what is good. We follow the constitution not the feelings on the public when deciding powers of the branches (unless you amend).
sorry, i missed it the first time...I am debating the original intent of the constitution has been changed. They have the judicial power...which means you resolve disputes...it makes it hard when you say ""they interpret the law to apply to situations""...because this is true, but it doesn't mean you interpret the law to mean whatever...it means you apply the laws to the case. There is a difference if you wish for me to go further into that...
As I said, there is a difference...they don't have the power to interpretate something new outta the constitution....if they did that they could say that ""freedom of speech really only means something you say, not something you write""....and this would be wrong. Would it not?
Well, it is unconstitutional until you amend it...otherwise it should be a state issue. Yeah, I will be the first to admit that most pro-lifers are XXXXXX and extremely hypocritical. I wish to change this. At the same time though there are probably many pro-choices that are the same way...although I dunno because I don't really meet with them...but would like to (the ones on campus don't exactly like talking about the issue but rather just call you an idiot and a women hater :-/).
This is what the living constitution is. And my question is how do the interpretations change with time and what criterion do we use to decide this? One can't rely on a judge to decide was is decent and what is not. Evolving standards of deceny is an arguement for the living constitution. The thing is, the judges are put there to decide this. They are put there to judge...thus judicial power. Cruel and Unusual means what it meant when written...why would it change over time? Doesn't this mean that the amendment is worthless if it could be changed to mean anything or nothing?
Who implied this? The judges...well duh, it gives them more power. The judges can't assume something is implied. This makes no sense because we can say the first amendment implies that we have the freedom to speak but don't have the freedom to write...that makes no sense obiviously...however, it was implied is it not? What is the standard for implying something out of what is written?
The Supreme Court had not heard any cases dealing with abortion, however, I don't know if they had refused to hear some.
Abortion was around prior to 1973...in fact it was banned by many states. Therefore this was not new and thus did not need to be adapted to today...when amendments were written such as the 14th, abortion existed.
This is were we differ...they don't give their feelings, They don't represent us. They have but one power...judicial power. To judge. Not to give us their feelings on what is right and wrong....but rather what the law says about right and wrong...there is a difference. You can't make up what the law says.
In conclusion, the judges judge..that is all. They have only one power and can't assume more. The judicial power. This simply means they look at a case, apply the laws that are relevant to the case and so who is wrong and who is not. Their feelings are irrelevant. If one believer abortion is ok, they don't have the right to go ahead and find ways in which to make the law so it is ok...this makes no sense.",145,147,topic_stance_votes_1

Things that are illegal are not necessarily immoral, and things that are immoral are not necessarily illegal. Trying to draw a direct line comparison is not valid, imo.
Actually, it doesn't matter what the gov't thinks is ""right"" at this point. What is morally right and wrong is a subjective decision each individual makes. The gov't is concerned (or at least, should be concerned with that since they have been caught up in moralizing so much recently) with what is Constitutional.
Whether the Constitution is based upon morals is really a separate argument.
I don't really compare self-preservation with ""certain wishes"". A desire not to be killed is not a moral desire, and a gov't that is theoretically representative of the people's desire passing a law making it illegal to kill another is not making a moral law necessarily.
Agreed, this is not how America works. This was how America is supposed to work, according to the Constitution. Corrupt gov't officials and elected representatives who are controlled by money and special interest groups who get them re-elected in order to vote the way the special interest groups want. bleh.
Why should I be glad it doesn't, pray tell?
Except laws do not equal morals. Dictatorships and theocracies base arbitrary laws solely upon the moral beliefs of one individual, while our representative democracy (theoretically) base laws upon the Constitution. Whether the Constitution is based upon moral beliefs is a separate argument.
Except laws do not equal morals.
You are attempting to create a causal chain of personal beliefs with the Constitution. In some sense this is true since each persons personal beliefs are in part determined by society and the environment they grow up in, but it is not a valid argument to draw a direct line causal chain.
The Constitution does not tell people how to behave, it tells the gov't how to behave. It details what the gov't has the power to do in order to protect our rights and then says the people have any powers not given to the gov't. Somehow I do not see the moral statements in that.",134,160,topic_stance_votes_2
160,An argument lacking sufficient justification?,abortion,support,"And that`s exactly my point. The reason why they are not illegal is because it is not an action of violence towards another human being. Hitting someone is illegal because it is an action of violence, which is considered morally wrong.
I agree. There is no such direct line. However, all laws are based on the notion that they should prevent something that is considered wrong (immoral) or encourage something that is considered right (moral). Even laws regulating which side of the road you can drive is based on the moral assumptions that car crashes and deaths are wrong, and should be avoided.
Isn`t the US constitution merely a framework? That is, it merely outlines basic responsibilities and boundaries for the government to work within?
Not if all law is based on the constitution. If that is/should be the case (as you implied above), then laws are still based on morality if the constitution is based on morality. Just that it was decided by some old dead guys instead of your democraticly elected representatives.
But the government is not passing laws purely based on aggregated desires. Not even in representative democracies. And certainly not in constitutional democracies...
I`ll get back to you on that one. (I`m a little short on time)
I have not claimed that there is a direct line of causal chain. I have claimed that governments base their decissions on morality. If not based on their own moral beliefs, at least the electorates. Simply because they will not be re-elected if they don`t cater to the basic moral belief of the populace (like killing is wrong).

162,An argument lacking sufficient justification?,abortion,attack,"That’s exactly my point (we apparently agree a lot ;) ). Whether an action is immoral to some, most, or all of America does not necessarily make or unmake a law. Even if some, most, or all America agreed that violence against another is immoral, that would not necessarily make it illegal.
You are saying that the only reason certain actions are not illegal is they are not violence toward another? Is that the only moral?
Now you’re splitting hairs. You are saying every action has its root in a moral code, but that type of reductionism thinking has little meaning when describing complex human behavior, including laws. I can possibly show that all behavior, even morality, evolved from the pressure of survival, and so every action including which side of the road we drive on and free speech is merely an expression of a drive to survive, but that type of reductionism has little meaning (though survival instinct would be more relevant in many cases than any claim of morality) when describing complex human behavior, including laws.
No, it outlines what powers the gov’t has and its responsibilities and says, specifically, that any powers not given to the Federal Gov’t by the Constitution the Federal Gov’t does not have.
In general, it is supposed to be or at least it must satisfy the requirements of the Constitution.
However, that is a separate argument. We are arguing if the American gov’t today bases the laws that it passes on personal morality or even the aggregate morality of the nation. Trying to make a causal chain of more and more fundamental reasons is of as little validity if I made the claim that the morality that the constitution is based on, that the laws of the US are based on, are based on a survival instinct. Wheels within wheels, Eddie.
Sure it does, though the aggregate desires are tempered by Constitutional limits.
I’m waiting with bated breath ;)
Except it does not have to be based on “killing is wrong”, it could be based on “I don’t want to be killed”, which is not necessarily a moral statement.
You have claimed a chain where all human activity and behavior is based on and can be traced to a moral code. In some sense this is true, but that type of reductionism has little use in explaining the creation of laws.
Insomuch as was felt was necessary to actually have a society, this is true. However, there was no desire to control or establish a moral statement. 
A desire to continue living, a desire for freedom from interference from others, etc, are not necessarily moral beliefs. You can, in some way, root them in that way but it would have as little validity as me rooting them in survival instincts. It may be true, but it provides little insight into complex behaviors and drawing a direct line is not valid.

170,An argument lacking sufficient justification?,abortion,support,"True. Laws are basicly based on a higher moral code, contained in the liberal democratic ideology in most western countries.
Not at all. Not every moral belief is law. But all law is based on some notion of right and wrong/good or bad (morality).
It`s quite possible that survival (or personal utility maximation) can be used to explain laws. However, I doubt it can explain all of it due to the important part ideology plays (allthough one could perhaps argue how different ideologies can be derived from a goal of survival).
That is, it outlines the boundaries for the state, no?
But the problem is, as you said yourself, that the US government isn`t very constrained by the constitution today. It still has leeway to impose other morality based laws than those specificly outlined in the constitution. 
I like wheels within wheels though. They make me feel important :p
What is morality and what is desire then? If I believe its wrong to kill another human, and desire a law that regulate violence and killings, would that be a desire or a moral belief? (isn`t this a case of wheels within wheels as well ;))
Because a constraining consitution robs the populace of their democratic self-determination. It basicly creates a static society that cannot evolve. Look at Iran for example. This is a country with a very strong constitution that severly limits the ability to reform their government and society. Now granted, the US constitution does not look like the Iranian constitution but the comparison does not lie in the content of the constitution, but rather that an all-powerful constitution invalidates the democratic process and conserves of old values, morals and power.
Sure it could. But is it? I certainly don`t think so. Studies of electoral behaviour does not support the notion that the political man merely acts on the basis of profit-maximation (or survival).

“Higher”? Higher than what? Laws are not laws because something is or is not moral.
You are basing all of this upon the belief that the instinct to survive is a moral belief. Thinking “staying alive is good” is not necessarily (or at all, imo) a “moral” statement. Basing a law upon the belief that staying alive or being alive is a good thing is not necessarily basing the law upon a moral belief.
Yes. However, that type of reductionism is just as useless as the argument you are employing.
In some ways. However, mostly it outlines the boundaries for the Federal Gov’t.
I know. And that is unconstitutional.
It really invalidates your argument, however.
Men and women more learn-ed than ourselves have pondered that for millennia.
Perhaps, perhaps not. Is the belief that stabbing yourself with pencils is wrong a moral belief or a survival instinct (or both? Or does one lead to the other?)? Imo, it is useless to ponder such things except as a mental exercise. 
You are attempting to argue that because one believes an action is “wrong” it automatically makes it a moral belief. It is not necessarily so.
And if the Constitution lays as a foundation the ability to change itself? If the Constitution uses such language that lends itself to be interpreted differently based upon current society norms? Honestly, you should be arguing against Steve about a “living constitution”
Like I said, depends on the Constitution.
It does not invalidate the democratic process at all. The democratic process would not exist without something to lay the groundwork for and enforce it, and this is what the Constitution does. Yes, the Constitution conserves old “values” (if you wish to call them that), that is its function and what our gov’t is based upon. The value of freedom of personal decisions, of little gov’t interference only when necessary, etc. The value that the gov’t has no place dictating our personal morals, such as “abortion is wrong” and “homosexuality is wrong” etc. Whatever morals you believe exist are merely to allow us to function as a society and prevent the gov’t from abusing its citizens (which allows us to function as a society). Whether or not “the gov’t should not abuse its citizens” is a moral belief is irrelevant, being that it can just as easily be explained by survival instinct. In fact, the moral belief itself can be explained on those terms.
Perhaps not, but if morals are based upon survival instinct (and I believe they are) then the ultimate cause for any decision you believe is a “moral” decision is survival instinct (yes this is ‘wheels within wheels’). Whether such reductionism has any meaning is, of course, up to you. I think it does not.
That is what I was doing, however you seem to wish to base any and all human decision making upon moral beliefs of “right” and “wrong”, down to what side of the road we drive on.

Yes, and they can if they provide a compelling reason to.
This is very petty of you to do, but so be it.
However, Congress has much more power to harm you than the Supreme Court does. Currently your objection is their ability to protect rights.
This means nothing.
And whether they are liberal or conservative should not matter, I agree.
I think basing decisions on political ideology is wrong.
You mean Congress is at fault for the Supreme Court being this way?! And yet, you trust Congress more? Since they can be ""unelected"" why do they do this?
For me, it would make me trust them less.
Ok.
If it did it would have said it only applied to slavery. They had one that said ""slavery is hereby abolished"" or some such.
""like how did we did during slavery"". Ok, I can live with that. It doesn't apply to only slavery.
Yes! It is straight forward in that it was meant to protect rights from arbitrarily taken away (and not just in slavery). It does not mention anything it specifically applies to because it was meant to apply to anything that is in that situation.
It's purpose was to protect rights. It may have been created in response to the slavery issue, but it is meant to protect rights.
Joking or not, I believe this.
Agreed.
They can create precedents and make decisions on the law. They can decide that no case warrants the death penalty. Since they are the final word on matters of law (""judicial power shall be vested in one Supreme Court..."") it is a perfectly valid power.
Ok. This is outside the scope of our debate however.
They do this. They look at the law and decide how to apply it. You disagree on how they did this and I agree with how they did this. The Constitution does not explicitly state how they are supposed to employ their power, so they are technically free to do so.
That is a different issue than substantive due process.
Ok.
No, but we have to trust them to rule on matters of law. We don't decide the powers of the branches, they have their power already. The judicial branch has no exceeded its power because its power was not defined in the Constitution.
They interpret the law and apply it to situations. When you say ""doesn't mean you can interpret the law to mean whatever"" you mean you don't want them to interpret it in a way you disagree with.
I do not know, I would have to know their rationale. Even then I might disagree with them.
Ok.
They change as society changes. There is no criteria but what the judges believe it should mean. ""Cruel and unusual"" would change as society changes... who determines what is cruel and unusual? Judges. Congress does as well when it makes laws to prohibit certain things based upon it as well. In this way judges power can only help and protect us. 
Because methods that can possibly be cruel change over time.
No, it means that any meaning must be based upon this. If a Supreme Court judge makes an unpopular decision (no matter if you agree they should have the power or not) we have to live with that decision until it is overturned by later courts (if it was indeed as heinous as you think it is).
I'm skipping a bit that was redundant.
And they do look at the law and apply it. They do, however, have to decide what the law means in terms of that case. That's where their ""feelings"" come in, what they feel it is supposed to mean.

Maybe I should clarify? It applied to slavery in the sense that it was written because of slavery...Thus the mindset. They didn't want a slavery type situation to occur.
you said this and a few other things saying it protects rights... It says you can't be stripped of rights without due process of law... The only protection here is that you can't be stripped of rights without due process...which means trial, congress makes a law, and other things of that nature. I don't see where you get the idea that it means one can't be stripped of rights unless the court says you have a good enough reason.
Creating precedent doesn't matter much anymore if you have ""evolving standards of deceny"" so what is your point there? How can they decide no case warrants the death penalty? This once again creates a law. They are not allowed to do that.
The idea of substantive due process just gives the judges too much power which never existed. I think you said somewhere that judges can assume power because the constitution doesn't really spell it out very well. Well, the constitution doesn't say they can assume power so doesn't this mean they can't? All powers are reserved for the states if not applied in the constitution. This would mean the judges have these powers: Judicial.
I dont think judicial means the power to assume other powers, the power to determine ""standards of decency"" in the world, the power to determine if a legal document's words have changed meaning (without actually having the words change). The judicial power simply means the power to judge. When you judge you look at the facts and apply them. When a judge is doing a murder case he/she doesn't decide what murder means, he simply uses the law that is stated. This applies all the way up to the Supreme Court. They may not agree with the law, but it says what it says. The 14th amendment is clear. It doesn't say subsantive due process, it wasn't written to mean that (or it would have said it), so why should a judge be able to change the meaning? This is not his/her power. The questions that surround the idea of the living constitution and ""subsantive due process"" can't be answered and no one can be accountable to these ideas. What criterian do you use with the living constitution? What is the basis? What are the restrictions? No one knows, the courts are supposed to decide.

Substantive due process is a valid interpretation, because it extends what the amendment was attempting to do.
You are attempting to argue two points: that substantive due process is not valid and that the living Constitution interpretation is not valid. You say the living Constitution supports substantive due process. I do not believe this is necessarily so, but I'll accept that. You are also using one contested point to support another contested point, and I do not accept your conclusion for either.
Steve, listen to me. The Constitution states that ""supreme judicial power shall be vested in one supreme court"" or something similar. All of what you object to is an aspect of judicial power, and thus falls under the perview of the Supreme Court.
The Constitution does not say judges must rule according to the Constitution. It does not say judges must rule according to ""what was written when it was written""; you and Scalia say that. It does not say ""rule according to what society wants"". It does not define judge's power or boundaries in that power. It does not say ""pull rulings out of your XXX"", either. Judicial power is ruling according to law, yes. However, judges have a great deal of discretion on how they apply that law, some interpret it ""how it was written when it was written"" some interpret it according to the nuances of the society of today. This is why we have appellate courts, because judges disagree on how laws are applied. The Supreme Court was created to be the final word on all matters of law. Their interpretation is the interpretation. Judges cannot create laws, they cannot re-write laws. This gives other judges the ability to say ""no, it does not say that"" and over-rule what other courts have said. The law never changes, the judges cannot change it. They can only change how it is applied, and that is totally and completely within their power.

Substantive Due Process is a direct result of the living constitution and vise-versa(sp) thus if one stumbles the other will too.

You go on to talk about how the judges and interept how they want. However, this is not the case and an unsafe one at that. With the thought of the living constitution and what not you assume that it is ok for judges to decide what is morally right in this country. You may think they should be, however, our constitution does not. Judicial power shouldn't be up for interperation. It is not an ""unclear"" term. From what I have read it is a simply term that means judge based on the law that exists. Here is something I have already posted that you should read
representatives, Alexander Hamilton assured the citizens of New York that there was little risk in this, since “[t]he judiciary . . . ha[s] neither FORCE nor WILL but merely judgment.” The Federalist No. 78, p. 465 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). But Hamilton had in mind a traditional
judiciary, “bound down by strict rules and precedents
which serve to define and point out their duty in every particular case that comes before them.”
Also from Federalist No. 78 (which is the one about the Judicial Branch)
And it is the best expedient which can be devised
in any government, to secure a steady, upright, and impartial
administration of the laws.
Whoever attentively considers the different departments of power must
perceive, that, in a government in which they are separated from each
other, the judiciary, from the nature of its functions, will always be
the least dangerous to the political rights of the Constitution; because
it will be least in a capacity to annoy or injure them. The Executive
not only dispenses the honors, but holds the sword of the community. The
legislature not only commands the purse, but prescribes the rules by
which the duties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated. The
judiciary, on the contrary, has no influence over either the sword or
the purse; no direction either of the strength or of the wealth of the
society; and can take no active resolution whatever. It may truly be
said to have neither FORCE nor WILL, but merely judgment; and must
ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the
efficacy of its judgments.
that the judiciary is beyond comparison the
weakest of the three departments of power[1]; that it can never attack
with success either of the other two; and that all possible care is
requisite to enable it to defend itself against their attacks
For I agree, that ""there is no liberty, if the power of
judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers."" Which it is not now with the living constitution
A constitution is, in
fact, and must be regarded by the judges, as a fundamental law.
Nor does this conclusion by any means suppose a superiority of the
judicial to the legislative power.
stands in opposition to that of
the people, declared in the Constitution, the judges ought to be
governed by the latter rather than the former.
They ought to regulate
their decisions by the fundamental laws, rather than by those which are
not fundamental.

All of this is from Fed No. 78 which is an explanation for the constitution by its writters. You can read the whole thing if you want..just google it. The point of this was to show that this country was based on something and we need to follow it. To just decide we have no basis and go at the whim of the people is dangerous...it means you are not going in any direction much less the right one. Think of it this way, if you are put into the woods without anything you will walk around aimlessly and die. If you are given a map you will live. The constitution is our map...Maybe we should use it.
The founders established this country a certain way and had certain reasons for what they did. It is clear from the statements above that the judges are not supposed to rule from anything other then laws and precedent.
Sigma, it comes down to this. A judgement made from a ""living constitution"" perspective (and subsantive due process) is a judgement not made from law or precedent but rather their own belief or public opinion (and now into international opinion). This was not the reason the courts were set up. If we go by the ""living constitution"" the constitution becomes a worthless document.

It can be of no weight to say that the courts, on the pretense of a
repugnancy, may substitute their own pleasure to the constitutional
intentions of the legislature. This might as well happen in the case of
two contradictory statutes; or it might as well happen in every
adjudication upon any single statute. The courts must declare the sense
of the law; and if they should be disposed to exercise WILL instead of
JUDGMENT, the consequence would equally be the substitution of their
pleasure to that of the legislative body. The observation, if it prove
any thing, would prove that there ought to be no judges distinct from
that body.
If, then, the courts of justice are to be considered as the bulwarks of
a limited Constitution against legislative encroachments, this

Cone, do you honestly feel that you would hold the views you now hold regarding what is wrong and what is right had you lived 300 or 400 years ago if you did not know what you now know, what has been conceptualized for you by the advances of our society?

311,An argument lacking sufficient justification?,abortion,support,"Wait, how can you tell them they are wrong? If morals are relative then you can't tell them they are wrong....it is their opinion...their morals. The fault in moral relativity is the fact that the only ""basis""(if you can call it that) would be a majority of people that happen to believe the same thing. However, if a morals were relative then you couldn't convince anyone that they were wrong because you would just say ""it is moral because the majority says so"". I will give an example to show you what I mean. (note: no historical data in here)
The year is 1852, Milliard Fillmore is President(bad one at that), Mozart is topping the charts, and slavery still exists. In fact slavery is the normal ""moral"" thing to do in the USA. MOST people believe it is fine even more so in the south. But wait!! Some people DON'T think it is right. This ""abolitionist"" lunes are saying slavery is immoral. I don't know where they got it from, they must have pulled it out their @%&...Moving right along, when the abolitionist try to convince people that slavery is wrong everyone was just says ""no it is not, the majority thinks it is ok""...And its true!! Since our morals are relative we have to rely on what the majority of people think in order to know what the moral code of today is. But because of this no one can ever convince anyone that slavery is wrong. Therefore, in 2005, it will be ok because nothing can change...oddly enough you created a moral abosulte based upon the majority of people and the majority only.
As my story has portrayed, the only way for a moral relative society to work is to look at the majority, however, this would create a moral abosolute based on the majority. Since this is obviously not true that leads one to beleive that maybe an abosolute standard does exist beyond the majority...it seems that we are all born with the idea that murder is bad and that living is good, so maybe we all know the moral standard at birth, we just refuse to accept it.",311,312,topic_stance_votes_1

First, let's take the U.S. governemnt.
1. Nowhere in our government, our society, is it written that certain acts are right, or wrong, morally speaking. We make laws, and enforce them, laws change, and so do the punsishments. This is how we determine what is ALLOWED and not ALLOWED in a society.
2. Minority rights in the U.S. government are a clear example that laws are not based solely on majority. It's one of the pillars of our government, I'm amazed you don't know this.
3. How do you know killing is wrong? Many religions, government, and individuals, support killing, in many cases, legally. In some, illegally. Recall the inquisition? The crusades? What about the Iraq war? The U.S. is killing civilians, women, and children. Is it wrong? To them, yes. To you..I don't know. It's releative of course.
