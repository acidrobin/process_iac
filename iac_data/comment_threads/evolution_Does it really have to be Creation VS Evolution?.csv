0,Does it really have to be Creation VS Evolution?,evolution,support,"Let's think about it. What if it was a little bit of both? God could have created something and it could have evolved from that. We all know that there was evolution. There is solid evidence that evolution has occured.
I am a Catholic. But I don't follow all of the beliefs of Catholicism. First of all, I strongly believe in Evolution.
I would like to know why other people believe so strongly in every word the Bible says. I mean, the Bible tells of Noahs Ark, but if that were true, all the animals would be retarded (same with Adam and Eve). We shouldn't take the Bible as it is, but learn lessons from it. Besides, the Bible also says not to use cotton blends. Palease!",0,1,topic_stance_votes_1

you cannot accept both
christianity has little to with an acceptance of either, apparently. the discussion is not about christianity
{P.S. I need a word to use for non-creation. if I say 'evolution' Ill get a swarm of people telling me thats not the definition of evolution, and they would be right. is there a word that denotes the big bang, abiogenesis, species progression, etc? in other words, a word that denotes the scientifically defined methods of universal origin?}",5,6,topic_stance_votes_1

but then again, there are many that consider these theoretical phenomena to not be science at all, but more conjectures and speculations. and even more then-again, there are people that see a correlation between what science says and biblical creation. so maybe science might not be the perfect word...

8,Does it really have to be Creation VS Evolution?,evolution,support,"That's creationism. It is religiously motivated, based on the Bible, and tends to reject reality and scientific investigation.
That could be because creationism has nothing to do with ""theoretical phenomena."" There is no theory involved in creationism. It is based on a literal reading of a book of mythology. To be theoretical, creationism would have to be based on observations of nature that have been verified by testing a prediction that is a consequence of the proposed explanation. Creationism merely rejects and twists reality to conform the the conclusions that were assumed.
No conjecture or speculation. It is dogma. Usually creationism falls back on miracle and magic.
Now if you are looking for one word that encompasses everything that creationism denies, science might be the word. Creationism requires either scientific illiteracy or intentional ignorance. Creationism arose out of the 7th Day Adventist/Fundamentalist Christian reaction to the reality that science was discovering. Way back in the early 1800s Christian scientists looking for evidence of the flood found that there wasn't any. They reached many conflicting conclusions from repeated creations, gap creations, and old earth with mankind created last, a series of floods with Noah's flood being local and last, etc. Christian fundamentalism was a late 1800s movement that stated the fundamentals of what they thought should be Christainity. It is important to realize that fundamentalism was not a ""return"" to fundamentals, but a statment of a new sect that separated from the more traditional Christian sects. In the early 1900s, George McCready Price attempted to defend the views of the prophetess of the 7th Day Adventist Church and in doing so developed flood geology. Without any scientific training and using Ellen G. White's view of the Bible as a basis, Price attempted to explain all geological evidence as the result of the flood. From this beginning Henry Morris (who failed to credit Price for any of the ideas he used) developed one version of modern flood geology.
Essentially, to be a creationist one must reject the most basic theories of all of the sciences from cosmology, astronomy, astrophysics, nuclear physics, geology, biology, etc.",8,9,topic_stance_votes_1

It's somewhat amazing that you would consider Copernicus, Galileo, and Newton to be current events.

Pretty soon those beliefs will pass and we will return to the truth of the Bible. We will realize that the earth is flat and covered with a great dome from which are hung the sun moon and stars. And we will stop all of this current event nonsense about predicting weather from moving air patterns and realize that rain falls from windows in the dome from the water that is above the dome. And we will stop placing our stupid faith in a light switch that is powered by electricity that is the result of a controled fission reactions.

15,Does it really have to be Creation VS Evolution?,evolution,attack,"Actually, there was no science as we know it and no scientists back when the world was thought to be flat. In fact, it was the ancient Greeks, when they started investigating the world in a proto-scientific manner, who discovered that the world was round.
A better example would have been when serious scientists, or practitioners of what was the beginnings of what would later develop into what we now recognize as science, believed that the heavens revolved around the earth. But even that belief was based partly on metaphysical/quasi-religious beliefs - again, it wasn't until roughly around the time of Galileo that the enterprise that we now call science really began to take its present form.
But your main point is well-taken. Science does not claim to have the final answers, and all theories and models are provisional (at least in theory). But some theories become so well-established by observation and experience that it becomes extremely hard to not believe that they are the correct explanation of phenomena. The theory of evolution is in that position right now. Of course, Newtonian mechanics was in that position, also, until Einstein and Heisenberg and others completely changed our understanding of space, time, and matter. But Newtonian physics was displaced (as an explanation - as a calculational tool it is still very useful in ""ordinary"" real life) only when a viable alternative was proposed. In regards to evolution, the creationists still haven't proposed a viable alternative model.",14,16,topic_stance_votes_1

No. That was the church that imposed that idea from ""holy scripture."" Modern science is only about 400 years old and the first scientists who tried to break free of the church risked their lives. Copernicus withheld publication of his theory because he was afraid of persecution by the chruch. Bruno was burned at the stake and Galileo was silenced.

First let me state I'm a staunch believer in creationism. But everyone here seems to call the Theory of Evolution ""science"". But its not scientifically proven and can never be proven, nor can Creationism. Both are accepted by belief alone. To be scientifically proven something has to be able to be re-created for testing purposes. So since we can't re-create the supposed ""Big Bang"" or the 7-days of creation, neither can be scientifically proven nor scientifically excepted (even though scientists do take sides based on evidence they find). But I must side with creationism. First, because I'm a Christian. Second becuase of all the evidence supporting it. Let's consider the Second Law of Thermodynamics. It is one of the most universally excepted laws of science. In fact, many other scientifically proven facts use this law as a basis. It says that things will deteriorate as they go along, unless acted upon by an outside force. But the Theory of Evolution firmly dictates that evolution is a positive process. If the Theory of Evolution is completely accurate, then this denies the accuracy of one of the foundations of science. That alone is more than enough to prove Creationism has more evidence supporting it. But let us continue. This outside force could always be God. What other outside force, the Theory of Evolution suggests none. Simply put, although neither can be scientifically proved, the Theory of Evolution is actually in defiance of the very science it supposedly supports.
( Note - Evolution is not actually a Theory by the text book definition but it is commonly accepted to refer to it as a Theory. )
About the question as to why it is Creationism vs. Evolutionism. Simply put, b/c they are mostly complete opposites. If you are a Christian (all inclusive, Catholic, Baptist, anything) you cannot possibly believe both and be a practicing Christian.

Sorry, the theory of evolution is indeed science! Nothing in science is ever ""proven"", but the preponderance of evidence overwhelmingly supports the theory of evolution. So no, the TOE is certainly not supported by belief alone. Evolution is routinely recreated in labs and observed in the wild. Your claim that we can't recreate the big bang has nothing to do with evolution.
And your claim that science must be able to recreate something in order to call it a theory is absolutely wrong. We can't recreate a planet orbitting a sun, yet the heliocentric theory is pretty well accepted. All science requires is evidence, not the ability to recreate an event in the lab.
But I must side with creationism. First, because I'm a Christian. Second becuase of all the evidence supporting it. Let's consider the Second Law of Thermodynamics.

This is not what the Second law of Thermodynbamics says, you are demonstratably wrong. Evolution does not violate the 2LOT. If the 2LOT prevented evolution, it would also prevent reproduction, you know, much less complex sperm and egg cells evolving into much more complex organisms, simple seeds growing into much more complex trees and plants.....But that's not what the 2LOT is about. This is a tired old arguement that was refuted decades ago, please try to keep up with modern science.
( Note - Evolution is not actually a Theory by the text book definition but it is commonly accepted to refer to it as a Theory. ) 
The theory of evolution is a scientific theory, which is different from the everyday usage of the word. Here's a good definition of what science means when it uses the word ""theory"": From here:ScientificTheory 
""Theories are central to scientific thinking. 
Theories are overarching explanations that make sense of some aspect of nature, are based on evidence, allow scientists to make valid predictions, and have been tested in many ways. Theories are supported, modified, or replaced as new evidence appears. Theories give scientists frameworks within which to work. Major theories of science, such as the cell theory, gravitational theory, evolutionary theory, and particle theory, are all big ideas within which scientists test specific hypotheses. 
The scientific definition of “theory” should not be confused with the way the term is commonly used to mean a guess or a hunch. In science, a theory means much more and is far more well-founded. The “Theory of Evolution” is an evidence-based, internally consistent, well-tested explanation of how the history of life proceeded on Earth—not a hunch. Understanding the role of theory in science is essential to scientists and vital to the informed citizen."" 
Please learn what theory really means in science!
About the question as to why it is Creationism vs. Evolutionism. Simply put, b/c they are mostly complete opposites. If you are a Christian (all inclusive, Catholic, Baptist, anything) you cannot possibly believe both and be a practicing Christian. 
And yet, millions of Christians do just that! They accept the theory of evolution and are practicing Christians. So it is only in your rather limited opinion that that they can't do both.

27,Does it really have to be Creation VS Evolution?,evolution,attack,"Then let me state that I am not a believer in evolution. I have spent considerable effort and many years in studying the evidence and accept the theory (actually several theories) of evolution as correct - the best explanation for the observed and tested facts.
Since we are not talking about some god, it is not necessary to capitilize ""theory of evolution."" It is, in fact, a theory of science. Do you not understand what science is or how it works?
I see that you don't understand what science is or how it works. Science does not prove. It explains based on evidence. However, science can disprove. And creationism has been disproven many times over.
No. As I explained, I don't believe in evolution. Possibly it would be a good thing to learn the basics of what you profess to disbelieve rather than make yourself look like a fool.
Don't be stupid. Wouldn't it be better it you actually learned what science is and how it works before you make such ignorant remarks. Again, science doesn't prove. Science explains.
What does that have to do with the theory of evolution? Could it be that you haven't the integrity to educate yourself about what you profess to propose? The big bang is not part of the theory of evolution. It displays considerable ignorance to claim that it is so.
Right. You side with ignorance and misinformation.
So being a Christian requires that you stop thinking? I never knew that before.
How wonderful. Finally someone is going to present some actual evidence to support creationism.
OK, lets. I know something about that. I'm all excited to learn how the 2LoT is evidence FOR creationism rather than a lame argument against evolution.
Really? Could you give some examples?
No it doesn't. What are you talking about? It seems that you are ignorant of the 2nd Law as well as the theory of evolution and science in general.
No it doesn't. What are you talking about? Evolution is a change in the hereditary makeup of a population over time. There is no implication that it is positive or negative, progress or any other misguided idea. If you wish to disagree with evolutionary theory, wouldn't it be a good idea to learn what you oppose?
That's gibberish. It doesn't make any sense at all. No theory of science claims to be completely accurate. Scientific theories are the best explanations that we can devise based on the evidence that we have. When we get new evidence, either the theories are supported or we change the theories to also explain the new evidence. 
So let me understand what you are saying. You are saying that because you don't understand what science is, and you don't understand what evolution is, that this is evidence for creationism. Do you actually have any idea of what evidence is?
Oh! Please do!
What outside force? Where did that come from? Are you completely crazy?
Exactly. Evolution is a natural process. The theories of evolution attempt to explain why evolution happens. Several mechanisms have been identified. Would you like to learn about them?
But you have already demonstrated that you have no idea of what science is or how it works. The very concept of ""scientifically proved"" demostrates dismal ignornace.
Wouldn't an honest person show why? Your little note is nothing more than an assertion without support. My assertion is that evolution is one of the better supported theories of science. I challenge you to show why the theory of evolution isn't real science. Moreover, I challenge you to show that creationism is science. Please provide the evidence that you said that you would. What scientific evidence is there that creationism is true. So far, you have only claimed that it exists. Arguments against evolution are not arguments for creationism.
And I think that you understand neither.
I see. So God has authorized you to decide what is and is not Christian. Because you have a warped understanding of the theology and are totally ignorant of the science, you are still divinely authorized to declare who is and who is not a Christian.
One or the other what?
I'm disappointed. You said that you were going to present evidence for creationism and you presented ****. You presented only assertions, and you don't even understand your own assertions. If you think not, then I challenge you to take a 1st semester test on thermodynamics - limited to the 2nd law. 
Thermo Test.
Understand that this test was first submitted to a nuclear engineer (thermodynamics is really a big deal in nuclear physics) for comment. He missed one question and acknowledged his error (smacked himself up the side of the head) when I explained. The test then was posted on the internet on a discussion board. A Ph.D. in physics who teaches thermodynamics at a major university opinined that it was a good test of Freshman thermo. He also missed one question but admitted his mistake upon further discussion (I don't know if he smacked himself up the side of the head). Others (engineers, chemists, physicists) stated that it reminded them of their freshman courses in thermodynamics. In other words, those who are educated in thermodynamics have expressed the opinion that the test is freshman level (chapter 5 in the 2nd edition of ""Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics"" as a matter of fact - if you require further references I will give them).
Understand the the test above is only a ""chapter test"" in a freshman course in thermodynamics. If you can't breeze through it, then you have no business in presenting arguments from the 2LoT. Besides, you are arguing statistical thermodynamics. My bet is that you don't know what I just said.
So we are again dissapointed. You promised to give evidence FOR creationism and gave only misguided and misunderstood arguments against what you ""believe"" is the theory of evolution. Wouldn't it be better to learn the fundamentals of what you claim to oppose rather than make yourself look foolish?",25,28,topic_stance_votes_1

29,Does it really have to be Creation VS Evolution?,evolution,attack,"science: A field of study seeking to understand natural phenomena through repeated observations and experiments.
Oh, and let me apologize, you're right, Evolution is a theory. Note, a theory is described by Webster as a ""speculation"".
And as of now I will list some proof. First, dog Variability. By progressively breeding for certain traits, dogs can be different and distinctive. This is a common example of microevolution?changes in size, shape, and color?or minor genetic alterations. It is not macroevolution?the upward progression in complexity from bacteria to man. Macroevolution has never been observed in any breeding experiment but is required by organic evolution. Spontaneous generation (the emergence of life from nonliving matter) has never been observed. All observations have shown that life comes only from life. This has been observed so consistently it is called the law of biogenesis. The theory of evolution conflicts with this scientific law by claiming that life came from nonliving matter through natural processes. Mendel?s laws of genetics and their modern-day refinements explain almost all physical variations observed in living things. Mendel discovered that genes are merely reshuffled from one generation to another. Different combinations are formed, not different genes. The different combinations produce many variations within each kind of life, such as in the dog family. A logical consequence of Mendel?s laws is that there are limits to such variation. Breeding experiments and common observationsc have also confirmed these boundaries. While Mendel?s laws give a theoretical explanation why variations are limited, broad experimental verification also exists. For example, if evolution happened, organisms (such as bacteria) that quickly produce the most offspring, should have the most variations and mutations. Natural selection would then select the more favorable changes, allowing organisms with those traits to survive, reproduce, and pass on their beneficial genes. Therefore, organisms that have allegedly evolved the most should have short reproduction cycles and many offspring. We see the opposite. In general, more complex organisms, such as humans, have fewer offspring and longer reproduction cycles. Again, variations within existing organisms appear to be bounded. Organisms that occupy the most diverse environments in the greatest numbers for the longest times should also, according to evolution, have the greatest potential for evolving new features and species. Microbes falsify this prediction as well. Their numbers per species are astronomical, and they are dispersed throughout practically all the world?s environments. Nevertheless, the number of microbial species are relatively few. New features apparently don?t evolve. The variations Darwin observed among finches on different Galapagos islands is another example of natural selection producing micro- (not macro-) evolution. While natural selection sometimes explains the survival of the fittest, it does not explain the origin of the fittest. Natural selection prevents major evolutionary changes. Mutations are the only known means by which new genetic material becomes available for evolution. Rarely, if ever, is a mutation beneficial to an organism in its natural environment. Almost all observable mutations are harmful; some are meaningless; many are lethal. No known mutation has ever produced a form of life having greater complexity and viability than its ancestors. Many molecules necessary for life, such as DNA, RNA, and proteins, are so complex that claims concerning their evolution are questionable. Furthermore, such claims lack experimental support.There is no reason to believe that mutations or any natural process could ever produce any new organs?especially those as complex as the eye, the ear, or the brain. For example, an adult human brain contains over a hundred thousand billion electrical connections, more than all the electrical connections in all the electrical appliances in the world. The human heart, a ten-ounce pump that will operate without maintenance or lubrication for about 75 years, is another engineering marvel. All species appear fully developed, not partially developed. They show design. There are no examples of half-developed feathers, eyes, skin, tubes (arteries, veins, intestines, etc.), or any of thousands of other vital organs. Tubes that are not 100% complete are a liability; so are partially developed organs. For example, if a leg of a reptile were to evolve into a wing of a bird, it would become a bad leg long before it became a good wing. There is no direct evidence that any major group of animals or plants arose from any other major group. Species are observed only going out of existence (extinctions), never coming into existence. Humans and many animals will endanger or even sacrifice their lives to save another?sometimes the life of another species. Natural selection, which evolutionists say explains all individual characteristics, should rapidly eliminate altruistic (self-sacrificing) ?individuals.? How could such risky, costly behavior ever be inherited, because its possession tends to prevent the altruistic ?individual? from passing on its genes for altruism? If evolution were correct, selfish behavior should have completely eliminated unselfish behavior. Furthermore, cheating and aggression should have ?weeded out? cooperation. Altruism contradicts evolution. Children as young as seven months can understand and learn grammatical rules. Furthermore, studies of 36 documented cases of children raised without human contact (feral children) suggest that language is learned only from other humans; humans do not automatically speak. If this is so, the first humans must have been endowed with a language ability. There is no evidence language evolved. Nonhumans communicate, but not with language. True language requires both vocabulary and grammar. With great effort, human trainers have taught some chimpanzees and gorillas to recognize a few hundred spoken words, to point to up to 200 symbols, and to make limited hand signs. These impressive feats are sometimes exaggerated by editing the animals? successes on film. (Some early demonstrations were flawed by the trainer?s hidden promptings.) Wild apes have not demonstrated these vocabulary skills, and trained apes do not pass their vocabulary on to others. When a trained animal dies, so does the trainer?s investment. Also, trained apes have essentially no grammatical ability. Only with grammar can a few words express many ideas. No known evidence shows that language exists or evolves in nonhumans, but all known human groups have language. Furthermore, only humans have different modes of language: speaking/hearing, writing/reading, signing, touch (as with braille), and tapping (as with Morse Code or tap-codes used by isolated prisoners). When one mode is prevented, as with the loss of hearing, others can be used. Different languages, such as English, Spanish, or Chinese, provide other alternatives. It is illogical to maintain that similarities between different forms of life always imply a common ancestor; such similarities may imply a common designer and show efficient design. In fact, where similar structures are known to be controlled by different genes or are developed from different parts of embryos,c a common designer is the more likely explanation. Evolutionists have taught for over a century that as an embryo develops, it repeats an evolutionary sequence. In other words, in a few days an unborn human repeats stages that supposedly took millions of years for mankind. Another well-known example of this ridiculous teaching is that embryos of mammals have ?gill slits,? because mammals supposedly evolved from fish. (Yes, that?s faulty logic.) Embryonic tissues that resemble ?gill slits? have nothing to do with breathing; they are not gills, and they are not slits. Instead, that embryonic tissue develops into parts of the face, bones of the middle ear, and endocrine glands. Embryologists no longer consider the superficial similarities between a few embryos and the adult forms of simpler animals as evidence for evolution. Ernst Haeckel, by deliberately falsifying his drawings, originated and popularized this incorrect but widespread belief. Many modern textbooks continue to spread this false idea as evidence for evolution. 
Each planet is unique. Similarities expected if the planets evolved from the same swirling dust cloud are seldom found. Yet most planetary studies began by assuming the planets evolved and are therefore similar. Typical arguments are as follows: ?By studying the magnetic field (or any other feature) of Planet X, we will better understand how Earth?s magnetic field evolved.? Actually, each magnetic field is surprisingly different. ?By studying Earth?s sister planet, Venus, we will see how plate tectonics shaped its surface and better understand how plate tectonics works on Earth.? It is now recognized that a plate tectonics process does not occur on Venus. The amount of water on Earth greatly exceeds that on any other planet in the solar system. Liquid water, which is essential for life and has unique and amazing properties, covers 70% of Earth?s surface. Where did all Earth?s water come from? If the Earth and solar system evolved from a swirling cloud of dust and gas, practically no water would reside near Earth?s present orbit. Any water (liquid or ice) that close to the Sun would vaporize and be blown by solar wind to the outer reaches of the solar system, as we see happening with water vapor in the tails of comets. Comets, which are about 85% water (by mass), did not bring much water to Earth, because comets contain too much heavy hydrogen, relatively rare in Earth?s oceans. For an evolutionist, comets also contain too much argon. If comets were the source of only 1% of Earth?s water, then, using evolutionist?s assumptions, our atmosphere would contain 400 times more argon than it does. The few types of meteorites that contain considerable water also have too much heavy hydrogen.These observations have caused some to conclude that water was transported from the outer solar system to Earth on objects that no longer exist. If so, many of these ?water tankers? should have collided with the other inner planets: Mercury, Venus, and Mars. These planets should have similar water characteristics as Earth, but those characteristics are dissimilar. Instead of imagining ?water tankers? that all disappeared, perhaps Earth was created with its water already present. 
Broad, but increasingly precise, relationships are sought between causes and effects. These relationships, called scientific laws, help predict future phenomena and explain past events. 
Notice, this does not mean the first cause must be naturalistic. It is poor logic to say that because science deals with natural, cause-and-effect relationships, the first cause must be a natural event. Furthermore, if the first cause were a natural consequence of something else, it would not be the first cause. Scientific laws can provide considerable insight on ultimate origins even though the first cause cannot, by definition, be duplicated. Yes, there was a beginning.

32,Does it really have to be Creation VS Evolution?,evolution,attack,"Oh, and let me apologize, you're right, Evolution is a theory. Note, a theory is described by Webster as a ""speculation"". 
Wrong, you still don't understand that a scientific theory is quite different from the common usage of the word. The theory of evolution is much much more than a 'speculation'. If you don't understand science, you can't effectively debate it's merits. You obviously don't understand science!
This is a common example of microevolution?changes in size, shape, and color?or minor genetic alterations. It is not macroevolution?the upward progression in complexity from bacteria to man. 
Just as you don't know what a scientific theory is, you don't know what macroevolution is either. Macroevolution is described as a change at or above the species level, we have seen new species emerge, so therefore, we have seen macroevolution. The changes your talking about wouldn't be apparent in our lifetimes because they take so long. But the fossil record gives us clear examples of macroevolution, we have a great many clearly transitional fossils, like Archaeopteryx, Acanthostega, ext.... These are examples of macroevolutionary changes, what is your explaination for them? 
Then we have organisms that are clearly transitional that are still living today, the platypus and the lung fish are 2 excellent examples. Evolution explains them, what is the creationists explaination for them? I mean, the platypus has both mammal characteristics and reptilian characteristics, evolution is the best explaination, and as far as science goes, the only explaination.
The theory of evolution conflicts with this scientific law by claiming that life came from nonliving matter through natural processes. 
You're 3 for 3, you don't know anything about the theory of evolution either!
Evolution says nothing about how life first arose, that's abiogenesis. It doesn't matter where the first life came from, naturally arose, carried here by a meteor, magic skyman poofed it into existance, once it was here, it evolved.
Spontaneous generation (the emergence of life from nonliving matter) has never been observed. All observations have shown that life comes only from life. This has been observed so consistently it is called the law of biogenesis. The theory of evolution conflicts with this scientific law by claiming that life came from nonliving matter through natural processes. 
Nope, there is no law of biogenesis that says life can't come from non life. Creationists like to pretend this is true, but it's not. Louis Pasteur never disproved spontaneous generation from dead organic matter, but he nver conducted any experiments on abiogenesis. And of course this has nothing to do with evolution.
Mendel?s laws of genetics and their modern-day refinements explain almost all physical variations observed in living things. Mendel discovered that genes are merely reshuffled from one generation to another. 
Nope, your wrong again! Mendel did not say genes are merely reshuffled from generation to generation! Once again, Learn what your talking about!
A logical consequence of Mendel?s laws is that there are limits to such variation. Breeding experiments and common observationsc have also confirmed these boundaries. While Mendel?s laws give a theoretical explanation why variations are limited, broad experimental verification also exists. 
Give us any of these ""experiments"" that confirm these limits, I say you're lieing once again to protect your silly myths.....
For example, if evolution happened, organisms (such as bacteria) that quickly produce the most offspring, should have the most variations and mutations. Natural selection would then select the more favorable changes, allowing organisms with those traits to survive, reproduce, and pass on their beneficial genes. Therefore, organisms that have allegedly evolved the most should have short reproduction cycles and many offspring. 
Depends entirely on which niche the organism evolved to live in. Organisms that have evolved the most should have short reproductive cycles??? This doesn't make sense......And bacteria today is just as evolved as humans, again, you have no concept of what evolution really is!
Organisms that occupy the most diverse environments in the greatest numbers for the longest times should also, according to evolution, have the greatest potential for evolving new features and species. Microbes falsify this prediction as well. Their numbers per species are astronomical, and they are dispersed throughout practically all the world?s environments. Nevertheless, the number of microbial species are relatively few. New features apparently don?t evolve. 
What?!?!! Like most of this post, this is just goobldygook. The number of microbe species are astronomical, nevertheless the number of microbial species are relatively few????? Well, what is it, are they astronomical or few?? And of course new features evolve, thats the whole premise of antibiotics, and bacteria has evolved to inhabit every niche on the planet, from the hottest deep sea hydrovents to the coldests glaciers of antartica.
Ever hear of nylon eating bacteria? Your whole statement about new features apparently note evolving is disproven by reality. Why you yourself have 50-100 mutations in your genetic makeup.
While natural selection sometimes explains the survival of the fittest, it does not explain the origin of the fittest. Natural selection prevents major evolutionary changes. Mutations are the only known means by which new genetic material becomes available for evolution. Rarely, if ever, is a mutation beneficial to an organism in its natural environment. Almost all observable mutations are harmful; 
And here we see you don't understand natural selection and mutation! How does natural selection prevent evolution??? Mutations are not almost all harmful, they are mostly neutral. As I said the average human has 50-100 neutral mutations. It is the environment the mutation expresses itself in that determines if it is harmful, neutral or beneficial. Now if a group of animals was split off from the parent group and a random mutation allowed them to exploit a new food source that was plentiful in the new environment, natural selection would favor those that had the mutation and those who couldn't exploit the new food source would die off, evolution in action. Again, how does natural selection prevent evolution???? 
There is no reason to believe that mutations or any natural process could ever produce any new organs?especially those as complex as the eye, the ear, or the brain. 
Another example of creationists being willfully ignorant. Since we see all levels of eyes in nature, from simple eye spots to the complex eyes of hawks and all degrees in between, it IS reasonable to theorize that mutations can account for the evolution of the eye (or heart or brain, ect...)
All species appear fully developed, not partially developed. 
Yes, but what about species that are clearly transitional as well as being fully developed, like the platypus or the lung fish?
There are no examples of half-developed feathers, eyes, skin, tubes (arteries, veins, intestines, etc.), or any of thousands of other vital organs 
Another lie! There are millions of examples of just this! Do some research!!!!
There is no direct evidence that any major group of animals or plants arose from any other major group.  
What about Archaeopteryx, what aboput the therapsid reptiles? what about the fossils for horse evolution? What about the fossils for primate evolution??? You are demonstratably wrong!

You stole the work of another and presented it as your own. I doubt that you will be prosceuted since Dr. Brown probably didn't suffer any monetray loss. All you needed to do was to mention somewhere that the source of your material was Dr. Brown. That would have been the moral thing to do. That would have been legal and considered ""fair use."" Instead you stole what was not yours. And then you justify it by claiming that you are lazy.
Also, there are some posting here who have spent years in the study of evolutionary biology, but you didn't feel like spending the time to learn the basics and educate yourself. But that is quite typical of creationists. You, like others, merely parrot others (in your case, plagerize others) without investing any effort or work.
And finally, related to the last point, you presented no evidence whatsoever. The problem is that because you seem to be too lazy to put in the effort to learn, you don't know enough to realize that you presented misundestanding and falsehood. Demon38 did a pretty good job of showing why you were wrong - actually, why Dr. Brown is wrong. Not only is your evidence not overwhelming, it isn't evidence.
Also consider that you argued against something without presenting any evidence in support of your view. Why not give evidence to support your view? Do you have any? Virtually 99% of biologists and geologists are evolutionists. Of other scientists, 95% accept evolutionary theory as correct, even though it is out of their field. The polls show that the scientists who are most likely to be creationists are chemists, and even at that it is only around 6%.
By the way, Dr. Walt Brown is an engineer. He is not a scientist and definitely not a biologist or a geologist.
And you made a common mistake of the uneducated. You grabbed the first definition that you understood. You see. If you intend to argue with the theory of evolution then whatever definition you agree with isn't relevant. To argue against the theory of evolution you must understand what an evolutionary biologist means by the word theory and you must use that definition in your argument. Since an evolutionary biologist does not imply that the word theory even hints of the idea of speculation, if you argue against speculation your are off the mark.
Let me give you an example. Let's suppost that you claim that Jesus died for your salvation. Now, am I allowed to define the meaning of the word salvation in an effort to make you look foolish? Would doing so be a valid argument against your position? Certainly not. First I must understand what you mean by the word and address my arguments to that meaning. Who knows. Maybe I even agree.
Now if you had read a bit farther in your dictionary you would have found this definition: ""5: a plausible or scientifically acceptable general principle or body of principles offered to explain phenomena <wave theory of light>"" Another definition comes from Talk origins.
Notice the reference at the end that indicates the source of the definition. Since the author of the page that I am citing did not compose that definition, he gives the reference to his source (just as I did). That reference is, by the way: Barnhart, Clarence L., ed., 1948. The American College Dictionary, New York: Random House.
So a theory is a body of knowledge that explains phenomena. That comes about by the use of the scientific method. First there is an observation. Next, based on other experience, knowledge, scientific theories and even a little speculation, a scientist constructs an explanation for the observation. He then makes a prediction that is the logical and necessary consequence of the hypothesis - it must be true if the hypothesis is correct. He than devises an experiment to test the prediction. When an hypothesis has passed many such tests it is called a theory.
But even then, there are levels of acceptance. The theory of gravitation has many, many uncertanties. There remains a lot of work. Nuclear theory is fairly secure - what we need to know to operate nuclear power reactors we already know. The germ theory of disease isn't doubted by even the most uneducated. The heliocentric theory is known by 3rd graders. And evolutionary theory is one of the oldest and best tested of all. Evolution is so well tested that it is no longer doubted except for religious reasons. 
Then welcome to the internet. Today must be your first day.
Perhaps you aren't aware of this, but science isn't actually done on the internet. Posting on the internet does not make anything true. In science, the modern system works by a process of peer review. Research is submitted to professional journals where it is evaluated by a jury of peers (other scientists in the field) before being accepted for publication. It is then out there in the scientific community for review and further testing.
Sadly, I think that you don't know of what you speak, which is more important. You see. If you knew what you were talking about then it wouldn't be necessary for you to plagerize the work of another. You could present your points for yourself.
I didn't see anyone who called you an idiot.
I doubt that. Since there is no such thing as ""evolutionism"" it can't be true. If you mean science books that deal with evolutionary biology then why don't you name a dozen or so.
Nope. One of the most striking things about evolutionary theory is that once one invests the time and effort into learning what it is about, it becomes so obvious. T.H. Huxley commented about Darwin's theory of natural selection, ""How stupid of me not to have thought of that."" With some real effort into educating oneself it becomes a beautiful, mysterious, wonderous, and sometimes cruel report of what is observed in nature.
But you have already shown that you are too lazy to investigate. You did a cut and paste job from Walt Brown and didn't even give him credit. You didn't think for yourself. You were a bobble doll on the dashboard of creationism - no thought - just nods.
AHA! So it is possible that you actually can think! A really good question. And it has been answered by evolutionary biology. Indeed it is true, and it is observed. Do you know what a thylacine is?
But there are limits. I don't know of any case where a lobster looks like a wolf.
And that may be your problem. You sit back and wait for someone to educate your rather than investing the considerable effort necessary to educate yourself. You see. Science doesn't ever claim any such thing as ""supreme"" evidence. All evidence of science is only the best that we have to date.
Unless you are educated enough to discuss each and every one in detail, you are blowing it out your pipes in order to save your bacon.
I didn't know that because it's not true. As I recall, all of the ""Lucy"" fossils were found in an area less than 9^2 meters. Once a significant fossil is found it seems to motivate an intensive search. I don't know what area was searched for ""Lucy"" fossils. Certainly fossils of a single individual were not spread out over 9 square miles. If what you say is true, the purpose most certainly wasn't to find fossils of a single individual. Think about it. Is what you say rationational? Could two fossil bones that were found 3 miles apart be rationally claimied to be from the same individual?
Now you are a liar. That isn't true. You have made an unsupported assertion and I demand that you support it from scientific literature or that you withdraw it and apologize.
Let me state again that ""Lucy"" was found in an area of less than 9^2 M (perhaps you are unaware the I have just made a claim about 9 square meters rather than 9 square miles. Perhaps the problem is that you haven't invested the effort to understand what you are talking about.)
I have appointments with two paleoanthropoligists in the next month and a half, both involved with Homo evolution research in Africa. Should I present your claim to them?
But I'll go you one better. Donald Johanson found Lucy. I can contact him and verify if the search area was nine sq miles or nine sq meters. I suspect that since Johanson uses the metric system in Africa that it will be meters rather than miles. What do you think? I haven't bothered Dr. Johanson until now but I'll ask him about the miles/meters thing if you want.

A scientific theory or law represents an hypothesis, or a group of related hypotheses, which has been confirmed through repeated experimental tests. Theories in physics are often formulated in terms of a few concepts and equations, which are identified with ""laws of nature,"" suggesting their universal applicability. Accepted scientific theories and laws become part of our understanding of the universe and the basis for exploring less well-understood areas of knowledge. Theories are not easily discarded; new discoveries are first assumed to fit into the existing theoretical framework. It is only when, after repeated experimental tests, the new phenomenon cannot be accommodated that scientists seriously question the theory and attempt to modify it. The validity that we attach to scientific theories as representing realities of the physical world is to be contrasted with the facile invalidation implied by the expression, ""It's only a theory."" For example, it is unlikely that a person will step off a tall building on the assumption that they will not fall, because ""Gravity is only a theory.""

http://home.xnet.com/~blatura/skep_1.html#1.2

In popular usage, a theory is just a vague and fuzzy sort of fact. But to a scientist a theory is a conceptual framework that explains existing facts and predicts new ones. For instance, today I saw the Sun rise. This is a fact. This fact is explained by the theory that the Earth is round and spins on its axis while orbiting the sun. This theory also explains other facts, such as the seasons and the phases of the moon, and allows me to make predictions about what will happen tomorrow.
This means that in some ways the words fact and theory are interchangeable. The organisation of the solar system, which I used as a simple example of a theory, is normally considered to be a fact that is explained by Newton's theory of gravity. And so on.
A hypothesis is a tentative theory that has not yet been tested. Typically, a scientist devises a hypothesis and then sees if it ""holds water"" by testing it against available data. If the hypothesis does hold water, the scientist declares it to be a theory.
An important characteristic of a scientific theory or hypotheis is that it be ""falsifiable"". This means that there must be some experiment or possible discovery that could prove the theory untrue. For example, Einstein's theory of Relativity made predictions about the results of experiments. These experiments could have produced results that contradicted Einstein, so the theory was (and still is) falsifiable.
On the other hand the theory that ""there is an invisible snorg reading this over your shoulder"" is not falsifiable. There is no experiment or possible evidence that could prove that invisible snorgs do not exist. So the Snorg Hypothesis is not scientific. On the other hand, the ""Negative Snorg Hypothesis"" (that they do not exist) is scientific. You can disprove it by catching one. Similar arguments apply to yetis, UFOs and the Loch Ness Monster. See also question 5.2 on the age of the Universe.

About similar characteristics. Is it at all possible that two creatures could have similar characteristics because it serves a purpose for both of them, something they both need to accomplish, not just because they are ""evolutionarily related""?
Sure. Some creatures evolve that way. Structures important for survival (like the eye) of for using a niche (like wings) have evolved many times, independently of each other. Birds and bats both have wings. In fact ""bats"" really are a lose mix of 11 different groups that evolved wings independently of each other. And the eye certainly exists in just about any form and function you can imagine in many different species who are only remotely related. The process is called ""Convergence"":
http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/glossary.html
----
convergence Convergence is an amorphous evolutionary term that is used in somewhat different senses by different authors (or even by the same people at different times). It generally refers to similarities between organisms that evolved independently, i.e. similarities not directly inherited from a common ancestor. Convergent similarities can involve structure, form, and function. Strict convergence of both function and structure is very rare, except in trivial cases. Convergence of form and function is common, and is a direct prediction of the theory of natural selection. In a sense, convergence is the opposite of homology.

'Science' itself has no opinions and makes no opinions. The scientific method is based upon observation of physical evidence, not opinions. Scientific theories are the explanations of the physical evidence, and have survived rigorous testing and the introduction of additional physical evidence as more is discovered. The only way to alter or discard a theory that I am aware of is to present actual physical evidence that is not supported by the theory. At this point in time, science cannot ignore the reality of the new evidence in question, but must find an alternate theory that better fits the evidence.
To this date there has never in the recorded history of the earth (including the history 'recorded' in fossils) been ANY physical evidence that contradicts the theory of evolution. If there had been, the theory of evolution would no longer be a valid theory. If ANYONE ever discovers actual physical evidence that contradicts the theory of evolution, the theory would either be modified or tossed out. NO ONE ever has. Period.
This is not physical evidence. If you wish to believe a literal interpretation of this passage based on faith without supporting evidence, you are free to do so. But the fact remains that in the physical world in which we live, there is no supporting evidence for a literal translation of this passage. So, to accept this literal translation, you MUST ignore the physical evidence of the world around you. A literal interpretation means that you MUST ignore the fact that the earth has been around for more than 10,000 years or so (and there is an abundance of physical evidence that coincides with this idea, and absolutely no physical evidence that contradicts it).",47,48,topic_stance_votes_1

God doesn't care about biological specifics or weird claims of how observable things are not possible due to dogma. God cares about how we treat our fellow man. The Bible is God's tool for educating us in how to treat each other.
Ah, that is because you focus on the Bible, rather than on God.
Evolution is correct, that is known because it has been directly observed. Creation is God's explanation to us of where we come from, tempered by translations and ignorance of the authors and translators. Again, trying to focus on specific words of translations of translations is rather futile.
The idea of the ""new earth,"" based solely on counting days in the Old Testament, that simply is stupid. The Earth is around 5 bill years old, and the universe is around 14-16 bill years old. That is proven.

As sea levels rose as the ice age was ending some 10,000 to 11,000 years ago, drainage patterns did not run into the Black Sea. Ryan and Pitman found evidence that the Mediteranean broke through at the Bosporus and raised the level of the Black Sea some 400 feet. The unscientific part is that Ryan & Pitman think that the people living around the Black Sea migrated and took legends of the great flood with them. These legends became the ones from which the Hebrew legend was derived.
There are, by the way, the remains of a coast line and even primative human habitation down some 400 feet in the Black Sea.
The channel of the Bosporus is very deep although it is filled with silt. There is also a plunge pool in the Black Sea where the Bosporous leaves the Black Sea. That is one of the things that Ryan & Pitman found out that made them realize that the Bosporus at one time flowed the other way.

o The Pentateuch was written by the person(s) who wrote the Pentateuch.
o The book of Genesis is an account of Gods creation, as communicated by the person(s) who wrote Genesis, who was/were allegedly inspired by God.
o The most current translations of the bible were taken from wherever they were taken from. As far as I'm aware, none of the original texts are still in existence.

I may not have an accurate understanding, but my point stands that they were taken from wherever they were taken from.
o Sandy (along with many other people in the world) is of the opinion that ""The bible is the inerrant Word of God, written by men devinely [sic] inspired by God.""
o According to the story communicated in Genesis, there is a specific order to Gods creation. This story, taken literally, may or may not reflect reality. Assuming God is not intentionally misleading us by creating fabricated physical evidence, then we can know with certainty that the story does not reflect reality.
o When one takes the Word of God to be a literal account of history, there can be no co-existance... Correct. Which is why it is impossible to be aware of actual physical evidence that contradicts a literal interpretation of Genesis and rationally state that the actual physical evidence that is known to exist in the physical world does not actually exist.

But we don't have to... because there are probably also biblical scholars who say it definitely means one literal 24-hour period. Even the most revered biblical scholars are welcome to their opinions. Their beliefs may or may not reflect reality, just like your beliefs and my beliefs may or may not reflect reality.

Ok, then why do you side with the Bible? Is it the fact that the Bible contradicts itself several different times on dates (the birth of Jesus for example) or that you would rather ignore things that are absolute truths in order for our universe to operate (the speed of light for example).
Ok, I'm outside the box. How do you know anything you see is real? Do you know how your eyes work? Unless you're also going to ignore the important work in biology done in this area, you'd know that light entering your eyes hits your retina and the rods and cones in your eyes and is translated into an image by your brain. That light that enters your eyes comes from some object or thing that the light bounced off of, and depending on what the object is, your brain would interpret what you see based on that light (this is why no human can see a black hole - light can't escape its gravity). So, taking what we've learned, if a star is 20 light years away, and a light year is a distance that light travels in a year, the light would take 20 years to reach earth. In this way, the light entering our eyes from that star would be some image from 20 years ago. And if we assume stars are actual light years away (unless your views correspond to the Ptolemian model which has earth in the center and the sun, moon, and stars fixed in crystal spheres) Adam of the Genesis story would not be able to see that star for 1 year - 2days (assuming that Man was created on the 6th day and the stars were created on the 4th). No one can see something that is too far for light to travel in that short amount of time (and if you reject this as well, you've just lost all of physics). And as far as carbon and other radioactive dating methods are concerned this http://geology.wr.usgs.gov/docs/usgs...ageofearth.pdf should be able to detail how the scientists who work for our government have narrowed the age of the earth to approx. 4.54 billion years. I'm afraid that you are the one in the tiny box, ignoring blantant truths that you cast asside as God-hating Science. If you feel that you are the next Aristotle who assumed that just by using assumptions that he could rationalize the world. Well guess what, all of his theories on how the world worked were wrong, and unless you actually have some real-life evidence of how your adopted theory works, then you have about as much ground as he does to talk about anything related to our world (by the way, the Church made Aristotle's theories their own for about 1000 years).

113,Does it really have to be Creation VS Evolution?,evolution,support,"Let me play Devil's Advocate here for a second, if you will. If you believe in Creationism as it is literally written in the Book of Genesis, then you would a priori believe that normal laws of physices don't apply. For example, God created the universe from nothing. If you hold physics to apply in all cases, then this is the first impossibility. Matter can't be reated or destroyed under normal means. Even if God could convert energy into matter, there would have to be something present before God started so that he could convert some to matter. Again, if He started from nothing, it would be physically impossible. 
Until one can reconcile the supposition that God doesn't follow the known laws of physics, any discussion about the speed of light pales by comparison.

A literal interpretation of the story of Genesis, along with the belief that the Bible is the inerrant word of God are in direct contradiction with actual observed physical evidence. A literal interpretation of a story combined with a belief does not constitute actual physical evidence. It constitutes a human belief that was made up by humans, even if those humans that hold that belief believe that God has revealed the truth to them... It is still a belief. There is nothing inherently wrong with this belief. But it is a belief. No one with this belief will ever be able to provide actual physical evidence for their belief.

Terral's reply >> I am a creationist that believes God used evolution to repopulate this planet after the Satanic rebellion caused darkness (Gen. 1:2) to separate the singularity forms of expression (of Gen. 1:1) into the man (earthly) / angel (heavenly) forms we have today. God’s original creation (Gen. 1:1) became broken, and we are now living in a reconstituted creation. The physical record in creation identifies lower forms evolving into higher forms. The amphibian dynasty preceded the reptilian dynasty. A ‘day’ to God is simply a very, very long time to men. Scientists say life came out of the water, and so does your Bible. (Gen. 1:20). Male and female came along later (Gen. 1:26-28). Those are sixth day people that have been here evolving over millions of years (Leaky’s Lucy) into the races we have today.
Adam, however, is a different kind of man altogether from the sixth day races. He was formed by the Lord God on the seventh day (we are still living within the boundaries of that day) into the singularity expression that existed in Genesis 1:1. He was spirit (breath of life), body (dust of ground) and ‘became a living soul.’ Gen. 2:7. Eve and the Seed were taken out of this one man, who previously possessed every member of the Adamic race within him. So while mankind has been on this planet for millions of years, the descendants of Adam (the descendants of Shem, Japheth and Ham; Noah’s sons after the flood) have been here for only the past 6000 years. Everyone else on this planet is descended from the sixth day races.
The land of the garden is the ‘land’ where Noah’s flood took place. The Hebrew expressions for ‘earth’ and ‘land’ are identical. Simply replace the mistranslated word earth with land, and the whole account makes better sense. The animals on the Ark were from a local population and not a global one. This is the same ground as the Promised Land given to Abraham, and the site of the future Messianic Kingdom of Israel. 
Obedience to the gospel today places us in the position of regaining our pre-fall (Gen.1:1) imperishable vehicles of expression. See 1Corinthians 15.

apathy, technically you are right, except that water vapor is invisible and water droplets in clouds arent. and even though the clouds are not at the top of the sky, there is sky between the clouds and the earth. the volume of air (oxygen, nitrogen, water vapour, nitrogen, inert gases, etc) between the clouds and the sea is called sky, just like i said before. reading the bible literally would bring me to this same conclusion. i still dont see any ambiguity in the passage

now dont get me wrong, im still not saying that this passage is true, nor that what it says happened in reality. but isnt this what the passage would mean if read literally? i cant say for sure that God actually did that the way it say he did, but its a fact that between the clouds and the seas (the 2 bodies of water) there is a big empty expanse.

The seven Hebrew words that make up Genesis 1:1 work together to describe a completed, perfect (mature), unified creation of a single expression. Creation was then made up from the love, light and life of God Almighty. There was no such thing as stars and planets, death and destruction, male or female, darkness or suffering of any kind. All the created beings of God were perfect, and were formed with the knowledge of all things. This was the very reason for God to create Lucifer in the first place. Look again at his name, which is “the anointed Cherub that covers.” Scripture says, 
Many forget that Satan was a good guy for a very long time during the Perfect Period of Genesis 1:1. 
Note that precious stones are rewards for good works (1Cor. 3:12-14), and Satan had plenty of time to receive all of them. However, those days would come to an abrupt end. ""You were blameless in your ways from the day you were created until unrighteousness was found in you.” Ezek. 28:15. That started the Satanic rebellion that caused the ‘darkness’ of Genesis 1:2.
A very large gap appears between these first two verses of your Bible. Evidence for the gap is found here, 
And Peter’s words here, 
So the original creation was not created in the ‘void’ condition of Genesis 1:2, but our universe became broken as the result of the Satanic rebellion.
It is through the mutiny of God’s highest ranking cherub that death and darkness entered into the universe, which affected the very fabric and physical make up of everything. Instead of a universe filled with perfect beings of light with a single expression, creation became a place with angels and men. After all, instead of being one thing the heavens and earth became totally separate, and an empty gulf came to exist between the two. The agency through which these two realms would again become One (that is the ultimate goal after all) was called into being in Genesis 1:8. “God called the expanse heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.” Heaven became the place where the two created seas of spirit (heavens) and water (earth) overlapped.
Then God had to make provisions for creatures of a physical nature. Instead of God illuminating creation (and us) from within, He had to create the stars for our eyes, and planets for our feet. Note at the very end, what Scripture says, “And there will no longer be {any} night; and they will not have need of the light of a lamp nor the light of the sun, because the Lord God will illumine them; and they will reign forever and ever.” Rev. 22:5. If you wish to see how things were before the Satanic rebellion, then look how things come to be after the devil and death are thrown into the lake of fire. 
Back to our timeline, we see a series of days (periods) where God created the principal components of this reconstituted universe and our specific world. Scripture is telling the story of how God used evolution to call these things into being. Science says that life began in water, and so does Scripture. “Let the waters teem with swarms of living creatures . . .” Gen. 1:20. Life on earth went through many stages of development from lower life forms to higher. That is why we find amphibian footprints in lower layers of stone strata, and reptilian tracks in layers above them, and so on. Then, on the sixth day (still millions of years ago), God created the male and female of Genesis 1. Dr. Leakey’s “Lucy” is dated back to about 1million years by some, and up to 3 million years by others. The right answer is most likely somewhere between the two.

Adam was formed by the Lord God on this seventh day. Gen. 2:7. Many believe that this event dates back to about six thousand years. I place the forming of Adam back much farther in earth history, but it is difficult to tell just how far back to go. Adam was not formed in the same image as men today, and Eden was a place where the heavens and earth overlapped. It was the ‘heaven’ of our specific earth. The tree in the center of Eden was the same ‘anointed cherub that covers.’ Adam was the first, but was not to be the last. This created realm would house all of the newly created beings, who were to be fashioned according to the Genesis 1:1 blueprint. Those special beings would be created knowing everything; perfect knowledge. Therefore, when the Lord God (or Adam) had a secret to keep, then this tree was the means of covering that knowledge. Time passed . . . how much time? Again, it is hard to tell. But, Adam had time to name all the animals, to sit down, and become bored. And thus . . . “but for Adam there was not found a helper suitable for him.” Gen. 2:20. 
So along comes Eve, “The LORD God fashioned into a woman the rib which He had taken from the man, and brought her to the man. The man said, ""This is now bone of my bones, And flesh of my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was taken out of Man."" Gen. 2:23. These two are a perfect pair for this heaven realm on earth. Events transpire, until Adam and Eve fall in the likeness of what occurred during the Satanic Rebellion. With the curses of Genesis 3:14-19, Adam and Eve were also cast down into this present earthly environment. And this marks the time that the clock starts ticking, and we can trace that back on our timeline to just about six thousand years ago. Just place the gap between Gen. 5:1 and 5:2. So Adam lived in his fallen condition “930” years. Gen. 5:5.
Note, again, that he is NOT a sixth day creation, and is NOT the ‘male’ created in Genesis 1:26-28. Sixth day people are native inhabitants of the land. Note that when Cain left the presence of the Lord, he found a wife and had children. Gen. 4:16+17. He found his wife from among the sixth day people. 
Terra’s reply >> There is plenty of room for Creation and Evolution, and there are different kinds of Creationists. Let us not assume that all ‘Creationists’ believe exactly as we do. If we rightly separate the sixth day people (Gen. 1) and seventh day Adam (Gen. 2), then there is room for evolution of the first, and creation of Adam. I believe we have God’s Word as a record, and creation itself as a testament. And they both tell the same story. It is just that men wish to interpret Scripture, as if one day to God is the same as one day to men. Then they blind themselves into not seeing the physical evidence in creation. But, remember again that ‘the anointed cherub that covers’ is loose in the world, and “has blinded the minds of the unbelieving . . .” 2Cor. 4:4. He is the ‘deluding influence’ of 2Thes. 2:11, and, accurate ‘knowledge’ about these things is difficult to come by, when the god of this world has it covered. 
What does Paul tell us? 
Look out into the cosmos, Unkerpauline, and take a guess at how long God Almighty has been in the Creator business? God’s Word says that His eternal power and divine nature have been CLEARLY seen, being UNDERSTOOD through what has been made. Since creation has every appearance of being billions and billions of years old, we should expect that this is the answer our Creator intended for us to clearly see. So a ‘day’ (Gen. 1) to Elohim is a very long time to men. Altering that one interpretation of Scripture allows plenty of time for God to use evolution as a tool. After all, He has an infinite amount of time. 
Terral’s reply >> We agree. However, this is about whether or not any Creation interpretation is compatible with any theory of Evolution. ""Does it really have to be Creation VS Evolution?"" I am a creationist who believes 100 percent that the Lord God formed Adam from the dust of the ground and blew life into his nostrils. Gen. 2:7. I also believe that creation is much older than even our planet earth. We can calculate that the universe has been around in its present form for much longer periods, by examining the light reflected from distant galaxies. Remember that we are not seeing distant stars, as they appear today, but as they appeared tens of billions of years ago. And, every time we build a bigger telescope, this place just gets bigger. Romans 1:20.

170,Does it really have to be Creation VS Evolution?,evolution,attack,"this interpretation/version od the creation story sounds pretty unbiblical to me...
if we take all these verses within the context of ""the events of the sixth day, then
- all land animals were created on day six (friday by modern conventions).
- man was created on the same day
- eve was also created on the same day. which also implies that all the animals would have been named that day.
- adam was made in God's image and likeness*
*since you say that adam was created much earlier than 6000 years ago, and that adam was not formed in the same image as ma today, then was adam closer in likeness a neantherthal/prehistoric homonid than modern man? and does God's image resemble these ape-men?
about cain and his wife, its not impossible to imagine that cain married one of his sisters, and not one of these undocumented people. in gen 5, it say that adam and eve basically spent the next 600 or so years after the birth of seth having children (what a life!). cain and abel may have been relatively young when the murder occured, and cain went into exhile. in the meanwhile, eve starts popping out more kids. it may be possible that cain might have been wandering in isolation for over 100 years, by which time even could have borne 40 or so sons and daughters, some of which would be old enough for marriage. in fact, adam and eve may have been great great great grandparents and still having kids. a man could have been a little older than his great aunt and decide to marry her.
in any event, to me this explanation seems more consistent with what the bible says than the idea that more people were created outside of the garden or outside the six day schedule",169,171,topic_stance_votes_1
