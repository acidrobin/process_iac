Based on your your experience what do you think God is like. Do not base it on what others say about God or on what the bible says or the Koran or ... you get the point.
Base it strictly on your own life experiences. I know you may not think God exists or you believe for sure he does not. But given your life, what you remember of it, what would you say that means about who God is.
Thanks, and just so everyone knows, I will not argue with your experiences but I may argue with your conclusions drawn if they are illogical or to challenge you to think of other possibilities. Please do the same for me. I will post on my own experience later.

1,IF God really exists what must he/she/it be like?,existence of God,attack,"I have had nothing that resembles any kind of experience, or even a hint of experience, of God or a Godlike entity/consciousness. I believe that all the world's religions, from the earliest to the most modern, have nothing to do with what the reality of a godlike consciousness might be. They are human constructs designed to answer questions for which at present we have no answers.
However, there is one thing that the prominent religions have in common that I think they may have right if 'he/she/it' does exist, and that is the idea of omnipresence. To put it simply, if there is a Godlike entity I think it is probably the universe. This is pure conjecture, but I believe the universe could be a conscious entity. Why not? 
It would not have thought processes that we as humans could in any way relate to, and given the predictability of physical phenomena according to the laws we have discovered it would not seem to be able to will anything to happen, but it could still have a sense of itself and an awareness of everything within it.
This inability of humans to understand this hypothetical consciousness is why I cannot subscribe to a religion; if 'he/she/it' does exist there is no way any human could possibly understand it, relate to it, communicate with it, or even know that it exists. I doubt very much that it, if it exists, would have any interest in individual human beings; it would see us as purely an extension of the matter that makes up the planet, after all that is essentially what we are.
The whole process of evolution (specifically including abiogenesis) has been the transformation of inanimate minerals and chemicals into living creatures through a mind-bogglingly complex 4 billion-year chemical reaction. We came literally out of the matter of the planet. That matter came from a nebula which was originally part of a long-exploded (population II) star, which formed from a nebula from an older exploded (population I) star, which was born as the galaxies formed from the hydrogen and helium left over by the processes that started it all. In terms of the particles that make up the atoms in our bodies (and everything else), we all come from the same place. 
OK I'm completely rambling now but my point is that I do not believe that there is such a thing as a 'God', at least not with any of the connotations that that word has had in the history of human culture. If our brains can be conscious, why not the universe?",1,2,topic_stance_votes_1

38,IF God really exists what must he/she/it be like?,existence of God,attack,"OK...first up excuse me if what I say makes no sense as I have never tried to really formulate my thoughts on this...
First up: omnipresence/omniscience/eternality:
I'm not sure omnipresence is the definitive word to use because it implies that there is something 'other' than is 'present' everywhere, alongside or behind every point in the universe. My POV is that 'God' literally is the universe, every particle, every wave, every field.
This certainly implies awareness of everything within the universe and all past events, but if you include knowledge of future events in the term 'omniscience' I am not so sure; time is another dimension like the spatial dimensions but it is very different in terms of what happens when you 'travel' along it compared to travelling through space, so I have never been able to view 4D spacetime as literally 4 equivalent dimensions; it is 3 space dimensions plus time. With this in mind, I am not sure that even a universal (ie space-transcending) consciousness would also transcend time.
As for eternality, this hypothetical consciousness would only exist as long as the universe exists, and we all know the problems with that little tangle...
Hmmm.... I think maybe it's possible to have a brief, fragmentary awareness of a higher order, a glimpse of something that is just too vast for the human brain to rationalise, but definitely not in terms of (for example) recieving ten commandments on a mountain, or a woman being impregnated with divine offspring, etc.
It's possible that our brains could work like recievers, picking up fragments of the universal consciousness but if that is the case I think it is more likely to lead to madness than enlightenment!
I said I have had no experience of 'God' but I have had (and some will scoff I know) bizarre, spiritual experiences on LSD and mushrooms, which I have only done a few times (before I get accused of being a spaced-out hippie!). The only way I can describe the experience is as a realisation that everything, all matter and energy, is connected in a fundamental way, and more than realising it you actually experience it, you experience being part of something all-encompassing, and once you are a part you are also the whole in its entirety. You lose all sense of self, and gain a new sense of something akin to omnipresence. Of course this may just be a hallucination entirely confined to the brain but it feels so real at the time that it's hard to know.

That without a relational god we are truly hopeless. The problem you are running into is that you are trying to imagine god existing within the framework of creation (universe etc.) and tying his existence to that. NOw I am going to say something that will really not make sense to you. God existed BEFORE time. Chew on that one a bit. Eternality implies an existence outside of time. And in fact, much of science alludes to this possibility. I certainly could never prove it and do not propose to but would like it if you would consider the implications.
As for God communicating to us, there is nothing that prevents that. Especially if you accept the idea that we are imago dei, image bearers of the divine. We are not perfect images but we are rational, emotional, spiritual, beings

61,IF God really exists what must he/she/it be like?,existence of God,attack,"Back to the only debate in this thread so far...
Why? I have heard variations on this many times and it utterly baffles me. Why do you feel we need a divine being who is interested in us, personally and collectively, for us to have any 'hope'? Hope, for me, as in hope for humanity, comes from what I see around me as being the positive qualities that we have as a race.
I cannot believe that a universal consciousness would care (in terms of what we humans think of as caring) about what happens to us in the long run, because the long run is either heat death or big crunch. If we are still around in this unimaginably distant future we may well have developed means to avoid the same fate as the universe, but if we don't, or if we die out before that, then that's that. End of story.
This is kind of tied in to the question I had trouble answering before, the answer to which I am still having problems defining: If God is the universe, he/she/it is also every one of us, every particle as I said before. If you look at the history of the planet in terms of particles, it's all just one dynamic system, the rocks, the oceans, the atmosphere, and the biosphere as well. The plants and creatures on this planet are made of atoms that used to be part of the rocks, oceans, and atmosphere. From this singular perspective there is no distinction between the living and the non-living parts of the planet; it's one colossal biochemical reaction.
I will concede that it is possible that this 'God' entity might be aware of our own consciousness, because according to my own logic the entity also is the matter that constitutes our brains, and it is certainly the case that many people believe God has spoken to them. Some of these people are treated as having had religious experiences, some are treated as having lost their sanity. 
However this in no way leads me to contemplate the idea that the Bible, Koran, Hindu Vedas etc are any more revelatory truths than are the Greek Myths or the Aboriginal Dreamtime; these are human constructs. Some of the individuals mentioned in these various texts may have had 'divine' experiences (or may have been insane {same difference}) but it does not logically follow that any of these texts have any special significance, either compared with one another or even if accepted equally or on their own merit.
But I don't see a problem. I do see a problem with proposing that God is something 'other', something special. I have a brain, which is a real physical object. I also have a mind, which is an abstract thing the true nature of which cannot yet be ascertained, but I do not believe that it is the result of anything other than the fantastical complexity of the brain. If the physical structure of the universe is equivalent to a brain, then 'God' is the mind, but he/she/it is only a product of the universe's fantastical complexity, and not the creator.
Given my last paragraph it should be clear why I don't agree with this. I also am not aware of any theories that imply any kind of extratemporal phenomena, only speculations as to what (if anything) may have happened before the Big Bang. If anything did (eg previous Big Crunch) that is not outside time, that is only time that is inaccessible to us in terms of observation. 
Nothing that prevents it communicating in theory, but I have covered the communication aspect already in this post. 
The idea that we are 'image bearers of the divine' comes purely from human religions, and has no concrete basis. The atoms in my body were created by nuclear fusion in the centres of stars that exploded billions of years ago. Rather than being imago dei, we are stardust. I find that idea far more grandiose and appealing than divine providence.

66,IF God really exists what must he/she/it be like?,existence of God,support,"Actually, my idea of ""god"" is eerily similar to yours.
The entire natural world around me, aka the universe, is to my mind ""god"". Everything around us, and everything that we are, comes from this physical world, and the complexity and beauty of it are never less than astounding.
I will never understand this line of thinking. Concluding that life is meaningless and hopeless because it is not created or guided by a supernatural being is completely illogical to my mind. IMHO, ""what is my purpose?"" is a false question. 
Firstly, why does one's life require a purpose? Cannot simply living and enjoying every moment of being alive be reason enough? Do you live your life for an end goal (God), or for the enjoyment of living and the people and the world around you? To reword the old saying, is life about the destination, or the journey?
Secondly, why does life being ""random particles"" prevent a person from having a purpose? Your purpose is whatever you would like it to be. Ultimately, our purpose is to perpetuate life and the species, hopefully making the natural world in which we live a better place along the way.
Why does ""random particles"" make life meaningless? Given Liminus', and my, interpretation of ""god"", we as humans are part of an amazing natural world, a random (semi-random) mix of particles that have come together to give us life and the gift of the world around us. That's not meaningless, it's incredible. We're part of an unimaginably old and incredibly complex chain of reactions, and those reactions of which we were briefly a part of, will continue to go on for eons. You and I are part of that natural world. 
IMHO, if you believe life is meaningless and hopeless, it is a conscious choice, and the problem lies within you, not in the need for a supernatural God. There's a world around you full of hope, and full of the need to have people contribute to it, you only have to choose to do so, for your own sake. No outside motivation should be required.

Why are we emotional, why do we need love, why do we need other people. There are many many questions that compose the purpose question. 
Even you cannot get away from it. You say you don't need a God but you still indicate that purpose comes from inside yourself, your choice, you admit the need for purpose.
Why does it need to be external is your real question. I submit, that the idea that we live 80 years within this current cosmic reality and that everything then just stops, lends itself to a lack of purpose.
Also you did not address the issue of depression. Check the statistics from NIMH and you will see that the number one and two reasons for it are a lack of purpose and lack of control. Control just adds to the debate. We don't need to control if we feel that our need for purpose is being met.

68,IF God really exists what must he/she/it be like?,existence of God,attack,"Simple answer - because we have evolved a conscious mind that greatly increases our chance of survival. 
Many of the qualities you list are not unique to humans, they are common in the natural world. Why do wolves travel in packs? Why so some wolves aspire to be the alpha male, while others are content with subservient roles? 
Emotions, love, the need for others, even the spiritual, are all evolved conscious mechanisms by which humans greatly increase their strength and chance of survival as a species. I don't view them as being separate or distinct from simple functions like eating and sleeping. 
Te purpose of all of these things is simple, to survive and perpetuate the species.
I don't admit the need for a purpose, especially an ""ultimate"" or ""universal"" purpose. Living to enjoy life is all that's required. Enjoying life often means having some goals, a job, your family, etc... If that is what you consider a ""purpose"", then I guess I would agree that we often need a puprose.
Purpose is an abstract human construct, it's certainly not required to live. 
Perhaps it is. On an individual level moreso than on a large scale or species level. I question the need for an individual to look beyond themselves and the world around them to provide meaning to their lives. Why is the supernatural better than the natural?
Why though? I laid out the ground work of why I believe your assertion is false, but you haven't provided any support for it.
I know very little about depression. I'm not one to sit around and feel sorry for myself. I've known very few people in my life that I would consider depressed, and those that are tend to annoy me, I have little time for them. The world is what you make it.
IMHO, depression is either a chemical imbalance, or is a conscious choice, a state of mind that can be overcome.
If people are depressed because they don't have a purpose, then they should simply look at the world around them and realize what they're missing, what they're a part of, and what they could be doing. Same thing goes for control, it's a matter of your chosen perception. If you don't feel you have control, step up and take control.
At any rate, I'm not sure what the point of the depression discussion is to be quite honest.

The part that is unprovable was:
Aspiration attributed to an animal is a stretch but not really what I want to argue.
The evolution of a concious mind is not provable. One can assume evolution of a concious mind but to do so requires a leap of faith. It is not an observable phenomenon. It requires that you believe evolution occured. It also requires the assumption that there is not a ""personal"" God and the assumption that if God exists then He is completely uninvolved. There could be evidence to that degree, but there is evidence that God is involved. We could debate which evidence is better but it is debatable at best.
The idea you state of an impersonal universe and of evolution both support a beginning and and end to a single life. Evolution does not support life beyond death. It in fact contradicts it. Evolution comes from the assumption that things end. To better explain, assume that there is life after death, then how does that impact the ""survival"" idea. If all animals live beyond death then the need for individual survival falls off and even the need for societal survival falls away. It is not needed as a motivator as we will go on forever.
Survival as a motivator only allows me to do what is in my best interests. Even survival of a society only allows me to do what is best for my society and actually encourages warfare so that one society may dominate by being the fittest (so to speak). Knowing that we go on after death actually means that I don't have to work so hard at caring for myself and am instead free to care for others.

It requires that you accept the best (most supported) and least complicated possible answer to the question, evolution. I will agree that it can't be proven - given our current level of understanding.
The ""assumption"" that there is not in fact a personal ""god"" is not an assumption at all, it's a logical starting point.
Introducing a personal god and putting him in control is where assumptions begin and logic ends. It's a simple matter of Occam's Razor and the scientific method. Neither requires faith, only logic and intelligence (not meant as a insult, only in that one must be able to understand the science and logic in order for it to be of value).
There have been countless threads on this, and to my knowledge, there has not been any proof or evidence put forward as yet as to god's involvement. I'll leave that door open to you should you decide to attempt to supply it. 
IMHO, there is no real debate here. The facts speak for themselves.
Honestly? No. Not to me anyway.
I don't know many people who don't bother with trying to survive in this life because they believe in an afterlife where they will go on forever. I would fear for any person such as that's mental health.
Putting off today in favour of tomorrow will never make sense to me. Even if I had a second life, I'd prefer to live them one at a time, and each to its fullest.
I disagree with your assumptions regarding survival and warfare. Constant warring is not the means by which to best ensure our survival, it's an intentional misrepesentation often chosen to bolster the case for ""god"" over evolution.
As for having more time to care for others - If what you have left, your mark on the world, is what you leave behind, then caring for others and the world around you is of the utmost importance, but you have to survive in order to do so. Selfishness in not inherent in the need or desire to survive.
I'm not sure where else to go with this, IMHO, your premise is artificial. You also haven't really clarified why life is meaningless and hopeless without God, you've only presented the notion that you have more ""free time"" to worry about others if you have an afterlife in place. That may or may not be true, depending on the particular circumstances, but for the most part, I believe it's a false premise.
It would seem to me that our debate boils down to a very simple premise - the natural world around us vs. the supernatural. Everyone is free to make their choice as to where they get their answers. I've made mine based on which choice I felt was the best supported and most logical, but at the same time, I can respect those who've chosen differently. Whatever works best for them is the choice they should make.

76,IF God really exists what must he/she/it be like?,existence of God,attack,"Maybe I was sleeping that day. I missed your specific definition of assumption. I was working on a slightly different definition.
There is no evidence of God, therefore any mention of his existence is an assumption.
There is plenty of evidence that the physical world around us exists, so no assumption is needed to work from that basis.
I understand the point you're making, that we don't have all the answers regarding cosmic science, abiogenesis, etc..., we can only theorize and attempt to test and verify the theory. However, that simply means we don't have the answers, it's doesn't mean the answers don't exist, or must come from the supernatural.
You're appealing to the ""God of the gaps"" as evidence for your position.
No, numerous other areas of science deal with the origin of the universe.
Evolution addresses the changes in life over time, abiogenesis addresses the origin of life.
The boogeyman addresses both too, the problem is, there's is no way to test the validity of either entity, and therefore no logical reason to conclude that they did have an impact, even if it can't be proven that they didn't.
You can never prove that God does not exist, I didn't miss that logic class. ;) 
It's simply a non-issue as far as science is concerned. Science does not deal with the supernatural.
What is observable and what isn't observable? I'm lost again.
I also have a feeling that this is quickly boiling down to another debate on the definition of faith.
Yes, it is. God to me is not a conscious being, and certainly not relational.
I'm unfamiliar with your assertions regarding density and the speed of light, and their relationship to the universe being created. You obviously put a fair bit of stock in this, as it apparently forms the basis for your belief in God. Do you have a link to the info?
I've laid out my thoughts, I figure it's time for you to lay out yours. So far I have down that you believe God is a relational entity without which life would be hopeless.
I think I've successfully challenged the notion that life without God is hopeless, at least I assume so from your lack a response on the subject, so the question is, how do you envision God?

77,IF God really exists what must he/she/it be like?,existence of God,attack,"Ahhhhh Very good argumentation. There is a great deal of evidence for the existence of God. I am not sure that I would characterize it as scientific, but evidence nonetheless. Certainly documentary evidence and writings concerning God go back a long way. The fact that we actually create is evidence for a creator. There are certain miraculous events which cannot be explained by science or can only be speculated upon by science. The raising of the dead, healing of the terminally ill through prayer (I have witnessed this thing on one occasion without any oddball televangists involved) amongst others. While I will admit there are things there we do not understand, they are still EVIDENCE. It does not mean that there are not other possible explanations but they still support the existence of God.
As to my understanding of God. He is relational. He is Love, He is omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent. He is creator, judge, savior, king, prince of peace, wonderful counselor, a strong fortress. He is the beginning and the end, He was before time and will be after time, he brought all things into existence, He defines Good, He is good, he is the lover of my soul. He is my caretaker, my hope and my portion. He is the best thing that ever happened to me.

Prayer and Mortality

Objective & Design: 
Investigators examined the effects of private religious activities like prayer and Bible study on survival. A random sample of 3,851 community-dwelling adults aged 64-101 years residing in the Piedmont of North Carolina was surveyed in 1986 as part of the NIH Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) program. Private religious activities and a wide variety of sociodemographic and health variables were assessed at baseline. Vital status of members was then determined prospectively over the next six years (1986-1992). Time (days) to death or censoring in days was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards. 
Findings: 
During a median 6.3-year follow-up period, 1177 subjects died. Low levels of private religious activity (meditation, prayer, or Bible study) were a significant predictor of mortality in healthy but not disabled subjects. After the investigators controlled for demographics and health status (including depression and stressful life events), persons with no disability and little or no private religious activity in 1986 were 63% more likely to die during the follow-up (HR [hazard ratio] 1.63, 95% CI 1.20-2.21). Even after controlling for social support and health behaviors, investigators found that lack of private religious activity continued to predict a 47% greater risk of dying (HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.07-2.03). This study is important because it is one of the first to show an association between private religious activities and longer survival in certain population subgroups. For more information contact: Judy C. Hays (jch@geri.duke.edu) or Harold G. Koenig (koenig@geri.duke.edu). 
And there are many more. No these do not prove the existence of god because there are other potential explanations, none of which can be proven either. The next argument that comes is that we take the most reasonable solution. The problem with that is that it is a subjective statement as to what is reasonable and not objective and therefore has little value in a debate where objective standard must determine the outcome.

First off - I agree that everything (well almost everything), you've presented can be considered evidence. The question is, is it GOOD evidence? Is it observable, reliable, testable, repeatable, etc...?
Documentary evidence and writings are your best evidence, and as I'm sure you know, they don't form the strongest basis. 
The fact that we create is in no way evidence of a creator. That's false logic.
I'm not aware of any documented and scientifically verified cases of anyone being raised from the dead.
""Miracles"" most often have explanations, where we have no explanation, God can be inserted, but so can anything, including simply, ""I don't know"".
Healing of the terminally ill through prayer is pretty much a dead end street. I think that's been proven in this thread.
I don't doubt the ""power of prayer"" has some positive influence on those that are ill, however, the fact that the prayer is to the Christian God is irrelevent.
Prayer means the presence of loved ones and a positive atmosphere, IMHO, that affects the mental state of the patient, and that in turn can help in overcoming illness. 
All of this ""evidence"" is indeterminate in nature, it could support the existance of God, but it could also support the existance of Thor or the boogeyman. 
Alternatively, it could simply be that we don't as yet know the answers, and it isn't evidence of anything.
Interesting.
I have no real objections to your definition, obviously I disagree, but as you've defined god, I can understand the attraction. I think it's a pretty standard definition of God for all put those of the extremes (your EZs). 
Irregardless of the omniscience and omnipotence, and the ""power"" associated with him in your definition, god would make a good parent, sibling or wife.
My question then is simple - if that is the case, when why attempt to justify his existence using science, or more specifically logic? Why is faith in god as you've defined him not enough to satisfy you?

For example, consider the new testament. The originals (which we do not have) were written in greek between roughtly 50 and 100 AD. While we do not have the originals there are 5000 manuscripts available with approximately 25000 copies available. Some dating back to as early as 120AD by scientific dating methods.
In comparison for Plato's manuscripts there are only 7 copies in existence and the earliest manuscript is over 1300 years after the fact of the writing. Yet these are absolutely considered to be authored by plato and to be good copies of what he actually wrote.
Norman Geisler makes several key observations for our consideration:
No other book is even a close second to the Bible on either the number or early dating of the copies. The average secular work from antiquity survives on only a handful of manuscripts; the New Testament boasts thousands.
The average gap between the original composition and the earliest copy is over 1,000 years for other books.
The New Testament, however, has a fragment within one generation from its original composition, whole books within about 100 years from the time of the autograph [original manuscript], most of the New Testament in less than 200 years, and the entire New Testament within 250 years from the date of its completion.
The degree of accuracy of the copies is greater for the New Testament than for other books that can be compared. Most books do not survive with enough manuscripts that make comparison possible.
As to the argument I raised concerning prayer and miracles, I will concede that portion. NOt that I think your correct, simply that I cannot prove it and the evidence for it has alternate explanations. It was a poorly constructed argument on my part with little actual research done. I will do more and if I find something better then I will post.
As to your last question: ""My question then is simple - if that is the case, when why attempt to justify his existence using science, or more specifically logic? Why is faith in god as you've defined him not enough to satisfy you?""
It is plenty to satisfy me. However, it is not enough to satisfy you and others. My hope is to make you question and think. I also hope to learn more about my own faith and beliefs as you question me. It is good for me. I share it with others BECAUSE it has been good for me. I only wish such goodness for others as well.

107,IF God really exists what must he/she/it be like?,existence of God,attack,"I have no real argument with the above, it's not worth debating the minor details. There's no question that the Bible has been well preserved. The problem is, it's inconsequential to the real issue at hand. It's the best of bad evidence.
Without some way of verifying the text(s), then the Bible is no greater proof of God than Harry Potter books are proof of Harry Potter and witches. I know I'm not telling you anything you don't already know.
Ultimately, the Bible, and God, cannot be proof of God. It's circular reasoning and a logical fallacy.
That's a difficult task. I'm not sure your research will ever turn up what your looking for.
You do make me think, far more than most on the board, especially in the religious section, dominated by the likes of EZ et al. 
I do absorb the info in these religious discussions, and occassionaly it is challenging, however, far more often than not, the information I'm presented on the side of religion only reinforces my existing beliefs. 
I believe we've talked about this before. About the desire of those who believe to somehow justify their beliefs or put them on a concrete, physical footing. Personally, I don't understand it. The choice has been made to have faith in God, something that can never be physical or concrete, at that point, the rest should be irrelevent.

108,IF God really exists what must he/she/it be like?,existence of God,attack,"Quite correct as far as proof goes. I disagree on the ""best of bad"" evidence. The evidence is equal in quality to what we already accept of secular documentation. It is even far better. Why then is it acceptable to say that ""the bible is unreliable"" or ""invalid"" and then also say that the works of Plato or aristotle are valid and reliable. Which is what happens from most atheists on this board as far as I can see. 
Additionally there is plenty of archaelogical evidence of many events in the bible. I believe there was astronomical evidence of an eclipse as described in the bible. There has been discovered a marker with the name Pontius Pilate within the last 20 years I think. There is corroborating evidence as well. 
The only real point I make, and I think you actually agree, is that to use one set of documents in an argument and then argue that the other set is unreliable or invalid when it has a greater probability of reliability and validity is simply poppycock.
Quite likely.
Again, it is not the desire to put them on some concrete or physical footing it is simply to show that the concrete and physical nature are not as non existent as one might think. Again, it is to challenge our thinking so that we are not so one sided as I am often accused of by trebor. I think an examination of my argumentation will typically show that I am very open minded, but just because I consider both sides of the argument and do not limit myself simply because I DONT believe something....

110,IF God really exists what must he/she/it be like?,existence of God,attack,"I do agree, in as much as the Bible can be proven historically accurate, it should be accepted as such.
The difference EF, is that Plato and Aristotle are not used as proof of a supernatural being, global floods, and miracles. Those documents are also not claimed to be perfect and divinely inspired.
They are simply different levels of ""validity"". 
There is also plenty of archeological, geological, etc evidence that contradicts the Bible as well.

112,IF God really exists what must he/she/it be like?,existence of God,support,"Let us also look at the conclusion that Geisler is coming to.
His conclusion is that because there were so many copies so early, that it 'proves' that the books were historically accurate, and therefore his interprestion that the 'prove' J4sus to be God and Messiah is true.
This is a false conclusion based on the evidence. What CAN bec concluded is that the development of Christaintiy happened within the time period that manuscripts would not have deteroirated, that it happened during a time there was a higher level of literacy, and that the preservation of those manucripts were important to the priests after the fall of the roman empire.

If you're trying to win over converts and increase your strength, the truth of what you're selling, and your belief in that truth, isn't always the most important factor. The world is full of such examples.
They obviously thought it important, and had a strong desire to preserve and preach it, but whether or not they believed it to be completely true, that's another story. Many likely did, as many believe so today, others likely did not, and manipulated it for their gain, or the gain of ""the church"", as many do today.

To look at how seriously the authors took it, you would have to look at the documents themselves in a historical/cultural context. It has been suggested by some that the author of Matthew wrote it as satire against the early Christian belief, and it was backed up by them in a reasonble manner. I would say that the person who wrote Luke and Acts took it quite seriously (and admits quite clearly he was not an eye witness), and 
I can understand why some people would consider Matthew a satire on it (not sure I totally agree). 
I will say that the gospels (with possibly the exception of Matthew) were written with honest beliefs. It does not make them true.",114,118,topic_stance_votes_1
