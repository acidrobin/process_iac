0,One Step Closer,gay marriage,support,"Washington State Gay Marriage Ban Ruled Unconstitutional 
Olympia, Washington) A second judge has ruled that Washington state's ban on same-sex marriage is unconstitutional. 
A Thurston County judge ruled Tuesday that the state's 1998 Defense of Marriage Act violates the civil liberties of gays and lesbians under the Washington constitution. 
""For the government this is not a moral issue. It is a legal issue,"" Thurston County Superior Court Judge Richard Hicks said in a written ruling. 
Hicks acknowledged that the intent of the state's 1998 Defense of Marriage Act was very clear: Legislators wanted to limit marriage to a union between one man and one woman. But, Hicks said, that law directly conflicts with the state constitution.
""What fails strict scrutiny here is a government-approved civil contract for one class of the community not given to another class of the community,"" Hicks wrote. ""Democracy means people with different values living together as one people. What can reconcile our differences is the feeling that with these differences we are still one people. This is the democracy of conscience."" 
The case was brought by 11 gay and lesbian couples from across the state. 
The decision is the second victory for supporters of gay marriage in Washington state. A King County judge ruled in favor of gay marriage rights in a separate case last month. (story) 
Both cases will now go to the state Supreme Court, where they will likely be consolidated.

It seems to me that it doesn't blatantly attack homosexuals but rather limits marriage to a man and a woman.

If this law is discriminatory then it must also discriminate against me. For even though I am a straight male I can't marry another male. What if I really wanted to marry my best bud so he could recieve all the benefits that a spouse would. Unfortunately I am unable do this, too bad for me. It in no way forbids a homosexual lifestyle.

I'm happy to give you my definition of lifestyle. I reference lifestyle as meaning the way in which you lead your life.

I date and intend to marry a person of the opposite sex. Hopefully I will be blessed with children. This is what I classify as a heterosexual lifestyle.

Read on:
Many psychiatrists believe (a) it is wrong to consign a person to such isolation and loneliness, one who is thus cut off from close relationships with either sex, not temporarily but until death; (b) it is unrealistic to expect this for it is virtually impossible for it to be done; (c) many of those who attempt to do this do so for pathological reasons; (d) the ""almost inevitable results [of attempting celibacy] will be tragic in terms of suffering, guilt, and mental disorder;"" and (e) growth and maturity require deep and committed relationships in one's life.8-4
I wondered about pathology in attempts at celibacy until I read McNeill's statement:
In my experience as a psychotherapist, I have found that the vast majority of people living out a life of abstinence do so for pathological reasons. Many have interiorized the homophobia of the surrounding culture and the Church and as a consequence hate and fear their sexual feelings....Others live out a life of abstinence because of serious trauma to their capacity for intimacy with another human....Those who have repressed or denied their homosexual feelings for pathological reasons are the ones in greatest danger of acting out those needs compulsively, imprudently, and unconsciously, seeking punishment for what they see as their crime....I would heartily advise all gay people to develop the most intimate and committed relationship possible for them.8-5

25,One Step Closer,gay marriage,attack,"So if a drug addict, or an alcoholic stands up and says, ""God made me this way"", should we accept that fact, and give them drugs or alcohol. 
This is not an act of love. The Bible is very clear that homosexuality is not right in God's eyes. If a homosexual comes to Christ, then they need to seek Him, and ask that God help them in their walk with Him, just as the alcoholic or drug addict needs to also. It does not mean standing and saying, ""My lifestyle is pleasing to God"", but it means trusting in Him to remove this sin from your heart. 
If you do not know that it is a sin, then ask God to reveal this to you. I needed to have God reveal a similar thing (drinking) to me, before I could ask Him to help me with it. 
If you think that God wants a person to be a homosexual all of their life, supporting such ways, and that that stance is pleasing to Him, then you are very young in your walk or not with Him at all.

That way we can keep the sanctity of marriage between a man and a woman, and gays can still have a ""union"" with other gays.

Emotional love is an ongoing process. It takes time to develop. Sex happens. A person doesn't usually LOVE a prostitute, but they do have sex with them.

To ""find our way back"" is going against humanity in general. As a species we evolve, we learn, we grow. As societies go, they must also grow or perish. Societies and governments which are unable to allow for growth will ultimately destroy themselves. 
Societies cannot take one step foreward and twelve steps back and survive. 
Yes, we do live under an entirely different set of circumstances. Technology has done a lot of this. It allows us to communicate even now. With people whom we have never met, exchange ideas and learn from eachother's experiences. 
Personally I find that a miracle! A wonderous achievement of which we all should be grateful. 
Jaaaman, even you enjoy these advances. If you want to ""find [your] way back to truth"" I suggest you practice what you preach and be the first to set the example. Remove your computer, radio, television, cell phones, microwave oven and anything that has been invented within the past 150yrs, try it for a while, see just what you are so upset about and then come back here and tell us what you've learned from that experience.
I bet you can already imagine just how 'inconvenient' your life will become. Chores which you and your family take for granted will become the center of attention because they will take exhorbinant amounts of time to get done. Getting to work will be an expedition not just an inconvenient commute. Washing your scrubs will be an all week task for you or your wife. etc etc etc...you get the idea.
So, tell me exactly what is ""truth"" now? 
The truth is that we all grow, we all learn, we all reap the benefits of these things. Just look at overtly regligious communities and tell me just how well they are doing. Look at the Memonites, Amish and Shakers. They are all dieing out because they can't compete in an ever changing world. Societies must grow along with progresses of technologies to survive.",56,60,topic_stance_votes_1
