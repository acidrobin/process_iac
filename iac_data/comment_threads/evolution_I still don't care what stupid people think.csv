If creation science bamboozles someone they simply have no ability at science and none of there views on science will ever be worth anything. Does anyone actually no a human being that could not see through creation science all by themselves and has opinions on science you consider worthwhile. Currently most people think I am the opposite, I can see through creation science but my opinions about science are not worth anything ;)",0,1,topic_stance_votes_1
1,I still don't care what stupid people think,evolution,support,"I'm not entirely sure I understand.
Creation science is a oxymoron in the first place. 
The majority of people who are fooled into believing it either have poor reasoning skills, or lack of scientific knowledge. One can be fixed for sure. If one believes in Creation science, their opinions count as to what science should be teaching or emphasising differently, as to create a larger rift between what CS people practice and what real science does. It is a right to learn, even from your enemy.",1,2,topic_stance_votes_1
2,I still don't care what stupid people think,evolution,support,"The problem with so-called creation science is that it isn't actually science. Science aims to look at the evidence with an open mind and see what fits. Creation science starts with a theory and then picks the evidence to fit it. It's the difference between receiving intelligence and then deciding what to do, and deciding to invade Iraq and looking for intelligence sources that give you justification.",2,3,topic_stance_votes_1
3,I still don't care what stupid people think,evolution,support,"I think that's overly simplistic. I've spoken with alot of creationists, both in forums and in real life, and many of them are quite intelligent and well educated. The problem is that people have an amazing ability to filter out things that don't fit into their pre-conceived notions. I'm sure you've seen this in all sorts of different fields, it's just most pronounced when someone is denying facts, rather than refuting an opinion. If someone is devoutly religious, and firmly believes in a literal interpretation of the Bible, then facts which contradict that belief simply don't take hold. It's not that they don't understand logic or science. It's more like they've trained themselves to not hear things which go against their beliefs.",2,4,topic_stance_votes_1
4,I still don't care what stupid people think,evolution,support,"Perhaps, however in my expierence (yes, I realize this is circumantial), I have met only a single creationist who even remotely understood evolution. The rest spouted off the idiocy of ""if we came from monkeys....""

5,I still don't care what stupid people think,evolution,attack,"Ha, CS being stupid. Or could it be the fact that you aren't satisfied with the fact that creation is more than just possible or theoretical, but actually has evidence to support it and the Bible? I don't consider myself to be a Biology major, but really how long are you going to argue over this subject? We could spend eternity arguing faith vs logic, science vs creation, and end up exactly where we started. 
Fact:
Most Christians have accepted Jesus Christ and the Bible as truth not because of it being ""a crutch for the weak and ignorant"", but because of the peace, joy and happiness of what Jesus brings to the soul.
Christians believe in Creation because it's a close spiritual conviction and belief in a God who holds supreme power.
To argue against these is foolish because you can't fight one's conscience or faith.
Fact:
Evolutionist/Scientist/and whatever you wish to be called, you long for the fact that not so much for your ""science"" to be proven right, but simply to have a guaranteed peaceful sleep that you won't have to face consequences for the sins in your life.
As for Creationist not believing in science, or can't except science because it contradicts their beliefs is simply an ignorant Creationist. I believe science was a gift, just as mathematics, music, and love. God gave us the brain we use, why would he not make us fit to be able to survive in the world? I know some of you on this board are like super genius biologist or at least act like it and I applaud your seek for knowledge, but I don't need to know every aspect of Biology to be satisfied or to solidify my faith in God or his Power. Do I claim to know the answer to every doctrinal aspect of the Bible? No. I simply have seen, figuratively, move in people's lives and make them for the better.
As for the political abuse of religion and all the other garbage, I agree it has tainted the view of religion, but that should not diminish one's faith. Even in Jesus's time, he often disputed with the Pharisees and Saudicees. Anyways, I kind of got off topic, if it helps you sleep at night to mock and scoff at those who have a belief in God and his Creation, then all the good for you. However, don't make a topic acting arrogantly presuming you have foiund the key to disprove creation, or else you would be much to busy to be sitting online to post this thread.

6,I still don't care what stupid people think,evolution,attack,"The difficulty is that you can pick and choose evidence to support any theory, however science aims for the ""best fit"" to the evidence.

Stating inbreeding exists does contradict the bible where adams children and Noahs animals interbred without any problems. Fundamentalists don't object when scientists that pandas are endangered and low numbers will make inbreeding a problem, If they think about the contradiction at all they would just write it of as the lord making the universe act differently back then. I don't think that is stupid behaviour. 
To be frank someone can use the bible as their guidebook for life without being stupid but if they check all the references for moneylenders in the bible and use that as a sole guide for picking a homeloan they are stupid.

32,I still don't care what stupid people think,evolution,support,"dude
perhaps i was too quick with you as post #16 and #27 were both reasonable. so i'll elaborate.
i am a big fan of community college as their mission is to educate those who would not otherwise be exposed to things. in many ways they are much better than elite universities elevating trivia as science.
post #20 quoted abovehowever is not worthy
the first lesson in philosophy is what philosophy is and is not.
as to my postings. there are several ways to counter an argument. the simplest is to post counter argument. but it is also possible to counter an argument with the way you post.
for example, in post #16 you talk about people believing in an imaginary relationship with superficial entities. superficially this may make sense, but you did cast aspersion on the faithfuls, suggesting that religious faith is somehow false by using the word ""imaginary"".
i responded in post #29 i applied your reasoning not to God but to you. I have no more proof in your existence than others have in God. As you have no way to prove my existence. Even if we meet in person this will not change, whether you subscribe to the ideation of the waking dream or more recently popularlized as the Matrix. Note though that even this does not disprove anything as Berkely (sp) suggested that reality, all that we perceive are words of God. For example, when you hear the word ""home"" an image comes to mind internally. The word of God is perceived externally. An interesting analysis.
Thus i highlighted the crux of your argument as i perceived them to be and applied it against you. which to me demonstrate a certain flaw in the reasoning, as well as to suggest that the inability to prove does not mean the inexistence of X, whether it be God, you, me, or ""true"" philosophy.
i'd also caution you from adopting the use of ""fallacious"" as others here are wont to do, because it usually connote only a superficial analysis of what is posted and an overly quick dismissal, and from that you get nothing in gained knowledge or understanding.
if you can appreciate this, then we can continue. otherwise i'll treat you as i treat Duo_boy.",20,33,topic_stance_votes_1
33,I still don't care what stupid people think,evolution,support,"I suggest you first learn what a fallacy is before commenting on how others should or should not use them. otherwise i'll treat you as i treat fracas_the_ignorantly_arrogant.
Whatever. My advice still stands.",33,34,topic_stance_votes_1
34,I still don't care what stupid people think,evolution,support,"Ok... so from what I can interperet, you are saying that since there is no way to ""prove"" our existence, and since there is no way to ""prove"" God's existence, God is real as we are, which is not neccesarily true. 
Also to note, scientists do not ""prove"" things in science. Scientists design experiments which are repeated numerous amounts of times, yielding results that suggest something, in accordance with their orginal ideas. Metaphysics is a messy subject, so when determining whether something is existing or not, the usual method is with Ocaam's Razor. The simplest solution is the right one.

35,I still don't care what stupid people think,evolution,support,"not quite
its more i can't prove your existence as i can't prove god's existence
and i can't disprove your existence anymore than i can disprove god's existence
the conclusion is that empiricism neither prove nor disprove god's existence

36,I still don't care what stupid people think,evolution,support,"Ok, I think we have reached an agreement. The idea of the existence of God can neither be ""proven"" or ""disproven"". To me, this means that God might as well not exist. Maybe to you, it ""proves"" his existence to some degree.
The use of Ocaam's Razor is for the assumption that if we can see it, hear it, touch it, smell it, taste it, detect directly or indirectly, it exists. If we do not use this assumption, then any hypothesis can be ""disproven"" by the ""fact"" that anything could not exist. However, there is always a possibilty that it actually doesn't. Science is not all black and white. There will always be data that casts doubt on the hypothesis, and vice versa, but, when considering if the hypothesis is ""true"" or not, then we see if the data that supports the hypothesis outweighs the data that does not.",36,37,topic_stance_votes_1

38,I still don't care what stupid people think,evolution,support,"actually i am an agnostic
i think it foolish hubris to declare god does not exist.

actually those are the perceived senses. and perception is fraught with error.

Uniformity to a certain extent. In any repeating experiment, there will most likely be more then one time where the data will not agree with the rest of the experiments. When I said majority, I didn't mean 51% to 49%, I meant more like 99.67% to .33%. Is it possible that the 1.33% is actually right?

Post # 1 (Me):
I said that it is up the the individual for him or her to determine how he or she wants to live. If they want to live with a philosophy already written out for them, that's great. 
If the person doesn't want to live like, that's great too.
I called the relationship between the person and God ""imaginary"", for you comment on it later.
Post # 2 (You):
You replied to Zardoz's post by saying that you should kill the people who do not want to convert to a certain religion. 
Post # 3 (Me):  
I replied to your statement saying that there is no ""true"" philosophy, meaning a standarized philosophy that everyone follows.
Post # 4 (You):
You ask me if I took the philosophy class in community college.
Post # 5 (Me):
From your two word comment in Post # 4, I thought you were alluding to assumption that since I took the class in a community college, it was wrong. So, I replied that you were wrong to make that assumption.
Post # 6 (You):
You explain in further detail on Post # 4, saying that I misunderstood the class. 
Then, you say that there is no such thing as a first lesson in philosophy, thinking that when I said first lesson, I meant a universal first lesson. 
You also say that there is no such thing as ""truth"".
You say that you don't believe that I exist.
Post # 7 (Me):
I replied that it does not matter if I misunderstood the class, because it does not weaken or strengthen my argument, and I said that I did not understand your statement about me not existing.
Post # 8 (You):
You respond to Duo_Maxwell's post by calling him ""duo boy"", saying that his argument was the fallacious one.
You respond to me saying that if there was no truth in philosophy, then there is no such thing as existence.
From the above comment, you conclude that I am not real as God.
Then you say you don't believe the above two comments you made.
Post # 9 (You):
You say that Duo_Maxwell said your statement did not make sense and declared it a fallacious argument, he is wrong.
You address a challenge to me and Duo_Maxwell to keep up in your argument.
Post # 10 (You):
On a side note, this is your longest post.
You say that you like community colleges because they are better then Ivy League ones.
You say that first lesson in philosophy is not that there is no ""true"" philosophy, but is actually explaining what philosophy is and isn't.
You refer back to my diction of the word ""imaginary"", saying that I chose that word specifically to cast doubt on the existence of God.
You say there is no way to ""prove"" something's existence, because there is always the possibility that one is dreaming. Then you say, that that does not ""disprove"" the existence of things because there is the possibility that reality is actually perception of the words of God.
You say that you have showed me the flaw of my argument, saying that you have used it against me. From this, you conclude that just because you cannot prove something, it does not mean it doesn't exist.
You say that one should not use the word ""fallacious"" because it just means that the person is not reading closely enough.
Finally, you say that if I follow your example, then you won't treat me badly.
Post # 11 (Me):
I try to summarize what you have said. My summary being, since we cannot prove we exist, and we cannot prove God exists, God is real as we are.
I say that in science, regarding the existence of things, scientists apply Ocaam's Razor.
Post # 12 (You):
You say that my summary is incorrect, saying that God cannot be proven to exist, as we cannot be proven to exist. Then you say that empiricism (the view that experience is the only source of knowledge) cannot disprove God's existence.
You say science discovers new laws.
Your second sentece doesn't make sense, so I guess you mean that science also suggests the existence of new laws before the new laws are percieved.
You say that Ocaam's razor describes things in the system, but does not accuarately describe the system itself.
Post # 13 (Me):
I thought that we had reached an agreement in that the existence of God can not be proven or disproven.
From that fact, I personally think that since God cannot be proven or disproven, it doesn't matter if he does exist at all. I make a presumption that you think he does exist because he cannot be disproven.
I say that Ocaam's Razor is used because hypotheses cannot progress if there is always the doubt that something that is bluntly there but actually isn't.
I say that hypotheses are considered ""true"" when the data that supports it is the majority of the data.
Post # 12 (You):
You claim that you actually believe that the existence of God can be proven or disproven.
You say that in your opinion, it is stupid to think that God does not exist.
You then say that perception by the senses is not accurate enough.
You say that ""good"" science is where all the data agree with each other.
You reply to Irvine's post, which I don't feel like translating.
Post # 13 (Me):
I ask you to stop pressing enter after every sentence, even if it does not start a new idea, becuase it is hard to quote from that.
I say that if your beliefs make you happy, then go for it.
I say that scientists have the make the assumption that things exist, or else science cannot progress.
I say that in most experiments, there will always be data that does not agree with the majority.
Post # 14 (You):
You claim that you were pointing out the error of my argument. 
You say that perception is not sufficient for metaphysics.
You say that the usual standard in science is within 5% accuracy.
Post # 15 (Me):
I ask you to explain to me what you are talking about.
I say that metaphysics does not ""prove"" God's existence.
Post # 16 (You):
You claim that you have already explained it before.
You say that it is wrong to use empirics to ""disprove"" the existence of God.

HS, that took a long time to write. Huh... Looking back, a lot of what you said either didn't make sense, was hard to understand, or didn't flow logically.
Since its late, I'll make an analysis of your argument later. I haven't checked other posts and forums, but do I get the award for the longest post ever (without pasted quotes)?
Edit: Alright, I think I got it. This whole argument was started my my use of the word ""imaginary"". By the dictionary definition, the relationship really is imaginary. They have never percieved God physically in any way, other than in the imagination, therefore imaginary. You argued that metaphysically, we are imaginary too. However, that does not strengthen or weaken my saying that God is imaginary, because people being imaginary does not make God more real, or more imaginary.
Then for some reason, we got into an argument about existence and how existence is determined in science and other unrelated stuff. 
I don't feel like talking about this anymore, so lets reach an agreement:
God can not be proven or disproven.
People are free to choose how they want to live.

After 2100, teleportation became a concept of reality.
End.
Before 2100, people could only imagine teleporting around, therefore teleporting was imaginary. However, it was still possible to teleport before 2100, but people haven't figured it out yet how to do it.

2005 BC the round earth was just an imagination. or was it?
yes, imagination is a dynamic process, and what was once imaginary can become real. and this i have no problem with and actually support my argument. this is the weakness of perception/empiricism as applied to metaphysics. because perception/awarness/imagination can be wrong.
otherwise when we ""discover"" something, we are actually creating it de novo. it may seem reasonable to say that we created teleportation in 2100 but does it make sense to say the Norsemen created north america?
when you declare something is imaginary, you are in fact stating it only exist in the mind and not in factual existence. as per the definitions. thus if God speak to you tomorrow, you know your statement that God is imaginary was false the day you spoke it.

Perhaps you would feel better about your misconception were I to stop there. You could perhaps say that Einstein didn't really have a clue about the universe. Then I would offer you this list of chronological order including ten other of the most notable scientists in history. I honestly hope this ruins your day, but I doubt you're smart enough for that. This is copied and pasted from http://www.godandscience.org/apologe...encefaith.html
1) Nicholas Copernicus (1473-1543)
Copernicus was the Polish astronomer who put forward the first mathematically based system of planets going around the sun. He attended various European universities, and became a Canon in the Catholic church in 1497. His new system was actually first presented in the Vatican gardens in 1533 before Pope Clement VII who approved, and Copernicus was urged to publish around this time. Copernicus was never under any threat of religious persecution - and was urged to publish both by Catholic Bishop Guise, Cardinal Schonberg, and the Protestant Professor George Rheticus. Copernicus referred sometimes to God in his works, and did not see his system as in conflict with the Bible. 
2) Johannes Kepler (1571-1630)
Kepler was a brilliant mathematician and astronomer. He did early work on light, and established the laws of planetary motion about the sun. He also came close to reaching the Newtonian concept of universal gravity - well before Newton was born! His introduction of the idea of force in astronomy changed it radically in a modern direction. Kepler was an extremely sincere and pious Lutheran, whose works on astronomy contain writings about how space and the heavenly bodies represent the Trinity. Kepler suffered no persecution for his open avowal of the sun-centered system, and, indeed, was allowed as a Protestant to stay in Catholic Graz as a Professor (1595-1600) when other Protestants had been expelled! 
3) Galileo Galilei (1564-1642)
Galileo is often remembered for his conflict with the Roman Catholic Church. His controversial work on the solar system was published in 1633. It had no proofs of a sun-centered system (Galileo's telescope discoveries did not indicate a moving earth) and his one ""proof"" based upon the tides was invalid. It ignored the correct elliptical orbits of planets published twenty five years earlier by Kepler. Since his work finished by putting the Pope's favorite argument in the mouth of the simpleton in the dialogue, the Pope (an old friend of Galileo's) was very offended. After the ""trial"" and being forbidden to teach the sun-centered system, Galileo did his most useful theoretical work, which was on dynamics. Galileo expressly said that the Bible cannot err, he saw his system as concerning the issue of how the Bible should be interpreted. 
4) Rene Descartes (1596-1650)
Descartes was a French mathematician, scientist and philosopher who has been called the father of modern philosophy. His school studies made him dissatisfied with previous philosophy: He had a deep religious faith as a Catholic, which he retained to his dying day, along with a resolute, passionate desire to discover the truth. At the age of 24 he had a dream, and felt the vocational call to seek to bring knowledge together in one system of thought. His system began by asking what could be known if all else were doubted - suggesting the famous ""I think therefore I am"". Actually, it is often forgotten that the next step for Descartes was to establish the near certainty of the existence of God - for only if God both exists and would not want us to be deceived by our experiences can we trust our senses and logical thought processes. God is, therefore, central to his whole philosophy. What he really wanted was to see his philosophy adopted as standard Catholic teaching. Rene Descartes and Francis Bacon (1561-1626) are generally regarded as the key figures in the development of scientific methodology. Both had systems in which God was important, and both seem more devout than the average for their era. 
5) Isaac Newton (1642-1727)
In optics, mechanics, and mathematics, Newton was a figure of undisputed genius and innovation. In all his science (including chemistry) he saw mathematics and numbers as central. What is less well known is that he was devoutly religious and saw numbers as involved in understanding from the Bible God's plan for history. He did a lot of work on biblical numerology, and, though aspects of his beliefs were not orthodox, he thought theology very important. In his system of physics, God is essential to the nature and absoluteness of space. In Principia he stated, ""The most beautiful system of the sun, planets, and comets, could only proceed from the counsel and dominion on an intelligent and powerful Being."" 
6) Robert Boyle (1791-1867)
One of the founders and key early members of the Royal Society, Boyle gave his name to ""Boyle's Law"" for gasses, and also wrote an important work on chemistry. The Encyclopedia Britannica says of him: ""By his will he endowed a series of Boyle lectures, or sermons, which still continue, ""for proving the Christian religion against notorious infidels.""... As a devout Protestant, Boyle took a special interest in promoting the Christian religion abroad, giving money to translate and publish the New Testament into Irish and Turkish. In 1690 he developed his theological views in The Christian Virtuoso, which he wrote to show that the study of nature was a central religious duty."" Boyle wrote against atheists in his day (the notion that atheism is a modern invention is a myth), and was clearly much more devoutly Christian than the average in his era. 
7) Michael Faraday (1791-1867)
The son of a blacksmith who became one of the greatest scientists of the 19th century. His work on electricity and magnetism not only revolutionized physics, but has led to so much in our lifestyles today which depend on them (including computers and telephone lines and so Web sites). Faraday was a devoutly Christian member of the Sandemanians, which significantly influenced upon him and strongly affected the way in which he approached and interpreted nature. The Sandemanians originated from Presbyterians who had rejected the idea of state churches, and tried to go back to a New Testament type of Christianity. 
8) Gregor Mendel (1822-1884)
Mendel was the first to lay the mathematical foundations of genetics, in what came to be called ""Mendelianism"". He began his research in 1856 (three years before Darwin published his Origin of Species) in the garden of the Monastery in which he was a monk. Mendel was elected Abbot of his Monastery in 1868. His work remained comparatively unknown until the turn of the century, when a new generation of botanists began finding similar results and ""rediscovered"" him (though their ideas were not identical to his). An interesting point is that the 1860's was the formation of the X-Club, dedicated to lessening religious influences and propagating an image of ""conflict"" between science and religion. One sympathizer was Darwin's cousin Francis Galton, whose scientific interest was in genetics (a proponent of eugenics - selective breeding among humans to ""improve"" the stock). He was writing how the ""priestly mind"" was not conducive to science whilst, at around the same time, an Austrian monk was making the breakthrough in genetics. The rediscovery of the work of Mendel came too late to affect Galton's contribution. 
9) Kelvin (William Thompson) (1824-1907)
Kelvin was foremost among the small group of British scientists who helped to lay the foundations of modern physics. His work covered may areas of physics, and he was said to have more letters after his name than anyone else in the Commonwealth, since he received numerous honorary degrees from European Universities who recognized the value of his work. He was a very committed Christian, certainly more religious than the average for his era. Interestingly, his fellow physicists George Gabriel Stokes (1819-1903) and James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879) were also men of deep Christian commitment, in an era when many were nominal, apathetic, or anti-Christian. The Encyclopedia Britannica says ""Maxwell is regarded by most modern physicists as the scientist of the 19th century who had the greatest influence on 20th century physics; he is ranked with Sir Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein for the fundamental nature of his contributions."" Lord Kelvin was an Old Earth creationist, who estimated the Earth's age to be somewhere between 20 million and 100 million years, with an upper limit at 500 million years based on cooling rates (a low estimate due to his lack of knowledge about radiogenic heating). 
10) Max Planck (1858-1947)
Planck made many contributions to physics, but is best known for quantum theory, which has revolutionized our understanding of the atomic and sub-atomic worlds. In his 1937 lecture ""Religion and Naturwissenschaft,"" Planck expressed the view that God is everywhere present, and held that ""the holiness of the unintelligible Godhead is conveyed by the holiness of symbols."" Atheists, he thought, attach too much importance to what are merely symbols. Planck was a churchwarden from 1920 until his death, and believed in an almighty, all-knowing, beneficent God (though not necessarily a personal one). Both science and religion wage a ""tireless battle against skepticism and dogmatism, against unbelief and superstition"" with the goal ""toward God!"" 
11) Albert Einstein (1879-1955)
Einstein is probably the best known and most highly revered scientist of the twentieth century, and is associated with major revolutions in our thinking about time, gravity, and the conversion of matter to energy (E=mc2). Although never coming to belief in a personal God, he recognized the impossibility of a non-created universe. The Encyclopedia Britannica says of him: ""Firmly denying atheism, Einstein expressed a belief in ""Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the harmony of what exists."" This actually motivated his interest in science, as he once remarked to a young physicist: ""I want to know how God created this world, I am not interested in this or that phenomenon, in the spectrum of this or that element. I want to know His thoughts, the rest are details."" Einstein's famous epithet on the ""uncertainty principle"" was ""God does not play dice"" - and to him this was a real statement about a God in whom he believed. A famous saying of his was ""Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.""

Really. Isn't that strange. I haven't found anything that would make me question Clive's knowledge of the subject. I would question your knowledge though. For having studied the topic for so long (or so you claim), I would think that you wouldn't show such misunderstanding of basic concepts.
Did he say that? I missed it. Or maybe you misunderstood what was said. Of course natural selection isn't the primary force for evolutionary change. But the funny thing is that I don't recall that it ever was considered as such, at least not since the 1920s or before. Natural selection is a mechanism of evolutionary change, and a quite important one, but I would think that calling it a primary force is a bit overblown.
The space bar on your computer seems to be malfunctioning. You keep sticking extra spaces around punctuation. It is annoying.
At any rate, I'm not sure what that little sentence fragment is supposed to mean. Are you implying that random mutation and natural selection together are the ""primary force"" or are you saying that punctuated equilibrium is? How does adding another mechanism (in the case of mutation) make it a ""force."" Yes, mutation and natural selection are two of the mechanisms of evolution. But, no, punctuated equilibrium is not. Perhaps if you explained what you think punctuated equilibrium is and why you think that it is a ""primary force.""
Well, I went back and looked and I don't find anything in need of correcting. Oh, wait. I guess I should say that the statement, ""Natural selection is the most likely mechanism for explaining how evolution occurs"" should be corrected to add, ""natural selection, in conjunction with other mechanisms..."". Happy now?
Not really. The difference is one of degree. I know of several examples of macro-evolution that are demonstrably nothing more than the accumulation of micro-evolution. I have found that biologists don't use the terms all that much anymore. They were first coined during the days of debate over a now discredited hypothesis about how evolution happens. Mostly I hear the terms used by creationists who confuse the meanings.
By the way,
What does ""extapolation"" mean? I've never heard the word. Perhaps you meand ""extrapolation,"" but that wouldn't make any sense. Darwin did state that he had read Malthus (funny how you characterize that as ""one other"") and got some of the initial ideas there. Of course, Wallace did too. And Blyth took many ideas from Lamarck, which were rejected by Darwin. And it seems funny that Blyth doesn't seem to have been aware that Darwin had ""borrowed"" his ideas, and even subsequently wrote about the ""Origen of Species.
No one mentioned Haldane's dilema. What was asked was that you explain, in your own words, the difference between Hamilton's and Haldane's equations for kin selection. What does that have to do with Haldane's dilema? By the way, the guy that you are probably referring to at Baylor is William Dembski. And Dembski's math on Haldane's dilema has been shown to be based on false assumptions.

125,I still don't care what stupid people think,evolution,support,"Fraud?!? Still don't understand science, do you...... This was a theory that was proposed by Haeckel in the late 1860's. But by the early 20th century, 
""ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny,"" was falsified. This is exactly how science works, theories are proposed and they stand or fall on the evidence.
Haeckel's theory was falsified by the scientific method. And hasn't been evidence for evolution since almost the turn of the century. Now, if these drawings are in textbooks, that's hardly the fault of science. And when I had biology in high school way back in the late 70's, there were none of Haeckels illustrations in my text books......
You're becoming infamous for making sweeping statements and being unable to back them up when pressed! I can think of only 2 frauds in the history of evolutioN. Piltdown man, which wasn't caught for a number of years and archaeoraptor, which was caught in a few months. Yes, Piltdown man is an embarrassment for science, but it was finally caught, decades later. Nothing in the theory of evolution ever hinged on Piltdown man, so this hoax does nothing to falsify evolution. And real scientists finally proved it was a hoax.
Archaeoraptor was quickly caught and wouldn't even have made the news if nation Geographic hadn't jumped the gun and published it before it was completely confirmed. So there you go, 2 frauds in 150 years, you say no science has produced frauds like evolution, support your statement and name a couple more that survived peer review for any length of time.
