Religion a ""Psychological Disease"" Say Experts 
LONDON (AP) ~ According to the Royal College of Abnormal Psychology, based in London, England, religion as we know it is actually more of a disease than an organization. 
""When you look at the various aspects of religion, you find that psychoses actually play a very large part,"" stated Prof. Dawnette Vancurenko, a practicing psychologist and long time member of the College. 
""For instance, irrational belief, which is usually associated with conditions like schizophrenia, is actually one of the primary ingredients of mental illness,"" she continued. ""It is a pervasive pathogen that finds its home in all religions."" 
Belief is an emotional acceptance of a proposition, statement or doctrine, according to the College’s own definition. ""Much of humanity’s beliefs are the result of prolonged and incessant indoctrination during their formative years, generally recognized as being the first four to five years of life."" 
""Intimidation and peer-pressure exert an ""I must believe"" ethic that soon becomes commonplace. A conceptual system is then created that will describe the actions an individual may or may not be permitted to perform."" 
""The process is augmented by another psychological factor, that of paranoia, a functional disorder in which the symptoms of delusions of grandeur and persecution are manifest. The delusions develop insidiously and become knit together into a rational and coherent set of beliefs that are internally consistent, and, once the initial set of assumptions is accepted, compelling and vigorously defensible."" 
""In the old days, voices in the head were referred to as ‘Revealed Knowledge,’"" remarked Vancurenko. ""Today we call them schizophrenia or multiple personality disorder."" 
""Fortunately, most modern prophets are on medication,"" she said.",0,1,topic_stance_votes_1

That too, could be an addiction.....but back to religion as a ""psychological Disaese"" or addiction....here are some talking points on the subject....
Some people can be so preoccupied with religion and its rites that, as with other addictions, they are unaware of events going on around them. They will hear no talk which threatens their addiction. 
As with work, religious addiction can be difficult to pinpoint because devotion to religion is worthy - so using it as a cover for compulsive behaviours is very effective. It is a classic case of the right words excusing the wrong actions. It is perhaps not insignificant that some family trees show a generation of religious addiction, the following generation of alcoholism, the following of religious addiction, the following of alcoholism and so on. 
Religion can be used as a cover for compulsive order, control and a feeling of power, for forced suppression of feelings, and as an excuse to govern the words and acts of others.  It can also allow the sufferer to feel safe, through justification, from the consequences of their own actions. As with all addictions, it allows the addict to avoid dealing with reality. The following indications of religious addiction I have compiled from a number of sources: 
Do you find that, when you are faced with problems or frustrations, you tend to pray or read/recite the Bible/Talmud/Koran instead of taking an objective look at the problem and building a constructive response to it? 
Have you changed your value system when you felt it your religious duty to do so? Have you put religion before your feelings and/or your children's feelings? 
Are you unable to doubt or question religious information and/or authority? 
Do you see things as black or white, good or bad? 
Do you think that God/Allah will fix you/do it all without serious work on your part? 
Do you have a rigid adherence to rules, codes, ethics or guidelines? Do you often use the words ""should"" or ""must""? 
Do you readily pass judgment? Are you ready to find fault or evil? 
Do you believe that sex is dirty and/or that physical pleasures are evil? 
Do you compulsively overeat or excessively fast? 
Do you put religion before science, medicine and/or education? 
Have you alienated any family member, friend or colleague with your religious stance? 
Have you cut back on social, family, work or other activities for your religion? 
Do you suffer from back pains, sleeplessness, headaches, hypertension? 
Do you manipulate scriptures or texts to justify your actions, feel specially chosen, or claim to receive messages from God/Allah? 
Do you get into ""high"" trance-like states? 
If you answer ""yes"" to only a few of these, you need to look at how you are using religion to suppress your feelings and to avoid dealing with reality. 
http://www.arfanswers.org/answers2.html
The few research studies aforementioned seem to suggest that religious people develop a dependency on religious practices for social approval. Since religious people seem to be describable in terms of relatively high levels of dependence, it seems useful to borrow a concept suggested by Peele and Brodsky (1975)- that of ""addiction."" According to these writers addiction is ""a person's attachment to a sensation, an object, or another person... such as to lessen his appreciation of and ability to deal with other things in his environment, or in himself, so that he has become increasingly dependent on that experience as his only source of gratification"" (p. 168).
There are a variety of definitions for the concept of religious addiction. Arterburn and Felton (1992) state that ""when a person is excessively devoted to something or surrenders compulsively and habitually to something, that pathological and physiological dependency on a substance, relationship, or behavior results in addiction"" (p. 104). They indicate that, ""like any other addiction, the practice of religion becomes central to every other aspect of life...all relationships evolve from the religion, and the dependency on the religious practice and its members removes the need for a dependency on God...the religion and those who practice it then become the central power for the addict who no longer is in touch with God"" (p. 117).
http://www.a1articles.com/article_9105_51.html
Despite the growing research concerning religiouscults, research specifically concerning religiousaddiction among members of traditional ChristianChurches is lacking. Clark (1983) reports that, ""weare reticent, as a culture, to criticize anythingcalled religion"" (p. 279). The aim of this literaturereview was to: 1) help mental health professionalsimprove diagnostic assessments when religious addictionand other psychoreligious problems are involved; 2)reduce iatrogenic harm from the misdiagnosis ofreligious addiction and psychoreligious problems; 3)improve the treatment of such problems by stimulatingclinical research; and 4) encourage clinical trainingcenters to address the religious and spiritualdimensions of human existence

They found people suffering from this disease on further investigation also physiological reacted to religious words the same way as most people react to sexual ones (with regards to pupils, heart rate etc). It was assumed that this part of the brain deals with abstract things and predicition - i.e religion could have evolved out of the part of the brain used for imagining tigers could be hiding somewhere being exposed to unusual things (radiation or hallucinogens and suchlike).
Knowing which section of the brain is then triggered when they have their fits, a team of engineers built a 'God-helmet' which stimulated the part of the brain with EM radiation (think it was radio waves). Whilst it didn't trigger religious visions (they didn't try it with sufferers of temporal lobe epilepsy) in normal people it gave them the impression of a invisable presense in the room with them, something that even Richard Dawkins could feel when he tried it on.
Got crazier later on when they used the technology to 'exorcise' a demon from a girl who kept having horrific nightmares of being raped by the devil - it turned out in the end her radio clock was emitting the same frequences as the helmet did.

If I recall correctly, you once mentioned that you took a course in 'Christian psychology' wherein you witnessed an exorcism. Was that part of your science education? Is this where you also learned about demons, demonic possession, and Satanic influences?

Now, how much analysis is over-analysis? Presumably the long and tortuous 'analyses' by which evangelical writers try to resolve biblical contradictions are just hunky-dory; whereas trebor's very basic observation that plants could not exist before there was sunlight, or the observation that the creation accounts in Genesis 1 and 2 are in direct contradiction, counts as 'over-analysis'.
