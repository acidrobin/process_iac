0,To Voice of Reason,abortion,support,"I've noticed your latest signature is: "" Abortion is the most barbarbaric act one human being can perpetrate on another.""
Are you serious or is this just a slight exaggeration? Are you really saying that you think an abortion is more barbarbaric (since it's your signature you could at least spell it right, barbaric) than what Hitler did in the Holocaust?",0,1,topic_stance_votes_2
1,To Voice of Reason,abortion,attack,"I don't mean to speak for Mr. Reason and I certainly do not want to minimize the holocaust, but in sheer numbers.... as a matter of fact, yes.
As barbaric as starving and gassing innocent people is, sucking the life out of them through a tube is certainly no walk in the park.",1,2,topic_stance_votes_1
2,To Voice of Reason,abortion,support,"Thanks Truthsayer............As bad as the holocaust was and I am not one to ever trivulize it 40,000,000 abortions since 1972 is worse to me.........",2,3,topic_stance_votes_1
3,To Voice of Reason,abortion,attack,"Thank you for pointing out my spelling.......Like Will Rogers I am just and old country boy and spelling was never one of my better skills.......
I am glad you know about the Holocaust though......There are a lot of people in your age group who believe it never happened........",1,4,topic_stance_votes_1
4,To Voice of Reason,abortion,attack,"I dont know and wouldnt say that people believe it never happened, but more that they just dont know about it, or just dont care.",4,5,topic_stance_votes_2
5,To Voice of Reason,abortion,support,"The statement that abortion is the most barbaric act someone can do to another is a question of how bad the act is, not how common. Burning someone at the stake is worse than shooting them, though the latter has happened more often.
Abortion is not as barbaric as torture.",5,6,topic_stance_votes_2
6,To Voice of Reason,abortion,support,"So let me ask this, if you believe that life begins at conception, which I imagine you do, then would you think that killing 11,000,000 fertilized eggs is worse than killing 11,000,000 jews?",5,7,topic_stance_votes_2
7,To Voice of Reason,abortion,support,"If full human life with total equality begins at conception, and you don't include the knock-on effects on other people, just considering killing as a simple evil in itself, killing the fertilized eggs is worse. But the individual act of killing a Jew is not as bad as the act of torturing someone to death.",7,8,topic_stance_votes_2
8,To Voice of Reason,abortion,attack,"So once again we have a viewpoint that misses the fact that the vast majority of those exterminated by the Nazi's died under extremely unpleasant conscious circumstances? there was no mercy lost on these people, and many had been subjected to early traumas and tortures as well.
How can you even compare being gassed (large chamber or small?), shot, beaten to death maybe even being killed in an experiement to test the limits of human resistance to high atmospheric pressure with aborting a foetus?
Or perhaps you would care to demonstrate how a foetus that is aborted experiences any terror and pain like someone who was gassed at Auschwitz?
THe crux of this is can you prove that an abortion is more barbaric than torture and death of a conscious person.",2,9,topic_stance_votes_2
9,To Voice of Reason,abortion,support,"OK, assuming that full human life with total equality begins at conception:
1. What is the difference between killing the fetus and killing the jew? Doesn't equality mean there is no difference?
2. Did you mean the individual act of killing a fetus is not as bad as torturing a jew to death, or did you really mean it as it was written? If you meant it like you wrote it, I will need a little clarification on this.",8,10,topic_stance_votes_2
10,To Voice of Reason,abortion,support,"1) There is no fundamental difference, but certain religious groups that hold this still prefer the mother's life over the child's as she has responsibilities and a place in society. So the secondary considerations may be different
2) The act of torturing anyone to death is worse than the act of killing anyone in a more humane fashion",10,11,topic_stance_votes_2
11,To Voice of Reason,abortion,attack,There is no difference life is life no matter what stage of development no matter what creed no matter what colour whether it be homecide infantcide or indeed fetuscide there is no excuse to take someone elses life.,7,12,topic_stance_votes_1

13,To Voice of Reason,abortion,attack,"Self defense, or in the defense of another? Or for food (presumably you do eat plants, even if not meat yet those are still life) or as part of the immune system (still self defense I suppose). 
It all depends on how you class 'life that matters', and what reasons you use to support it. To be for 'all life whatever it is', is a completely untenable position as just by existing you kill things, its just we don't think these forms of life matter",12,14,topic_stance_votes_2
14,To Voice of Reason,abortion,attack,Sorry should have made my post a bit clearer i am on about human life.,14,15,topic_stance_votes_1

16,To Voice of Reason,abortion,attack,"That's just your opinion however.
To me, the early stages of a fetus aren't really ""human"".

17,To Voice of Reason,abortion,attack,"Which ever way you look at it it is human it doesn't suddenly become human.
It was after all human sperm that fertilised a human egg.",17,18,topic_stance_votes_1

Anything that cannot survive* outside of the womb is imo not ""human"".

An acorn is an acorn. It is not a small oak. It grows into an oak, just like I believe a foetus grows into a human.

19,To Voice of Reason,abortion,attack,"And that is just your opinion........Have you ever asked yourself, What if I am wrong? Probably not.........
So I guess you are against abortion in the 3rd trimester then becasue babies at that can and have survived outside the womb........",17,20,topic_stance_votes_1
20,To Voice of Reason,abortion,attack,"Hence the fact I stated it as my opinion. She did not. emoticonXRolleyes 
Unless the mother's life is endangered, I'd most likely be against them.
-Wez",20,21,topic_stance_votes_2
21,To Voice of Reason,abortion,attack,"Who did not?
So if the mothers life is not endangered in the 3rd trimester and the baby is viable outside the womb you would be against and abortion? emoticonXConfused",21,22,topic_stance_votes_1
22,To Voice of Reason,abortion,attack,I'm not sure on this but I thought that in the third trimester abortions were illegal unless the mother's life was in danger.,22,23,topic_stance_votes_2
23,To Voice of Reason,abortion,attack,"So what gives humans this exclusive right to life? Why is a fetus's ""life"" equal to a grown man's life, yet they are both better than a deer or any other animal? What is your reasoning behind this? Is it just religious or do you actually have a logical explanation of why this is true (I have no problem if it is religious, just a question).",15,24,topic_stance_votes_2
24,To Voice of Reason,abortion,attack,"OK basically my thought is this:
The holocaust was killing random people (well not random but if we think all races are equal along with gays, gypsies, disabled, other groups), it didn't matter what job they had, how their life was, if they had a family who cared for them, or anything. They were just murdered. Abortion is exclusively done on a child where the parents don't want to raise him/her for whatever reason. I'm pretty sure it has to be before the 3rd trimester to be legal so they are not concious, can't feel anything, most of the time will endanger the health of the mother, and always is unwanted by the parent(s). Most likely the unborn baby will not have very good parenting (most of the time people love their children and will only have an abortion if they cannot care for the child). The parents may not be able to afford to care for the baby or have time. While you can argue that it's bad (I agree) but I still don't think you can compare that to the torture (and forced labor) of adults and children fully capable of taking care of themselves and they are not a danger to anyone's health.",15,25,topic_stance_votes_2
25,To Voice of Reason,abortion,attack,"No problem, just pointing it out.
This is very surprising, everyone should know that it happened, why it happened, and how it happened. Just remember ""those who don't remember the past are condemned to repeat it"". Rwuanda anyone?",4,26,topic_stance_votes_2
26,To Voice of Reason,abortion,support,"That did not answer my question. I did not ask about certain religious groups. You stated:
If we are talking about full human life with total equality, how can you say killing the fertilized egg is worse than killing the jew?",11,27,topic_stance_votes_2
27,To Voice of Reason,abortion,attack,"The question was for Wez.......The congress passed a law against PBA but the left have submitted a lawsuit and it is under appeal...............
At this momemt you can abort at anytime during a pregnancy.......",23,28,topic_stance_votes_1
28,To Voice of Reason,abortion,attack,I will take that..........Most people that are pro life believe life begins at conception therefore killing a fetus is killing a human being....,24,29,topic_stance_votes_1
29,To Voice of Reason,abortion,attack,"Well, thats not entirely accurate. I mean, if you take a hair from your head, it is a human hair. A fingernail clipping contains human cells. Human sperm cells are human as are human ovaries. A newly inseminated ovary is indeed, wholly human. I mean, it sure as hell isn't a chicken or cow fetus, is it?
I think what you mean is that it isn't a person.",19,30,topic_stance_votes_1
30,To Voice of Reason,abortion,attack,"I realise these questions were not asked towards me. But I have a big mouth. :) 
As far as the human portion of your question, I would suggest it is about a fair chance at life and even more so about ""potential"". Grinding up a fetus inside a mother is rather disgusting, no?
And just where are these abortions occuring most often? Third world nations who cannot support their current populations where it might make some sort of sense? No, they are happening most frequently in nations that damn well have the capacity to care for unwanted children. And, don't get me wrong, I do not lay all the blame of unwanted pregnancy at the feet of the woman. I want the fathers prosecuted if they are unable to pay for the costs of placing their children or taking care of their children. I want every damn paycheck they recieve deducted to pay for their children. 
I don't really know what to say for deer or other animals. I do know that in the upper midwest U.S.A. the whitetail deer population is out of control. I had a young doe in my mid-city backyard two days ago at 5 am. My Lab chased her off. Abortion, as perfomed on human beings, is not a worthwhile option. Venison is good eatin' however. emoticonXKill",24,31,topic_stance_votes_1
31,To Voice of Reason,abortion,support,"Sorry, I meant as bad, not worse. My point is that killing in itself would obviously be equal, but some would say that one killing was worse becasue of its knock-on effects.",27,32,topic_stance_votes_2

Barring serious physical deformities/ mental damage, or in some exceptional circumstances, then yes I would be against such an abortion.
Yes, that's what I meant.:)
-Wez",22,33,topic_stance_votes_2
33,To Voice of Reason,abortion,attack,Well at lest I thank you for that..........As far as I am concerned it would have to depend on how serious the deformity or other damage is.........There have been great gains in medical science in a lot of those areas and i think the baby at least deserves a chance to live...........,33,34,topic_stance_votes_1
34,To Voice of Reason,abortion,attack,"no problem, I just asked the question in general.
OK, I'm not sure but I always thought that abortions were done relatively early, I mean if you don't want a kid you should probably know that when you get pregnant. I'm not sure how I feel about the potential part. On the one hand it does seem horrible to terminate a possible life, but on the other hand isn't every sperm and egg a potential human life? Should we force people to have sex so that every possible potential life is born?
But what if neither the mother nor the father can afford the baby? What if they have the baby in high school? The question is either have an abortion, finish school, wait a few years and have another baby they can care for, or quit school, work 2 shifts at minimum wage just to meet ends meet and have no money for the baby to do much other than eat and have a roof over their head.
I understand that some populations are out of control, but if the human population were out of control, do you think anyone would advocate for the hunting of humans?
Actually my main question was actually just about careless swats at flies or bees. Why isn't swatting a fly considered murder? It's a life after all, right? what makes it worth any less than a human life?",31,35,topic_stance_votes_2

38,To Voice of Reason,abortion,attack,"I'm not sure what the trimesters mean, but I'd be against abortions if the foetus could survive out of the womb without major mental/physical damage to the foetus, unless of course the woman's life was in danger.

39,To Voice of Reason,abortion,attack,"Ok I thought you were talking about the third trimester...anyway, well what makes the unborn more important when it can survive outside the womb?",39,40,topic_stance_votes_1
40,To Voice of Reason,abortion,attack,"I don't see it as a person before it can live 'normally' outside of the womb.
For example an acorn is not a smal oak, it's an acorn.
A foetus, imo, is not a small person, it's a foetus.
-Wez",40,41,topic_stance_votes_2
41,To Voice of Reason,abortion,attack,"While I am not real certain about how plant seeds work I do believe this ""acorn"" is still classified under the same thing as an oak tree would be. Once again, just didn't stages of development. Nevertheless, I am not sure a nut or a tree seed would really work here.
A fetus can live outside the womb though. A fetus is after the 8th week and I do believe one can survive sometime around 20 weeks?? Either way, it is a bad marker because 100yrs ago it wouldn't be able to survive outside the womb at 20weeks but now it can...does this mean the when someone is a person has changed? I an not all certain I can go with that. Besides who makes you the determiner of when a person is in fact a person?",41,42,topic_stance_votes_1
42,To Voice of Reason,abortion,attack,"Clearly an acorn is completely different form an oak. It may share the genetic material, but that's about it. It bears no resemblance to an oak.
Nope. Personally, if it can't live outside the womb, I don't think it's got any rights and as such couldn't care less whether it was aborted.

44,To Voice of Reason,abortion,attack,"Physically they may be similar, but I believe there’s more to a person than physical appearance.
I don't believe I can make a choice for someone else. People view foetuses with different values. I don't think there is an answer to the abortion debate: there is no right and wrong, there is only personal opinion. The law should, imo, try to accommodate for the wishes of the people.
