0,Proof of God,existence of God,support,"Faith can be linked with reason. You can either say we are here for a reason or no reason... (by chance).
I have read several tracts on the proof of God, including ""You Have Ten Minutes to Prove The Existence of God to My Husband"". (http://www.freerepublic.com/forum/a3aa7bd326640.htm)
Does any one else here (believers, I mean) know of other arguments?",0,1,topic_stance_votes_2
1,Proof of God,existence of God,support,"No proof of god is possible, since you must have faith to even accept this ""proof"". This first thing he does in that arguement is try to throw out science. I stopped reading there, as without science as we know it, there is no proof to the non believer.
There will never be prood of god, as I understand it, god would never allow it to be proven because faith is the cornerstone of religion.",1,2,topic_stance_votes_2
2,Proof of God,existence of God,support,"Do you believe in God?
I do, and I don't agree with what you believe about God and proof.
Jesus Himself was living proof. He said ""I am"" and He showed us with miracles. If God had wanted total faith alone, then Jesus need not have appeared.
On another matter...
You seem to mistake faith for something that is devoid of reason.
Here's an analogy.
My mum, I've obviously known all of my life. She tells me that a new work colleague of hers is a thief.
I don't doubt her, not based on the fact I've actually witnessed this person, or that I've even met him/her, but because I know my mum, and I trust her. I have faith in what she says, but it is not without reason.",2,3,topic_stance_votes_2
3,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,"Faith is the cornerstone of religion, yes. But who says God cares about religion? Religion is a completely human invention, and as such is a poor indicator for God's will. If God felt like showing up, and thus proving his existance, I don't think he'd let the fact that it would screw up most of the world's religions stop him.",2,4,topic_stance_votes_1

6,Proof of God,existence of God,support,"I believe in Jesus, but that's just it. To accept the existence of Jesus as proof for the existence of God requires one to have faith that Jesus existed and for the reason he existed. Even if one believed that Jesus existed in a historical sense, that does not prove the existence of God, because one would first have to believe that Jesus is the son of God, which requires a belief in God in the first place. The argument is circular.
Besides, faith isn't about having ""proof.""
Here are some lyrics that I think convey pretty well what I think:
""I don't need no one to tell me about heaven
I look at my daughter and I believe
I don't need no proof when it comes to God and truth
I can see the sun set and I perceive""",6,7,topic_stance_votes_2
7,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,"The problem with that argument is that the author accuses science of claiming that everything is random. That is not so, for science claims that the atoms operate according to the laws of physics, not random chance. And also, the author only recognizes the ""gradualist"" version of evolutionism - there is actually another version called ""punctuated equilibrium"" that means that the separation of species was occasionally caused by drastic mutations.
Like GreenMtnBoy, I hardly read anything after the author tried to throw out science.",7,8,topic_stance_votes_1
8,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,"Montalban, you didn't use faith for that decision, you reasoned it.
1. You have no reason to suspect your mother would lie (as far as we know) about the event.
- you have never observed her lie
- you have never observed anyone else claiming she lied
(assumptions, you can clarify and we can still make this point)
2. Your mother would have no motive for lying..it does her no good, nor anyone she is close to, any good.
3. You are certain your mother is capable of telling the differene between stealing, and not stealing, you can say she is an expert at teling the difference (we are all experts at most ordinary things..like, telling time, etc.)
4. You know that some percentage of humans steal things, it is not all that uncommon, it's entirely possible, if not probably, that at some point your mother (and each of us), will witness someone steatling something.
THEREFORE, you conclude, through reason and evidence, that this person ""probably"" is a thief.
You didn't use faith, you used reason, and evidence. So why are you claiming faith is useful in this situation, or that faith somehow ""used reason"". I submit you do this either because you don't understand what it is you're claiming, or because you want to associate the good things we all know and appreciate with regards to rational thought, evidence, and reason, with your faith. Or, you can explain it to me first-hand.
Faith: 1) : firm belief in something for which there is no proof (2) 
http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionar...onary&va=faith
Why would you use proof to support your faith in the first place? You either accept it, or you don't. But let's examine this!
If 1303003 people attested that this person was in fact NOT a thief, and they have 20 independant video recordings from all angles that verify his every move the day your mother made the claim...then what? Where does your ""faith"" leave you? Do you ignore the evidence and rely on faith?

9,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,"You don't get it. I used reasoned faith. Not blind faith.
I can never be 100% certain; hence ultimately, it is a matter of faith. But I had a reason for that faith.
I don't follow your arguments sometimes as you seem to have novel ideas such as exobiology is 'science fiction'. Further, you've already admitted where you'll allow non-scientific rationale to dictate which scientific pursuits you're willing to accept; such as Nazi science, rejected on basis of what you describe non-rationale argument; viz feelings.",9,10,topic_stance_votes_2
10,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,"Oh I understand what you said, perhaps better than you do, unless you're being intentionally deceitful.
You're wrong Montalban, you used reason, and I clearly showed how. You imply reason requires 100% certainty, it does not, so your argument is lost. I realize you WANT to make faith somehow useful and ""like science"", but alas.
You you can even test this, I'm surprised you made a mistake in responding the way you did. I even tested this already for you, but I'll do it again since you obviously missed it or didn't understand it.
==============================
Montalban: I used ""faith"" to make my decision to believe what my mother says.
==============================
So, if your mother says ""Montalban, I saw godzilla last night for real (the 60ft fire breating monster that stomps japan for fun)""
You must believe her if you used faith.
You could however, use reason, to determine that it's most likely that she did not see godzilla, and is either making a joke, or suffered some mental mishap.
So which is it gonna be:
Faith: ""Belief without evidence"", or ""Belief in a divine being""
OR
Reason: (as shown above).
Faith by definiton, is a belief without evidence, or a belief in a divine being (which can have no evidence).
What exactly did you have faith in dear Montalban? You're mother is always correct? Obviously not, since I assume you think she didn't actually see Godzilla. So you didn't have faith after all.
==============================
Now, if you say again you used both reason AND faith, and that this somehow saves you from making a mistake, well, it doesn't. Let's use your logic:
- We are testing if these two [drugs] had an impact on the [health of the patient].
We used two [drugs]
1. A placebo (not actually a drug per se)
2. A new chemical that we think can cure this infection.
We tested the [patients] with both [drugs] at the same time. Our results showed strong evidence that the patient's infections were cured 85% by this combination of drugs.
We conclude that a placebo, combined with this new chemical, cures infections, using Montalban's inadequate logic.
You see, I could replace any mumbo jumbo made up stuff and replace the placebo with it. Then by your logic, we could prove anything has an effect on anything else IN COMBINATION with something that actually works (you know, logical AND) 
Nice try. I also like at the end how you try to change the subject too, talking about Nazi's and what not.... real class act there. Can we please stick to the topic at hand, your argument in this thread, for once????
--------------------------------------
Oh, lastly, since you like to try and label other arguments as circular reasoning, I want to show you what circular reasoning is, it's an even better example of why your argument is fallacy
--------------------------------------
If you use both faith AND reason to support your belief, you are using circular reasoning.
1. You have faith in someone's honesty (Requires no evidence, belief without evidence)
2. You see ""some evidence"" of their honesty.
You are using both you claim, so by using #1, you argue for believing they are telling the truth based on the evidence of your belief that they they always tell the truth (and need no evidence).
That's what circular reasoning is, care to come up with a new line of argument? You also have the option of dropping the ""and faith"", and just leave ""I used reason"" if you want to adopt my corrections to your logic. 
-Mach",10,11,topic_stance_votes_1
11,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,"mach, apparently you give the impression that faith cannot be combined with reason
say i look at the tv guide, or any billboard or ad all over, and see that the
superbowl finals is next sunday on channel 5 at 2 pm. i start making plans, buying snacks, inviting friends, and setting up my superbowl party. is that faith or reason?
note that superbowl happens every year, and every year i watch the game with friends. also, this year's superbowl has not occured yet, but from the networks and tv guides and every othe source i know its scheduled to air on sunday
also, remember faith is ""belief without evidence""",11,12,topic_stance_votes_2
12,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,"If we go with your defintion that faith is belief without evidence, then you clearly are acting on reason, because you have lots of evidence here. The tv guide, the billboards, and the fact that the superbowl happens every year are all evidence that it will happen when you expect.",12,13,topic_stance_votes_1
13,Proof of God,existence of God,support,"Exactly.
And as I point out, if you include ""faith"" in your reasoning for believing in something, it's circular, no matter what you combine it with. That's why you're a reasoner unkerpaulie, not a preacher, about the superbowl.
I think as in many cases, the word ""faith"" is being used for two purposes, but that's certainly not the kind of faith Montalban notes.
Faith: defined as ""trust"", is a reasoned trust, a probablity. It's not making a claim. I have faith my friend will make this next field goal. ""friend doesn't"". 
Shoot. But I won't declare that he made the field goal anyway..so it is just a descriptive word for where I think the outcome will be, based on my own decision tree.
Faith: belief in the divine, belief without evidence, certainty despite evidence, etc. is what we're discussing here however.
-Mach",13,14,topic_stance_votes_1
14,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,"yes, but the superbowl hasnt happened. you have no EVIDENCE that the superbowl will air on sunday, but you have REASONS to believe it will. I hope the difference is clear
if you can accept the word of the tv guide and the track record of superbowls airing on channel 5 on a sunday every year as EVIDENCE, then you have exactly as much foundation as someone that believes in God through reading the bible and a track record of God's intervention in their personal life
the fact is, by definition and every other means, accepting that the superbowl will air on channel 5 on sunday is a matter of FAITH. there is no evidence that the superbowl will happen as stated.",13,15,topic_stance_votes_2
15,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,"Yes and no IMHO.
There is plenty of evidence. There's the tradition of past Super Bowls, the TV guide, the league schedule, there's playoff games happening, there's a network preparing, there's a half time show being prepared, there's a stadium that's booked and being prepared. That's sufficient evidence IMHO to form a reasonable belief that the Super Bowl (an Eagle's victory :p) is going to happen.
Depending on your definition of ""faith"", I guess it takes faith to believe that the game will actually be played, there's a lot of factors. However, that version of ""faith"" does not require unwavering belief in the abscence of evidence, or what's more, in the face of contradictory evidence.
Waxy",15,16,topic_stance_votes_1
16,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,"I understand the difference, but it's really largely semantic. Yes, there is no direct evidence for an event which hasn't occurred yet. There is, however, what I would call indirect evidence, and which you call reasons. If we have direct evidence that something happens reliably under a given set of circumstances, and those circumstances are about to occur, than we have a reason, based on our previous direct evidence, to believe it will happen again. 
Not quite. We're not excepting tv guide's word blindly. Several million people can corroborate that it's been correct in the past. There's no one around who can do the same for the Bible.
Again, there's an important semantic point to be made here. Religion is based on blind faith, with no real evidence to support it. Your belief that the tv guide knows when the super bowl will be is based on your direct experience that its always gotten it right before. There's a logic reason for your belief.",15,17,topic_stance_votes_1
17,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,"this ""indirect evidence"" is somewhat subjective, but it is important in making decisions based on reliability and track record. however, there is no real guarantee that the superbowl will occur, or that channel 5 will air it. but we still accept it as true. it is also possible that there are people that dont believe what they read in the tv guide, perhaps because of errors they noticed in the past. of course for the most part we can look at the tv guide as an authoratative source of schedule information, and we've seen every tv guide ""prediction"" come to pass. this is all reasonable, but it is definitely an act of faith
the term ""blindly"" is also subjective. most people that subscribe to tv guide never question what it says, they just plan their time around it without needing a second opinion or corroboration from any other source. whether you want to call it ""blindly"" is up to you
in the same way, the perception of millions of christians is that God does what his word says he will do. they've percieve this within their own lives and have heard the testimony of others that it is true. to them, this is evidence to support their belief. based on the apparent agreement from different sources, it can be percieved that the bible has been correct in the past, and in different circumstances in the present. as far as the definition goes, this is just as valid as evidence as the tv guide schedule and the history of superbowl airings in the past",17,18,topic_stance_votes_2
18,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,"You're overloading the word ""faith"" here. Yes, a bomb could go off and the super bowl might not happen. The odds of this are really slim though. Smart money says the super bowl will happen when the tv guides says, because the super bowl always has happened when the tv guide said. Our direct experience gives us a degree of confidence in this prediction. Call it ""faith"" if you must, but it isn't the same sort of ""faith"" that allows people to believe in an omnipotent being which is completely outside their experience, and for which there is no direct evidence what-so-ever. That's the distinction I'm trying to make here. 
Ah, but they do have corroboration from another source: the tv. The tv guide says something, and the tv backs it up. If I just mailed you a random tv schedule you wouldn't believe it automatically, you'd check to see if it's accurate. You've used the tv guide for years, so you've already determined it's accurate.
This is a bit fuzzy, don't you think? All I've heard from Christians is that they believe that God has influenced them. That's not evidence that it's true. And it's certainly not evidence that the Bible is true. As for parts of the Bible having been demonstrated to be true; it has also been demonstrated that parts are false.",18,19,topic_stance_votes_1
19,Proof of God,existence of God,support,"We don't believe that there is a 100% chance that the superbowl will occur, we believe that there is a high, but not completely certain, chance that it will. This is inductive reasoning.
It is, however, faith to believe that there is a 100% chance the superbowl will occur, but such belief is fallacious. The rationalist recognizes that there is still the possibility that it won't occur, due to some crazy fluke or something.
See the distinction?",19,20,topic_stance_votes_1
20,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,"There's talk across the river here...
There is faith that concerns the things of man and God, then there's the earthly variety. Unless we specify the type of faith we're talking about this debate can be fruitless.
Hebrews 11: 1 – Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.
So faith to a Christian cannot be separated from God.
To me faith in anything else (or anyone for that matter) is a crapshoot. Is that bad? No, since we have no idea if we'll greet the morning, but it's the truth nonetheless.
I have faith in my friends, my wife, my job, etc., but none of those are guaranteed.
Have the faith of God Mark 11 : 22
By whom also we have access by faith unto this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. Romans 5 : 2
Have thou faith? Have it to yourself before God. Joyful is he that condemns not himself in that thing which he allows. Romans 14 : 22",20,21,topic_stance_votes_2
21,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,"I think most have filled in the question, but one that hasn't been specifically answered is having evidence before something happens.
Evidence doesn't pertain only to present or past tense, even if the superbowl ""hasn't happened"", there can most certainly be evidence that it WILL happen. (You can drop a ball and predict it will hit the ground, even though it hasn't hit the ground yet, in simplest example).
However, as Dzeron says, that still doesn't imply that most people use evidence to claim 100% certainty..it's probablilty with most of us, crucial to reasoning.
-Mach",15,22,topic_stance_votes_1
22,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,"i'm glad you brought that up. it doesnt require faith to believe a mixture of acid and alkaline will produce a salt, or that a ball will accelerate downward if you drop it. action-consequence relations will remain true regardless. these are PROVEN
it hasnt been PROVEN that everything the tv guide says comes to pass, the possibility that it wont always exists. whenever there is a possibility that something different than expected can happen, no matter how improbable, we take on FAITH that it will be so.
there is something called a ""measure of faith"". it takes very little faith to rely on the tv guide. for some it requires a bit more to rely on their cousin paying back the money they lent him. if you cannot predict the outcome of something with 100% certainty, then the unpredictable fraction is the measure of faith required
faith is believing without evidence. you may BELIEVE that the superbowl will 100% certainly air on sunday on channel 5, but you have no EVIDENCE that the superbowl will 100% certainly air on sunday on channel 5. thats what faith is",22,23,topic_stance_votes_2
23,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,"this i agree with. but while it sounds rational to provide for the slim chance that the superbowl wouldnt occur, we can reasonably ignore that possibility, and still plan our party, buy drinks and invite friends over. of course if for whatever reason the superbowl is cancelled/not showing, you figure the risk is not that great, and the chance of the superbowl airing as scheduled is in your favor. its a risk you can take, but faith is still involved
with any event where a risk of the unexpected is involved, there is a measure of faith as well. for the 100% certain, no faith is needed. for the very uncertain, you need a lot more faith. there is no evidence that the unpredictable will certainly occur, yet everyday we believe that they will.",20,24,topic_stance_votes_2
24,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,Can you explain how this sort of faith is related to faith in God's existance?,23,25,topic_stance_votes_1
25,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,"its not, except that its simply faith
i really took this off-track path because Mach was equating ""faith"" to ""belief in God"", when really even atheists exercise faith
the way it ties in is this thing called EVIDENCE. evidence simply means anything that causes or convinces you to believe something. what is RATIONAL evidence will vary depending on who you ask. for some, looking at the beauty of a flower-filled field on a spring morning is their evidence. for others its a near-death escape. on the flip-side, for some, looking at the wanton destruction of mankind and the malice around us is their evidence. what constitutes evidence is anybody's guess. of course you can discuss how rational that evidence is and hope for the best.
believing in God dispite the lack of rational evidence is the faith Mach was referring to. when you explain to a theist why their reasoning is irrational, thats when faith kicks in. theists cant see, hear or interact with God on a physical level, but they believe he exists in this physical world, and that he is able to manifest his power in the physical realm. they experience events, call it God's manifested power, and gather more evidence of God's existence. the fact is that the events they experience may very well have nothing at all to do with the manifsetation of God's power; theyre simply just everyday events. but by faith, they take is as God's interaction in their life",25,26,topic_stance_votes_2
26,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,"Actually, science accepts many things as highly improbable, quantum mechanics is one field that utilizes the concept.
You are incorrect with the ball drop. A ball WILL NOT accelerate downward if you drop it and hit at the time you calculate IF:
Your friend catches it instead
A gust of wind blows it away (think florida hurricane wind)
the earth explodes
the sun explodes
the sun gets bigger and vaporizes the ball
An alien that has been watching you, unseen, decides to appear and catch the ball.
These things are highly improbable (assuming your friend isn't nearby!), yet also entirely possible. So they are not fact, it's a reasoned guess, a highly PROBABLE guess the ball will hit the ground, but a guess nonetheless.
In the same way, usually it's right, based on past evidence and the knowledge that TV guide is trying to be accurate, it's a good guess what's written WILL happen. Yes, a gust of 140mph wind is LESS likely, both both are possible.
Same with the ball drop.
You say ""measure of faith"", meaning the more evidence in favor, the smaller the measuer of faith. With less evidence, the faith becomes greater.
Evidence is clearly part of this ""measure of faith"" equation, which is the ""other"" definition of faith. It's:
Faith
-----
evidence = measuere of faith, inverse relationship.
The definition of faith, that at leat I am referring to, is:
Belief without evidence.
Which removes it from your classifcation since the evidence is by definition, 0.
-Mach",23,27,topic_stance_votes_1
27,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,"Tsk, tsk... There are typically exceptions. And this is no exception. Just because you drop a ball does not mean it will accelerate downward. There are many ways in which other forces could be acting on the ball. And gravity, apparently, isn't as straight-forward as it first seems. How about the mixture of acid and alkaline in an environment of various gases other than the usual...
To be a little more precise, we could accurately say this: assuming constant factors in a controlled environment without unusual circumstances or changes, we can assume that a ball dropped will accelerate downward or that mixing acid and alkaline will produce a salt (because our experience tells us to expect this). However, if any of the parameters change, this may not happen.
We can say something similar with the Superbowl example... Assuming constant factors without unusual circumstances, etc., we can assume the Superbowl will happen as planned.
There remains the possibility in both cases for exceptions to the rule.
The perspective from which you are debating this topic depends largely on semantics. You can continue to debate from that position, but in order to do so, I believe it would be helpful to agree upon the definitions of the words you are using. Otherwise, it could go back and forth forever. It is evident that you are not using the same definitions as Kronus, Mach, and Dzeron.",23,28,topic_stance_votes_1
28,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,"what science ""accepts"" without 100% certainty requires faith. in science, nothing should be ""accepted"" just because it best fits, unless it is a theory and treated as such
a ball wil ALWAYS accelerate downward when dropped. the friend catching/wind blowing/sun exploding scenarios will not cause the ball to NOT accerlate downward when it is dropped. the question is not about hitting the ground. the law of gravity doesnt require an object to hit the ground
your faith/evidence relation is right on the money. faith sort of ""fills the gap"" where evidence is lacking. so the more evidence, the less faith needed and vice versa. where something is known to be, or goes against all evidence, then you need total faith to believe it will be. where the outcome is known for certainty to be, no faith at all is required",27,29,topic_stance_votes_2

Is it really always.
I agree on the law of gravity, as it relates to the mathematical equation, I don't agree that if you drop a ball it will ALWAYS ACCELERATE downward.

bootfitter, i'll take your scenario, even though the ball would accelerate downward due to the force gravity, the force of the magnet would be stronger, and the net acceleration would be upward. the acceleration towards the floor would still exist, but you wouldnt know it does unless you compare it the magnetic force on the ball in a weightless environment
waxy, i could get technical and legal about it, but the word ALWAYS will still apply. try these on for size:
an object free of any other force than gravity will ALWAYS accelerate toward the center of the gravitational body
objects statically charged with the same charge will ALWAYS repel
a floating object will ALWAYS displace the volume of fluid equal to its own weight
thermal energy will ALWAYS transfer from a body of higher temperature to a body of lower temperature that is in contact with it

Yes, I agree, I think at some point basic laws of physics describe the fabric (for lack of a better term) of the universe, and are actually part of it. If the universe exists, then these ""givens"" are by it's existence, true, as in your gravity/acceleration and thermodynamics case. The only uncertainty seems to be our ability to describe it, which oddly enough sounds like the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. I am glad however he didn't use the word ""Faith"" in describing our prediction as to where an electron will be at any given instant! :)

33,Proof of God,existence of God,support,"ok, getting back to the original off-track discussion...
faith and certainty sort of supplement each other. some things are 100% certain, some are totally faith-based, most are a combination. also, faith is not restricted to theists or religious people
and getting back on the real track...
people that believe in God have what they deem as evidence to support their belief. even though they find later that these pieces of evidence dont rationally support what they believe, they still hold on to that belief and search for something else as evidence. the thing is, faith by itself is the most unstable situation. if you want to believe something, you must find evidence that can bring up the certainty scale and your faith is under less strain. the goal is to support the belief. if you lack the certainty, then the faith has to do all the work.

Faith by definition is a belief without evidence. Note 'reason' modifies faith. You are giving a definition of 'faith' as it sits alone. I talk about reasoned faith, and you argue about faith. Thus you constantly argue not against what I say, but what you believe I said.
I have reason to believe you are being condescending, but what exactly are you asking? A recitation on Orthodoxy?
Ah, so you don't see the difference between faith, and reasoned faith after-all.
Where do I say that one can not reason and still be mistaken? Have you heard of Neptunism? It was a scientific rationale and it is wrong.
You mean; let's use a straw-man. But anyway...
Where do you come up with these straw-man arguments?
I see!
Again, I apologise for using your words against you; I should have just made it up as you do, and argue against that, as you do.
But seriously, you did argue for science and laughed that anyone would question it from a non-scientific stand-point (i.e. me believing in religion and creation instead of science and evolution) and yet we find an example of you doing exactly that; with respect to Nazi science which you condemn as detestable, based on philosophy rather than science. However, you see nothing wrong with that, and everything wrong with your perception of me doing the same to another form of science. Hypocrisy comes to mind.
Even here you misrepresent me. I don't like to label all arguments as circular reasoning, which you imply. I like to label circular arguments as circular arguments. And you like to use circular logic.
Really?
You are partly correct, I would indeed be using both as I claim. The rest of your statement is a nonsense.
That's not what circular reasoning is.
You have demonstrated an example that if I believe something based on examples of reason, that I continue to believe in it. That is called basing one's belief on the evidence provided; or logic. It is not circular. Circular reasoning is where you believe in no God based on lack of evidence; because you don't accept as evidence anything that would point to God. You create the conditions.",9,37,topic_stance_votes_2

Your faith is your evidence that your mother is correct.
What could you not prove by participating in circular reasoning? It's fallacy, good luck with it.
yes.
But then you throw in ""reasoned faith"". But then you are making up terms that try to show faith as reason. What is reasoned faith? If reasoned faith is the same as ""reason"", then fine, you aren't using faith. If it's faith, belief without evidence, then your evidence is your faith, and thus, it's circular.
If your faith is even part of your ""evidence"" or ""reason"" for belief, then logically the entire claim is arrived at through circular reasoning. You can use both all you like, I'm just letting you know it's fallacy to claim faith as evidence, which you do. If you do not, then you are using reason, and not faith, and we don't need to continue because I see no fallacy in using evidence to back your claim.

""A reasoned faith. Faith and Reason go together.""
http://www.wnking.com/mchristheology.htm
""As Augustine wandered from one philosophy to another (Manichaeanism, skepticism, and Neo-Platonism), he became personally aware of the limitations of human reason. Reason and faith need to cooperate intimately in the soul’s quest for God. Belief is natural and necessary for intellectual activity which assents to many opinions solely on another’s testimony. ""We believe the things which are not present to our senses, if the evidence offered for them seems sufficient,""14 and the authority ""of who may be believed is being considered.""15 Religious belief and understanding are complementary: ""Understand my word in order to believe, but believe God’s word in order to understand.""16 Belief enlightened by understanding becomes a reasoned faith.On account of his close correlation of faith and reason, Augustine often made philosophical reflections in the course of theological inquiry and scriptural exegesis. Within this framework of philosophy and religion, Augustine’s Christian faith was open to whatever insights Greek and Roman thinkers had to offer.""

40,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,"Hello Dzeron:
The problem with that argument is that the author accuses science of claiming that everything is random. That is not so, for science claims that the atoms operate according to the laws of physics, not random chance.
How could random chance than produce order? This implies the existence of an orderly Creator who set the laws and particles into motion, would it not? The author is not talking about operation science, the science that involves observation, experiments and repeatability, but the belief of evolutionism that everything came into being over eons of years of change that eventually came from lifeless chemicals, that ultimately originated from the supposed big bang. Real science investigates problems using observation, experimental validation and repeatability, such as medical science, genetics, computer and space technology. Typically, no one observed those events (mentioned above) occuring, nor can they be repeated or experimentally validated. Thus, evolutionism cannot be proved by science, and as such, it must be taken by faith. Generally, evolutionism is the naturalistic (or atheistic) view about our origins.
there is actually another version called ""punctuated equilibrium"" that means that the separation of species was occasionally caused by drastic mutations.
Wow, I have never heared of this version.
Like GreenMtnBoy, I hardly read anything after the author tried to throw out science.
As explained above, he didn't try and through out the reputable operation or real science that involves observation, experiments, repeatability, he was targeting the theory (or belief) of evolutionism. This typically says that things came to be by accidents and natural processes (i.e. no intellgence involved).",8,41,topic_stance_votes_2

It is circular reasoning. You believe something, and you find the evidence for it, without even considering your position, and why you believe it, you just believe it.
I did this. Again you missed it. Selective myopia seems not to have caught the many sites I cited that retort your very limited understanding of philosophical arguments. Hence you repeat the mantra that faith and reason are mutually exclusive.
It would help to have a reasoned post. Simply restating your one site doesn't help you. Are they are well-versed in philosophy? You perhaps should resort to something by Kierkegaard. At least your position should be grounded in the study of philosophy. I give you this so you can at least effectively understand the nature of your own position.
The Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy states there are three choices you can have...
""Religious faith is of two kinds: evidence-sensitive and evidence-insensitive. The former views faith as closely coordinated with demonstrable truths; the latter more strictly as an act of the will of the religious believer alone. The former includes evidence garnered from the testimony and works of other believers. It is, however, possible to hold a religious belief simply on the basis either of faith alone or of reason alone. Moreover, one can even lack faith in God or deny His existence, but still find solace in the practice of religion.""
http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/f/faith-re.htm
Note you can have reason alone, or faith alone, but you can have faith and reason; reasoned faith. Your philosophy is stated as ""The incompatibilist model."" It is the axiom by which you draw all other statements of belief from, even the one about science being rational. Because you believe that there's a gulf between faith and reason, and this is a philosophical stance, not a truth. I have a different philosophical stance, to be sure. However your stance is so far backed up by, well... your stance... and one obscure web-site reference. You should also check out your own site again, before re-stating it; it lists as 'reason' sensory perception, in other words, feelings.

Here's a Hindu one
Reasoned Faith: Hindus declare that blind faith and dogma are the two most vicious sources of conflict in the world; only reasoned faith can ensure harmony in the world. ""I know that I myself owe it to thinking that I was able to retain my faith in religion...,"" writes Dr. Albert Schweitzer.17 One's deepest convic-tions must be vindicated by reason. Reason says that it is irreligious to perform religious actions which cause pain and discomfort to others. It is alright if an organized religion inspires its followers in the existence of God and prescribes a discipline to reach Him. At the same time, it is also important to recognize that God is above all religious systems, even though theologians may set limits to Him.

The Islamic tradition holds that the revelation granted to Muhammad had three principle elements: islam or submission to God, ihsan or moral and spiritual duties to the rest of humanity, and iman or faith.

47,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,"just a brief note: looking at both this thread and the ""out of china"" thread, in which bootfitter, monty and mach are debating, i am disturbed by the word ""silly"" next to ""montalban"". you 3 guys i respect in this forum for your articulate skill, knowledge and mature temperaments. please avoid the name-calling
i think this is the key to settling a major part of the back-and-forth-ing.
based on definitions 2 and 3 (which we can live with for the sake of this debate) r and f are mutually exclusive, in that you can back up your belief B with either r or f. however, r and f work hand in hand, as i pointed out in another thread. the sensory and logical evidence that back up B may not always be conclusive. in fact, most of the time we must leave some margin of error
for example, we can observe the sound of a siren up the block. this is sensory evidence. our belief would be that there is a fire in the neighboorhood. however, the sensory evidence is not conclusive, so there is a possibility or ""risk"" that you could be wrong about your belief. being certain that there is a fire in the neighboorhood requires faith. if the sound of a siren means there is a 40% chance that there is a fire in the neighboorhood, then the other 60% is based on faith
so here you have a case of f and r complementing each other to form a certainty of B. it is more logical to accept B with certainty when you have a much higher ratio of r to f. if r is overwhelming the f aspect, we call it a ""reasonable belief"". however, if more f than r is involved, then it is a ""faith-based belief""
most beliefs have an element of both f and r",42,48,topic_stance_votes_2
48,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,One does not have to be 100% certain that there is a fire in the neighborhod in order to reason that the benefits of acting on the 90% or whatever certainity outweight the benefits of not acting. Ever heard of game theory?,48,49,topic_stance_votes_1
49,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,"lol
very true. the game theory does not preclude faith. the game theory is just about odds.
if there is a fire on your block, then the best action is to wet your house so that it wont get burnt easily. however, if you hear a siren down the block, the odds that this means a house on your block is burning is about 40%. (5 out of 10 times is a road accident, 1 out of ten is a domestic dispute/burglary/other). in this case it is not reasonable to start soaking your house down with a hose until you gather more evidence. if at this point (with only the siren as evidence) you start to pour water on your house, then you're acting unreasonably. you believe that there is a fire, without reasonable evidence, therefore you are acting in faith
if you hear a siren and see firemen attaching a hose to the hydrant (but you dont see a fire) then you have a 99.5% reasonable certainty that there is a fire on the block. if you see the fire, then its 100%
acting upon the certainty that a fire is on your block, it is reasonable to pour water on your house to protect it from spreading and burning your stuff
with faith, there is the risk of soaking your house down for nothing and looking like a fool. then again, there is the chance that you were right all along.

Faith is belief without evidence. 
Reason: Belief based on some evidence, the amount matters not.
If you believe in a ""fire"" based on faith, your evidence is faith. That's circular reasoning. Your premise is that fire exists without evidence, to say you ""reasoned"" that fire exists, based on faith, is circular.
If you believe based on both reason AND faith, your reasoning is again circular.
Logically if reasoning based exclusively on faith is circular reasoning, then using that AND [anything you want to put here], is also circular.

Reason does not imply conclusive proof or some absolute certainity. That's again, your mixing up definitions in some odd fashion. 
Bill watched TV all day, at 4:45 he drove around the block and his wife, coming home from work, reasoned he was at work all day, based on the evidence of his driving, the evidence of having seen him go to work before, and on the evidence that he probably wouldn't lie.
She does not have conclusive proof, yet she still reasoned (and she's actually incorrect to boot). You somehow argue that she used faith, and reason, to which I say you're making faith synonymous with reason. They are mutually exclusive unless you re-define faith as ""reason"". Reason does not imply conclusive, absolute, right, or wrong. Get the dictionary if you like, whatever works for you to revise your definition.

The Catholics state Christian faith is based on reasoned faith; this is in their Catechism
35 Man's faculties make him capable of coming to a knowledge of the existence of a personal God. But for man to be able to enter into real intimacy with him, God willed both to reveal himself to man and to give him the grace of being able to welcome this revelation in faith. The proofs of God's existence, however, can predispose one to faith and help one to see that faith is not opposed to reason.
http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c1.htm#II
Christians rely on rezoned faith...
""Sometimes our answers seem somewhat lame, but in reality there is only so much one can say before one must acknowledge that, while there are certain things we simply cannot fully understand about this, reasoned faith, as defined in St James, becomes the only recourse""
http://www.oca.org/pages/orth_chri/q...s-of-mary.html
And in the understanding of the Bible...Matthew Henry's classic Bible commentary of the Book of James states...
""2. Faith is a grace that one expression supposes and another expressly requires: Knowing this, that the trial of your faith, v. 3; and then in v. 6, Let him ask in faith. There must be a sound believing of the great truths of Christianity, and a resolute cleaving to them, in times of trial. That faith which is spoken of here as tried by afflictions consists in a belief of the power, and word, and promise of God, and in fidelity and constancy to the Lord Jesus.""
http://www.gospelcom.net/eword/comme.../mh/james1.htm
Further, in understanding the Christian faith, he adds...
""I. Let us consider the address to sinners""
http://www.gospelcom.net/eword/comme.../mh/james5.htm
That is, he calls us to think/reason about what is being said....
""1. He foretels the judgments of God that should come upon them, v. 1-3. they should have miseries come upon them, and such dreadful miseries that the very apprehension of them was enough to make them weep and howl-misery that should arise from the very things in which they placed their happiness, and misery that should be completed by these things witnessing against them at the last, to their utter destruction; and they are now called to reason upon and thoroughly to weigh the matter, and to think how they will stand before God in judgment: Go to now, you rich men."" (Ibid)
Also, in judging whom we should be faithful/trusting of...we can use reason...
""When we read in Bouchet about miracles associated with the relics of Saint Hilary we can shrug it off: His right to be believed is not great enough to take away our freedom to challenge him. But to go on from there and condemn all similar accounts seems to me to be impudent in the extreme. Such a great saint as Augustine swears that he saw: a blind child restored to sight by the relics of Saint Gervaise and Saint Protasius at Milan; a woman in Carthage cured of a cancer by the sign of the cross made by a woman who had just been baptised; his close friend Hesperius driving off devils (who were infesting his house) by using a little soil taken from the sepulchre of our Lord, and that same soil, borne into the Church, suddenly curing a paralytic; a woman who, having touched the reliquary of Saint Stephen with a posy of flowers during a procession, rubbed her eyes with them afterwards and recovered her sight which she had recently lost... What are we to accuse him of - hum and the two holy bishops, Aurelius and Maximinus, whom he calls on as witnesses? Is it of ignorance, simple-mindedness, credulity, deliberate deception or imposture? ....

The golden number or divine proportion is clear evidence of God's intelligent design of us and our universe. This number, which is 1.618033989 (rounded), is a ratio that is seen throughout creation. Phi is represented with the Greek letter phi, which is Φ.
It is seen in geometry, spirals of seashells, the human ear, face, and body proportions, DNA, the human heartbeat, and of course, mathematics.
The sine of 666 degrees is 1/2 of anti-phi, or negative phi.
-2(sin 666°) = Φ
-2(-0.8090169944) = Φ
1.618033989 = Φ 
666 degrees is 54 degrees short of a complete 2 circles. If you divide the measure of a full circle by 54, you get 6.66666666.
2.5 cubits / 1.5 cubits = 1.66666666, which is close enough to phi that the difference proprtions of the ark of the covenant to Φ won't be a difference noticed by the human eye.
This exact same number can also be derived from the dimensions of the ark.
The breadth / height, which is 50/40, equals 1.66666666, which is not that far off from our calculation of Φ.
Φ is was also used by the Greeks and Egyptians in the building of their structures.

this i know. certainty is up to the observer/deducer. some people are prone to jump to conclusion. some are skeptical of everything. the mix of reason faith a person uses to be certain about something depends on thje person and the situation.
she used faith because there exists the possibility that her husband may lie, or that she could be wrong about her certainty. her conclusion may be deemed ""reasonable"" if there is a more likely chance that her reasoning is correct. similarly it may seem ""unreasonable"" for her to conclude that her husband never went to work but only just drove in to trick her. the fact is, she formed a certainty based on inconclusive evidence, but figured that the evidence she gathered (seeing her husband just drive in) would be sufficient to based her certainty upon.

85,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,"exactly. and my point is that we make irrational beliefs all the time. it is not always the best thing to wait until you gather all the necessary evidence before you make a decision. this is where judgement comes in. there are times when we must make a decision based on inconclusive evidence. call it irrational if you like (thats actually what it is, but dont tell the decision makers that), but its always part-faith/part-reason
i have repeatedly pointed out that faith requires no evidence. the definition of faith is certainty in something without evidence
it cannot. faith is used when sufficient evidence is absent. with faith-based certainties, there is always a risk that you may be wrong. the more faith employed, the higher the risk of being wrong
faith is necessary for explaining that which needs an explanation but cannot be currently backed by evidence. for example, you must explain why you need to hire kim as an assistant. kim's resume and interview may be incoclusive evidence of her motives and competence, but you justify your decision based on what you have, and based on your belief that its true and that what you see with kim is what you get. obviously, the possibilty exists that you can be wrong about your decision, and its reasonable to admit that, since the decision was based largely on faith",62,86,topic_stance_votes_2

however, one single belief can be based in both faith and reason. in fact, faith is usually the default basis, and it is replaced by reason as evidence comes up. many things we are certain of are based in faith and reason simultaneously. the relationship between the 2 is inverse, the more evidence there is, the less the belief relies on faith. the basis for a single belief can also switch from primarily or entirely faith to primarily or entirely reason and vice versa. we can be certain of something based on evidence, then later find out that our reason does not lead to the conclusion we came up with. if we continue to hold on to that belief even without evidence, then its a faith-based belief. similarly (and this is the most common case), we may believe something to be true simply because we were told. eventually, we start gathering evidence that backs up what we originally believed, making the basis for that belief change from faith to reason, without changing the belief itself",83,88,topic_stance_votes_2
88,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,"1. A belief is most certainly not a known truth. Degree of certainty is fine to apply to anything approached through reason. Reason however assumes anything CAN be known, whether it's known or not doesn't change that it can be known. I'm more certain about my existence than I am about my belief in the exact age of the earth, and will always be this way. Reason does not imply perfect knowledge, only a way of arriving at knowledge.
2. The instant you use reason to back your belief, faith is no more. It's not a graduated change. Why:
2. The law of the excluded middle: anythign is either A, or not A. A proposition can either be true, or false.
3. Law of contradiction - nothing can be both A, and not A. A proposition cannot be both true, and false.
Faith: Belief justified without evidence
Reason: Belief justified by evidence.
That might be a bit more clear. You can be incorrect in your justification, but it doesn't mean you didn't arrive at your belief through reason.
However:
You either USE evidence for your belief, or you don't. There is no middle, and it cannot be both. I think religious and common definitions of faith confuse the issue. Faith in your case is synonomous with a degree of certainty, unless it's entirely based without evidence, in which case it's faith.
Either you use evidence, or you do not, there is no middle, it cannot be both. Fortunately for us, else we would be incapable of reason.

89,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,"Mach, I have given you the benefit of the doubt now for some weeks, actually assuming that you were genuinely debating me. It seems that either you aren't, and determined to prattle off stuff in an effort to spam the threads, or your incapable of not resorting to straw-man.
You quite erroneously reconstruct this term I have used as 'a new phrase' and that is so wrong that I suspect you have no desire for reasoned debate. I have posted quite a large body of evidence, and suggested that, as far as Christianity alone is concerned, reasoned faith has existed for 2,000 years.
Perhaps it's because you haven't been taught the concept yet at school. But to assume that it is a 'new phrase' is absolutely false, as shown by thinkers such as Augustine, whom I've referred to (he lived c.400; so unless you construe 'new' as 1,600 years old, (?) :))
Whether you are genuine in debating or not, such blatant misconstructions do you no justice what-so-ever. And I should hope that you refrain from doing so in the future.
You don't need to agree with what I say, but it is disrepectful to say the least to re-construct arguments in such dishonest ways.
Yes, but it's no longer strawberry flavour. It's a new flavour, a combination of the two. Pity you fail to see your own examples don't help you.
I said as much; it is still a sword. Here again you re-vert to ignoring what was said. I did however say that it is a stronger sword.
Ah, again a straw-man. Reasoned faith is neither [a] nor [b] (see your own example re: mixing strawberry and raspberry).
Show one of them. So far you've exampled a flavour that is no longer strawberry or raspberry, but a new flavour, that therefore is neither [a] nor [b], but [c] which is what I've maintained all the while, that reasoned faith is not faith. SO you're whole argument, even using your own analogy bodes ill for you.
It is arguments like this, where you, on autopilot prattle of a large amount of stuff that actually contradicts yourself that in fact makes me feel that you're actually genuinely concerned about debate, and not attempting to spam these boards. However, you need to consider that when you give examples of mixing of flavours that becomes a new and different flavour, neither [a] nor [b] then you are in fact arguing against yourself, and it does no justice to you.
If you are genuine, you'd actually post some evidence. This is one of several posts, several arguments we're having where you either refuse to give evidence, or you can't.",83,90,topic_stance_votes_2
90,Proof of God,existence of God,support,"""The Law of the Excluded Middle"" is a concept new to Mach, obvious so because of the novel application he uses.
""The Law of the Excluded Middle is that ""if a given proposition is not true then its denial must be true”. See also The Law of (Non-)Contradiction which says that ""if a given proposition is true then its denial cannot be true"". Whereas formal logic places an absolute ban on Contradiction, Intuitionism is a branch of Logic which holds that the Law of Excluded Middle is not valid.
For dialectics, this law has only relative truth; due to the inherently mobile and interconnected nature of all concepts, it is frequently the case that neither a proposition nor its denial may be accepted as absolutely true.
http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/e/x.htm
It makes the assumption that two concepts are 'crisply defined as either [a] or [b].
In this case Mach deems that ""reason"" [a] and ""faith"" [b] can not be the opposite, by arguing in favour of ""The Law of the Excluded Middle""
The idea is that [a] as defined can not be [b], and visa versa. However ""reasoned faith"" is neither [a] nor [b], but [c] and thus Mach makes one of the saddest mistakes of logic. He gives an example of this in his own analogy in post 83
In this case strawberry [a] and raspberry [b] can neither be each other. However, mixed together they create a new flavour [c]. [c] is neither [a] nor [b]. It is what I have been arguing, and what he has failed to grasp.
And thus, continuing his analogy, adding instead of the ingredients, the concepts, we read his sentence as
The concept of truth of faith might have some reason added to it, but it's still a concept of truth.
Concrete thinking is to blame for someone seeing everything in black and white.
Logicians also accept that paradoxes exist, and that these defy the ""Law of the Excluded Middle"", such as the The Epimenides Paradox.
Scientists accept that there are degrees of truth, that things neither are [a] nor [b]. This is called ""Fuzzy logic"" and is ""widely accepted within the engineering and computer science communities, but generally rejected by mathematicians and statisticians.""

a belief does not care what it is based on. either faith or reason can be the basis of a belief.
belief: fire makes things hot
basis 1: my mom told me, so i believe
basis 2: i've observed fire causing things to get hot
regardless of the basis, the belief is the same. the basis doesnt change the belief itself. most of the things you are taught as a child you believe by faith. you take your parents'/teachers'/ books' word on what they say and believe it as true because mom/mr. charles/the encyclopedia said so. as you grow older, some of the things you believe by faith become based in reason, because you have observed with your senses and determined that they were true (backed up by evidence). the more evidence you have to back up your belief, the less you need to rely on faith
you assume that the law of excluded middle applies, but it doesnt. a belief itself does not care about its basis, its just a belief that the statement is true. there is no rule that states a belief can only be determined by a single basis. 
i agree. however, you continue to ignore the fact that inconclusive evidence exist (and therefore partial reasoning). 
again, the senario: a guy hears a siren up the block and immediately rushes out and hoses down his house. 
would you consider his belief (that there is a fire on his block) reasonable? would you consider him reasonable to act on such a belief? (note that a siren sound is the evidence he is acting on)",89,92,topic_stance_votes_2
92,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,"Nonsense. If it's outside of reason, where is it?
Reason does not imply certainty. You can have a degree of certainty with regards to reason. The ONLY requirement is that you can rationally justify your belief.
Correct example:
Will my neighbor return my weedwaker:
- Returning borrowed things is often considered a good thing to do
- However, people often are lazy and forget or put it off
- Some people steal, but I know my neighbor is well-off and should have no reason to steal a $100 weedwacker (gas powered!)
- My neighbor exists
- I DID let my neighbor borrow my weedwacker, which I believe also exists.
- I asked my neighbor to return it when he's done with it.
- He hasn't had it long, I still think he's well within etiquette to not have returned it yet.
- Then again, my neighbor is rarely home and very forgetful, I will probably have to remind him.
Conclusion1: My neighbor will return my weedwacker.
Conclusion2: My neighbor will not return my weedwacker.
Conlcusion3: I'm fairly certain my neighbor will return my ww.
Conclsuion4: I don't think by neighbor will return the ww, but he might.
OR:
I am not going to come to a conclusion yet.
All of these are consistent with reason.
You have to have no evidence to utilize faith. Again, there is no middle to these statemetns:
Faith requires no evidence
Reason requires evidence
I don't care if you need 1 unit of evidence, or 10000, if you REQUIRE it, you require it. If you don't, you don't.
No, I don't ignore it. It's wholly accepted and embraced, and logical. As detailed above. It's entirely consistent with reason. You can make false conclusions using reason, we do it daily!

-Mach",91,95,topic_stance_votes_1
95,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,"You argued this same thing on the superbowl thread. You have evidence, unless you choose to use none. You have all of the evidence I listed above, or you can ignore all of that, and make a guess, based on nothing. You're free to do this. If you choose to use no evidence, and provide NO justification for your belief, than you are indeed using faith. It's an either or. There is no middle to requiring evidence. As soon as you use any evidence, whatsoever, conclusive or not, you are using reason to arrive at your conclusion.
Scenario1:
I think this medication helps people based on a trial of 2 people.
That's a reasoned conclusion.
However, statistically we know that 2 is too small a sample size to give a GOOD justification. However, you still used reason.

Regarding your scenario, it follows the same rules. I think he made a poor choice, didnt' intereperet the data well, poorly justified his belief, but justified it just the same. Again, reason does not require you to arrive at the right conclusion, it just needs evidence as justification. If he considered the siren evidence that a fire may occur, then he reasoned it. If it was pure coincidence that he heard the siren, and assumed fire, then it was faith. He can call it either way, but if he justified his belief based on evidence, it was reasoned, not faith.

have you ever said ""hmm... i dont know about this, but i'll give it a try""? 
when you act on a belief (i'm not talking about testing the belief, i mean putting the belief into action), in your mind you are 100% certain that your belief is true. if your belief is based on inconclusive evidence, then its incomplete reasoning. yet you are completely convinced about your conclusion. you are using faith to fill the gap in the certainty. 
thats my take on it anyway. i think we both understand what we're saying, and might have to agree on leaving it as is
i think in the end, you stil end up accepting certain things as evidence that i would not consider evidence. for example, in the case of your neighboor (fred)returning your weedwacker, you really have no observable evidence that he will return youf weedwacker. in fact, there's a term coined specifically for lending someone something in the hopes of being repaid in the future: ""goodfaith"". you cannot predict the future, and the only things that are undoubtedly bound to happen are events that conform to the laws of physics (accelerating objects due to gravity, etc). other than that, you have no evidence that a specific event WILL happen. the evidence you consider may SUGGEST what will happen, but no evidence can ever bring to the 100% conclusion that fred will return your weedwacker
my view is that evidence can bring certainty in some instances, but not in all. with faith, we recognize that the evidence dose not suggest certainty, yet we must act on our belief, so faith comes into play. if the evidence outweighs the faith factor, this our conclusion is considered ""reasonable"". if we have a deficit in evidence, the conclusion is considered ""faith-based"". most of our beliefs have a generous mix of faith and reason",96,97,topic_stance_votes_2

my point (slightly modified now) is that if we act upon a belief not backed 100% by evidence, then we are exercising faith. even if we gather all the evidence available, very often it alone cannot give us 100% certainty. faith is no guaratee, in fact in undergoing any venture that involves risk, faith is involved",98,99,topic_stance_votes_2
99,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,"OK.
Let's examine a situation I deal with every day. Drilling oil and gas wells.
I've got say 2 or 3, or if I'm lucky 10 or 12, data points in an area and a geological concept. From that you create a series of maps and cross-sections of the strata, and you propose a well location. Before a well is drilled, every possible piece of data is examined. I should be pretty certain of the result right? WRONG.
As the old saying goes ""It's 2 miles down, and it's dark."" :p
You have no idea what the drill bit will encounter until you drill it.
There is no faith involved in drilling a well IMHO. You do your homework, examine all the facts, pick what you think is the best location, and then you sit back wait. I BELIEVED it was a good location, and I HOPE it's a good well, but I certainly don't have faith in it being a good well.
To my mind hoping for a result, or believing in the possibility of a result, are completely different that having faith in a result. Faith implies certainty regardless of circumstance, hope and belief do not.
Perhaps I'm different than most, but I approach all of my life with the same attitude that I approach drilling a well. I'll do all I can to make sure I make the right choice, and then hope for the best, but in the end, what happens happens. I wouldn't presume to have ""faith"" in my decision being correct, and definately not with 100% certainty.

Waxy",101,102,topic_stance_votes_1
102,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,"OK, I think this might help the two sides meet:
Regarding your choice or decision, or exercise of uncertainty....I think a choice does not impact belief.
If somone tells me to choose heads or tails, my choice doesn't change my belief, nor does it change what I based my belief on.
Namely, that I have a 50% chance of getting it right no matter what I answer (given a random toin coss!). But if I choose tails, and it turns up heads, I know that I was just forced to choose, not change my belief, which is still based on reason, that I have a 50/50 shot at getting it right.
I can always be uncertain about my rational choices, and in most cases, we will be. Only very certain things like math, logic, etc., will have certain answers for the most part. Things like the weather, we know to be based on basic physics, but the system is so complex we still don't do better than about 50/50 a few weeks out. BUT, we don't make the decision based on faith. Like Waxy striking Texas Gold :) we make the uncertain decision, based on reason. 
I can even choose the LOWER probability, just for kicks. It might be a less likely choice, but certainly not based on faith.
I think the clearest example to the contrary is that faith is belief without evidence, OR IN SPITE of evidence. That is to say, if your neighbor brought the weedwacker back, and you believed he would not  based on faith, you would either ""maintain your faith"" despite the evidence that he will not return the weedwacker (irrationally!), or you would drop the faith and adopt a new faith (he returned my weedwacker), or reason (Obviously I have seen evidence my weedwacker was returned).

- Fuzzy logic also, logically, adheres to basic logic when the precise values are known. Requires, is a precise term, by any stretch, so you're still stuck with good old fashioned logic. Fuzzy logic is more similar to every day decision making where you don't have a clear yes/no, or don't know precise values, and still want to make a decision based generally on probability. It's the logical application of reasoning in my simple terms. It does nothing to bypass basic logic, which of course, is what you endeavor to do.

Here are the two similarities:
I believe in you.
I have faith in you.
To some and also in the dictionaries they are one in the same, but actually they are only similar.
I believe in you means I trust your actions, your feelings, and your decisions about (a certain thing) and that you will do your best for the whole (whether that whole is the family, the community, the country, or the world).
I have faith in you means means I know all that you do will benefit us both. You have faith in your children so that they will grow up and make the right choices that benefit them, and, by proxy, yourself. You have faith in your wife that she will always love you – dual benefit. You have faith that God will perform His word – dual benefit. Whether we believe it or not God wants us to have faith in Him…that’s His benefit.

I've been following your numerous debates on this issue, and I'm sure it's no surprise to you that I'm going to side with Mach on this one. 
I think the two terms are mutually exclusive. It's an oxymoron.
I would completely agree with 'reasoned belief', but faith implies that no reasoning is required.
Here's my take on your ongoing debate(s) with Mach on this subject-
I think that what you're driving at is reasoned belief. I haven't seen all of your reasons to believe, I'll just accept that you have them. Based on these reasons you believe God exists. That's fine, and I'm quite willing to accept that, but belief does not imply 100% certainty.
The only way to convey 100% certainty is to say that you have faith in the fact God exists. Then, by definition, if you have faith, you don't require any evidence or reasons for your certainty.
Further to that, IMHO, belief is rational, faith is irrational.

111,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,"I like this approach to the topic. I think unkerpaulie had a thread which touched on this recently as well (does the existence of the object of faith matter, or the faith itself). 
Basically the belief, without evidence, itself, can impact, in a real way, our lives and the lives of those around us. It's not used with the desire to gain knowledge directly, it's meant to give...confidence, so to speak, in a very real way.
As you mention, faith in one's children is a great example, even to the point when a child commits a crime, parents will (and I assume I will as well!) side with their child. Rationally they may know differently, but outwardly, they ignore the evidence and have faith. 
We all take part in this, and it's part of the human condition. Archers use to aim at targets they knew they could not hit, in an effort to make them shoot farther than they might if they set their sights at a more...reasonable distance. Competitors of all kinds visualize winning, KNOW they will win, and proceed to perform with that in mind. Our mortality...probably the most common form of denial that serves in many cases, what we believe to be a very good purpose (keep us sane in the face of our impending death).
I will second that....I too think there is a place for this, obviously, I take part in it as well.
What I can't abide by is anyone's dispute of reason based on irrational grounds. To claim there are applications of ""faith"" that serve humans well, is entirely reasonable, and one I happen to side with as well. Keep faith where it is, use it, emrbace it, do what you will with it, but I can't sit by as some try to push it into the space that reason holds.

This is called ""Fuzzy logic"" and is ""widely accepted within the engineering and computer science communities, but generally rejected by mathematicians and statisticians.""
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic
It is a direct refutation of your application of ""the Law of the Excluded Middle"" in that some scientists accept that things aren't necessarily black and white. As a concrete thinker, this seems hard for you to absorb, even when scientists disagree with you.
You're back to flogging this dead horse. We're not debating 'faith' or 'reason', to which we are both in agreement. We are debating another and different entity called ""reasoned faith"" which is an admixture of the other two concepts.
Mach, you ask me a riddle here but we've gone several weeks where you've not done me the courtesy of giving any evidence other than your own misplaced opinion. If you can research a site, that agrees with your stance, that is based on philosophical study. But you don't. You can't. And that's saddeningly dishonest of you to not debate to the same level of research you continually get from, and expect from me.
I put forward evidence in Posts #40, #46, and #66, and reminded you of this as late as post #79. It seems your spoiling tactic is to ignore an answer I give, and continue to ask questions about 'reasoned faith' when I've already given loads of supporting evidence on three separate occasions.
I had hoped that you were a genuine debator, but you are not. You simply re-state your belief. I have asked for you to support your statement on every occasion, and you see fit not to do so, and then to ask me for support which has been given from philosophical and religious sites, including dictionaries of philosophy. This weight of evidence is something you continue to ignore.
If you are a genunie debator, you will respond with evidence, not opinion. Find the research. I even suggested a philosopher who might agree with you. You are lowering the standard of debate by refusing to post anything but opinion - when you yourself demand 'evidence' from others.
This is the challenge, open for everyone now to see. Will Mach cite sources of evidence? I believe he won't.
Show me the evidence.",112,113,topic_stance_votes_2
113,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,"Reasoned faith is not a word. It's a phrase. It describes using both faith and reason.
It's a logical AND, ...faith AND reason. Thus, it's reduced back to giving conclusions based on no evidence, and is thus, is irrational.
(From Montalban's own posts)
You use the word faith in your definition, you already admitted it's faith combined with reason.
Quote from your source, this does not indicate some new made-up nonsensical word, it clearly shows reasoned faith as using both reason and faith to make decisions.
So, as we see, by both your words, our understanding of the english language, and your sources, that reasoned faith is juse a phrase describing the use of BOTH reason, and faith. They are not something new, they are the logical combination which you have thoroughly convinced me of.
So, we're back to reason and faith.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Faith does not require evidence
- Reason requires evidence.
Using both in combination results in two methods. You can use faith AND reason, or use can use faith OR reason. Let's test them!!!
Montalban's Dillema using reason AND faith.
Q: Is 2+3=5?
=============
Faith application:
I have faith that 2+3=4.
Reason application:
OK, but clearly we can show basic arithmetic that proves 2+3=5
Using faith AND reason you are left to conclude that 2+3=5 is false, based on logical AND of using faith, and reason.
Sorry, you're still arriving at irrational conclusions. 
Montalban's Dillema using reason OR faith.
Q: Is 2+3=4?
=============
Faith application:
I have faith that 2+3=4 (same as above..based on my special bible)
Reason application: No foo, it's 5, so it's false, based on mathematical evidence. 
Conclusion, logical OR, results in 2+3=4 being a TRUE statement.
So much for reasoned combined with faith, it's logically irrational.
Enjoy.

114,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,"Good point, Mach.
I would like to go further down that road if you don’t mind and say that that confidence will surely diminish in time without hard evidence. And I know that the confidence you speak of is for boosting one’s moral, but we would both, I think, agree that without substance it would soon be replaced by something. I could give you a thousand examples, but feel assured that you don’t need it.
Faith in a child, unfortunately, can be lost, despite how much he/she is loved. Gone are honor, respect, admiration, reliability, and faith…all but love. The type of action that destroys the aforementioned is varied by the deed’s severity. Many parents have more faith in a stranger than their own child after the child has gone beyond a certain threshold. I pray that I never see that day.
Yes, I agree, there is nothing wrong with aiming high…until you want to put meat on the table. :) And I agree that positive thinking can take us a very long way. It’s knowing what to do after “knowing” we will win, and we lose, that makes the difference. God wants you to think for yourself, religion don’t, God loves to see us guard our souls, but religion wants us to put all our eggs in one basket.
Sometimes it’s best to be sure we will hit our mark, despite all the evidence to the contrary.
I’m with you all the way there, Mach. Either you have faith in something that works or you don’t. It really doesn’t matter if you think it might one day, if it’s not bearing fruit – cut it down. Pushing faith into a hole where squarely sits reason is really having no faith at all. Very good point, Mach.",114,115,topic_stance_votes_2
115,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,"Before you denied it was a phrase. Then you changed to it being a new word (post #114). How you do jump about and diminish your debate :) It's truly amazing that you can type this stuff that contradicts something else you wrote only a short while ago.
Yes. Your point? It is indeed a combination (as your analogy dealt with, of combining flavours).
What do you think reasoned faith is?
Anyway, you're awfully confused. You're both saying it's phrase, it's a nonsensical word, it's a word that does clearly show something (obviously). What is it you're trying to fathom?
I never said it is something new. That's the untruth you said (see post #114). But you hit upon what reasoned faith is. It is a combination of faith and reason. After all this time of debate, and suddenly BINGO, you got it.
Yes, I have predicted that you would continue to go back to what we're already agreed upon.
Please, enough with your weird examples.
Why not use reasoned faith?
So you keep saying, and you've offered not a single citation to back up your opinion, something else I said you'd do.
It's the only reason I continue to respond to your jumble of thoughts.
No, what you are saying is that you don't need to look at any citation of people who work in the field of philosophy, all you need do is argue points we agree on, ad infinitum (such as a definition of 'faith')
But you're right, dealing with you is a burden.
Here's a bit of reasoned faith.
I have faith that God is good. If God is good then God would not be cruel. That is reasoned faith. I have faith in God, I use reason to conclude what God is like. But it goes deeper than that too, (but I'm sure you'll be quite selective in your re-wording of this statement), that God has revealed Himself to us. That is reason; proof by appearance. God has said ""I am a God of love"", we believe Him, that is faith. God made us to recognise Him; it is in our nature to return to Him. Faith and reason working hand in hand; reasoned faith.
We are not wholly rational beings, and we are not wholly emotional beings. WE are a combination of both rational and emotional, and thus we come to know things with both head and heart.
Here's an interesting site...
Can we have both Evidence and Faith? 
The origin of the word faith comes from a Latin word meaning to trust. 
Usually we need to earn trust to receive it, but that is not always the case. 
Does God want us to have earned trust in him, or should we just trust?
Hebrews 11:1,6 
According to Hebrews 11 faith has substance, and evidence and can be diligently sought for. 
We have not seen have we seen the air, but we have faith that air exist because we have evidence, we have seen the trees sway in the wind, balloons fill, and even tornadoes tear houses away from thier foundation. 
The same can be said for God we have not seen God, but we have access evidence just as powerful as any tornado that he exist, but we have to diligently seek it. 
1 Peter 3:15 
God commands us to be ready to give an answer to everyone who ask 
for the hope that lies within you. 
If you have faith that requires no evidence you have something more precious than gold, but many people esspecailly in our modern day world need evidence to believe in God and the Bible requires us to have an answer for those people who are looking for evidence. So even if you do not personally need evidence for your faith, you need to be able to answer the questions about your faith that others have. 
Acts 1:3 
Jesus produced many infallible proofs of his reserection. 
Mat 22:37 
We are to love the Lord with all our mind as well as our heart and soul 
How can we love God with our mind without anilizing the evidence that God exist? 
Mark 9:24 
Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief. 
This verse sounds confusing until you read the entire chapter this man brought his demon possessed son to Jesus to be healed, and Jesus said I can fix him if you believe 
What I believe this man was saying was Lord I believe, but if you heal my son, you will have given me the evidence I need for my faith to grow. 
In Exodus 4:1-10 Moses tells God that his people won't believe that Moses has talked to him and God replies by giving him several signs to prove that he has spoken with God. And that is just the first of many times that God gives the Jews evidence that he reigns supreme.

A challenge that was laid down some weeks ago, and each and every post Mach shies away from this and simply re-states his opinion on it.

It was his second half-hearted attempt at research, and both times he showed a total misunderstanding of what it is he was trying to say; because the cites didn't support his statements.

What do you think reasoned faith is? Some posts you argue that its a word, others that it's a phrase, then you add in all sorts of un-supported claims; like it's 'new'. Where are you up to this time?
Reasoned faith is a combination of reason and faith. I have maintained a consistent claim. Somehow you, who change what it is you are arguing against daily, believe I am changing. That's very rich!
I look forward to you just repeating the concept is illogical.

Faith made stronger by reason.

Is this how you determine truth from false...by tallying the number of web sites someone references? LOL, that's errr..RICH! 
You can post all the evidence you like, it just needs to refute something. If you post 40404 people that claim 2+3=4, do you suggest that we need 40405 posts saying the opposite to actually show it false? Your claims are impotent.

123,Proof of God,existence of God,support,"It's factual. Evidence by the lack of citations that you make.
We are on a public forum, or did you imagine we two are the only ones reading this?
Yes, you do continually re-state your opinion. You demand evidence, yet offer none. When I offer it, you say no amount of evidence will convince you, and then a few posts later, you'll demand that I post evidence.
Not quite. I posted numerous sites that show that the concept of reasoned faith is neither just my opinion, nor 'new' (something which you claimed; thus you have made counter-claims; which are false). You continually say that it doesn't exist. I have shown my case. You dismiss it with your re-statement of opinion. So, there is some burden for you to show why you think your opinion, constantly re-stated constitutes an argument greater then effectively saying ""no it isn't"" There is also some need for you to demonstrate why you hold a circular position.
You demand evidence, and when it's posted, you say the amount of evidence I cite is irrelevant, even though it backs up my case; because you then argue that no amount of evidence will convince you. Next thing you do, is you demand I post evidence. :)
Yes, you make such claims even though I've referred you to definitions of it. This is again your very lazy way of arguing; calling for an answer that's already been given.
For you this is 'argument'. And the thing for my side is it shows how irrational your argument is. Even if people disagree with my case, your case is flawed by that lack of evidentiary argument.
In fact, for instance, in Post 46 I gave you several citations, including from philosophical dictionaries/sites.
Your retort was that the actual amount of evidence to my case was irrelevant. And that's been the story so far. So much for the rational mind, you have a belief, and regardless of what evidence is put forward, you maintain your belief is correct - based on (?) your belief that you are correct.
I posted evidences at Posts #40, #46, and #66. You make a cry for me to provide evidence, even though I have, and even though I remind you that I have. SO, when I remind you of the fact that I've posted evidences such as in posts #73, #79 and again in post #113, you still make this totally dishonest tactic of saying ""Please show the evidence"", when also you say that no matter how much evidence I do cite, you've already convinced yourself you're right. In fact, I've had to post these references to where I've given you evidence, because you continually make the false claim that you're still waiting for a definition.
So much for the rational mind! We now must travel through this cycle every few days as you seem to forget where you're up to; whether you're attacking me for not posting evidence - and demanding that I do, or attacking my evidence, by stating that no amount of it will convince you, then you're back to demanding I cite evidence, as if I haven't.
Goldfish have a memory retention, it is said, of only a few seconds.
However, for me, argument is a set of connected statements with (hopefully) references to evidence. For you, a re-stating of your opinion, and calling for me to provide evidence that I've already done, and then offering no evidence yourself constitutes debate. With, occasionally the re-insertion of argument against something we're agreed on, and then a reversion to indignantly demanding I do something I've already done.
You seem to mistake 'faith' as in I have a religious faith/belief/denomination to a particular belief, for 'faith' per se. My Orthodox faith is made stronger through reasoned faith.
Yes, my Orthodox faith is one that combines faith with reason, or reasoned faith, a concept that you've tried to pretend I've just made up (despite citing evidence from Christian tradition), to stating that it's a made up word, to a made up phrase, to a 'new' word or phrase.
No, you mean you re-stated your belief, devoid of evidence, which for you is 'true'.
You and I have a different idea of evidence. For you, your opinion is evidence. And you've stated your opinion as if it's true, based on the belief what you say is true.
.
Do you assume that we are the only two on this forum?
It is certainly relevant to you being incorrect. You tried to show that faith and reason, by being poles apart would have nothing in between. You used a concept that is not even widely accepted by scientists (re: my refutation from citing evidence about 'fuzzy' logic' etc).
It was your best attempt at providing some evidence to your case, and it was evidence that did not support your case. Therefore your case still rests on your opinion.
That is quite frankly a terrible howler to make. It goes to show the level of honesty between us is vast. It's very easy for you to make such a comment that I've ignored what you said. It's just as easy for me to reference the posts (#91, and to a lesser extent the one before it, and again at #104) where I showed that your concept of ""The Law of the Excluded Middle"" was misapplied. It's extraordinarily odd that you would diminish your own credibility by making such a patently false claim as that. That's starting to become a catalogue of false claims you now make, added to your demands that I provide a definition of what I believe in; which I can only assume you do because you make a mistake between not agreeing with something stated, and not seeing something stated... which is probably likely to your own self-belief that what you believe in is true, anyway.
Odd for you to think of a tactic that an irrational person would use to convince others. If you had evidence, you'd post it.
Well considering I was able to debate your two attempts at sourcing your ideas, it is very easy for you to give up on doing this.
Not at all the same. I have spelt out my case by citing evidence, showing you where that evidence was stated (after your numerous claims that I haven't done this). We are operating on totally different sets of principles.
Please bear in mind your numerous false claims.
Here we go for your dishonest statement again. I've already defined it. I've already cited sites that define it. You just call on me to do it, when I've done it.
No, you've stated that it is.
So are you now admitting that I have defined it? There you go, caught in your own trap. When people are dishonest they begin to lose track of what it is they are claiming.
You've changed your claims at various times, re: whether it's a word/phrase/new/my invention etc.
Now you've been caught out again.
So now you do admit I've defined it. That's a different thing from saying that you don't agree with it. You've made post after post of this bogus claim that I have not given you a definition.
Now we're back to seeing you claim that I haven't defined it. You ought to make up your mind.
Yes, it is. So far even within this post you've demeaned that I provide a definition, then admitted that I have, (even though you don't agree with it), and then gone back to demanding that I provide a definition, even though you've already attempted to refute my definition. This is, as I stated, further evidence that you switch day to day what it is you're arguing.
You already do just make claims about what I've said, and they are just your claims.
Ah, arrogance. Here you assume again that your opinion is 'logical'. Now you give your opinion about your opinion :)

However, reasoned faith is not entirely about proof of God. It is a way of rationalising what God wants; what He wants for us, etc.
I can have faith in God, that He exists. (as well, I can have reasons for believing in God). But what does God want for us? I therefore can reason what God wants, based on what I know of God (through faith), thus there's a dialectic relationship between my faith and reason senses and this will, I believe, give me a greater faith (in the sense of faith being a type of religious belief)

Yes a number of people have now voiced their opinion. You do the same. Good for you. I have entered a world where-by if enough people express their opinion, that adds weight to the argument, even if it's not actually based on anything except your own a priori beliefs about belief.
Your idea of human thinking is separate from the truth. We are both rational, and feeling beings. We combine the two everyday in a process that is continually relying on both sources. In effect, you are saying we are full of oxymorons, everyone of us, for we draw upon both sides all the time... maybe you're from Vulcan.
I think what you do is mistake 'faith' for 'a religious faith built on faith and reason (or reasoned faith)'. I think actually that's the crux of the many objections. 'A religious faith' is not just 'faith' alone, although you probably feel that people just sat around one day and started believing in something, with no reason what-so-ever, somehow a 'faith' just happened. And that these people just accepted what they felt, with no reason what-so-ever.

""A reasoned faith. Faith and Reason go together.""
http://www.wnking.com/mchristheology.htm
""As Augustine wandered from one philosophy to another (Manichaeanism, skepticism, and Neo-Platonism), he became personally aware of the limitations of human reason. Reason and faith need to cooperate intimately in the soul’s quest for God. Belief is natural and necessary for intellectual activity which assents to many opinions solely on another’s testimony. ""We believe the things which are not present to our senses, if the evidence offered for them seems sufficient,""14 and the authority ""of who may be believed is being considered.""15 Religious belief and understanding are complementary: ""Understand my word in order to believe, but believe God’s word in order to understand.""16 Belief enlightened by understanding becomes a reasoned faith. On account of his close correlation of faith and reason, Augustine often made philosophical reflections in the course of theological inquiry and scriptural exegesis. Within this framework of philosophy and religion, Augustine’s Christian faith was open to whatever insights Greek and Roman thinkers had to offer.""

""Reasoned Faith is a collection of fourteen essays offered in honor of Christian philosopher Norman Kretzmann that addresses Judeo- Christian themes in the tradition of analytic philosophy. The collection is divided into four sections, all addressing the rational assessment of religious faith: ""The Role of Reason in Faith,"" ""Reason and Revelation,"" ""Reason and the Nature of the God Faith,"" and ""Reason and Faith on the Relation Between God and Creatures.""

The Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy states there are three choices you can have...
""Religious faith is of two kinds: evidence-sensitive and evidence-insensitive. The former views faith as closely coordinated with demonstrable truths; the latter more strictly as an act of the will of the religious believer alone. The former includes evidence garnered from the testimony and works of other believers. It is, however, possible to hold a religious belief simply on the basis either of faith alone or of reason alone. Moreover, one can even lack faith in God or deny His existence, but still find solace in the practice of religion.""
http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/f/faith-re.htm
Note you can have reason alone, or faith alone, but you can have faith and reason; reasoned faith. Your philosophy is stated as ""The incompatibilist model."" It is the axiom by which you draw all other statements of belief from, even the one about science being rational. Because you believe that there's a gulf between faith and reason, and this is a philosophical stance, not a truth. I have a different philosophical stance, to be sure. However your stance is so far backed up by, well... your stance... and one obscure web-site reference. You should also check out your own site again, before re-stating it; it lists as 'reason' sensory perception, in other words, feelings.
""'Reason' refers to beliefs held on the basis of sensory and logical evidence.""

Here's a Hindu one
Reasoned Faith: Hindus declare that blind faith and dogma are the two most vicious sources of conflict in the world; only reasoned faith can ensure harmony in the world. ""I know that I myself owe it to thinking that I was able to retain my faith in religion...,"" writes Dr. Albert Schweitzer.17 One's deepest convic-tions must be vindicated by reason. Reason says that it is irreligious to perform religious actions which cause pain and discomfort to others. It is alright if an organized religion inspires its followers in the existence of God and prescribes a discipline to reach Him. At the same time, it is also important to recognize that God is above all religious systems, even though theologians may set limits to Him.

Here's a Moslem one..
The Islamic tradition holds that the revelation granted to Muhammad had three principle elements: islam or submission to God, ihsan or moral and spiritual duties to the rest of humanity, and iman or faith. This word, faith, is a fairly poor rendering of iman ; one might better understand the word if it's translated as ""reasoned faith"" or ""conviction.""

St.Augustine believed "" Belief enlightened by understanding becomes a reasoned faith""
http://www.crvp.org/book/Series01/I-9/chapter_i.htm
The Catholics state Christian faith is based on reasoned faith; this is in their Catechism
35 Man's faculties make him capable of coming to a knowledge of the existence of a personal God. But for man to be able to enter into real intimacy with him, God willed both to reveal himself to man and to give him the grace of being able to welcome this revelation in faith. The proofs of God's existence, however, can predispose one to faith and help one to see that faith is not opposed to reason.

Christians rely on reasoned faith...
""Sometimes our answers seem somewhat lame, but in reality there is only so much one can say before one must acknowledge that, while there are certain things we simply cannot fully understand about this, reasoned faith, as defined in St James, becomes the only recourse""
http://www.oca.org/pages/orth_chri/...ss-of-mary.html
And in the understanding of the Bible...Matthew Henry's classic Bible commentary of the Book of James states...
""2. Faith is a grace that one expression supposes and another expressly requires: Knowing this, that the trial of your faith, v. 3; and then in v. 6, Let him ask in faith. There must be a sound believing of the great truths of Christianity, and a resolute cleaving to them, in times of trial. That faith which is spoken of here as tried by afflictions consists in a belief of the power, and word, and promise of God, and in fidelity and constancy to the Lord Jesus.""

Further, in understanding the Christian faith, he adds...
""I. Let us consider the address to sinners""

""1. He foretels the judgments of God that should come upon them, v. 1-3. they should have miseries come upon them, and such dreadful miseries that the very apprehension of them was enough to make them weep and howl-misery that should arise from the very things in which they placed their happiness, and misery that should be completed by these things witnessing against them at the last, to their utter destruction; and they are now called to reason upon and thoroughly to weigh the matter, and to think how they will stand before God in judgment: Go to now, you rich men.""

136,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,"i thought i had gone over this already
i showed plenty examples of combining faith and reason in making decisions or believing statements.
if your mother tells you that clouds are big clumps of water vapor and dust high up in the sky, as a child you believe her without evidence. that is faith. as you learn more, you find evidence that confirms this belief. eventually, you have enough evidence that you dont rely on faith anymore (as when you were younger) to believe that stars are big clumps of water vapor and cloud high up in the sky
like i said before, the belief itself doesnt care if its based on reason or faith or a little of both. the belief in the statement ""clouds are big clumps of water vapor and dust high up in the sky"" can be based on faith or reason, but the statement itself doesnt change. either you belief it or you dont. you can believe it based on faith, you can believe it based on evidence, or you can be partially convinced by evidence yet still believe it because thats what your mom sid. that is what reasoned faith is",136,137,topic_stance_votes_2
137,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,"You're talking about a decision Unker, not a belief.
Take a coin toss. Which do you choose, heads or tails?
Your choice DOES NOT impact your belief as to which side will land face up.
If asked to choose a side, you choose a side. This has no impact on belief.
If however you claimed you knew to be true, that the coin, after this toss, will be heads, you'd be relying on faith.
Using reason, you can choose heads, or tails, but your belief REMAINS THE SAME, that there is a 50% chance for heads and 50% chance for tails, every toss.
Making a choice has absolutely no impact on your belief, we cannot combine decisions with belief and be consistent.
=============================
2nd issue:
Under the guise of being young and ignorant, taking your mother's word as evidence is entirely reasonable, especially when you don't have the faculties to think critically. This need not be faith, I consider your teacher's instruction to be evidence. If you later come upon more knowledge/evidence to the contrary, you weigh, not reason vs faith, you weigh your mother's testimony (and all of your knowledge about the reliability of your mother's testimony), vs. your new knowledge/evidence, and it's reliability. That's a reasoned belief.
If you knew basically nothing about the sky, and your mother said ""coulds are water vapor"", and you decided instead to believe to be true that the clouds were just big cotton balls, then you'd be relying on faith.
==============
Faith can be used in combination with reason, but the combination still results in irrational absurdities, and is therefore still not a reliable way to seperate true from false, which in the end, is the point that is being made. Reason entirely fills the need for gaining knowledge, there is no room for faith.

139,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,"making choices have a lot to do with belief. dont compare choosing a coin side to hiring an administrative assistant. both are very different. in hiring someone you have to consider the evidence you gather and act based on what you believe is true at the time
there is no guise in being ignorant when one is young. and taking someone's word for truth in the absense of evidence is EXACTLY what faith is. if you can argue that it is reasonable to believe your mother's statement is true just because she said it, then how can you argue that it is unreasonable to take the statements in the bible as true just because the bible said it? by arguing that beklieving what your mother said - based on her reliability, etc - is ""reasoned faith"", you supporting exactly what youve been arguing against this entire thread
how in the world could you come to that conclusion? if a child believes that clouds are big cotton balls, based on his familiarity with cotton balls (shape, color, texture), why wouldnt that be a ""reasoned belief""? and if he never even knew water vapor existed, but his mother told him that clouds are made out of water vapor thats in the air but invisible, yet he can see clouds, why would it be more reasonable to believe his mother?
reason simply has to do with making a rational belief based on evidence around you. it is surely more reasonable to liken clouds to cotton than invisible water vapor thats in the air around you. yet the belief that clouds are made of cotton would be false, not because its faith based, but because its simply inaccurate. however, believing what your mother tells you about the nature of clouds, simply because she tells you, even if it seems to go against the evidence you have, is totally based in faith
like i said, reason and faith can only be a basis for a belief, not the belief itself. you can believe a true statement without evidence to back it up, or you can believe a false statement that is supported by reason. the statement itself is not determined by the basis of believing it
of course faith is not a reliable way to separate the truth from what is false. with faith comes the inherent risk that you may be wrong. with solid evidence to back up a belief, you dont have that problem. my point is that many times (probably most times) you dont have the conclusive evidence that can 100% back up your belief, so you must use your own judgements and subjective views to help support the belief. it is not a totally reliable way to separate the truth from what is false, but we necessarily employ it in our everyday lives anyway",138,140,topic_stance_votes_2
140,Proof of God,existence of God,attack,"They most certainly do not require a change of belief.
Hiring someone is a decision. When using reason, a decision does not imply knowing truth or falsity.
"" I think she will be sufficient for the job"", is reasoned. She may fail miserably, but you knew reasonably that you had no way to know, short of hiring her, to find that out. One does not need to form the belief that the person is perfect for the job in order to hire them, obviously. If you read a resume or interview the person, you're gathering evidence.
If you randomly choose a name out of the phonebook and claim you know to be true that they are a good worker, you're relying on faith to make your claim that it is true that this person is a good worker.
A gulf of difference seperates reason and faith.
Judgements and subjective views add to the confusion.
A judgement is a decision. See above.
Subjective view merely describes a view that originates from an individual, that cannot readily  be observed by others. However, if I say someone is beautiful to me, I can certainly be making a true statement based on my objective view of the evidence that I feel pleasure when observing the person. 
Those two terms do nothing for the argument.
Use these simple tests unker:
1. Did the belief/claim require evidence? Yes/No
If it required evidence, it's reasoned. If it does not require evidence, it's faith.
Recall, the absurdity of faith used as a basis for belief is best illustrated by not just requiring no evidence, but IN SPITE OF EVIDENCE.
To say ""I know to be true that clouds are made of cotton"", and you're then flown up and allowed to observe clouds directly, if you maintain your belief based on faith, you still claim to be true that they are made of cotton.
Big difference, easy to test, requires or does not require evidence.

Reason usually says something is x% likely to be true, where x is between 0 and 100. Hence, rational people are said to think in shades of grey.
Faith says that something is either 0% likely or 100% likely. Hence, faith-oriented people are said to think in black and white.
To combine reason and faith would be to start thinking like this: If something is shown by reason to be 51% certain, you jump to the conclusion that it is 100% certain. That is not rational, so it leaves reason out of the question.
