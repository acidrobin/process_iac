1,Canadian healthcare,unknown,support,"Falling, I got some information from some Canadians. Most of them didn't like the system and would rather see it gone. They said: 
Canada is experiencing an even more severe shortage of doctors and nurses than most nations with a shortage.
There is a huge waiting list for vital procedures. 
Assorted colorful remarks about Chretien and his party... 
And my French friend said in France it is first come, first served, which we all know isn't such a great idea.",1,2,topic_stance_votes_1
2,Canadian healthcare,unknown,support,"then have private health-care for those who can afford it. but offer free-health care to everyone. and btw, if canadians were so strongly against free health-care then how come when election time comes they continually vote for politicians who support it? and who are these canadians that you got information from? probably business owners...",1,3,topic_stance_votes_1
3,Canadian healthcare,unknown,support,"Because they are afraid of change. People from Canada and France say no one there likes the leaders. I always ask why they get re-elected. They say it is because no one else is sure what the other party will do because they have no been in power for so long. I'd say Right parties in those countries are like the Green party here...viewpoints confused and the party generally not well known. (Party names are so bland in Canada and France...LIberal party, Conservative party, Right Party, Left Party.)
Now that's different. I would probably be for free healthcare at a certain income level if it cut off there. But that's different from the current plan--we'd need major changes.",1,4,topic_stance_votes_1
4,Canadian healthcare,unknown,support,"hahahahaha, conservatives are afraid of change my friend. conservative means you want to conserve or keep the way things are now.
what is wrong with having private health care for those who want it and free health care for those who cannot afford anything else?",1,5,topic_stance_votes_1
5,Canadian healthcare,unknown,support,"By that I mean leadership change. The other parties haven't been in power for so long... 
I said free healthcare is fine at a certain income cut off and with major changes from the Canadian/ French system.",1,6,topic_stance_votes_1
6,Canadian healthcare,unknown,support,"ok, then we agree on something. what is a good cut-off? anyone below 60,000 a year has ACCESS to free health care?",1,7,topic_stance_votes_1
7,Canadian healthcare,unknown,support,"Hmm... I would probably say $40,000-$30,000. $60,000 is way to high, on my opinion. I think it should be offered only to those who can't afford it. If you make $60,000 I would say you could afford it.",1,8,topic_stance_votes_1
8,Canadian healthcare,unknown,support,"another question: should government employees receive free health care. not politicians, but teachers, police officers, firemen, people in the military. they are already underpaid. i think they deserve a break",1,9,topic_stance_votes_1
9,Canadian healthcare,unknown,support,Hmm... I think we should stick with the income level instead of giving all government employees healthcare that they may not need.,1,10,topic_stance_votes_1
10,Canadian healthcare,unknown,support,"but teachers, law enforcement officers, firemen, and people in the military are very very underpaid. the least we can do is provide them the opportunity to have free health care. you even said you would never be a teacher solely because the pay sucks.",1,11,topic_stance_votes_1
11,Canadian healthcare,unknown,support,"I said the pay is bad and I couldn't deal with today's children. Inserting words at me again... 
If they are so underpaid they don't need an exception... they'd already be at the right level, would they not?",1,12,topic_stance_votes_1
12,Canadian healthcare,unknown,support,"I have just spent 2 years in Canada and the health care sucks. But the reason is trivial: money.
How many of you know the correct answer to the following question:
Between Canada and the US, where does the government spend more on health care per capita?
If you think it is Canada, you are dead wrong. And of course the private spending in the US is much bigger.
The problem with the Canadian system is excessive cost control. This is because the politicians must keep taxes down - at any given election time, the majority of the voters are healthy.
While no one likes high taxes, the US experience shows that people also hate cost control in health care. That is why we have - through legislation and litigation - crippled the HMOs' ability to control costs and we once again have a double-digit inflation in health care costs.
But the truth is, the American 15% of GDP is probably closer to what an affluent society desires to spend on health care than Canada's 9%.",12,13,topic_stance_votes_1
13,Canadian healthcare,unknown,support,"The health care system in Canada has undergone a dramatic change in the past ten years.
The conservative (relatively for Canada, US ""conservatives"" are our ""fascists"") governments have been cutting away at Health Care in a blatant attempt to destroy the system.
Canadians love having public health care. In order to try to sway people into accepting some degree of privatization, the politicians make Health budgets which are completely impossible- because of pressure from huge US medical insurance companies.",13,14,topic_stance_votes_1
