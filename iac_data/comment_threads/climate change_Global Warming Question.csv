0,Global Warming Question,climate change,support,"This article, from the Daily Telegraph, states that data from the ""Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia"" shows ""that for the years 1998-2005 global average temperature did not increase (there was actually a slight decrease, though not at a rate that differs significantly from zero).""
Does anyone know anything about this university (i.e. is it reputable in this area of science)? Also, any thoughts on the author and his interpretation of this data (if the data is reliable that is).",0,1,topic_stance_votes_1

2,Global Warming Question,climate change,attack,"The Daily Telegraph is in the pocket of big business interests, it's about as trustworthy on this as Exxon Mobil's PR department.
UEA is a respectable university, however, and the latest press release from their website seems to contradict what the torygraph is saying:
http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/press/2006-02-hotspots/
I can also quote from the information sheets on the website of the unit:
""The year 2005 was the second warmest on record, exceeded by 1998""
So, in other words, the torygraph is manipulating statistics and talking out of their collective arses. They chose the two warmest years on record and tried to make something out of the fact that the warmest was before the second warmest.",2,3,topic_stance_votes_1

Bob Carter, the guy who wrote your editorial, is either a fool or not above lying to make a point. The world is clearly getting hotter, all the data supports this. It's not like we're talking rocket science here. All this takes is reading a thermometer and writing down the results, which is a task that people have mastered for quite some time now.

7,Global Warming Question,climate change,attack,"Hey im new and this is actually my first post, as side from the intro one I gave. 
Anyways, I believe Global Warming is a crock. But I would like to say temperature readings are actually increasing in some areas! Wait a min that sounds like I was contradicting myself... Well let me elaborate. Allot of the temperature readings are taken at places like airports, which have allot of concrete and heavy machinery around. Those two factors alone cause a huge rise in temperature, which will distort these readings. In order to get accurate readings temperatures must be taken by other means, like weather balloons. 
Hey you guys want to know something amazing? The weather balloons that they use for this purpose show a very low rise in temperature if any.
Therefore we can only conclude that the earth is not getting warmer at an alarming rate. 
And even if it was... So what! I mean really do you think that we are the cause of it? I doubt it. Friends, the earth is not, by any means as weak as some people would have you believe. It can take our cars and anything else we throw at it.
Umm... this is interesting. My dad just came in and told me about an article that was aired on Toronto's CFRB radio station. The article said that when we go out and burn a quart of wood for a fire we actually put so much pollution into the air that a SUV would have to drive around the world a couple of times in order to even compare!!! can you imagine if there was ever a forest fire!!! man the world would pretty much just XXXX up! Again people, the Earth can take it. 
Also, here’s another interesting fact, when a volcano explodes it produces more pollution then all of the cars ever produced. I mean EVER, from the days of Nicolas Cugnot in 1769 to now.
Also in relation to rising water levels. Reality states that unfortunately there are rising water levels.... However, there are descending water levels! And they pretty much balance each other out. there’s places like Tonga have risen 29.1% over a 65 month period, but places like Tuvalu have decreased 34.3% over a 62 month period. 
But you see people the problem is that environmentalist wackos would have you believe other wise. My point is, we know very little about what’s going on, and our elected officials are attempting to create half fast solutions to a situation that may very well be false problem, i.e. Kyoto. (Remember im from Canada, God bless America!) These attempts are just to make them self’s look appealing at election time. Why does this make them look good? Because people believe the environmentalist wackos and they're outrageous clams, so the government thinks it has to throw money at a made up disaster. 
Also the facts and our scientist even dissociate them self’s from this man made global warming myth and look more to natural fluctuation. 
Therefore if you’re going to point to point a finger, pointed it at Mother Nature. But on the other hand she probably knows what she’s doing so why point a finger at all?

8,Global Warming Question,climate change,attack,Not really. Global warming is a fact. The only question is whether we are a significant contributor to it at this time. Btw cars are only part of the problem. Electrical generation 24/7 with fossil fuels is a big concern.,8,9,topic_stance_votes_1

25,Global Warming Question,climate change,support,"this is an interesting ariticle.
""Shaidurov explained how changes in the amount of ice crystals at high altitude could damage the layer of thin, high altitude clouds found in the mesosphere that reduce the amount of warming solar radiation reaching the earth's surface.
the most potent greenhouse gas is water, explains Shaidurov and it is this compound on which his study focuses. According to Shaidurov, only small changes in the atmospheric levels of water, in the form of vapour and ice crystals can contribute to significant changes to the temperature of the earth's surface, which far outweighs the effects of carbon dioxide and other gases released by human activities. Just a rise of 1% of water vapour could raise the global average temperature of Earth's surface more then 4 degrees Celsius.""

27,Global Warming Question,climate change,attack,"http://www.fraserinstitute.ca/shared...sNav=pb&id=237
It doesn't matter what the increase in carbon dioxide is because it has little effect. The big contributor to a rise in temperature is water vapor, which we have no control over. Because the atmosphere is mostly made up of water vapor if you were to increase its amount by even 1% you would get a temperature change of 4 degrees Celsius, thats almost a 10 degree fahrenheit change for my friends down South.

34,Global Warming Question,climate change,attack,"Didn't we have a Ice Age at least once wherein glaciers formed far south of where they are now? I suspect things have warmed up quite a bit since then.
According to one seemingly valid source, the earth has had four periods of Glaciations in which ice covered vaste amounts of what are now occupied areas. That means global warming was followed by global cooling, then again by global warming and cooling. The last Ice Age was some 18,000 years ago.

That meteor theory is just one explanation. Jim’s four periods of Glaciations is another. By reading and understanding these other Theories can we only get to the truth.

As to the cause, I suspect we are somewhat at fault. However, I also believe it is a naturally occuring thing that we are simply speeding up.
