0,How do Atheists account for the Laws of Logic?,existence of God,support,"How do atheists account for the laws of logic in a universe without God? The Laws of logic are conceptual by nature and absolute. Being absolute they transcend space and time. They are not the properties of the physical universe (since they are conceptual) or of people (since people contradict each other, which would mean they weren't absolute). So, how do they account for them?
Examples of logical absolutes are: something cannot be itself and not itself at the same time (Law of non contradiction). A thing is what it is (Law of identity). A statement is either true or false (Law of excluded middle). These are simple, absolute logical absolutes.
How can absolute, conceptual, abstract laws be derived from a universe of matter, energy and motion? 
In other words, how can an atheist with a naturalistic presupposition account for the existence of logical absolutes when logical absolutes are conceptual by nature and not physical, energy, or motion?",0,1,topic_stance_votes_2

you are confusing the mind with the universe. Define what ""common sense"" is; common sence is subjective, not absolute. If the laws of logic come from experences of nature, then they can change because peoples experences change. Sticking your hand in the fire in not logic. The laws of logic are not actions. They are statements about conceptual patterns of thought. Though one could say that a law of physics (i.e., the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence) is a statement which is conceptual, it is a statement that describes actual physical and observable behavior. But, logical absolutes are not observable and do not describe behavior or actions of things since they reside completely in the mind. 
We do not observe the laws of logic occurring in matter. You don't watch an object NOT bring itself into existence if it doesn't exist. Therefore, no law of logic can be observed by watching nothing. 
We discover laws of physics by observing and analyzing the behavior of things around us. The laws of logic are not the result of observable behavior of object or actions. 
For example, we do not see in nature that something is both itself and not itself at the same time. 
Why? Because we can only observe a phenomena that exists, not one that does not exist. If something is not itself, then it doesn't exist. How then can the property of that non-existent thing be observed? It cannot. 
Therefore, we are not discovering a law of logic by observation, but by thought. 
Or, where do we observe in nature that something cannot bring itself into existence if it does not already exist? 
You cannot make an observation about how something does not occur if it does not exist. You would be, in essence, observing nothing at all and how can any laws of logic be applied to or derived from observing nothing at all? 
i dont get it, he can say he is someone else but that does not mean that he is someone else, again law of logic are conceptual.
The laws of logic are not dependent upon different peoples minds since people are different. Therefore, they cannot be based on human thinking since human thinking is often contradictory.",2,3,topic_stance_votes_2

Putting your hand in the fire has everything to do with nerves not logic; saying that A then B does not follow because someone could tie your hand (I know people that will burn themselves) in a fire and then A would not equal B, however the laws of logic cannot be violated. 
Logic cannot come from experience because people's experiences change and are different which means that the laws of logic could change. Logic does not come from your mother's teaching because not everyone has a mother and mothers think differently. 
Again, if the laws of logic are human constructs then how can they be absolute since humans think differently and often contradictorily.

from infidels.org - 
The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines logic as ""the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference."" Logic will let you analyze an argument or a piece of reasoning, and work out whether it is likely to be correct or not.
It's worth mentioning a couple of things which logic is not.
Firstly, logical reasoning is not an absolute law which governs the universe. Many times in the past, people have concluded that because something is logically impossible (given the science of the day), it must be impossible, period.

you are very right that logic is predictable and constant. this is exactly why logic diametrically opposes god. a body of water cannot divide itself and leave a dry path down the center unless god something to defy logical law. because gravity exists, its logical for water or any fluid to be drawn by gravity to the lowest level possible. there is nothing miraculous about the common and predictable properties of water under the force of gravity, so god isnt needed to explain it because logic already has

Then in the next paragraph you state that logic is outside of the material universe and only a concept. This is where you lose me. Would 2+2=4 if there was no material entity to add or subtract? ie 0+0=0? Do you not first need to have the material in order for there to be a basis for the logic? Chicken and the egg perhaps.

Can God make a rock so big He can't pick it up? 
This question is representative of the type of paradoxes atheists use in attempts to prove that God cannot exist. It works like this. God is supposed to be omnipotent. If He is omnipotent, then He can create a rock so big that He can't pick it up. If He cannot make a rock like this, then He is not omnipotent. If He can make a rock so big He can't pick it up, then He isn't omnipotent either. Either way demonstrates that God cannot do something. Therefore God is not omnipotent. Therefore God does not exist. 
Is this logical? A little. However, the problem is that this bit of logic omits some crucial information, therefore, it's conclusion is inaccurate.
What the above ""paradox"" lacks is vital information concerning God's nature. His omnipotence is not something independent of His nature. It is part of His nature. God has a nature and His attributes operate within that nature, as does anything and everything else. 
For example, I have human nature. I can run. But, I cannot outrun a lion. My nature simply does not permit it. My ability to run is connected to my nature and I cannot violate it. So too with God. His omnipotence is connected to His nature since being omnipotent is part of what He is. Omnipotence, then, must be consistent with what He is and not with what He is not since His omnipotence is not an entity to itself. Therefore, God can only do those things that are consistent with His nature. He cannot lie because it is against His nature to do so. Not being able to lie does not mean He is not God or that He is not all powerful. Also, He cannot cease to be God. Since He is in all places at all times, if He stopped existing then He wouldn't be in all places at all time. Therefore, He cannot cease to exist without violating His own nature. 
The point is that God cannot do something that is a violation of His own existence and nature. Therefore, He cannot make a rock so big he can't pick up, or make something bigger than Himself, etc. But, not being able to do this does not mean He is not God nor that He is not omnipotent. Omnipotence is not the ability to do anything conceivable, but the ability to do anything consistent with His nature and consistent with His desire within the realm of His unlimited and universal power which we do not possess. This does not mean He can violate His own nature. If He did something inconsistent with His nature, then He would be self contradictory. If God were self contradictory, He would not be true. Likewise, if He did something that violated his nature, like make a rock so big He can't pick it up, He would also not be true since that would be a self contradiction. Since truth is not self contradictory, as neither is God, if He were not true, then He would not be God. But God is true and not self contradictory, therefore, God cannot do something that violates His own nature.
Another way to look at it is realize that in order for God to make something so big He couldn't pick it up, He would have to make a rock bigger than Himself. Since He is infinite in size, He would have to make something that would be bigger than Himself. Since it is His nature to be the biggest thing in existence because He created all things, He cannot violate His own nature by making a rock that is larger than He. 
Also, since a rock, by definition, is not infinitely big, then it isn't logically possible to make a rock, something that is finite in size, be infinite in size (no longer a rock) since only God is infinite in size. At dictionary.com, a rock is defined as a ""Relatively hard, naturally formed mineral or petrified matter; stone. a) A relatively small piece or fragment of such material. b) A relatively large body of such material, as a cliff or peak. c) A naturally formed aggregate of mineral matter constituting a significant part of the earth's crust."" A rock, by definition is not infinitely large. So, to say that the rock must be so big that God cannot pick it up is to say that the rock is no longer a rock. 
What the critics are asking is that God become self contradictory as a proof He doesn't exist. Their assertion is illogical from the start. So what they are doing is trying to get God to be illogical. They want to use illogic to prove God doesn't exist instead of logic. It doesn't work and the ""paradox"" is self-refuting and invalid.",33,36,topic_stance_votes_2

consider this statement: touching a hot pot will burn me
i know that a hot pot will burn me because i've consistently been burned by hot pots when i touch them. this is personal experience and the first level of proof. 
expanding on this, we know that fire converts propane gas (in the stove) from chemical energy to thermal energy. we also know that thermal energy is conducted through and temporarily stored in metal objects, such as a pot. and we know that our nervous system has sensors in our fingertips that detect temperature and causes us to feel a painful sensation when it detects something very hot. so touching a hot pot will burn me. this is scientific evidence and the second level of proof
either level of proof is enough to consider the statement to be true. when we mentally affirm a statement we consider to be true, we ""know"" that it is true
ill answer your follow up question right away. 'knowing"" something by faith is different from ""knowing"" something by evidence, in that it is the opposite. faith is considering a statement to be true at the lack of evidence or in the face of contradictory evidence. i may ""know"" that a hot pot will burn me because i have been told, but havent proven this myself. this ""knowledge"" is based on faith, and continues to be based on faith until i have evidence that this is true. as time goes on and i experience being burnt by pots or understand the mechanics of being burnt by hot pots, i no longer rely on the faith i had in being told, because i have enough evidence to know that it is true for myself
an atheist ""knows"" things through evidence. specifically concerning things of god and the supernatural, there is simply no evidence of a consistent and reliable condition.

The fact that there are 
1) Things which are so complex that we do not yet understand them
2) Abstract concepts which cannot be quantified
3) Laws of logic which exist independent of us
are all intriguing subjects worth talking about, but no matter how many billions of arguments I hear on the subject, not one comes anywhere near convincing me that the only explanation is that God must exist in order for these perplexing aspects of existence to exist.
The opening post:
OK, I agree that the ""laws of logic"" themselves are conceptual by nature. However the rest of this statement is flawed. The laws of logic that we are aware of are concepts which we have noted as we have become more aware of the way in which the universe works.
Even though these logical truths would exist independently of us, they would not exist independently of the universe. 
While they are not properties of the physical universe, they are properties of the interactions and possibilities which take place within the universe. They do not have to come from anywhere. They exist as a result of the existence of the universe and its physical configuration, not as a result of the existence of God.
Both of your examples are simply the product of the fact that on a macroscopic scale, we live in a highly ordered universe where matter and energy ebb and flow in predictable patterns. Objects and phenomena in our universe obey four basic forces which give rise to all physical interactions, and can be measured and tested, hence cannot be more than one thing at once, and can be shown to have happened or not to have happened. One does not need God at this point in the argument.
(On the quantum scale however, neither of these statements describe experimental data satisfactorily.)
Absolute, conceptual, abstract laws are derived from the universe of matter, energy and motion through the working of the human mind.
Before human minds existed, 2 mountains and two mountains were still 4 mountains, planets followed their orbits, entropy increased. The universe does not need God to tell it how to work, it does it on its own as a result of its own configuration.
These abstract logical concepts existed before us, but it is us who has termed them ""abstract concepts"", otherwise they are just The Way Things Work.
My comparison to other ""big questions"" was relevant to all this because it is a common phenomenon for people to attribute things we do not fully comprehend to the existence of the Divine.

Truth is relative? Changes from person to person? 
carm makes a good point about this:
""There is no proof that God exists""
To say ""there is no proof for God's existence,"" is illogical because an atheist cannot know all things by which he could state that there is no proof. He can only say he has not yet seen a convincing proof; after all, there may be one he hasn't yet seen. 
Your presupposition is that science has no evidence for God, but that is only an opinion. 
Science looks at natural phenomena through measuring, weighing, seeing, etc. God, by definition, is not limited to the universe. Therefore, it would not be expected that physical detection of God would be found. 
how do you know that the laws of logic exists? did you experence the ""law of non-contradiction ""? tested it for awhile? the atheist knows things through evidence. Show me the law of non-controdiction?",102,128,topic_stance_votes_2
128,How do Atheists account for the Laws of Logic?,existence of God,attack,"""There is no proof that God exists"" is quite accurate. Only the deepest philosophy will come to the point of seriously debating the fault in the statement, which is that as we are posessed of imperfect knowledge we cannot deny the possibility that some as yet undiscovered proof of god might exist. In this case, we'd modify the statement to ""There is no known proof that God exists."" However, in the context, what you are doing is not deep philosophy, but nitpicking.
As for the laws of logic, once more I shall try to explain from another angle: logic, mathematics and similar are ways in which we describe the universe. Take an apple. Take another apple. Now you have two apples, but you don't actually have two of the same things. You just recognize that apples are similar one to another and that it is reasonable to invent the nonexistent context of an abstract apple.
While this may be somewhat unclear, it is clarified if you take an apple and a pear. You now have two fruits. However, you will notice that there is no fruit in reality, only apples, pears, peaches and so on. Fruit is an abstract concept. That abstract concept exists only as a set of criteria within our minds. Even so, these concepts are not universal, which is immediately obvious once you notice the various things people consider fruit even though they fail to meet some criteria, thus showing their non-universality.
This is how abstract concept can ""exist"" in our minds, without having an existence of their own. And these concepts are something we invented. Until you are introduced to one, you don't have knowledge of them. For example, you have no knowledge of the concept of ""hofflenosh"", which is what this thread is all about, but it is still an abstract concept.
As for science and God, you do have a point, but you are also misrepresenting that point. Science is about studying the natural world, if you define it as the world that we can in some way observe, that has some effect on us. While this does mean that science cannot study that which may exist without affecting our reality, it must also be noted that it is not possible to study anything that has absolutely no effect on us by any means, not even logic and philosophy.
Also, while the purely philosophical argument does hold water, making the position of agnosticism theoretically more accurate than either atheism or religion, one must realize the limits of what this argument means.
First, it does not prove the existence of god.
Second, it does not extend very far when it comes to real life. Religion is not just about philosophical debate, it also makes several demands of real life. Observance of rituals, setting up taboos, establishing morality and similar. In order to accapt these, however, one must be able to substantiate them with arguments based upon reality.
Here, we get into different waters. The arguments proposed by the religious often lack a suitable amount of rational support. In the case of those that don't, science can often offer alternative explanations that turn out to be better supported and more likely. In the case of these arguments, atheism is actually a valid position.
And, just in case:
""I declare that I know the existence of an entity of a higher order, beyond the ken of mortals, and that this entity demands that we cease existing immediately, for which it offers to reward us with an eternity of blissful nonexistence. If we do not comply, it threatens to utterly destroy us all.""

“Fruit” is a name we give to identify a physical object; the laws of logic are not physical.
When you say “fruit” exists you can show its existence in the physical world. If the laws of logic exist, then show me. For one thing, atheism cannot account for a universal concept that is not material, and does not depend on our thinking. In addition to that, I am using the same argument atheist’s use against the existence of God to get the atheist to show me the existence of the laws of logic. Atheists say, “Show me God” I cannot see him. Theist describe that the universe cannot exist without God by showing the affects of God in the material universal (design) Show me the laws of logic, where is it? I cannot see it. Using apples is describing it is not the law itself. Just like I describe the evidence of Gods existence.
The laws or logic are not universal? Again, you are using matter to show something that is non-material, I can look at fruit until I am blue in the face but that only describes concepts, it is not the laws of logic itself. 
How can they? If they exist in the mind and not on there own, then I can chose not do think about or believe in these laws (Bivalency, Involution, Idempotency,Identity, (Non-)Contradiction, Excluded Middle, Contraction, Commutatively, DeMorgan's, Associatively, Distributivity) and they stop existing? Or I could say, ""hofflenosh"" is a concept I think is stupid and does not exist, come to think of it, the law of excluded middle is a stupid concept so it does not exist either. If is existed only in the mined, it would not be absolute. It would be your opinion of the law of logic existing against someone that says they do not exist. 
So before ""we invented"" the laws of logic they did not exist?
Something could be itself and not itself at the same time, before ""we invented"" the law of non-contradiction?
Just because we do not know the laws of logic does not mean they do not exist. I could debate someone and violate the laws of logic and claim I don’t have any knowledge of them and therefore they don’t exist for me.
Attacking the person again, not the argument, I guess atheists can make logical fallacies because it’s a concept that they can choose to not exist like the concept of “hofflenosh”
Hmmm, you cannot study the laws of logic. That’s like saying we cannot study math because it as no effect on us. Try violating the law of non-contradiction in a test you take. Say to person that is giving the test, “The wrong answer can be the right answer at the same time sir, because the law of non-contradiction has no effect and does not exist for me, beside its impossible it study the laws of logic or anything abstract like this test.” 
I can see why people would be drawn to atheism, wow, ""eternity of blissful non-existence” (“blissful” you can enjoy non-existence?) as an atheist it does not matter what you do, life has no meaning, we are atoms banging around at random, you live—you die—you stink—and then you’re extinct. Do whatever you want, rape, murder, or be the next Hitler.

What I said was that a chess computers uses what are essentially concepts. And they do, as I explained. 
What they move around to analyze a chess position is not actual, physical chess pieces that can be seen and touched, but rather logical representations of them that are manipulated by their information processing circuitry. For example, a white king might be logically represented as a 32-bit binary string similar to 10101010010101110101011110100100. That’s not a physical king that you can pick up and move on your chess board: it doesn't have the same mass, height, volume, color, or other physical properties as an actual, physical white king. It is a logical representation of a particular chess piece. 
Similarly, a white king in our brain is represented by a particular pattern of brain activation: a specific set of neurons fire when we see or recall a white king. There is no actual physical chess piece inside our brain, but rather a logical representation of it. That representation does not have the same mass, height, volume, color, or other physical properties of the actual object it stand in for.
And when a stream of photons bouncing off of an apple strikes our retinas, electrical signals are sent to our brain, which then interprets them as representing an apple according to preexisting images stored in our memory.

logic is consistent and reliable. it cant be rigorously tested and conditioned, and still always produce predictable results. take a look at this: 4, 7, 10, 13... the numbers in this sequence follow a pattern. they increase by 3. our sensory perception and our familiarity with addition helps us determine this. if asked for the 5th number in the sequence, you might say 16, but someone that didnt catch the pattern might say something else. since this is subjective, it may vary from person to person depending on their level of math proficiency. now watch this: 3x + 1. this is a formula to the sequence above. however, if asked to calculate the solution when x=5, then there is no sensory perception involved. you simply apply the substitution and get 16. applying this formula does not require perception or subjective perspective. hence it is 100% reliable and predictable
faith, unfortunately, does not work this way. there is nothing reliable and predictable about applying faith. for example, the bible says ""children obey your parents in the lord, so that it may be well with you and you will live long on the earth"". applying this ""formula"" does not produce reliable and predictable results. obedient children sometimes die young, and disobedient rebelious children sometimes grow to old age. not only that, but the clause ""in the lord"" creates a complication, since what is ""in the lord"" as far as parenting goes varies from church to church in various degrees. because no definite corelation between being obedient to your parents ""in the lord"", and long life, can be established, the ""formula"" is inconsistent and unpredictable and is discarded as false.

If something is conceptual, that by definition means it was conceived by the human mind. That's what a concept is. I think that simply ends the discussion. Concepts are of human construction and thinking. Logical constructs are absolute only to the extent that they were designed that way.

Assume God is required to have 'created' logic (along with everything else). Now imagine there is no God. Without him, according to our assumptions, there is certainly nothing - yet our derivation of that certainty presupposes the validity of logic. With no god to create logic, we cannot exclude the possibility of the universe existing. If the universe can exist without god...
:)
Then there's the part about god's 'own nature'. If god cannot violate his own nature, that implies a form of logic to which he is beholden, and which he therefore did not choose. If one form of logic can exist beyond god, so can ours.
:)
What else...
Oh yes: 1+1 = 2, and its binary and unary equivalents 1+1 = 10 and 1+1 = 11. These expressions operate according to the axioms of a mathematical space - axioms we define. They model our perception of reality; they are not in themselves real.
On no level is the equation 1+1 = 2 expressed outside of human consciousness. A rock with another rock next to it is precisely that; they and everything else in the universe represents a single configuration of matter. Before they can be called ""two rocks"" you need an intelligence capable of conceptually partitioning reality and categorising its perceptions. However, the absence of such an intelligence would in no way impede the rocks' (or the universe's) behaviour as a configuration of matter. Ergo, counting is a human invention.
Finally:
The logic we use to make statements about reality is derived from the way we observe material things behaving, and that logic is not immutable. Quantum physics demonstrates the fundamentally uncertain nature of reality at very tiny scales: the 'law of excluded middle' in particular taking it firmly in the shorts. Given that logic can vary on such a simple metric as physical scale, your argument is starting to look more than a bit frayed at the edges :)",153,154,topic_stance_votes_1

157,How do Atheists account for the Laws of Logic?,existence of God,attack,"I have some news for you. The laws of logic existed before you came up with them. The laws of logic by defination are outside the meterial universe because they are concepts. The atheistic worldview cannot account for the laws of logic/absolutes becuse only the meterial universe exists.
But they did not exist before ANYONE came up with them did they. They are as you I think indicated conceptual. And of course the formal logic of say Aristotle is dependent on the law of the excluded middle which forces all logical operations to be two valued only. This law is subject to attack both from a physical direction (namely quantum mechanics) and on the basis of fuzzy set theory (essentialy a logic of continua). So its possible that some or all of the ""laws"" of logic are not valid! Or at least they may not be the only set of internally consistent logical propositions.
Now one might ask why are the ""laws of logic"" so self-evident to most humans. Well that one is fairly simple - those laws reflect the behavior of the physical world we live in. If our brains did not in effect synchronize with that world we would not have survived and reproduced. The world has molded us as it were by evolution to apply the relevant rules to a large degree. The fact that QM is counter-intuitive reflects the fact that our survival and reproduction was NOT dependent on being able to operate within that domain during our evolution.

160,How do Atheists account for the Laws of Logic?,existence of God,support,"I just have to add something to this debate.
I'm not sure on this ""the laws of logic existed before man thought them"" thing. Let us suppose that, purely philosophically, there is this ""law of logic"" that exists that we still have not discovered. Just because we have not yet discovered it does not mean that it does not exist. On a side note, who is to say that it has not been discovered by some other creature (but let's not go there). There have been many truths, or laws of logic, that we have discovered as we developed, but this does not mean that we invented them. Much like gravity, it existed long before we thought, ""Oh, so that's what it is.""
But does all this mean that these laws/concepts/physical properties were created by some superior being?
There was also the argument that because people disagree, then laws of logic cannot be human constructs. This argument does not make sense. Humans are not particularly logical in their thinking, and some humans get things wrong. But this goes no way to either prove or disprove that the ""laws of logic"" are human constructs.
Abram's repeated assumption that atheists do not believe in things that they cannot touch/eat/hump/whatever is complete rubbish.
In fact, the initial assumption behind this whole thread is complete rubbish.
What is more illogical than to say, ""I do not understand this, so it must have been created by something for which I have no evidence""?
There was another branch a bit further back that brought up the question, ""Can God create a rock so big that he cannot lift it?""
If God is omnipotent, then the answer would have to be yes. But then, I here you cry, if he can't lift it, then he can't be omnipotent. To which my answer would be, ""Of course he can, but what makes you think that he is constrained by our extremely limited understanding of logic?""
Maybe there are absolute laws of logic out there, but we are still far too primative to understand them. I don't see how we can be so presumptuous to think that a concept does not exists yet simply because we have not thought of it. I do understand that a concept by definition has to be created by a mind, but as a concept, let's assume that there is a ""truth/concept"" out there that we have not yet thought of, conceptually speaking anyway.
But I also don't see the argument that if we have not yet thought of or understood something that it must have been created by maaaaaaagic.

If there is no 'matter', then there is nothingness, unless you decide that the nothingness does in fact hold energy, ergo your God. As matter and energy are syonymous, no matter means no energy therefore nothingness.
How therefore can you state unequivocally that logic exists in nothingness? How did you test this fact? If there is nothingness, then logic can't exist as it has no purpose. And one of it's purposes is to help sentient (and perhaps non-sentient) creatures relate to their environment.
If God is so all-encompassing, He doesn't need logic, therefore before the Creation, logic can't have existed in nothingness.
I don't think we are embued with logic - evidenced by some thick puddings we meet from time to time - but rather we learn and acquire logic and the skill to use it. It's a tool. If some wish to define it as a 'law' for the purpose of ascribing it a handle, so be it. But it's still a construct as an identifiable method of how we relate ourselves to our world.

Logic is the identification and conceptualization of reality as it exists. The laws of logic are derived from the way reality works. The ability to identify the rules maybe built into us but the logical concepts themselves are not. If humans did not exist then logic wouldn't exist either, but reality itself and all its constituent rules would remain unaffected. 
Your argument boils down to that God is the source of all reality and all its rules. Good luck convincing any atheist of that, especially given that there is no evidence. Since reality is the source of everything that exists, asking for the source of reality is like asking who made God. However, our position is stronger here because we have definite evidence that reality exists but there is no evidence that God does. Besides, a self-contradictory, whimsical God would negate the very idea of logic.
That's because reality, on which logic is based, is itself universal. 
Transcend what? Reality itself? You will have to give an example of that because I don't think that the concepts of logic would make any sense outside the context of reality. Take Dante's description of God for example and tell me if it makes any logical sense. 
His idea of aliens was probably a bad analogy. Take reality as we know it exists only in this universe, it might exist in a different way, with different rules in another one. Things such as law of non-contradiction might not be applicable there. Since the reality we live in forms our environment, it can be justifiably said that environment does determine the outcome of logical reasoning.
