The expense is in the endless appeals. When President Garfield was assassinated, his killer was caught, tried, sentenced, executed and buried within six weeks. Back in the fifies, it was a national scandal that Caryl Chessman spent ten whole years (!) on death row in California before his execution. Now, a prisoner can routinely expect to spend twenty years on death row before the case is finalized. Since most of these convicts are broke by the time they are sentenced, the taxpayers foot the bill for the defense + the prosecution + the incarceration. It's a consequence of our judicial branch morphing from a justice system to a legal system.",1,4,topic_stance_votes_1

5,Death sentence to expencive?,death penalty,attack,"For obvious reasons. Do you know the current rate of release? DNA is exonerateing about 1-2 death row inmates every month. 
The taxpayers, actually counties percisely pay for all of the procesution and often for the defense lawyer. Convicts usually don't pay for their own defenses unless they are very rich. There's no real way to get around that: unless you want to kill more innocent people. It's called due process.
So VOR, you would send a innocent man do die?
You do know that DNA tech as well as other technologies take time to develop. Usually more then two years. 
Would you condemn the 216 or so freed prisoners to death merely because their 2 years ran out before their DNA could be tested? 
Not to mention that every DNA lab in the US is backlogged, often for months or years. You would condemn a man merely because the process to prove he might just be innocent is jammed up?

In a way, I think maybe we are not so far apart here. I completely agree with your assessment of Dukakis, and the problem is not entirely with the courts.
I once closely followed the case of a fellow convicted for attempted murder in Washington state and I was shocked to learn that, once he was turned over to the state corrections system, the corrections system had total discretion over whether to keep him for the full term. The court sentence was a recommended maximum, for display purposes and public consumption only.
Crime control depends on a chain of police work (where scumbags are sometimes left on the street because they are also informers), courts (where attorneys and judges sometimes game the system with technicalities that do not serve the purpose of justice), and the corrections system (where officials are sometimes too far removed from the crime to make sound judgments).

108,Death sentence to expencive?,death penalty,support,"ABOUT THIS INNOCENCE PROJECT 
The Innocence Project at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law was created by Barry C. Scheck and Peter J. Neufeld in 1992. It was set up as and remains a non-profit legal clinic. This Project only handles cases where postconviction DNA testing of evidence can yield conclusive proof of innocence. As a clinic, students handle the case work while supervised by a team of attorneys and clinic staff.
Most of our clients are poor, forgotten, and have used up all of their legal avenues for relief. The hope they all have is that biological evidence from their cases still exists and can be subjected to DNA testing. All Innocence Project clients go through an extensive screening process to determine whether or not DNA testing of evidence could prove their claims of innocence. Thousands currently await our evaluation of their cases.
DNA testing has been a major factor in changing the criminal justice system. It has provided scientific proof that our system convicts and sentences innocent people -- and that wrongful convictions are not isolated or rare events. Most importantly, DNA testing has opened a window into wrongful convictions so that we may study the causes and propose remedies that may minimize the chances that more innocent people are convicted.
As forerunners in the field of wrongful convictions, the Innocence Project has grown to become much more than the ""court of last resort"" for inmates who have exhausted their appeals and their means. We are now helping to organize The Innocence Network, a group of law schools, journalism schools, and public defender offices across the country that assists inmates trying to prove their innocence whether or not the cases involve biological evidence which can be subjected to DNA testing. We consult with legislators and law enforcement officials on the state, local, and federal level, conduct research and training, produce scholarship, and propose a wide range of remedies to prevent wrongful convictions while continuing our work to free innocent inmates through the use of postconviction DNA testing.
We hope that this site will raise awareness and concern about the failings of our criminal justice system. It is a facet of our society that eventually touches all of its citizens. The prospect of innocents languishing in jail or, worse, being put to death for crimes that they did not commit should be intolerable to every American, regardless of race, politics, sex, origin, or creed.

111,Death sentence to expencive?,death penalty,support,"Kirk Bloodsworth was convicted in March of 1985 for the brutal killing and sexual assault of a nine year old girl. The victim was found dead in July of 1984. She had been strangled, raped, and beaten with a rock. Bloodsworth was arrested based on an anonymous call telling police that he was seen with the victim that day and an identification made by a witness from a police sketch that was based on the recollections of five eyewitnesses. At trial, all five witnesses testified that they had seen Bloodsworth with the victim. Also presented at trial was testimony that Bloodsworth had said that he had done something terrible that day that would affect his relationship with his wife. Additionally, he mentioned a bloody rock during the investigation. A shoe impression found near the victim matched his size.
This evidence was challenged in Bloodsworth's appeals, which asserted that the bloody rock was mentioned because the police showed him a rock during the interrogation. The incident he mentioned regarding his wife amounted to his failure to buy the food she had requested. Moreover, the police failed to inform the defense that there may have been another suspect. Bloodsworth's conviction was overturned by the appellate court and he was retried. This time, he was convicted and sentenced to two life terms, to run consecutively. 
In 1992, the prosecution agreed to DNA testing to be performed by Forensic Science Associates. The victim's shorts and underwear, a stick found at the scene, and an autopsy slide were compared against the blood standards of the victim and Bloodsworth. Using PCR based DNA testing, FSA determined that the amount of spermatozoa on the slide was insufficient for testing. Testing on the panties excluded Bloodsworth. Replicate testing performed by the FBI yielded the same results.
Bloodsworth was released from prison in June 1993 and pardoned in December 1993. He had spent over eight years in prison, two of those years facing execution.
Bloodsworth also became the first person to be exonerated from death row through postconviction DNA testing.
