0,God,unknown,support,"Everyone has a belief in something, even if it turns out that you don’t believe in anything. Then you BELIEVE in nothing, nothing is what you believe in, you cannot dispute that statement. Surely you can grasp that much? When you take a drink from a cup, you believe that there is a cup in your hand, only because you feel it there and you see it there, but those two sensations are the only forms of proof that you have that the cup exists and believe me that is just what they are, sensations. Your powers to believe beyond what is physical and visible are weak or none existent, so you don’t believe. Happy are those who believe yet have not seen.
Besides who started the universe and don't say it was the big bang because I'll say who started the big bang?
It makes more sense to say it was started by someone that has always existed, by someone that never started but always was.
Something can start from nothing??? I don't think so, but that is what you are saying when you say you don’t believe in God, and what sort of science is that you believe in? “The universe started from nothing”.
Now that is a silly concept!",0,1,topic_stance_votes_2
1,God,unknown,attack,"Let's see how you deal with me. 
Alright, all facts are actually beliefs. 
Why does it make more sense for something to originally exist? 
If the big bang needed a start, who started God?",1,2,topic_stance_votes_1

He has always existed.
He is the force that has always existed, the force that started the big bang. If I said such and such started God, then you would just ask who started such and such, God is the be all and end all.",2,6,topic_stance_votes_2
6,God,unknown,attack,"If you don't have a problem with God always existing, why do you have a problem with our universe always existing (even before the big bang, the universe still existed. It was just a immensly dense neutron star, which favored the big band, which in turn made the neutron star into something more similar to what we see today)?
If you think it's fair to ask, ""What's before the Big Bang?"" I think it's only fair I get to ask, ""What's before God?""",6,7,topic_stance_votes_1

Why have the added complication of assigning the attributes of these conditonis being an all knowing, all powerful entity?",6,9,topic_stance_votes_1
9,God,unknown,attack,"No, because God is a capable of exercising force, an ultra dense neutron star would need something to trigger it off into the universe. Whatever started this, has to have a conscience, since we have consciences, since a conscience cannot exist unless it has always existed some where.",7,10,topic_stance_votes_2
10,God,unknown,attack,"Jimmyjacks, then you have a contridiction. You attack the big bang as it has no origin yet you make a exception for God. You cannot do that without sacrificing the prinicipals of debate. 
That means your argument revolves around a double standard and such has no intention of proving anything. Your thread is merely a bashing one. 
Your attack is obviously based upon all things must have a origin. You hold what you attack to that standard, but you do not hold your own belief to it. Why would we bother with someone who isn't even going to consider evenly applying standards to both sides? 
What is more believable:
A being of uncomprehdable power existing forever without logical reason, or a single hydrogen atom popping into existance.
You are clearly out of your league.",6,11,topic_stance_votes_1
11,God,unknown,attack,Then your argument too is flawed by the same principals of debate.,11,12,topic_stance_votes_2
12,God,unknown,attack,"Because? The conventional big bang is just as unlikely as God. Therefore your claim is wrong. 
However the current believe mainly among physicists and astronomers is that there is no end and there is no beginning to the universe. Expansionary theories along with contractionary theories that are being observed have led many to believe that the current universe was born from the death of the last universe. There is no end and there is no beginning.
You are out of your league.",12,13,topic_stance_votes_1
13,God,unknown,attack,"Just as I said there is no beginning to God and there is no end.
He always was.",13,14,topic_stance_votes_2
14,God,unknown,attack,"Except you attack the big bang for lacking a origin. If you are going to apply the logic that the big bang is wrong because it has no origin, then you must apply it to God if you wish to appear as anything but a devious fool. 
I take it you concede your earlier claim about me is wrong?  
Furthermore, your argument is chidlish. Using such logic, and applying the true skeptic forumla, a belief in God is just as credible as a belief that you exist. You cannot prove neither. As such, claiming that God is real, or that it exists it foolish. Not to mention that you have directly violated the belief of God by limiting its power and therefore violating the notion of ominipotence.
You are way out of your league.",14,15,topic_stance_votes_1

16,God,unknown,attack,"And I believe that you're a smelly hobbit who goes by the name of Frodo Baggins.  
That's not the point, but your inability to address counter arguments as well as support your own does prove my claim that you are out of your league.
If you wish to continue avoiding your own argument and counter arguments, you're going to have a rough time here TOMHARRYBILL. Btw, being banned several times is a sign that you're not welcome here. ",16,17,topic_stance_votes_1
17,God,unknown,attack,"Not so, it is quite simple: I believe in the big bang, I also believe God started it, I believe because he has a conscience that he has the power to start it. Whereas your argument is that a dense star started it, its self! That is less believable by anyone’s logic, and is just plain stupid. So you are the one having a rough time since I have just smashed your argument and perspective to pieces.
Fool of a took!",17,18,topic_stance_votes_2
18,God,unknown,attack,"So I hear that the opium crop from Afghanistan just bloomed.  It appears you must have some from the last harvest.
A dense star? Please, show me where I said this. In fact, I don't recall even stating a star, much less as it as the origin. Oddly Trebor points out that you claimed it, not I. 
How did you even remotely deal with my argument? As I see it, you fabricated the star part. 
You failed to address the origin standard
You failed to address the skeptic problem
You failed to address your false claim about my argument
You failed to address how you violated the principals of a Diety

22,God,unknown,attack,"Let's see, Trebor just quoted you saying the star, not I. 
Please, I see no evidence that you addressed any of those points. 
Again, you do apply standards to the big bang you do not apply to God. How is it that you can have such low standards for your arguments but have such high standards for the opposition?

29,God,unknown,attack,"this may be the first problem you need to address. the big bang theory is even more tentative than that of evolution. there are other less popular but equally valid scientific explanations for thw beginning of the universe. in fact, the big bang event as you know it may very well be explained away or replaced with a more suitable theory, so how do you deal with that? a theory isnt valid because god fits into it, its valid because the evidence fits into it
other than that, there are a number of problems with god that are outstanding and unresolved. since this thread is titled 'god', maybe they can be addressed here.
1. god has no definition
2. god has no examples of manifestation
3. god has no recognizable form or features that could identify him if he were to show up
4. god has no consistency (comparing what is in the bible with reality)
5. god has no means of communicating to people in an unambiguous way
6. god has no appeal or interest to all humans (there are nations of people that god has never occured to)

So you deal with this first!",30,32,topic_stance_votes_2
32,God,unknown,attack,"Of course, that includes this 'God' thing. When describing 'how the universe' started senerio, people like you make a claim for 'God', and then claim 'god' was eternal. That creates the logical fallacy of 'special pleading' for god. 
And, of course, saying the universe started from nothing is a concept that is in error.. a singulartity is not nothing (for the classic inflatinary theory), nor is 
multidimentsional branes (as in the EKopyrotic theory). So, why don't you create a different strawman to try to chop down?",32,33,topic_stance_votes_1
33,God,unknown,attack,"the belief that the universe started from nothing is yours. this is not the belief of science. science never claims that the universe started from nothing, it says that they are not sure how the universe started.
not only that, but the claim ""god created the universe"" and ""the universe came from nothing"" are both the same. god is a made up entity (as you will soon demonstrate), an imaginary concept that does not exist. therefore the belief that the universe was created by god and that the universe was created by nothing are no different
anyway, like i said, science does not claim that the universe spontaneously popped out of nothing

37,God,unknown,attack,"The bold quotes of yours flow directly after one another, and are completely contradictory.
God didn't need to start.
Everything needs to start from something.
What I ask is - Why does the universe, and even time, need a 'start' at all? Can't it have simply always existed?
Furthermore, when looking for reasons for existance and creation, why turn to the bible? It is a factually innacurate and contradictory book which has very minimal outside verification.
I could write a story-book incorporating the events of 9/11, which could be independantly verified, and then go on to detail how the earth was created, and is secretly ruled by giant ants from outer space.
Both books contain skerricks of fact. Both books detail the creation of life. Both books are written by men. Both books have, as their basis, some completely ridiculous story with no proof, or even credible theories to support it.
So why would you dismiss my story-book out of hand, but literally take the bible as gospel?",1,38,topic_stance_votes_1
38,God,unknown,support,"Within our universe, so far as we can tell, all events require a prior cause. Since however, time is hypothesised to have started at the same point, or just prior to the expansion of our universe, nothing can have occurred ""prior"" to this point. It's therefore empty to say the universe ""started"" from nothing, since there was no ""nothing"" prior to the beginning of our universe, there is no such thing as prior to our universe. Perhaps this is where science ends, and we will simply never know what could have produced everything. Or maybe we will, or at least have some idea - after all, science has revealed many things to us we may previously have thought to be science fiction.",38,39,topic_stance_votes_1

Obviously it can't be taken to support a Christian God, but the belief in the need for some sort of creator to explain existence isn't that easily rejected.
Duo: you're accusation of 'special pleading' for God isn't really fair, as God is by definition not of the same nature as normal existing objects. God is seen as being beginingless in that he transcends time. If the universe has 'no beginning' in the more literal sense then we run into the problem that this means an infinite amount of time has passed, which is impossible. 
Personally, I think that trying to work out the roots of existence from rules within existence is more than likely impossible. There are 'scientific' speculations and 'religious' speculations, but I've never seen anything definitive from either side.",38,50,topic_stance_votes_2
