1,Why? Why Not?,gay marriage,attack,There are ideals in this world that are better left alone.....lines that should not be crossed. Marriage is an ideal that does not need changing; doing so is crossing that line in the sand that was drawn there for a reason.,1,2,topic_stance_votes_2

4,Why? Why Not?,gay marriage,support,"Well this evening was definitely interesting. 
Sorry I missed the conversations here, but I was doing something a bit more pro-active. 
My partner and I were members of a discussion pannel hosted by the ACLU on Marriage Equality.
One of our fellow pannel members was a Baptist minister; Rev. Dr. Larry Greenfield, Protestants for the Common Good. He brought up an interesting point, that marriage is indeed meant to protect the ""family."" But he then posed a question which had many of us thinking. ""What makes a family?"" ""Where in the Bible does it ever give anykind of 'ideal' for what makes a family?""
The answer: There isn't any. When seen in Biblical terms, family means any group of people (usually adults) commited to the wellfare and education of children. 
He then moved on to: ""What makes a marriage?"" 
He brought up another interesting point. The usage of the word ""marriage"" originally didn't specify gender at all. It simply meant two adults committed to a life together. Very simplistic.
Only recently has our Government decided to narrowly define marriage. That was with the signing of DOMA in 1996. Before then there were almost NO laws which specified gender when speaking of marriage. 
So in all actuality the whole concept of a marriage being between one man and one woman, is extremely new, in the sceme of things.",4,5,topic_stance_votes_1
5,Why? Why Not?,gay marriage,attack,"I beg to differ. If you read Mark 10:6-9, it explains that a man and woman are made for each other and if a man puts his wife away and marries another, it is adultry.

7,Why? Why Not?,gay marriage,attack,In that case divorce should be made illegal. When you get married you promise to stay with that person for the rest of your life. In fact you do so before the presence of God. Therefore divorce should not be allowed.,2,8,topic_stance_votes_1
8,Why? Why Not?,gay marriage,attack,No....that is incorrect. Divorce has been around for centuries and was used in biblical times when a woman or man cheated on their spouse. Same sex marriage has never received any good stamp of approval in civilized societies.,8,9,topic_stance_votes_2

Look, Alzheimers case. This is the part of your post I was referring to. I didn't say anything about your community family idea. While you are out doing pro-active stuff for the gay community, you might ought to leave the Bible out of it, because the Bible does not condone homosexuals. It is covered in Leviticus 20:13.
Very simplistic.",15,31,topic_stance_votes_2
31,Why? Why Not?,gay marriage,attack,"Zelma,
My dear child, please visit this site and read what it says about leviticus.
www.godmademegay.com
Oh wait I will just post it for you..
Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13
Revised Standard Version:
22 You shall not lie with a male as with a woman, it is an abomination.
13 If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall be put to death...
The King James and New International versions say virtually the same thing.
Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 are the only direct references to same-gender sex in the Old Testament. They are both part of the Old Testament Holiness Code, a religious, not a moral code; it later became the Jewish Purity Laws. [""Abomination"" is used throughout the Old Testament to designate sins that involve ethnic contamination or idolatry. The word relates to the failure to worship God or to worshiping a false god; it does not relate to morality.] Professor Soards tell us, ""Old Testament experts view the regulations of Leviticus as standards of holiness, directives for the formation of community life, aimed at establishing and maintaining a people's identity in relation to God.""B-4 This is because God was so determined that his people would not adopt the practices of the Baal worshipers in Canaan, and same-gender sex was part of Baal worship. (The laws say nothing about women engaging in same-gender sex; probably this had to do with man's dominance, and such acts by the subservient had nothing to do with religious impurity.)
God required purity for his worship. Anything pure was unadulterated, unmixed with anything else These Purity Laws prohibited mixing different threads in one garment, sowing a field with two kinds of seed, crossbreeding animals. A few years ago in Israel when an orthodox government came into power, McDonalds had to stop selling cheeseburgers. Hamburgers, OK. Cheese sandwiches, OK. But mixing milk and meat in one sandwich violated the Purity Laws--it had nothing to do with morality. These were laws about worshipping God, not ethics, and so have no bearing on our discussion of morality. Helmut Thielicke remarks on these passages: ""It would never occur to anyone to wrench these laws of cultic purification from their concrete situation and give them the kind of normative authority that the Decalogue, for example, has.""B-5
Another reason they are not pertinent to our discussion is that these laws were for the particular time and circumstances existing when they were given. If you planted a fruit tree, you could not eat its fruit until its fifth year, and all fruit the fourth year must be offered to the Lord. A worker must be paid his wage on the day of his labor. You must not harvest a field to its edge. We readily dismiss most of them as not applicable to our day and culture, and if we dismiss some of them for any reason, we have to dismiss all of them, including the sexual regulations, for that same reason.
When we add the fact that these laws were talking about heterosexuals, it makes three reasons, any one of which would be sufficient, why they have no bearing on questions about homosexuals or homosexuality or on the morality of same-gender sex by homosexuals today.",31,32,topic_stance_votes_1

41,Why? Why Not?,gay marriage,attack,"Actually that passage does not define a marriage. 
It just says that a man shouldn't divorce his wife.
It does say that in the beginning god made man and woman.
You can infer whatever you wish about that, but it doesn't explicitly say anything about a marriage being strictly between a man and a woman.
Besides, if current laws were actually rooted in the Bible, in this passage, then divorce would be illegal. But our laws are NOT rooted in the Bible, so the passage is irrelevant. 
I realize you were addressing a different point but I just had to respond.
Here is the whole context though:
I love how Jesus asks what Moses did and then tells them that Moses only did it because they were buttholes. :) 
So he didn't say that Moses had it wrong, but he didn't say that Moses had it right either.
