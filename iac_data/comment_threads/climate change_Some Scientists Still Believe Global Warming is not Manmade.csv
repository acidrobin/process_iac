""Dr. Shariv, a prolific researcher who has made a name for himself assessing the movements of two-billion-year-old meteorites, no longer accepts this logic, or subscribes to these views. He has recanted: ""Like many others, I was personally sure that CO2 is the bad culprit in the story of global warming. But after carefully digging into the evidence, I realized that things are far more complicated than the story sold to us by many climate scientists or the stories regurgitated by the media.
""In fact, there is much more than meets the eye.""
Dr. Shariv's digging led him to the surprising discovery that there is no concrete evidence -- only speculation -- that man-made greenhouse gases cause global warming. Even research from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change-- the United Nations agency that heads the worldwide effort to combat global warming -- is bereft of anything here inspiring confidence. In fact, according to the IPCC's own findings, man's role is so uncertain that there is a strong possibility that we have been cooling, not warming, the Earth. Unfortunately, our tools are too crude to reveal what man's effect has been in the past, let alone predict how much warming or cooling we might cause in the future.
All we have on which to pin the blame on greenhouse gases, says Dr. Shaviv, is ""incriminating circumstantial evidence,"" which explains why climate scientists speak in terms of finding ""evidence of fingerprints."" Circumstantial evidence might be a fine basis on which to justify reducing greenhouse gases, he adds, ""without other 'suspects.' "" However, Dr. Shaviv not only believes there are credible ""other suspects,"" he believes that at least one provides a superior explanation for the 20th century's warming.""
It has been claimed here that the ony scientists who disagree with global warming either have ties to oil companies or are not specifically climatologists (which shouldn't necessarily matter). 
Both the idea that they may have some tie to oil companies or that they aren't specifically climatologists, of course, are beside the point--what matters is their logical reasons and data they can point to. There are scientists on both sides of the issue of whether or not global warming is human-caused. It just so happens that those who fall on the side of human-caused global warming tend to be winning a huge PR thrust that's been going on for some time.
And before anyone thinks otherwise, I tend to fall on the side of global warming and that humans are at least contributing. But I can't go along with the idea some have that anyone who scientifcally challenges the global warming view of human-caused should be written off--pretty much automatically.",0,1,topic_stance_votes_1

3,Some Scientists Still Believe Global Warming is not Manmade,climate change,support,"I'm sorry, but is this really news? Shock! Horror! Hold the press! General public confused by large, complicated multifactoral systems.
I understand where this guy is coming from though, but not sure whether I agree with what he's doing, one of the huge drawbacks of modern democracy with the level of communications we have today is that most important decisions are made by people who don't really know anything about them. I don't doubt that climate behaviour is something that is far too complicated for anyone to totally understand and that to really get a grip on the subject you really need to dedicate some serious time to it. However just leaving every topic up to specialists brings a whole host of other problems with it.
Honestly I think the key to the problem lies more with the politicians, both sides (but particularly the right) will latch onto any bit of science that confirms what they want to believe and many won't even care whether or not it actually says what they want it to anyway. What you really want is some sort of sliding scale that adjusts the power of politicians based on how they use it - the more various studies and research is misrepresented, the more power is taken out of their hands, whilst if they are actually behaving like they should do they can have it back.
We're all working off ideals and systems of government that where devised when the best form of communication was a guy on a horse. Doesn't suprise for an instant that these systems might suddenly find themselves horribly flawed in these days of the mass market TV and internet. One of the critical issues today is man's impact on the changing environment and our fate is being governed by a group of people, half of whom are below average intellegence...

11,Some Scientists Still Believe Global Warming is not Manmade,climate change,support,"A few scientist who are controlled by democratic parties say that.
Yet data shows otherwise. These increases in temps, melting of polar caps, during humans industrial age and suddenly increasing at its climax isn't due to natural changes, you have to be blind to think so.
What made me laugh are a few non-caring individuals who attempted to use the Polar Vortex as an example, but failed to see a link. THe vortex itself has even slightly changed due to changes in flow aroudn the world, THe natural depletion increased from 5% to 8%.
However this is a strong natural accurance. In the opposite pole however, the much higher effect is not natural. Corporate greed will dispel it. They need to sell those fossil fuels. Ther are 4 scientific groups, both owned by corporations who distribute fossil fuels, their opimion is blinding the world further.
Ice that has exsisted for 126 million years has disapeared. Other ice cored and dated that is over 50 million years old is almost gone. Yes ice that is much newer is over it, but hte core samples have existed on this planet for so long, and durign the climax of emmisions has disapeared. Yet we have no affect on that?
Here is the thing. It's to late to fix it ourselves, and we have to deal with that. SLowing or stoppign it is possible. At that point mother earth will have to correct it herself. However we continue beign ignorant, humanity may not be in the equation at all.
Decreased forest, increased C02. SAying it isn't linked means greed is envolved or you are not capable of seeing the obvious answers. The majority of the INDEPENDENT scientist still agree, it is related to industry and man, and is a real issue.",1,12,topic_stance_votes_1
