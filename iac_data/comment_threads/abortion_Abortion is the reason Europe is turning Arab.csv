The liberals who see abortion as a normal, acceptable, right to choose abortion are aborting themselves into extinction.

I believe in Democracy too. The issue should have been brought up on referendum at the time the supreme court ruled on it. The supreme court is to enforce and interpret law, not create it.

Most well educated Muslims that I have met share their less-educated members views against US support of Israel and against the US incursion into Iraq - or at least against the way it was handled - but certainly do not think that the US is out to destroy Islam in totality. However, Muslims in general hold a wide range of views about the US - many quite extreme. Unfortunately, in the Middle East, the press is not truly free so people are far more open to trusting rumor and conspiracy theories. From what I am told, that helps feed the anti-American feelings. Essentially, though there have been actions we have taken which could justifiably be criticized by Muslims of the Middle East, many - particularly the extremists - vastly exaggerate and distort our actions to make us appear to have evil purposes - thus justifying their terrorist actions in their minds. I don't think there are too many things that we can say or do to prove them wrong - we have no credibility in the Middle East. That is why I continue to hope that moderate Muslims will be brave enough to speak out more.
The 66% number for people supporting the legality of first term abortions is from http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm - most of the way down the page. It comes from a CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll. Jan. 10-12, 2003. Surveying 1,002 adults nationwide - Margin of Error &#177; 3%. This is the most recent poll I know of which breaks up the question based on trimester. Last I heard, these organizations were not considered left wing. Indeed, I have heard many on the left consider CNN somewhat right wing. Anyway, you will also see that, in the poll, the majority of people view that second term abortions should be illegal, which goes against most pro-choice views. So, this is obviously not a left-wing biased result.
The constitutionality of an issue is not something that is decided by refurendum in this country. The constitution itself can be changed by popular vote electing representatives that can change it. As for the constitutionality of Roe vs Wade, you just happen to disagree with the decision so you call it ""creating laws"". I am sure you would not label court decisions in your favor as such. 
If Roe vs Wade were overturned, there would be no ""tearing our nation apart"" but it would certainly politically mobilize the silent majority of pro-choice supporters that now take those rights for granted as being guaranteed by Roe vs Wade. You would be waking up a sleeping giant.
On a last note, last year, I had a discussion on the Abortion forum with some Brits who said that, in Britain, once third trimester abortions were largely outlawed, a large part of the furvor died down regarding the abortion debate since there were few people who were adamant about pushing the law further. I hope that something similar happens here.",34,39,topic_stance_votes_2

2. Abortion is not mentioned in the constitution to my knowledge. 
Any ruling on it or any other issue not mentioned specifically is equivalent to creating laws. Therefore should be brought up on referendum or handled by the legislature.

43,Abortion is the reason Europe is turning Arab,abortion,attack,"That is why there is a 3% margin of error added. If the sample were truly random, then the science of statistics say that the margin of error is 1 / Sqrt (sample number ) = 3%. There is a legitimate point to be made that any type of survey on such issues is not 100% random since often those who will even answer surveys are those that have strong opinions to begin with (already a preselected portion of the population). Nevertheless, the fact is that the same poll (from the same specific group of polled people) said that they would outlaw second term abortions. This should show you how this is not a poll purposely skewed toward the pro-choice side, since the pro-choice side would have kept second trimester abortions also legal.
There are many things that are not specifically mentioned in the Constitution and that the Court has ruled on - in either direction (left or right). That is why the court exists in the first place - to interpret the Constitution for a given new situation. If the Constitution was clearly defined for all scenarios, then one would only need administrative clerks (or even only a computer nowadays) to make such a ruling - not well experienced and educated justices.
Most polls that I have seen (from pollingreport.com) show the pro-choice and pro-life side being close, but the pro-choice side slightly leading. However, the poll about first trimester abortions, and the situation that occurred in Britain, tell me that it is late term abortions which most concern people. That, along with my personal stance on abortion, is why I hope that we will have some reasonable law limiting third trimester abortions. That may finally put the issue mostly to rest. I think that is part of the reason why the right does not push for a law specifically outlawing third trimester abortions.

2. Then the court does not take it's job seriously enough. It should have created extremely tight parameters for the action of ending lives. Those parameters being only to save the endangered life of a mother who makes the choice or a consenting spouse or guardian if the mother is not capable. There is no other acceptable reason.

46,Abortion is the reason Europe is turning Arab,abortion,attack,"I agree with you that one's own opinions need not be directed by the majority opinion. On the occasions when I find my opinion not in the majority (or at least a large minority), then I do question whether there is something that I might be missing and look into the reasons why the majority hold their opinion and judge for myself based on those reasons. 
However, in a Democracy, we are ethically obligated to abide by the indirect decision of the majority (indirect since it is filtered by representatives, for better or worse), unless those decisions run counter to the Constitution. There are certainly majority decisions that I disagreed with but have to live with nonetheless. If one disagrees with the majority, then all one can do is to help contribute money or time toward convincing the majority of one's cause.
There is no other acceptable reason to you and those who think similarly to you on the pro-life side. Many, indeed most, others hold a range of more progressive views. The Constitution is not clear on the subject of when human rights start but there is enough language referring to ""birth"" that that seems to be the official starting point. Also, Abortion was legal during the start of our country. On the other hand, the right to privacy is one that is contentious since it is only spelled out indirectly in the Constitution. The bottom line is that I accept that the Constitution is open to interpretation when it comes to abortion rights. 
I agree that politicians of today often do not vote based on well developed reasons but based on political expediency - a continued source of disappointment. I think that there are various factors from both sides stopping direct legislation about third trimester abortion:
1. Many on the pro-choice side are afraid of the slippery-slope and would be extremely careful about any language in third trimester abortion restrictions that could be used to open the possibility of restrictions in first and second trimester.
2. The pro-life side might view a ruling only restricting third trimester abortions as an acceptance of that as the limiting point, which would not be acceptable to them, so they might try to force language into the restriction that would try to push open the gate to first and second trimester restrictions.
3. The pro-life side might recognize that, if third trimester restrictions were implemented, then a main motivating factor for pro-life momentum (i.e. the sympathy toward late term fetuses) would no longer be relevant since that part would be solved. There might not be enough sympathy toward first and even second term fetuses to sustain further progress.

The communist government seemed not to be significantly discouraging it. After communism fell and a new capitalism was introduced, then not only were contraceptives more easily available but the Catholic Church gained significant political influence and was able to essentially outlaw nearly all abortions. 
I cannot speak for other Eastern European countries, but some of the trends might have been similar.",60,62,topic_stance_votes_2

66,Abortion is the reason Europe is turning Arab,abortion,attack,"The reason we might be having 2.3 kids and Islamic countries is because women are given the right to choose abortion and have rights over their own bodies by law. In certain countries, women are overruled by law not to go out in public unattended, not to teach or have a job, and have no rights over their own body, but a man does. It's BS. 
The difference is, we are given a better sex ed than certain countries and that as women, it ISN'T our duty or only duty to be a baby machine. We are able to hold careers and be independent. (There are independent women within Arabic countries who are educated, who have careers of their own within these countries too, but they come from educated families and aren't as common place, perhaps.). I am not going to start having kids because of someone else's fear that we are being taken over by Islam. In fact there are many parallels between the fundamentalists there and the ones in the west. 
I, have been educated that I will have kids when I am damn well ready as a woman to take on that responsibility. That it is not my role, but my choice. No one else has the right to tell me what goes in and out of my body, but me. I think everyone deserves a right to choose their life.",45,67,topic_stance_votes_2
67,Abortion is the reason Europe is turning Arab,abortion,support,"The highest rate of unemployed in Europe is among Muslim immigrants. It’s not surprising. Because nowadays with their immigrant doles they find more comfortable rather doing nothing than working as labourers which those arrogant aliens conceder beneath their dignity or forbidden by their Allah. And that Allah is very strict guy. As soon as he sees that his subjects begin working hard he announces this activity abominable. But it is so tempting living in civilized country and stirring no finger for getting little money necessary for barely making ends meeting. As a result we have suburbs of our towns full of malcontent indigent Muslims prepared tore throat to every the least dressed properly European.
The only thing to do is toughening control over Muslims living in Europe. If they want staying here they have to obey our laws and stop being burden and spongers. If their religion forbids them European way of life they should change their religion or adopt moderate Islam worked out by Europeans for Europe.",67,68,topic_stance_votes_2

It is difficult to believe that anyone would prefer to live a subsistence lifestyle based on welfare(dole) if they could achieve more affluence with proper employment.

But it was right now that I got it at last. Those operations will take place not somewhere in a distant country but right here at territory of the US! I think that disgusting perspective we owe to our nutty officials unable to confine Muslims’ immigration to USA. Muslim newcomers are building new mosques and their communities are growing rapidly (partly due to rising figures of the native Americans converting into Islam).
I’m sure that our officials knew that most acts of terrorism occurred in USA are due to Muslim participation but in spite of it they are continuing to present all those shootings in broad daylight or explosions or other as just accidents caused by natural reasons! They hide the truth. In fact the guerilla warfare is being led by Muslims at the territory of USA and IMHO it’ll be on the rise in nearest future. I wonder why our top officials have been inactive and lying all the time! They’ve been preoccupied with Iraq and Afghanistan mainly and not caring about ordinary Americans personal safety!
