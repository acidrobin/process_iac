0,Proof that God is not all-powerful,existence of God,support,"By Reduction to the Absurd:
Suppose that God is in fact all-powerful. If he is all-powerful, then he can do anything. Yet this raises the question, ""If God can do anything, can he make a rock so hard that he himself cannot break it?""
If the answer is yes, then God cannot break this rock, so there is something he cannot do.
If the answer is no, then he cannot make such a rock, and thus there is also something he cannot do.
Therefore, it is impossible that God can do everything, and it is thus impossible for him to be all powerful.
I can't claim originality for this proof, but I have never heard any good refutation of it, and yet people still act as if God is all powerful despite the absurdity of such a notion. emoticonXBanghead If there is a refutation, then I'd like to hear it.",0,1,topic_stance_votes_1
1,Proof that God is not all-powerful,existence of God,support,"Well, the simplest refutation would be to say that God is omnipotent within the realms of logic. Everything that isn't inherently contradictory, God could do.
Another simple refutation would be to say that since God is beyond the physical realm, the logic of the physical realm doesn't apply to him. Perhaps he can create a rock so heavy he can't lift it, and yet still lift it. Our logic may simply not apply, the same way that Euclidean geometry doesn't apply in cruved space.",1,2,topic_stance_votes_1
2,Proof that God is not all-powerful,existence of God,attack,"That's because its sophistry. Its an inherent contradiction and it simply means we don't have the capacity to understand it. Another more common example is that the assertion that the universe cannot be endless, and yet as far as we know it is. Trying to understand it is for us humans like an ant trying to fathom the theory of relativity.
Damn are we ever conceited as a race...we seem to think that if we can't understand something, it cannot be. We also tend to think, in every generation, that we have achieved somehow the pinnacle of progress.",1,3,topic_stance_votes_2
3,Proof that God is not all-powerful,existence of God,attack,"The first refutation is not a refutation at all - it is a retreat. No longer is God all-poweful, but he is all-powerful within the realm of logic. That reminds me of the guy in Monty Python's Life of Brian who says ""Besides the sanitation, the education, the aqueduct, the public order, etc. what have the Romans ever done for us?""
The second refutation sounds like something Rousseau said, along the lines of ""I don't care about logic. I'll believe in God privately."" If one can claim that the power of God is beyond logic, but still true, then one can also claim that the powerlessness of God is beyond logic, but true. Similarily, I can claim that ""2+2=5"" is true by saying ""We humans are too simple-minded to understand it, therefore it must be true."" That's fallacious.",3,4,topic_stance_votes_1
4,Proof that God is not all-powerful,existence of God,support,"Fair enough.
You missed my point. Logic is simply a set of rules, which works for us here. There is no reason to believe that logic would work outside of this universe, however. It's not a matter of whether or not we can comprehend anything, it's just a matter of whether or not the same rules govern where God is. There's no way for us to know that they do, so it's quite possible that logic doesn't work there.",4,5,topic_stance_votes_1
5,Proof that God is not all-powerful,existence of God,attack,"This silly argument has been around for ages. It is gracious of you not to claim originality.
The argument is flawed in that it displaces the concept of universe and space. If you're going to confine us to human logic, you cannot dismiss these concepts.
If God built a rock so big he couldn't move it, it would be only because the rock had to be so big as to take up all available physical space in the universe and therefore not be movable at all...by any power whatsoever. There would be no place to which it could be moved.
But then, God could ""remove"" the rock by destroying it.
So the answer to your question is, ""Yes, God can make a rock so big that He can't move it. Then after He makes it, He can unmake it.""
Like I said, this is a silly argument often forwarded by those who doubt the power of God and continually quest for some disproval of His existence. You'll never succeed. I know it and God knows it. Not only is He omnipotent, He is omniscient.

6,Proof that God is not all-powerful,existence of God,support,"hey! i was gonna say the same thing jim just said, whadya know!
but basically, God cannot do the illogical, like create a round square, simply because it cannot be done. it is by nature illiogical for any rock to be unbreakable, no matter how hard it is. in fact, something as simple as adding 2+2 and getting 3 is impossible for God. that doesnt make him less omnipotent, just means that there are certain illogicalities that can never exist",6,7,topic_stance_votes_2
7,Proof that God is not all-powerful,existence of God,attack,"Yes this is absurd.
All things are subject to the Will of God the Creator. Nothing exists or can exist that is not subject to God's Will.

8,Proof that God is not all-powerful,existence of God,attack,"Unmaking it isn't moving it. And I didn't say ""Move a big rock"" I said ""Break a hard rock."" In half, that is.
What about this hypothetical rock? Can it exist?
Or, does this mean that God himself requires God's Will to exist? Cyclical! emoticonXBanghead",8,9,topic_stance_votes_1
9,Proof that God is not all-powerful,existence of God,attack,"No it can not exist without being subject to God's Will.
The only way the hypotehtical Rock could exist would be if God would deem to give the rock Free Will and then deem to honor the rock's Free Will as God honors Free Will -- the vast majority of the time -- within people.
This hypothetical is rather pedistrian.",9,10,topic_stance_votes_2
10,Proof that God is not all-powerful,existence of God,support,"an unbreakable rock cannot exist, simply because its illogical, not because of God's will. as long as something is classified as a rock, or any other solid for that matter, it can break. in the same way God cannot create a round square. 
then again, God can set limits on himself, in that he can create a situation that he himself cannot revoke. in a way it is similar to the hard rock question. for instance, God cannot undo his word. if he says something will happen, or never happen, then it can never be undone. according to genesis, one of the things God cannot do is destroy the earth by water. in this sense, here is something God cannot do. by God's own declarations he limits his possible actions. but it doesnt make him less than omnipotent. he still possesses the ABILITY to destroy the earth by global flood, but he cannot because he cannot lie, and for every declaration he makes, its one more thing he cannot do",10,11,topic_stance_votes_2

15,Proof that God is not all-powerful,existence of God,support,"a round square? how do you suppose that such a thing can exist? if God is all powerful, it simply means he can do anything that can be done. some things cannot be done. and not because it is too difficult a task, simply because it is illogical. 
can God exist and not exist at the same time?
because many people disagree or are not satisfied with this answer. you can never disprove (or prove) the existence of a incomprehendible (thats a word, right?) God. to accept that God cannot be comprehended makes you a theist or agnostic. for atheists, God should be comprehendible, and since he is not (i.e., a comprendible God does not exist), then they feel their view is right

And by definition power is ""ability or capacity to do something: the ability, skill, or capacity to do something"". This is the most relevant definition, it also has strength, political control, and other irrelevant definitions. So if one ability is taken away (lying), even if it is bad, he is less powerful.

This entire argument is inconsequential and fruitless. It has already been admitted there are things that God cannot do. It is also inconsequential that He cannot do those things. He's still the most powerful being in existence.

24,Proof that God is not all-powerful,existence of God,attack,"The question is illogical. By declaring the existence of an all powerful God then saying God cannot do something is not a comment on his powerfulness but rather the direct representation of his nature. Your question by its very statement does not test wether or not God is all powerful but wether or not God is comprehensible. See another thread for that topic.
The statement that God is all powerful defines his nature. To state then that he cannot do something outside of his nature as proof of the non existence of his nature is circular in logic.",1,25,topic_stance_votes_2
25,Proof that God is not all-powerful,existence of God,attack,"No, it tests whether he is all-powerful. The proof shows that the very notion of all-powerfulness leads to other notions that are absurd, such as the unbreakable rock or, someone else posted, the round square. This is called ""reduction to the absurd"" and it is a valid logical method. It has been used to prove that 1/0 is undefinable.
I stated that he cannot do something inside of his own nature, that is, his nature doubles back on itself and is contradictory. Similarly if someone spoke of something that is ""both green and not green at the same time and in the same sense"" I can disprove this statement using the Law of Non Contradiction.

30,Proof that God is not all-powerful,existence of God,attack,"I actually find your post here offensive.
But for the sake of argument here is the logic as you state it.
premise-God is all powerful
step toward conclusion - God can do anything
step two -God can create a rock he cannot lift -
Step three - God cannot lift the rock
conclusion - God is not all powerful
Problem with your logic is thus. Step two is not based on step one. It is a second premise. The fact that a being is all powerful precludes step two. Therefore, contradictory PREMISES. Therefore, fallacy of the inconsitency.
Perhaps he did guess. Perhaps he was right. Irrelevant. You argue vehemently for something that is CLEARLY illogical. The proof is in what you state. 
You do not simply reduce to the absurd. You use a logical fallacy. Reduction to the absurd is also, if you study it further, actually not reduction but inflation to the extreme and denies plausability of the premise and, well you get the point. 
The fallacy of inconsistency is very often used in political debates. It is the easiest hidden by making a premise look like a conclusion which is what that statement has done. You are not the first to post this argument, although undoubtedly, you thought you were. This has been argued almost as often as the statement that ""there are no absolutes"" a statement that is inconsistent in its very existency (being an absolute statement).

in the case of a rock so big God cannot lift it, the only concievable rock of that nature is a rock of infinite volume and mass. such a rock would use up all the space in the universe. since moving something means taking it from one place and putting it in another place, there would be no place that this rock would not be, and therefore no place to move the rock to. in such a case, we can say yes, God wouldn't be able to move this rock. if we want to be technical, then if God is powerful enough to create a rock of infinite volume and mass, then thats pretty dam powerful. even if he can't move such a rock, it would only be because its illogical to move a rock that takes up infinite space, not because God's ability is limited",47,52,topic_stance_votes_2

66,Proof that God is not all-powerful,existence of God,attack,"Hello Yang:
making a stone that one cannot lift is not illogical!
In the physical universe that we are in now, no. But as unkerpaulie pointed out in, I think it was post 60 of this thread, that an infinite rock (as far as mass, volume, radius, etc.) would take up all the space avaible (even assuming that the universe was infinitively large), so where do you propose God lift the rock from and where do you propose that he move the infinitely large rock to? You have not answered this fundamental question. Your objection (notice the word ""refutation"" is not used) to unkerpaulie's argument is as follows:
So a god who creates an infinite universe from nothingness cannot creates an infinite stone. the man who makes this kind of ""argument"" is either shameless, or mindless again, the crux is: can he lift this stone? 
Where in this have you replied to unkerpaulie's statement? The only thing that you do say is trying to destroy his/her reputation, i.e. ""shameless, or mindless."" It is ironic that you accuse others of being these, when you yourself may be committing these accusations (e.g. ""You distort, or purposely deny"" [parts of a persons post]) These words are not needed here. You are also, in the first statement are not getting what unkerpaulie is saying (or purposely ""distorting"" it ;). unkerpaulie said that God can create an infinite rock, but as he/she describes later, God cannot lift the rock into ""nothingness"". When God creates more space, than the rock is no longer infinitively large (by way of radius, mass, volume, etc.). 
The last part of the above statement refutes your statement:
again you words slap back on your face why doesn't god expand the universe so that the stone can be moved freely? like widening the doorway?  
If He creates more space, then the infinite rock cannot be infinitively large or heavy unless it was to also expand into the more space that God created - thus defeating the purpose of God creating more space. Your argument about ""expanding the universe"" does not stand up to reason (or logic) as the rock (infinitively large, heavy, etc.) would no longer be infinitively large (by way of mass, radius, etc.).
Getting back to the original question, can God create a rock that He cannot break - how did we get to God lifting an infinitively large rock when the topic is about God making a rock so hard that He cannot break it (i.e. unbreakable)?? As unkerpaulie stated in post 11 in this thread, i.e. an unbreakable rock is illogical because anything that is solid can be broken. Therefore, this whole objection to God being all powerful is flawed from the start.",66,67,topic_stance_votes_2
67,Proof that God is not all-powerful,existence of God,attack,"i guess not... he could choose to not break the rock, but it wouldnt be because he is unable to...
an unbreakable rock cannot exist. and no matter how hard God makes the rock, he can break it. a rock can only be as hard as possible, and even at that degree of hardness, it can still be broken. 
so i guess the answer is no, God cannot create a rock that he cannot break.",61,68,topic_stance_votes_2
68,Proof that God is not all-powerful,existence of God,attack,"An all-powerful God can create a stone of infinite size and mass that he cannot lift.
this is because lifting is a form of movement. in order to move something, you must have and empty space to move it to. a rock that fills up the infinite universe leaves no empty space to move to, therefore it cannot be moved or lifted
because there is nothing bigger than infinity. you cannot make a universe of infinite size bigger than it is. it is impossiple to expand something that is already infinite",65,69,topic_stance_votes_2
69,Proof that God is not all-powerful,existence of God,support,"lol, this one really made me think... i must say :p
ok, before you start jumping up and down, consider this: the hardest stone God can create is the hardest possible stone. no stone harder than this can possibly exist, therefore God cannot make a stone harder than the hardest possible stone. but even the hardest possible stone can be broken.
the only reason why God cannot create a stone so hard that he cannot break it is that a stone harder than possible cannot exist. such a stone is illogical. if it cannot logically exist, then God being unable to create it still can do anything possible, and thus maintaining all-powerful status

71,Proof that God is not all-powerful,existence of God,support,"To be able to do ""anything"", including things outside the knowable, is unintelligble. You cannot even being the argument because you are arguing the unknowable, which is, unknowable. That's the root. You can no more argue that god can participate in the unknowable, than you can do any rational examiniation of anything that has the attribute of being unknowable. It's meaningless.
If on the other hand you are starting with the premise that god is some entity that resides in the knowable universe, and is also knowable, then we can discuss this. And then ""god"" cannot also be the creator of the universe, which means I can probably stop right there in the debate.
Jim's claim of ""god is omnipotent and omniscient, is equally nonsensical.
Ominpotence cannot be understood, it's unknowable.
But, to tie this all back into a more useful example:
If God is omniscient, he knows everything that will happen and has happened.
If God is omnipotent, he can do anything.
That's contradictory. If he knows what will happen, then he cannot change what will happen, and is thus, not omnipotent. These are contradictory.
So theists can choose, either to discuss meaningless things (unknowable), or to admit that there is no god by classic definition.

72,Proof that God is not all-powerful,existence of God,attack,"Perhaps by you this is true.
Virtually anything!
Not being able to change something would be an indication of not being omnipotent. Here is another example of your inadequacies.
Some theists are willing to ignore such discussions. It has nothing to do with whether God exists.

73,Proof that God is not all-powerful,existence of God,attack,"No Jim, by reason.
You cannot know the unknowable, it's a contradiction. To claim anything about the unknowable implies knowledge of the unknowable. Me saying it has no relevance to it's being rational.
Which then would NOT be omnipotent/omniscient.
corrected above, thank you, minus the insult that followed.
It still stands however as a rational rebuttal.
Good, then you go back to the first point, which is that you cannot rationally claim to have knowledge of the unknowable. So yes, you're back to either being rational and not accepting god, or being irrational and accepting knowledge of the unknowable. I don't make the rules Jim.

74,Proof that God is not all-powerful,existence of God,attack,"This thread started with a challenge to God's omnipotence. It had nothing to do with omniscience. Our definition of omnipotent is ""having virtually  unlimited authority or influence. That appears to rule out the ability to do every conceivable task, uncluding those that are illogical.

Our definition of omniscient does not include virtual. That tells me that omniscient means having infinite knowledge.
It wasn't meant as an insult...just a statement of fact. I likely have as many or more inadequacies than do you.
Not having knowledge of an unknown says nothing about it's existence.

75,Proof that God is not all-powerful,existence of God,attack,"i totally agree with this point, Mach. it is useless to give God definitions that include the impossible or illogical. thats what this whole debate is about. its imperative that we limit what can be done to what is logically possible. it is not logically possible to foresee the future and then cause the future to be different that what was foreseen. omniscient can only be defined as ""knowing all that can be possibly known"", and similarly omnipotent as ""able to do anything that can possibly be done""

it seems the best definition anybody came up with for God is ""the greatest possible being"". this means a being that can do and know anything and everything that is POSSIBLE to do and know.
