0,Why are the majority of charities Christian?,existence of God,support,"After spending the past few days glued to the TV's coverage of Katrina, I began to wonder what all of the anti-Christians had to say about the fact that MOST of the help being given to Katrina victims is coming from CHRISTIAN ORGANIZATIONS. I've yet to see an atheist charity step up to the plate. What's the matter? Are only Christian organizations compassionate enough to lend a helping hand? 
I guess just as there are no atheists in a foxhole, there aren't any atheists in charitiable organizations either. emoticonXRolleyes",0,1,topic_stance_votes_2

4,Why are the majority of charities Christian?,existence of God,attack,"Atheism as a organization (if there is one) would find it difficult qualifying for not-for-profit tax free status enjoyed by wealthy Christian organizations. I once did a study on non-profits and religious principal salary/benefit levels would warm the heart of any capitalist, and in many cases make them very envious. All Christian organizations have a fixed percentage of donations raised for emergencies set aside for administrative, expansion and reserve purposes, all tax free.

5,Why are the majority of charities Christian?,existence of God,attack,"Well, who was the head of FEMA appointed by? A brief googling seems to suggest a Mr. G.W. Bush was responsible, it wouldn't be entirely out of the question for dubya to appoint another member of the Christian right to this permission, who might be keen for Christian charities to be promoted. Other possible reasons are that religion is very strong in the south, and hence religious charities are more likely to have resources in the south, were the problem is.
In any case, the red cross is by far the largest organisation involved, and as has already been estalbished is secular. And as I said before just because the organisations are Christian doesn't necessarily mean that their workers or contributors are.",3,6,topic_stance_votes_1

7,Why are the majority of charities Christian?,existence of God,support,"christianity cultivates a special skill in its leaders of appealing to people emotionally. its their survival tactic, so to speak. even if you had an athiest-run charitable organization, you'd probably use these tactics to get people to support it, and you'd quite likely hire a christian to do your marketing lol",7,8,topic_stance_votes_1
8,Why are the majority of charities Christian?,existence of God,support,"With the vast majority of the population being Christian, it seems obvious that the vast majority of charities are Christian.

Then there's the fact that, in the past, just about everyone in the US was a Christian. That's round about the time many of these organisations were set up, so logically theyâ€™ll be Christian.
There's also the fact that non-Christian people give to Christian charities.
Finally, quantity of charities doesn't actually reflect the quantity of help given. For example, the Red Cross will be giving more than the Mennonite Disaster Service.

15,Why are the majority of charities Christian?,existence of God,attack,"Why would they ""necessarily"" be Christian organizations? They could just as easily be secular like the Red Cross? The reason is because Christianity teaches and promotes charity towards others and Christians put their money where their mouths are. Atheists doesn't. It's a ""WIIFM"" philosophy. 
As you stated above, the majority would be Christians. I can't think of too many philantropic atheists, can you? emoticonXRolleyes

26,Why are the majority of charities Christian?,existence of God,attack,"JP, I'm losing an enormous amount of respect for you with every post you make in this thread.
Not only are you pounding on a very shaky generalization, but you're beating your chest and strutting about for all to see in a fit of righteous indignation because you've (and Christian organizations) donated some money to the hurricane relief.
It sickens me. 
IIRC, this type of attitude was seriously frowned upon by Jesus himself on several occasions in the Bible.
The vast majority of the US population is Christian, and therefore the majority of charitable organizations are Christian. Is that so hard to figure out? People donate money, ATHEISTS TOO, THOSE BASTARDS, to whatever charity they feel is going to get the most out of their money. 
What do want? A roll call of everyone here posting a tax receipt for their charitable donations so we can all whip them out and compare? What is this, the second grade?
Why you would feel the need to come on this board and point fingers while blowing your own horn is beyond me.

27,Why are the majority of charities Christian?,existence of God,attack,"I'm not trying to XXXX my own horn. I happened to see the thread about charities and saw that the majority were Christian organizations. They weren't secular foundations, they were Churches and other Christian organizations.
I then began to think of all the anti-Christian propaganda that's been posted on here lately and thought that, just maybe, someone should point out to those blinded by anti-Christian hate that Christians do good things all of the time.

28,Why are the majority of charities Christian?,existence of God,attack,"In another thread you said you'd try to stop with the generalisations. What happened? Can you provide a shred of evidence of how Christians give more per person?
Because most people are Christian.
Why don't churches sell all their gold then? What possible benefit does it bring them? Why not sell it all? God sees no value for money in his kingdom, so why do churches insist on storing it?
Red Cross?
People tend to bash stupid Christians such as Chic and co, rather than Christianity as a whole. Those who bash Christianity as a whole are XXXXXX. Just like those who bash non-religious people as a whole.
As I said, quantity of charities isn't directly proportional to quantity of help. The Red Cross, yet again, does more than dozens off smaller charities put together.
People acknowledge Christian charities do good. Where is there a single post saying something to the contrary?
-Wez",13,29,topic_stance_votes_1
29,Why are the majority of charities Christian?,existence of God,support,"It's as simple as this.
Most charities need organization.
Most religious organizations are organized.
Most religious organizations are non-profit.
SO most charities are based on or around non-profit organizations, most of which are religious organizations, most of which, in the US, are christian.
But there are Jewish, Muslim, etc. charities, just fewer of them, since there are fewer Jews, Muslims, etc.
It's very simple and it's nothing special to do with Christianity.
Why are most charities in the Middle East Muslim?
Because Christians aren't charitable.

Might I suggest that you do a quick search of this forum. Pay particular attention to the anti-Christian Gay Forum. 
You keep bringing up the Red Cross. The majority of donators to the Red Cross are most likely Christians as well, so what's your point? emoticonXConfused 
This forum is replete with Christian bashers. You'd have to be blind to not see that and an essential part of Christian doctrine IS charity. So, when they bash Christianity, they also bash the good that Christians do.",29,31,topic_stance_votes_2
31,Why are the majority of charities Christian?,existence of God,attack,"JP - you are big time generalizing.
Just becuase one disagrees with one action of Christianity does not mean that they don't recognize the good of another action.
The gay rights forum is a forum about gay rights. Christianity opposes gay rights. Of course they are gonna get reamed there.
If it were a forum about the good works of the church it would be different.
I recognize the charity of many Christian organizations and the committment to education. I EVEN attended a Catholic University.
However, when it comes to reproductive issues and gay rights the church is gonna get it square in the teeth from me. That does not make me ""anti-Christian"", it just means I am in favor of things that the church isn't.",31,32,topic_stance_votes_1
32,Why are the majority of charities Christian?,existence of God,attack,"None, seeing as tithing generally means giving money to the clergy/church.
Making it simple: Why doesn't the RC church sell all its gold and use the money to help the poor?
The [British] Red cross website has no matches for the words: ""God"", ""Christian"" or ""religion"". The American one has matches, but not in relation to the Red Cross's beliefs. Have you got evidence it's Christian?
That's another generalisation. Why do you make them? I won't just pick on you though. This is another stupid generalisation: 
But is the Red Cross Christian? Obviously most contributors are Christian. That's obvious as most Americans are Christian. 
That makes no sense.
If someone criticises, for example, the Church's stance on abortion, it doesn't mean that the person is criticising the church's charity. Someone who just insults the Church in general, or gays in general, should just be ignored.
