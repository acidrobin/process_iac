Criminols are gonna have them and could kill us. Statistics show that it is 1 cop for 20,000 people!! it might be just me but i want to be protected at all times and the most effective way!!!!And about the ""accidental Deaths"" by kids not knowing what guns do at a early age.. Schools should have a program [other than dare] that teaches you not to use guns and make up rules if you ever come into contact with one. This gun-control thing is going to far!

""But I don't feel safe with any one having a gun. Only police officers and security guards should carry and have them.""
First of all, feeling safe is NOT a right...that's a state of mind. It seems people think feeling safe is somehow a right, it's NOT. Self-defense IS a right. That is right granted by the Constitution, specifically the 2nd Amendment. In no where does it say ""only police officers or military, etc"" it says the people! Secondly, citizens with CCW (concealed weapons permits) are just a capable as police officers and security guards. Most if not all CCW holders have to go through some kind of training with firearms.

46,Anti-Gun control,gun control,support,"Protecting yourself from criminals is only one reason to own a gun (and because they're criminal they don't care about the law so they'll find a gun anyway). An even better reason for the public to be allowed to own weapons is that it protects against government usurpations. It is no coincidence that one of the first things any totalitarian regime does is take away guns. If the government takes your rights and those of others and you don't have a gun, what's the best you can do? Challenge it in court, what if they're in on it? Go and throw rocks at them, they'll just pick you off with 50 calibers.

47,Anti-Gun control,gun control,attack,"Ummm ""feeling safe"" is one of the reasons we have so many laws... so, in a sense, feeling safe is a right.
I am neither gun lover nor gun hater. However, a concealed weapon is a concealed weapon. Perhaps a gun owner has some training as to how to fire a gun, but police officers and (hopefully) security guards are trained to protect and uphold a law. Granted no one is perfect, but you cannot compare the training a CCW holder receives with that of the years of academy training a police officer goes through. Millions upon millions of americans go through life without ever firing a gun. Probably the majority of americans. I honestly don't feel it's safe to have someone with a CCW walking around a peaceful neighborhood toting a gun. It's pointless. If a neighborhood is dangerous and the police support is failing, then I can understand. But in anytown USA, I think it's beyond ridiculous.
The constition was written so long ago. I don't think the founders ever imagined a population so big or so many powerful weapons in the circulation. The constitional law was also meant more on the lines of militia. I'm all for hunting and recreational gun useage. But there has to be common sense as to what exactly a real threat is. And, there have been LOTS of accidents... including the bufoonery of our current vice president. There has to be reasonable control. There is no reason to have cop-killing guns in the population. Because of the lack of control laws we let happen, we now have created a larger problem of black market weapons. One has to wonder about the psychological makeup of joe or suzie blo carrying a concealed weapon in anytown USA. I'm sorry, it's more dangerous, not safe.",46,48,topic_stance_votes_1
48,Anti-Gun control,gun control,support,"I know what country I live in and what its Constitution says. My question to gun advocates is why with nearly no guns in many European countries and others, is the crime rate so much lower than ours? Many enjoy most or all the liberties we enjoy with the exception of gun ownership and yet there are simply fewer criminals. If all our guns make us free and safe, how come we're not safe and not any more free? Do we have more outlaws because of our historical relationship with firearms? Is the psychological attachment to the gun the same for both law abiding gun owner and outlaw? Don't both villian and hero intend to prevail by virtue of the gun's power?",48,49,topic_stance_votes_1
49,Anti-Gun control,gun control,attack,"It's not, and I wouldn't want to live in Europe anyway because by the end of the century Europe will be no more.

Okay, I know little about the state of Russian streets, but I would guess that conditions there have something to do with the collapse of the USSR.
Given that the USA seems to be collapsing at the moment, perhaps the same conditions will exist there soon. Then, maybe you will wish you did live in Europe.

51,Anti-Gun control,gun control,attack,"So your saying since some things make you afraid we should ban, destroy, etc them? Would you really give up a lot of your rights just to feel safe? 
I think you're misunderstanding the concept of CCW. If no one can see it, there is no harm done. I'm sure there are tons of people around where I live with CCW (license) and walking around. It hasn't turned into the OK Corral or anything of that nature. Neither are people freaking out. If you do you're just being paranoid. If you ever take a CCW course you will realize that they take this very seriously. The majority of gun owners are not irresponsible and won't go around toting their guns in front of people because they are ######. 
You say police officers are ""better trained?"" That's debatable. I have read lots of stories where police officers were accidentally shot. Although you might not believe it, some police officers tend to forget basic safety protocols, which could result in the death or injury of another person. They are human after all. CCW's holders have to follow the same protocols and probably do so at a higher rate due to public opinion.
Even if it was written long ago, it is still the law of the land. I'm sure the founders never imagined the internet and the MSM..but hey that's legal right? I can understand reasonable controls, but what is reasonable to you might not be reasonable to me and that I guess is the issue. An issue that will be determined by the Supreme Court hopefully this next year (see Washington DC vs Parker.) Also check up on the statistics about gun accidents. Gun accidents are very low compared to drowning, poison and medical procedures. Cop killing guns? What's that?

52,Anti-Gun control,gun control,attack,"I'm not debating whether or not it's the law of the land. Of course it is and guns certainly will never go away. Even if I thought they should, it would be impossible to find all guns and destroy them. I will never happen.
It's just too easy for anyone to get them. We have to have a license to drive a car, which, in itself, can be a very dangerous weapon. But it's controlled. Guns should be difficult to attain. It's not an infringement on rights. It's common sense. 
I have never carried a gun in public and I've lived in some pretty tough neighborhoods that would certainly have warranted it. I just don't see the point. If someone is going to shoot you, that person is going to do it... period. Concealed weapons in suburbia is nonsensical. It's dangerous to everyone around. Despite training you get with the permit, it doesn't take in account the psychological make-up of stressful situations.... or intoxication.... or anything else that might cause someone to pull out a gun. Without proper screening, how can you prevent wacko's from going to the OK Koral... or, rather, high-schools in the US. I would say the rights of the non-gun carrying citizens outweights the rights to carry a concealed weapon. 
The right is to be able to carry a gun. However, carrying a gun is a lifestyle choice. It should not put into danger anyone who does not carry a gun. If you're going to carry a gun, you must past a litmus test for psychological stability. 
And as an aside, my cousin was and his son is a NYC cop. They served many years on the force, and both were part of the 911 ground zero operations on that horrible day. Their views are similar to mine, and they are both personal gun owners. They understand, more than anybody, the power behind a gun. And yes, the academy training they went through was intense. Accidents are going to happen, but that is what academys are for.... to prevent more accidents from happening.

59,Anti-Gun control,gun control,support,"I’m not sure about the futility of resisting modern tyranny with small arms. Now I’m not suggesting that we are imposing tyranny overseas, but here is one point. There are far, far fewer armed terrorists in Iraq than there are armed citizens in America. If the need ever arose for armed resistance, then I don’t believe the American resistance fighters would march out into a field, form square like they are about to receive cavalry at Waterloo, and patiently await the B-52 strike.
I know there are people who are ashamed of the RKBA—who want to treat it as the red-headed step-child of the Bill or Rights—who want to keep it locked up in the basement lest it show itself and frighten our more enlightened European neighbors. These same people want to declare that the 2nd. Amendment RKBA constantly hangs in the balance, and they believe they have the moral authority to destroy it the moment they are convinced it is “no longer needed.” For those of you who feel that way, here is my answer: 
We are a government of laws and not men. I don’t have to justify the necessity of having a right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure; a right to free speech, press, and assembly; a right to remain silent, to be free from cruel and unusual punishments; or my right not to be a slave. These rights are recognized by my Constitution, and need no further justification. The 2nd. Amendment is likewise a part of that great charter, and also requires no further justification. I know some of our friends around the world believe we have lost the moral torch of freedom and liberty by our invasion of Iraq. All I can say is we have sunk low indeed when we see persons at home hover over the Constitution with a gleam in their eye and a bottle of white-out in their hand make the self-righteous demand that we are required to justify why they should not go ahead and strike out portions of the document they don’t like. 
The 2nd. Amendment recognizes an individual RKBA. I challenge anyone to demonstrate otherwise. If you want to prevent your neighbor from owning a gun then be honest about it. Work to amend the RKBA out of the Constitution, and once successful then pass laws denying your fellow man that right. Don’t attempt it by deliberately distorting the wording of the amendment to read what you think it should. You only encourage others to rewrite or white-out other portions of the Constitution they don’t like.

The second amendment needs amending, like much of the constitution already has had. It's called constitutional evolution. It's called meeting the needs of the current society. It is different now from the 1700s and it will be different in the 2200s. 
Guns are here to stay. We might as well figure out how to regulate them, keep them from lunatics, have intense training as to the impact of guns and their useage, and get them out of criminals hands. Having open gun sales events with limited background checks does not acheive this. Why would anyone need a semi-automatic to ""protect their family"". Most Americans do not have guns. Go figure...

Nonsense. There is no such explicit call. Moreover, the drilling you describe did not even become standard for the Guard until the National Defense Act of 1916. 
The Founders did not expect droves of citizens to trek un-armed to Camps of Instruction whereat they would be armed.

65,Anti-Gun control,gun control,support,"On that note, see also U.S. v. Miller, which is often wrongly cited as a case against the individual RKBA:
”The signification attributed to the term Militia appears from the debates in the Convention, the history and legislation of the Colonies and the States, and the writings of approved commentators. These show plainly enough that the militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. ""A body of citizens enrolled for military discipline."" And further, that ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of a kind in common use at the time.” United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174, 179 (1939).
The goal was to ensure an armed populace, and then draw upon the members of that armed populace for the militia.

“Little more can reasonably be aimed at with respect to the people at large than to have them properly armed and equipped. . . .This will not only lessen the call for military establishments, but if circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens, little if any inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their rights and those of their fellow citizens.” Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist Papers #29, reprinted at page 185 in The Federalist Papers, Mentor Books, 1969, edited by Clinton Rossiter.

If laws, etc. can't sway you, than maybe common sense can. Guns have become such a large part of todays society that any attempt to ban them would be fruitless. Think back to the Prohibition... it worked great didnt it emoticonXDonno !! Also, can we generalize that a criminal does not obey laws? Therefore a ban on guns, created through law, would leave innocent, law-abiding citizens with no way to defend themselves from the criminals that disobeyed the ban... emoticonXKill emoticonXWow",67,68,topic_stance_votes_2

I agree with this to some extent.... Assualt weapons are used only for killing people. semi-automatic would be all that is nessasary to give us a fighting chance against an attack where ever it may come",70,71,topic_stance_votes_2
71,Anti-Gun control,gun control,support,"I don't understand why you think that after giving up are guns how we would be remotely threatening to ANYONE. Sure we might scare others who gave up our guns but what is the point in that? And we wouldn't be safe against felons who(wait for it...) wouldn't give up their guns!! I know right now that Seleare is saying,"" But we'll take them from them!"".
Great. Who is we'll? Do you honestly think that the government is gonna know what to do? And if the government does have this ""miricle plan"" how can they do it without making a law-abbiding citizen retaliate?

In fact the vast majority of it leads to the conclusion that an unarmed populus is more suceptable to being murdered than an armed one. For instance, Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, China, as well as countless small level murder in every other ""civilized"" country on this Earth.

77,Anti-Gun control,gun control,support,"yes i agree with this guy. If the whole point of CRIMINALS is to IGNORE laws then what is the point of making the laws that cripple the safety of those of us who follow the laws? Even if the government, through some paradox way, is able to rid the country of ALL guns, a knife, a car, a No.2 pencil, your hands, or pretty much anything you can do damage with will kill somebody just as easily. If guns are banned what of those who make a living by hunting for their food? Those who supply the stores with venison and rabbit? Those who grow your crops? The hunters and the farmers trade with each other so that they can survive through out the rest of the year.
