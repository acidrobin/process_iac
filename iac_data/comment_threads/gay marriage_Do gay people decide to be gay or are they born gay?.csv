11,Do gay people decide to be gay or are they born gay?,gay marriage,attack,"Nice dodge, EZ. We're not talking about behaviour, we're talking instead about sexual orientation/inclination and how it comes about. Did you choose your sexual orientation, EZ? I certainly didn't and I know of no one who did. When I was about five years of age, I discovered that I was somehow attracted to little girls my age. I didn't know why, and I had no concept of sexuality. 
It's unclear as to what factors determine one's sexual orientation. It could be genetic. Researchers have also found that the sexual orientation of laboratory mice can be engineered by altering the proportions of various hormones in the mother's bloodstream during pregnancy. In any case, one's sexual orientation does not appear to be a deliberate choice. 
With regard to ""illicit"" gay sex, that seems to be one of the goblins which you carry around with you. You know, EZ, if gays had the right to marry, their sexuality wouldn't be ""illicit"", would it? ""Illicit"" in terms of the Bible?

16,Do gay people decide to be gay or are they born gay?,gay marriage,support,"Yes that does seam to be there charter sometimes doesn’t it.
Other issues include:
The position of religion is made immoral by the fact that people are born gay. If people are born gay it makes treating them with prejudice, disrespect and discrimination immoral because the gay person had no choice in his or her fundamental constitution. 
That’s why EZ can’t directly address the topic question directly (by saying people are born gay.) On the bright side EZ didn’t simply say people choose to be gay, hopefully indicating a positive change in his thinking (but I doubt it.) Religion must maintain the misnomer that sexual orientation is a choice in order to protect itself. One of the pitfalls of playing the is it good or evil game.
The sneaky thing about this gay rehab idea is that it also says, you may have been born gay but that does not mean you don’t have a choice. With a little work you can change your sexual orientation, however they have had very little success with this. One then would say, if nothing else why couldn’t gay people just be celibate and avoid human physical contact their whole life. People being what they are I don’t think that’s a realistic thing to ask them to do.
The real problem is that as long as the thinking is, people choose to be gay, no progress can be made, it’s a dead lock, they will always be evil and that’s it. However if one begins to think in terms of people are born gay then religion requires revision. Religion fears this because it thinks people will lose faith and/or it will lose control.

i disagree. being heterosexual does not mean you are sexually attractive to every female you come into contact with. you have a set of criteria that you use to determine which female is sexy.
most boys (depending on how they are taught) are not sexually attracted to their sisters, mothers or females in their immediate family, regardless of how good-looking they are. yet they would be attracted to another female with the same body type and features. how do you explain that?",21,22,topic_stance_votes_2

23,Do gay people decide to be gay or are they born gay?,gay marriage,support,"What an interesting thread. We just had this discussion around our house last week. Our 17 year old daughter came into the kitchen tears. This boy she met and was excited about their upcoming date called at the last minute and cancelled. No explanation of any kind until the next day.
It seems HIS sister convinced him that he just had to be gay. Our daughter asked him, via phone conversation, why she thought he was gay. Because he acts it. He is a sensitive, gentle soul and has no tendency to want to do the rough and tumble things that normal high school boys do.
Normal? I think our society needs more gentle masculine men. So in this respect was he born gay? No... His sister decided for him and he is going along with it. Wow!! I guess that means since I am still a tomboy and prefer more so-called masculine jobs that I must have been a lesbian all along. Can you imagine the relief I feel at age 41 finally figuring this all out.
Why can't we just let people be who they are and quit trying to fit male and female into stereotypical roles. I never liked playing with dolls. My girls don't either. But you won't find a more proper young lady or 4 that couldn't kick butt in sports either. I say we can have the best of both worlds. So are we born gay or lesbian. I believe we are not.

39,Do gay people decide to be gay or are they born gay?,gay marriage,attack,"how is this different from the ability to be sexually attracted to any gender or type of sexual act? it seems to me that when a person is born, he can potentially speak any language, but is oriented to the language he is primarily taught. what could possibly indicate that sexual orientation is different?
similarly. gays are usually attracted to a subset of males, and bisexuals are usually attracted to a subset within all males and females. some people are only attracted to blonds, or short people, or very slim people, or voluptuous women, or muscular men. these ""attraction restrictions"" are usually consistent throughout the entire lives of some people. does that mean that these people are born with the inclination to be attracted to that particular type of person?
apparently, there are many siblings that are sexually attracted to each other, and some that act on it. this pheremones theory doesnt seem to be an explanation at all, because there are lots of cases where the sexual attraction is there, and lots of cases where the sexual attraction is not there.
from what i understand, the factor that determines whether siblings are sexually attracted to each other and act on it is the teachings that are indoctrinated in the children due to the environment. a child in a traditional religious background is much more likely to suppress the sexual attraction that he may have to his sisters because he has been taught that sisters are off-limits. however, a child without a strong indoctrination would be more likely to allow the attraction to develop into action. similarly, in an environment where such a relationship is severe taboo, incidents of incest is usually less.

43,Do gay people decide to be gay or are they born gay?,gay marriage,attack,"SOme people naturally can be more flexible, and have an easier time learning different languages. I don't think tht when it come to sexuality that you can train ANY sexuality into someone. There have been instances where children born with deformed gentiles were raised in a gender that they were not biologically, (after cosmetic surgury). Although they were treated as the opposite sex since infancy, their assocatiation with their biological sex was so great it caused them a lot of pain growing up. This demonstrates to me that sexuality is not a 'blank slate'. 
Maybe, maybe not. It is the gender that is the constant.
It is not 'perfect'.. but it shows a general trend. The chances of two syblings having similar pheormons is greater. 
I am sure there are social factors that reinforce it. I find it ironic that the general area that has the sterotypoe of a higher incidendent of incest also
has the sterotype of a higher degree of relgious belief too.
WHich, of course, the peer reviewed article on the pheormones shows that is incorrect. It does show that phermones is a strong influence. There are a number of papers on it, if you care to look it up, and actually read them.

65,Do gay people decide to be gay or are they born gay?,gay marriage,attack,"im not assuming anything. whether sibling pheremones are similar, identical, or different, seems to have no bearing on the facts. sibling pheremones dont repel sexual attraction from their relatives. male pheremones dont repel sexual attraction from males. there is no corespondence between pheremone emission and sexual attraction, in terms of the rules that the studies suggest. a single person could be sexually attracted to his sister, his non-relative girlfriend, and a non-related guy, and a sheep. similarly, a dad, woman and guy might all be sexually attracted to the same woman.
whats more is that pheremones do nothing to explain visual sexual attraction, which is extremely common. a person can be sexually attracted to somebody theyve seen on tv or in a magazine, or heard on the radio, or read about in a book. gays could look at a video of guys and get turned on, completely in the absence of whatever pheremones are claimed to be responsible. in fact, some ""studies"" use this as a test to examine sexual arousal and orientation. 
finally, if the pheremone theory had any merit, then a woman sprayed with a male pheremone would be sexually attractive to gay guys, and repulsive to gay women or straight guys. obviously it doesnt work that way...",65,66,topic_stance_votes_2

What about the desire to have that encounter? When does that kick in?

Let us also say for the sake of argument that it is indeed a sin. (just withold judgment of my statements for the moment........)
So is Murder, So is adultery, so is lying, so is stealing. Jesus said that whoever looks on a woman with lust in his heart is guilty of the sin of adultery and whoever looks on a man with hatred is guilty of the sin of murder.
As a christian, I would have to say that I am as guilty of sin as any man or woman who is homosexual. Why is it that I also sin? Because I made flawed (also official christian doctrin, the fall of man and all). If that is the case, what do I do about it?
I can give in to it or I can choose to rest on God's grace. Does that mean I will not sin, no. It only means that God is stronger than any sin.
The issue of this debate is whether or not someone is born Gay. I cannot conclude otherwise. The question is then, should we hold gay men and women accountable because they were born this way. The answer is NO.
Here's why. It is not my job nor the job of anyone else to JUDGE another. Period. That is reserved for God (also official christian doctrine). Will God judge a man according to the Laws he gave to Moses? Only if men (and women, not meaning to leave you out, just hate writing more than I want) do not choose to identify with the one who paid the full penalty already. If they do not accept that gift then they are ALREADY judged by the law. 
I guess what I am saying is that as a christian, it does not matter to me whether a man or women is born gay or chooses it. My job is to love God and others. 
I personally believe that those who are gay have a tough enough time in this world without the extra judgement heaped upon them by those who think they are righteous. If anyone here is christian and declares a person an abomination because of homosexuality they have only to read Romans Chapter 2 where Paul makes it clear that we are Judged by God because we judge others.

109,Do gay people decide to be gay or are they born gay?,gay marriage,support,"To Big Bear - Here's something to help you out on the Law:
The ""Law,"" as we have come to know it, is often seen as a collection of Old Testament commandments, given to Moses by God on Mount Sinai, and carried forth into the New Testament, most notably by Jesus Christ and the apostle Paul. It is a sometimes confusing array of commandments that many Christians even today are unsure of as to its significance for the New Testament believer. Originally, torah (the usual Hebrew word in the Old Testament for ""law"") meant oral instruction or direction . It has since come to be used as a comprehensive term for the whole Pentateuch, in which all of the most important legal collections were carefully included (Hastings Bible Dictionary, 533). 
In the Old Testament, there were three main categories of law: ceremonial, civil, and moral.
CEREMONIAL LAW
Ceremonial law is specifically related to the Levitical priesthood, and is seen in explicit detail in the book of Leviticus. In addition, we see other ceremonial requirements for the preparation and maintenance of the tabernacle, and its furnishings, in other books of the Pentateuch (Exodus 25, for example). Ceremonial law applies not only to the holiness and qualifications of the high priest, but also to how various types of sacrifices should be prepared and offered. Burnt offerings, fellowship offerings, sin offerings, etc., all required a knowledge of God's divine and ceremonial law before the proper sacrifice could be presented. It's primary purpose was to foreshadow, or point forward to, the perfect sacrifice of Christ that was made at Calvary. These laws, for all intents and purposes, were discarded and rendered unnecessary after Christ's crucifixion, though the necessity of worshipping a holy and righteous God through a holy and consecrated priesthood of believers still applies. 
CIVIL LAW
The civil laws that were given to the Israelites were primarily meant to address tenets of everyday living. These laws governed such things as divorce, lending, payment of wages, harvesting, and numerous other activities (note Deuteronomy chapter 24). They they still remain as a basic guideline for godly living in many parts of the world. American civil law, tort law, contract law - all have a ""genetic"" heritage in the civil laws of ancient Israel, and show us the ""mind of God"" for the civility of mankind.
MORAL LAW
These basic laws, perhaps more than any other Old Testament commandments, show us the divine nature and character of God, and are absolutely revered in all institutions of true Christianity to this day. For the record, they are as follows, as stated in Exodus chapter 20:
1. You shall have no other gods before (besides) me.
2. You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in
heaven above, or on the earth beneath, or in the waters below.
3. You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God.
4. Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.
5. Honor your father and your mother.
6. You shall not murder.
7. You shall not commit adultery.
8. You shall not steal.
9. You shall not give false testimony against your brother.
10. You shall not covet. 
These laws of God are objective. They are meant for all people, at all times in history, in all places of civilization. Man's laws, by comparison, are subjective. They vary from culture to culture, from one time period to another, and from place to place. Prohibition (of alcohol) is a good example. At one time alcohol consumption was legal. Then came prohibition, and finally alcohol was again legalized (through certain restrictions still apply today). So we see the subjective and changing nature of ""worldly"" law in contrast to God's eternal standards. When God says, ""You shall not commit adultery,"" that commandment is for everyone, no matter when or where they may live.
When studying Biblical law, it is important to recognize the difference between the ""letter"" of the law and the ""spirit"" of the law. This was an extremely contentious issue between Jesus and the pharisees of His day. Several examples of this are noted in Matthew chapter twelve, when the pharisees chastised Jesus for healing the man with the withered hand on the Sabbath, and when the disciples were picking grains of wheat to eat. The pharisees went to an extreme to keep the letter of the law, but forgot to keep the Spirit of the law when they tried to keep God's children from being healed and fed on the Sabbath day. Jesus replied that, ""It is lawful to do good on the Sabbath"" (Matthew 12:12). Noting this, the apostle Paul wrote in 2 Corinthians 3:6 that the ""letter (of the law) kills, but the Spirit gives life."" 
THE PURPOSE OF THE LAW
For purposes of clarification, I maintain that when speaking of the ""law,"" that the Ten Commandments of the moral law are the primary focus, followed by the various tenets of the civil law, thereafter followed by the Spirit of the ceremonial law as noted previously. 
From my review of scripture there are four major purposes of the law. The first is that the law was intended to show us the character and morality of the sovereign God. If we want to know what God's opinion is concerning adultery or murder, we can look at the sixth and seventh commandments to realize that God does not approve of them. If we want to know if we are involved in idol worship (such as money), we can look at God's second commandment, as well as Matthew 6:24, and Luke 16:13, to see what God's word says about that. But the most important realization that we can come to is that there is but one righteous and sovereign God who is clearly defined through His divine law, and that divine law is perfect.
""For the law of the Lord is perfect, reviving the soul."" 
(Psalm 19:7)
The second major purpose of the law is that it is a tutor, or a teacher, to lead us to Christ. 
""So the law was put in charge to lead us to Christ, that we might
be justified by faith."" (Galatians 3:24)
""Indeed I would not have know what sin was except through the
law."" (Romans 7:7)
In Galatians 3:19 the apostle Paul wrote, ""What, then was the purpose of the law? It was added because of transgression until the Seed to whom the promise referred (Christ) had come."" The main point here is that man needs to have some set of guidelines, or law, as a reference to know whether or not he is sinful. Without the law, man indeed did not know what sin was, but once the law was given, three things happened: (1) Man knew the moral character of the righteous God; (2) Man knew by his review of the law that he was sinful;
""For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.""
(Romans 3:23)
(3) Man came to the realization that an unfathomable gulf exists between the righteous God and unrighteous, sinful man, and therefore a savior was needed to bridge the gap.
""What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this
body of death? Thanks be to God - through Jesus Christ our
Lord."" (Romans 7:24-25)
""But now a righteousness from God, apart from the law, has
been made known....This righteousness from God comes 
through faith in Jesus Christ..."" (Romans 3:21, 22)
The third purpose of the law is that it is a guide for Christians to live by. Whereas the law was initially provided as a tutor to lead us to Christ, the law also serves as a reminder to keep us ""in"" Christ. One of the interesting things that happens to a Christian in his ""walk"" is that the closer he gets to God, the more aware he is of his sinful nature. This realization serves the purpose of keeping us close to Christ, depending on and trusting in Him for our salvation. 
So the law is meant to guide us in our day-to-day walk of faith in Christ. Now there is one extremely important observation that needs to be addressed here. That has to do with the relationship of the law to salvation. Keeping the law does not result in eternal life or salvation. That was never the purpose of the law in regards to man. But it was the purpose of Christ to fulfill that law on our behalf, so that by faith in Him we could all become righteous in the eyes of God. 
""Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the
Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill
them."" (Jesus, Matthew 5:17)
""(In Christ)....We have been released from the law so that
we serve in the new way of the Spirit."" (Romans 7:6)
This is one of the biggest stumbling blocks that Christians get caught up in - trying to ""keep"" the law, or trying to do something to help win their salvation.
""Know that a man is not justified (righteous) by observing
the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ....(by) observing the 
law no one will be justified."" (Galatians 2:16)
It would do us well to forget about the law as far as our salvation goes, and try to remember it as a guide for daily Christian living. 
The last purpose of the law is to show us where there may be ""traps"" and pitfalls in our lives. For instance, by not committing adultery, we don't have to worry about getting shot at by a jealous husband, or a jealous wife. Our reputations and our consciences stay clear from disgrace. Our marriages remain stronger, and our families tend to stay together longer. Furthermore, we are free from any discipline from God that might take place should we commit such a sin, and we tend to stay out of the ""clutches"" of Satan at the same time.
""...Hand this man over to Satan, so that the sinful nature
may be destroyed and his spirit saved on the day of the
Lord."" (1 Corinthians 5:5)
Another example is if we keep God's law about not stealing, we don't have to worry about going to jail. And so it goes from law to law. The law is there for our protection, and grants us liberty from many adverse and unpleasant consequences. 
In summary, the law serves four major purposes:
1. It shows us the moral character of God.
2. It is a tutor to lead us to Christ.
3. It is a guide for Christian living
4. It can keep us from suffering the adverse consequences of our sins.

I've known a few and heard of many more people who couldn't care less about sex. I've known one and heard about many more who can't go 15 minutes without having sex with something.
Our bodies are designed for sex and we are given pleasure through sex to ensure that we practice a lot of it and procreate our kind. The nymphomaniac I knew would have sex with male, female, inanimate objects...virtually anything that would 'get her off'. There's a species of monkey that has casual sex and masturbates daily, along with mutual masturbation between two males and between two females. Female dolphins have been known to 'fin' each other's genitals for pleasure. It's the pleasure seeking and the availability of someone else's sensuous touching that brings people physically together. The bell-shaped curve is alive and well in regard to sex drive, with some people being undriven and some people being driven up the wall.
To me, it is quite simple to imagine that this has been occuring since multicell animals have been in existence and is nothing knew. Gayness and besexuality have existed for millions of years. It is natural and depends only on the sex drive factor. If I'm not mistaken, there are even some insects that exhibit gay activities.
My contention is that people choose to be gay because it happened to feel good the first time someone of their own sex touched them. Sex drive is a powerful thing and can easily overcome the fact that the potential partner may be of the same sex.

The mechanisms appear to be different in most other animal species. Females going in heat makes males compete during a defined mating period. Or they mate for life but confine sex to a mating season, gestating and giving birth at opportune times of the year. Odors and receptive behavior encourage the males to mate. Birds (except penguins) have the nesting seasons timed so that chicks are not born in the dead of winter.

133,Do gay people decide to be gay or are they born gay?,gay marriage,attack,"This is a tough question. Here's my take on it -
Firstly, IMHO, homosexuality is not simply the act of engaging in homosexual sex, it is primarily the attraction to the same sex.
Most importantly -
It's not black or white, x or y, that type of a scenario rarely exists in nature. It's gray - xx, yy, xy, yx, etc...
You have to have the desire to ""experiment"". If you have an innate attraction to both sexes, you then have the ability to choose which one you will have sex with. If you have no attraction, or in most cases, a repulsion to the thought of sexual interaction with someone of the same sex, then it's not really a choice. 
The attraction must be there. If one can be purely homo or heterosexual, why can one not be somewhere in the middle? 
Also, I don't think this is type of experimentation is nearly as prevalent as the media and ""porn"" makes it out to be. 
Finally, I believe that genetics are the basis for sexuality, but I also believe that environment can affect the expression of that basis. Personally, I think it's absurd to suggest that one or the other has zero impact on sexuality.

I am sure deer sexuality is understood. I did not state that the study of deer sexuality is impractical. I stated that the study of population of all male deer (having never been around any female deer) is impractical.
A study of an all male population of deer in an otherwise normal environment would be impractical. Rats on the other hand are at home in any space provided, they multiply and mature fast and would lend themselves to statistical study far more than deer.
As previously stated, boys usually attend boys schools after they have reached a certain age. Having been raised among boys and girls until they go off to boys school removes them from the category of those raised in an all male environment.
I would think that after having been raised in a coed environment, a boy sent to an all boys school would want female companionship even more. I don't think boys school drive people toward homosexuality.

You stated nothing in your original posts (I grow weary of quoting you as proof) that age was a limiting factor in your theory.

Hardly. 
You made clear statements regarding your theories, now you're back tracking.
A number simply meant to represent many. Like I said, define many if it's so critical to your arguement. Many can be 100, many can be 5.
Debating the number 5 is pointless avoidance of the issue.
Here is your quote than spawned the question -
Where in this quote do specify that age is a critical factor - nowhere. You simply state ""the first time"". The first time could be at age 45. 
The simple question is, and it follows very directly, do you think that your first homosexual experience, if it happened tomorrow and was very pleasureable for you, would make you a full fledged homosexual, with a strong attraction to other men? Would you, or better yet, could you, simply choose to be gay or bisexual at that point? The sex drive is a very powerful thing.
