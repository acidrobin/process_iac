0,Debate a signal of prochoice confusion and breakdown?,abortion,support,"Al Mohler has an interesting commentary on an ongoing debate between two pro-choice journalists. Check it out here.
An Op-Ed writer for the NY Times, William Saletan is arguing that the pro-choice movement is loosing in the national debate and should admit that abortion is a ""bad thing.""
Katha Pollit, a columnist for The Nation is putting forth an argument that says as prochoicers seek to reframe their arguments, injecting more moralism into the antiabortion debate will not keep abortion legal and accessible.
Here is Mohler's conclusion on this interesting dialogue between Saletan and Pollit:
""Why should pro-lifers pay attention to this debate among advocates of abortion rights? The answer to that question is simple--the exchange between William Saletan and Katha Pollitt demonstrates the inherent weakness of the pro-abortion argument, or its pro-choice variant. Lacking any objective definition of human life and the status of the unborn, the pro-abortion movement is mired in a pattern of endless internal debates and confusions. Saletan's argument is less radical than Pollitt's, but his position is morally arbitrary, based more in pragmatic concern than in moral philosophy.
In any event, the exchange between William Saletan and Katha Pollitt indicates that the pro-abortion movement knows that it has work to do in reaching the hearts and minds of Americans. The pro-life movement had better remind itself of the same challenge. Both sides are locked in a race to reach the hearts and minds of those still stuck in the middle.""",0,1,topic_stance_votes_1

3,Debate a signal of prochoice confusion and breakdown?,abortion,support,"I agree that most people who have pro-choice views have been complacent about their rights since, after Roe vs. Wade, they did not feel that those rights were under threat any longer. Far too often, on any subject (global warming also comes to mind), people will not respond to a problem until they start to suffer from that problem and they don't bother to pay enough attention to prevent the problem in the first place. In this case, the problem would be that of the loss of abortion rights.
I have actually been surprised by the number of people who don't realize what the debate is all about. A surprising number of people I have spoken with actually think that the debate is about whether or not a woman ""should"" have an abortion, not about whether or not she ""can"" have an abortion. Just look at the absurd use of the word ""pro-abortion"" in that post. I, personally, have never had a discussion with anyone who was arguing that women ""should"" have abortions. Even with people who are arguing that abortion is an important option for women who are in deep poverty and who are pregnant, I don't remember hearing any arguements that they ""should"" have an abortion. The use of the term ""pro-abortion"" is simply absurd.

7,Debate a signal of prochoice confusion and breakdown?,abortion,attack,"In debates between those of us not in power (such as ourselves), there are ranges of views on both sides - both intelligent and well thought out, vs. knee-jerk emotional reactions. So, both camps in these types of forums can be occasionally guilty of distortion. However, where the leaders of the movements are concerned (those that run NARAL or Democratic congresspeople), I haven't heard too many extreme distorted comments. If you have heard such distortions at those high levels, could you name some?
I would be fine with information pamphlets on abortion (or other sources of information on abortion which are read by women considering that procedure) having a section with arguements on both sides - about the views on health concerns, morality, etc. Then, the woman can continue to choose for herself and would have heard summaries of both arguements. 
As for your comment about many getting abortions since they have grown up with it and assume it to be ok, the same can be said of those who are automatically against abortion because their parents and their communities are. As can be seen in the arguements in this forum, the issue is far too complicated to easily convince people one way or the other.

As for debating, pro-choicers simply can't say without losing credibility ""anytime during the pregnancy is a valid time"" for a woman to have an abortion. Nationwide, up to 24 weeks, any pregnant woman can get an abortion just because. She can have an arguement with her boyfriend and say f-u and get an abortion. As fair, social beings, we know its very wrong when one person can control one being's fate and effect another beings life, because she's so chooses?. A pro-choicers has no credibility when they deny that a 24 week fetus is not a human being, worthy of continuing its life. No one buys it and the bottom line why women have abortions, is because they can't cope, be that emotionally or financially or both. An excuse of emotional or financial distress should not give any human being greater power than another human being.
Come on, you tell me this baby (link below) is not a human being like you and I, deserving of the same rights we enjoy.

this is a premature baby, that lived. Many babies are aborted at this stage because of one person. How fair is that. Wanted babies have rights, unwanted babies have no rights and end up in the garbage. You cannot deny this is a human being, inside or outside the womb.",11,12,topic_stance_votes_1
12,Debate a signal of prochoice confusion and breakdown?,abortion,attack,"I have no problem with any of this that you've said. I do not think late term abortions should be done, period, unless there is a serious medical issue at hand. (I would not ask a woman to sacrifice her life for her baby's-I would educate the heck out of her and allow her to make a decision) 24 weeks is six months pregnant. That, to me, is late term and six months, half a year, is plenty of time to figure out what the heck you're going to do.
I have never felt that a fetus, at one week or at 24 weeks or whenever is not a human being. Of course it is a human being, what is it if it isn't a human being? A caterpillar in a cocoon? A mass of cells? No.
Even as a pro-choicer, I believe there has to be some line drawn in the sand.
That being said, I don't know where to draw the line. I do believe that we still need for abortion to be legal, safe, and accessible at least within the first three months. I have read conflicting reports about fetus development and am trying to make up my mind about when it is not okay anymore. This has been very hard for me to do, as I can clearly see both sides of the issue. 
I don't want women to get abortions, and I don't encourage anyone to ever do it. However, until we address the reasons women get them, which are very life effecting and legitimate (many will argue against me), then we need to keep abortions legal.

This is pretty impressive. Many pro-choicers say otherwise.
I don't think anyone thinks the reasons women get them do not need to be addressed. The problem is I think many feel it is an option so they won't address any of the other issues. As a teen if a girl is deciding whether or not to have sex she might say ""well, there is always abortion if I get into a bad situation""....so they feel their is a remedy for a mistake happening.

Second, the constitution was not written to be interpreted. It is written in plain English, and was meant to be easily understood by the average person. Peopl who 'interpret' the Constitution are simply unhappy with what is written and trying to twist the words to fit their own agenda. Third, what is really at risk with the removal of reproduction rights? Could you be referring to the fact that people will once again be held accountable for their actions? That they will not be able to simply remove the outcome of their actions? Or perhaps you are referring to all the couple who have been waiting to adopt a baby, after all, we would want them to actually be able to provide a secure and loving home for a child.

Regarding the debate that the other side opted out of, they might not have trusted that the debate would happen in a calm, reasonable manner and, if it would happen in an school where people would be mostly pro-life, they might have been afraid of the intimidation they might face as a consequence of participation in such a debate. I, for one, would be quite weary of participating in a public debate (if such an occasion came up) for precisely that reason. That is why the anonymous setting of a forum, where one can ignore flamers and those who argue with beligerent irrationality, is a far more productive setting. I can imagine that there are some on the pro-life side that might feel the same way.
As for people being comfortable with something because it is lawful, I think a far larger influence is the beliefs of one's friends and family - i.e. whether they think that a particular action is acceptable. After all, being promiscuous is lawful, so is being an alcoholic, or being homosexual or a goth for that matter. There are actions and ways of being that certain communities do not accept.

In regards to an unborn child in the first trimester, I cherish the knowledge that another life has begun. I think about all the things this new life may accomplish in the world, the joy that he/she will bring to others, the differences that he/she will make in other people's lives. Yes, I believe that an unborn child in any stage has a mind. I have been pregnant three times and given birth to three wonderful children. I have also known several women who miscarried during the first twelve weeks and one friend who had an abortion during the first twelve weeks. If an unborn child during this time is not a life, a human being, than why do all these women grieve over the loss of these children?",21,22,topic_stance_votes_1
22,Debate a signal of prochoice confusion and breakdown?,abortion,attack,"I can understand your respect for the potential of that fetus. For those who want to be pregnant, the thought of that potential can be a wonderful thing - something to look forward to. However, for those with an unwanted pregnancy, the potential that they see is purely hardship. 
For women in a tough situation who might be considering abortion, there really are no good options:
1) They can continue the pregnancy and keep the born baby, but women who typically would opt for abortion are typically women for whom this choice would be frought with difficulties and regrets. Some simply cannot afford a baby, some are too young. For some, there would be major health reprecussions, etc. I give my full support to those who are willing to try to bring such an otherwise unwanted child into the world. For some, this is simply not a realistic option - for those, I support their decision to abort.
2) They can give the baby up for adoption. I admire the women who are able to do this, since it is a large sacrifice on their part that can be a great benefit to a childless couple. Unfortunately, from a wide variety of anecdotal evidence I have heard, this is a very depressing option for women, so I can understand why many do not choose this option.
3) They can abort. How depressing an option this is for them depends on their belief system. Yes, some will be depressed. Others will be relieved - most from what I have heard. I, personally, would love to see fewer women need to choose this option by improved birth control methods (to limit the number of unwanted pregnancies) and by support for unwed mothers.
You believe that a fetus has a mind at all stages. That is where I disagree and that is the main reason that I lean much farther to pro-choice than to pro-life. My own views are based on the views of neurologists that the mind cannot start to exist until around the beginning of the third trimester. Therefore, I would strongly restrict late term abortions but allow first and second term abortions. Your view, as stated, is that the fetus at all stages has a mind. Given that view, I can understand why you would like to outlaw nearly all abortions. However, I suspect that view is based on religious beliefs - which many people, including myself, do not share. Do you base that view of the early existence of the mind on something other than those religious beliefs?",22,23,topic_stance_votes_2
23,Debate a signal of prochoice confusion and breakdown?,abortion,attack,"In answer to your question, I do have religious beliefs, but I spent most of my youth as an atheist, then began practicing vampirism and Wiccan (during which time I had my first child). What my religious beliefs are now is not relevant to this discussion. I have held these views since I was a teenager and actually researched abortion (and yes, I did research both sides of the issue). I have also seen too many people eaten away by the fact that they had an abortion. If, as you say, most women are merely relieved, why are their so many post-abortion trauma groups and counselors? Why is the suicide rate higher among women who have had an abortion? Why is it that the rate of child abuse is higher among women who have had an abortion?
As for the pregnant woman who is experiencing hardship, I firmly believe that abortion is still a selfish choice. They think it will be too hard, so they don't even try to give their unborn child a chance at life. I got pregnant at 18. The father of my child was not in the picture. I spent the majority of my pregnancy living in a box-like structure made of wood and tarps that I had found in a small wooded area near a Denny's. I wrote bad checks so I could buy food. When that stopped working I started begging for food, and hitting homeless shelters. Towards the end of my pregnancy I heard about a home for pregnant women. Since it was heading into winter (I was due in January) I decieded to check it out. I moved into this shelter despite the fact that it was a religiously ran shelter and they did not let me practice Wicca in the house. I knew that the temporary difficulty that presented meant a better chance for my baby. Since the birth of my daughter I have had two more children. Luckily, I found and married a wonderful man.

The reason that it is part of the discussion is that, in this country (the USA), people from one religious group cannot impose their views in law on the country in general. The founders had dealt with state imposed religion in the form of the Church of England and felt it important for people to have freedom of belief - not to have it imposed on them. If you hold your beliefs about the early mind purely for religious reasons, then you are trying to impose your religious beliefs on others.
As for statistics and reasons behind women's psychological state after abortion, just a quick Google search came up with this site (that sites references for its data):

To quote from that site:
Note: Most sites listed on Google were either clearly pro-choice (ex. Planned Parenthood) or clearly pro-life (Abortionfacts.com sponsored by pro-life Heritage House).
I can admire the courage it took for you to go through all of those hardships in order to keep the child. It sounds like your belief system compelled you to make that choice and you fought hardship to live up to that belief system. However, not all people have the same belief system. Since you believe that a mind exists in a fetus from early on, I can understand why you would have felt repelled by the idea of aborting the fetus. However, for those that don't share those beliefs, the early fetus is not yet a being with which one can sympathize and for which one need feel the obligation to sacrifice for - it is still just a body without a mind. Then, their own circumstances compell them to make the decision for abortion in some cases. You may call that selfish, but selfishness is ignoring someone else's needs in order to satisfy one's own. If there is no other ""someone"" yet, then the picture of whether or not it is selfish is far murkier. I, personally, do hold some respect for the potential of the fetus, even if it does not yet have a mind, and would hope that any decision that a woman takes about abortion would keep that potential in mind.

Your comment does give us a unique insight into your worldview (naturalism/relativism?) as well as some of its conclusions: 
1. That human life does not have any absolute inherent meaning, value, or dignity within itself. 
2. That the value of human life is relative and that it is determined by people like yourself.",26,35,topic_stance_votes_1
35,Debate a signal of prochoice confusion and breakdown?,abortion,attack,"Well, this goes back to the debate over when the life begins. (Frankly, as one who meticulously analyzes things, I have a hard time defining anything as alive in such a way that holes in the argumentation don't exist.) However, this is Sassy's claim, and while I choose not to strenuously object to it here, I don't need to; I used it as foundation upon which her argument can be reduced to absurdity. Insisting that this portion of her statement is correct does nothing to resolve the absurdity.
Let us look again at Sassy's statements, chloe, just for clarification:
She clearly states that a life begins when both (A) fertilization occurs and (B) a new DNA pattern is formed.
She continues,
Suffice it to say that this is not what most biologists ""feel"" makes a human being a human being; regardless, we can discredit a clearly absurd claim despite the false appeal to authority. If her assertion were true, the existence of a non-unique DNA pattern would disqualify the owner (or perhaps owners) from being human. This is, of course, ridiculous by any biological standard.
Furthermore, upon the first cell division, fertilization had not again occurred and a new DNA pattern was not produced. Therefore, according to her statement, only one life exists. Again, this is absurd.
Please keep in mind that these are not my positions or beliefs. I am simply following Sassy's statements to their logical consequences. This is a common philosophical approach known as reductio ad absurdum; if you are unfamiliar with it, I suggest you follow the link.
Sorry, chloe, I didn't make that claim. In fact, I reduced Sassy's claim using that as an example of absurdity.",34,36,topic_stance_votes_2

I mentioned a few in previous threads on these forums from NARAL and PP. You can go dig them up if you like but I don't want to bother. If you choose not to believe me then no skin off my nose :) My point is just that both sides will distort and to think otherwise makes you blind.
Actually, it was lack of organization. I didn't meant to imply they were scared or anything...it was just not an ""active"" group.
While both sides have flamers...pro-lifers are they only ones that need to worry at a college campus. I don't recall ever hearing such hatred from one side of the fense....it is different in other places it seems.
Perhaps if it is talked about. If your family doesn't talk about that kinda stuff then you probably would default it to being ""right"" based upon the law. I doubt many families have discussions about abortion all the time. I know mine didn't.

41,Debate a signal of prochoice confusion and breakdown?,abortion,attack,"I suppose that we are both limited in the time we are willing to spend to dig things up. We will just have to leave this point of arguement as unresolved.
I would think that the reprecussions of public debate that either a pro-life or a pro-choice group would face in a university would depend on the political demographics of that University. Most Eastern universities end up being left-of-center, in which case the pro-life groups might face more harrassment than the pro-choice groups. Those attending universities in the South and Mid-West would probably be much harsher on the pro-choice groups.
My folks didn't talk about it but neither were they strongly religious. Their political leanings, apart from their strong anti-communism, were generally left-of-center which I'm sure shaped my own political leanings. I would expect that people who grow up in strongly religious communities would feel strong societal pressure against getting an abortion despite it being legal.
I always think that civil discussions are the only ones that ever have a chance of accomplishing anything. Even where people disagree, as when you and I disagree about when the mind can first start to exist, civil discussions often reveal that the assumptions we might first make about our opponents might be wrong. There are good people on both sides, as well as selfish and unthinking people on both sides. Though I highly doubt that pro-choice and pro-life sides will ever reach a good compromise, at least with our current technologies, a lot can be gained by just understanding where the other side is coming from.",38,42,topic_stance_votes_2

I read the entire study. While assigning causation is always the most difficult things to establish, and, of course the authors were well aware of this difficulty, after adjusting for all confounders there is a strong relationship, suggestive of causation. It is not clear. The authors freely admitted that the young women (this was looking at women ages 15-25 only, with the youngest women the most affected) who were had the abortions had clearly different socioeconomic bcakgrounds that could explain the mental health problems, but those are the women that had the abortions.

45,Debate a signal of prochoice confusion and breakdown?,abortion,support,"I still don't agree,the study is flawed.And here is why.
You won't get the same results in the US because we don't have to prove mental illness to get an abortion.The control group for the study didn't have abortions.Seems to me the reason that a person would consider abortion would also cause depression and so forth not necessarily the abortion itself.Seeing that you have to prove mental illnes to get an abortion in NZ means that women who get abortion in NZ are mentally ill.",45,46,topic_stance_votes_2

Yeah, I have a weird view I guess. I grew up in a religious family (not overly religious I might add) yet I was pro-choice up until I went on to college (a few years into college). Too much time to think I suppose :p

48,Debate a signal of prochoice confusion and breakdown?,abortion,support,"You have a very good point there. I missed that. The authors state that they corrected for all the socioeconomics differences between the two groups. However, this could suggest that the women in the abortion group are selected specifically for pre-existing mental illness.
I know in the past, when abortion has been illegal, the wealthy could always get a physician to declare that the woman was ""psychiatrically unfit"" for pregnancy, hence a medical reason for abortion would be deemed necessary. I wonder how rigorous the NZ evaluation is. It may not be a factor, but I am suprised that that authors didn't even mention it.",46,49,topic_stance_votes_2

Dealing with flamers on either side can be a hard thing to handle. If I encounter a flamer whose post contains no point worth discussing, then I will generally ignore them (it is no fun on their side if no one is responding). However, sometimes a flamer might have a valid or interesting point hidden within otherwise beligerent irrationality. Then, it can be worth continuing the discussion but it really does try one's patience to refrain from responding back in a nasty way, and every so often I also lose my patience and respond back. My general hope is that the flamer will calm down enough to present a more well thought-out version of their opinions. Then, the real communication starts to happen.",48,50,topic_stance_votes_2
