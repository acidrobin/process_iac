I really didn't mean to XXXX your story off so lightly, but after all of the discussions on these very boards of science and evolution, it seemed to me that you might have had a bit more understanding of the process and theory.
Let me begin with three points: first, amoebas are actually quite advanced when compared to more primative life; second, amoebas do not ""mate"" since they are unicellular and reproduce by simple cell division; third, they require an aqueous or very moist environment to survive. To summarize: amoebas are not the ""first life"" or even close to it, amoebas do not mate with other organisms since they do not actually mate, and amoebas do not crawl onto land.
So what kind of organism might be successful on land? Certainly some of the algae are. My fence turns green with the algae bloom every summer. And certainly there are a myriad of protists and bacteria that exist on land. But can these be the source of organisms that mated ""there"" way to humans? That is doubtful because there is no evidence development on land.
But there is evidence for the evolution of fish into land animals. In my youth, it seemed obvious - there were lung fish that managed to move about on land. It must have been that lungs developed from the swim bladder of ray-finned fish. And those modified fins must have evolved into legs. But then the fossil story was filled in. It seems that the swim bladder evolved from the lungs of more primative fish. And the evidence indicates that legs didn't develop from fish crawling about on land, but legs developed in water, in organisms that were essentially bottom walking fish.
Look up the following: Eusthenopteron, Panderichthys, Elginerpeton, Ventastega, Metaxygnathus, Acanthostega, Ichthyostega, Hynerpeton, Greepeton, Tulerpeton.
That goes from water to land.

MICRO evolution, on the other hand is possible.

31,How did evolution happen?,evolution,support,"Back to the question of who determines the meaning of the terms scientists use. Just because Calli's little golden dictionary defines a word is not an indication that in some particular field of science the word is used much more specifically.
In my experience, we never used the terms macroevolution and microevolution. Among evolutionary biologists the words are rare since any such matters are covered by the context of the discussion. In discussing speciation it isn't necessary to make the distinction.
However, the words are used sometimes. And if you want to talk about the words that scientists use, then you Calli needs to use the meanings that scientists use. Microevolution (according to my dictionary of modern biology) is genetic change that occurs within populations of species as a result of progressive adaption to a changing environment. Futuyma, in his text Evolutionary Biology (3rd edition) calls it ""a vague term for slight, short-term evolutionary changes within species.
Macroevolution is defined as major evolutionary changes resulting in new species, genera, orders, and families. And Futuyma also says that macroevolution is a vague term for the evolution of great phenotypic changes, usually great enough to allocate the changed lineage and its descendants to a distinct species, genus or higher taxon.
So the question is not whether a dog is a dog, but whether it is a wolf. Where do we put that line? Dogs and wolfs are perfectly capable of interbreeding and they produce fertile offspring. How about coyotes? Foxes? Are red foxes and arctic foxes still just foxes? They don't even look alike.
How about cats? A cat is still a cat, but is a ocelot a lion? How about a tiger? Is a lion a tiger? They are interfertile.
What about Brown bears and Polar bears. A Polar bear, besides the characteristic of two layers of colorless fur, has a different shape to the head, teeth, ears, the neck is longer, the hind limbs (especially) are longer, the feet are webbed, and it is larger.

33,How did evolution happen?,evolution,support,"FreeThinker,
Are you trying to be funny or do you mean, by your name, that you are free from thought?
Right. What's a ""kind"". Creationists tell us that Noah took two of every ""kind"" onto the ark, and now you tell me that there are lots of ""kinds"" of bears. I guess that means that every one of the 5,000,000 species that exist today (not to mention those that no longer exist) were on the ark. Isn't it nice that you get to throw around words like ""kind"" without ever actually defining them? So tell me - what is a ""kind""?

Me too. Only a XXXXX would talk about scientific data as ""proof"" of anything. Perhaps if you knew what science is and how it works you wouldn't look so foolish.
Absolutely not! Fossils are data. The theories of evolution explain the data. What were you talking about?
What is a ""missing link?"" Once we find it, can it still be missing? I'm not sure what you are talking about.

I am sorry I confused you by using ""kind"" in two different ways. When I said ""kinds of bears"" I meant ""breeds"" or ""types."" Sorry about that...I'll try to be careful about that in the future. 
Karl, according to the Encyclopedia, a Panda is in the raccoon family. 
Someone mentioned ""Homo heidelbergensis"" or, Heidelberg Man. This ""missing link"" which is supposed to help connect apes to man, was built from a lower jaw with teeth...and LOTS of imagination. These fossil skeletons that are put together are almost always composites. Bones are taken from a certain area of a country, and are assumed that they are from the same creatures. Evolutionists take these bones from here and there, and ""compose"" a skeleton. Piltdown Man, Nebraska Man, Peking Man, Java Man, Heidelberg Man, and ""Lucy"" are all either ""composites"" or simply hoaxes.",1,36,topic_stance_votes_2
36,How did evolution happen?,evolution,support,"So then 2 dog breeds are different kinds?
Homo heidelbergensis is not just Heidelberg man. Tautaval man, a complete skull, is considered Homo heidelbergensis as well. As are other fossils considered homo sapiens archaic.
Hoax: Piltdown was a hoax refuted by scientists.
Hoax: Nebraska man was an illustration from a popular magazine. No scientists accepted it as a hominid ancestor.
Genuine: ""Peking Man"" is a series of more than a dozen partial craniums, including a few almost full skulls. Also found were many skeletal bones which were consistant (thicker than modern human) with other homo erectus finds.
Genuine: Java Man is a skullcap similar to other homo erectus fossils.
Genuine: Heidelberg man is neither a composite (it's only one piece) nor a hoax. It is a very large, robust jawbone with a receding chin.
Genuice: Some Creationists used to say that Lucy was from two different sites some 1.5 miles away. Of course, this is false, as the other fossil was a knee and was never applied to Lucy. Lucy is around chimp size, but has middle-range balance between arms and legs (chimps have long arms compared to their legs, humans less so, Lucy in between) and was bi-pedal, which chimps are not.
So it appears only two were hoaxes (the ones which scientists didn't accept and eventually debunked) and the rest were genuine. None were found ""all over a country and put together"".",1,37,topic_stance_votes_1

Your encyclopedia is out of date. DNA analysis indicates that while the Red Panda is related to the racoon family, the Giant Panda is related to bears. But of course, any such discussion from a creationist is silly and meaningless. They are obviously different kinds of animals and a no panda is the same kind as either a bear or a racoon. Why would you even say such a dumb thing?
As for your silly discussion of hominid fossils, wouldn't it be nice if you actually learned just a little bit about what you are talking about? Essentially all you had to say was, ""I just don't want to know that.""
If you are actually interested in learning I can suggest some reading.",1,38,topic_stance_votes_1
38,How did evolution happen?,evolution,attack,"Java man, huh? That is absolute speculation. Let's try to put it into perspective. Late last century a Dutch physician, Eugene Dubois, set sail to the Dutch East Indies (now called Indonesia). Completely enamoured by the theory of evolution, he had come to believe for some reason that he would find the elusive ‘missing link’ between humans and apes in that part of the world.
In 1892 on the island of Java, he found a thigh-bone, which to all intents and purposes was like that of modern humans. About a year earlier in the same location he had found a large skull-cap, and later three teeth. These were not necessarily from the same individual: the skullcap and the leg-bone were about 15 metres (50 feet) apart.
The creature from which the skullcap came appeared to have had a brain size of 900 cc (about two-thirds that of the average modern man—one must of course allow for the difficulty of estimating brain size from only a part of the skull). There is no reason to insist that the skullcap and the leg bone came from the same individual. But Dubois had found his ‘missing link’ and it eventually became widely accepted as such, in spite of the fact that a leading authority had identified two of the teeth as those of an orangutan, and the other as human.
‘Java man’ was trumpeted around the world as indisputable proof of human evolution. Textbooks and magazines were filled with fanciful reconstructing of ‘Java man’, who had been given the impressive-sounding scientific name of Pithecanthropus erectus (‘erect ape-man’).
Naturally, the bones did not show whether their owner (or owners) had much body hair or not. Yet drawings of ‘Java man’ all showed the required amount of hair, the usual club in the hand, and so on. Although no face bones had been found, suitably ‘half-ape, half-man’ features were reconstructed in artists’ drawings.
No suprise that of course it fits right into the world's anti-creation veiw.",1,39,topic_stance_votes_2
39,How did evolution happen?,evolution,support,"Yep. The tropics. It seems he was correct.
12 meters in fact. But why would you begin the discussion with the thigh bone? It isn't even considered as part of Java man but is, in fact, from a modern human. Oh, I see. You don't necessarily want to explain facts. You want to cast doubt on evolutionary theory and you need to twist the facts a bit to do so. Nice going. Carry on.
Please explain your experience in estimating brain size from skulls. Please explain tell us about the difficulty in estimating brain size from that part of the skull. Please, after allowing for these difficulties, how big do you think the brain was? Why were the paleontologists who estimated 900 cc wrong? By the way, it was about 940 cc.
But who insists that they do? Oh! Wait! I keep forgetting that your purpose isn't to explain facts but to make evolution look bad. So here you imply that paleontologists make this claim, when in fact they do not.
I'm sorry. Again, what is your point here? Why is it important to know that the teeth are not claimed to have come from the same individual as the skull. You mention the thigh bone first, even though it is from a modern human, and then you follow with teeth that aren't from the same fossil (they aren't claimed to be). Do you think that this somehow means that the skull cap doesn't exist?
By the way, none of the information that you have given came about because of any work done by ""creation science."" Everything you have said about the femur and the teeth were conclusions reached by real scientists who have studied the fossils (and not a holy book) and reached conclusions based on the evidence.
Actually all type fossils are given scientific names, and while this may be impressive-sounding to scientific illiterates, it is actually standard procedure. But more about reconstructions later.
I'm not sure what your point was here. Is it that you think reconstructions are supposed to be exact? Newspapers do that. They want pictures. If they just show the bones then the scientific illiterates mumble about how a pile of bones is supposed to tell them something.
You've got it backwards. Science doesn't care for or against about your creationist views. Because the mythology that you believe is history cannot be reconciled with the facts does not make science anti-creation. It does make your views anti-science.
By the way, why didn't you mention the Sangiran 2 fossil? It is an almost identical skull cap that is just a bit smaller at about 815 cc. And you didn't mention Sangiran 17, an almost complete skull with a brain size of about 1000 cc. Since the cranium is almost complete, that estimate is fairly close since there is no need to ""allow for"" the difficulty of estimating brain size from only a part of the skull. And you didn't mention that Sangiran 17 is not just a skull cap but a skull, complete with the face bones that you were so worried about. I'm sure that you know that both of these come from Java too from a site where the fossils of over 50 individual hominids have been found. Those in the upper layers are similar to the original Java discovery and are associated with stone tools.
I also wanted to call your attention to the picture below. This is the Java man skull cap overlaid on the complete skull of Turkana boy. Since you are so familiar with this group of fossils, I'm sure that you know that Turkana boy is an almost complete skeleton, missing only the hands and feet.
http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/overlay1.jpg
Also compare the shape of a modern human skull.
http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/sapiens.gif
Well, at least you didn't claim that this was a gibbon since gibbons have a brain size of about 97 cc. But on the other hand, you don't offer a reasonable explanation of what Java man is. Obviously not a modern human and obviously not an ape.
By the way, do you understand the meaning of the word ""speculation?"" Please explain why unquestioned mythology is better than tested scientific theories. Please explain how scientific theories are ""speculation.""
By the way, if you actually want to learn something, I know two paleoanthropologists who would probably be willing to come here and discuss this with you and answer your questions.

Archy is still a form combining reptilian and avian features. The fossil you speak of -protoavis- was put together with a series of horribly crushed bone fragments and its status as bird is questioned by many. Additionally, if protoavis is a true bird, it just pushes bird evolution back. There is no requirement for Archy to be the sole transitional to avian forms.
The most recent forms -like modern humans- are only found at the top. The simplest forms -like trilobytes and the like- are found at the bottom. Creation would predict that all creatures would be found at all levels.

But you haven't looked. You may claim that your god did it, and no evidence to support or deny that can be offered. The assertion relies on miracle and has no suporting evidence. But when you start talking about how your god did it, your claims can be debunked by facts. Certainly the mythology of ancient nomadic herdsmen is not accurate. If you look at the world and the history of the world the is evident in the geologic strata, then you can see that the earth is very old, and you can see a succession of organisms through time. When considered with other fields of science from genetics to biogeography to physiology and anatomy, evolution becomes apparent. 
Didn't you read my reply? Your comment was nothing more than a statement of your lack of belief. If you can't post something of substance, then why bother? ""I don't believe it"" isn't really something that can be answered.
Since the original point was not specifically about bones, you are being dishonest. As a matter of fact, there are some ichthyosaur fossils that preserve the shape of the animal quite well. And whether you are aware of it or not there is a lot that can be told by looking at bones, teeth, fins and the general morphology of an animal.
Can't do it in a nutshell. Your level of knowledge is so limited that it will take considerable explaining. How about this? Suppose that a fossil is found that is the lower half of a femur and the upper half of a tibia. Of course you couldn't tell anything about that. But someone who has studied such things (like paleontologists, paleoanthropologists) can immediately recognize such a fossil as coming from an anthropoid. Such bones simply don't look like they are from cattle or carnivores. Suppose that the tibia has two concave surfaces where the joint would be. Suppose that the femur has to convex surfaces that align with the concave surfaces. Suppose that when they are aligned that the tibia and femur do not form a striaght line, that the femur from hip to knee would have angled inward. Such things are very characteristic of the lifestyle of that organism. Even without any other bones, those characteristics definitively indicate a most important feature of such an organism. By the way, Donald Johanson found a fossil like the one I describe above in 1973 near Hadar, Ethiopia. You don't know what the characteristics I described mean, do you? But then, you think that you can't tell much from bones.
So here is a problem for anyone who can answer. What characteristic would the above features of that fossil show? By the way, the same characteristic can be recognized in the other end of the femur - by the neck and head of the hip. Also from the pelvis, sacrum, and the spine.
Lets talk about another fossil. Suppose you find a skull. It has a small brain case, sloping forehead, heavy brow ridges, wide nose, projecting lower face, receding chin. Now you turn the fossil skull over and there right under the skull is the foramen magnum, the hole where the spine attached. The position of the foramen magnum under the skull tells you conclusively something about the lifestyle of this fossil. Do you know what that is?
No doubt it would be better than actually investing any effort into learning what you claim to oppose.
What did you say? How can I contradict ""huh-uh""? I know, uh-huh. There. Now you've been contradicted.
All in all, there is a lot that can be learned from bones. You can see where muscles attached and you can tell the size of the muscles from how big the attachment points are. You can tell the size of the animal from the bones. Big bones mean big bodies. You can tell a lot about the diet from the teeth. Only a complete dunce wouldn't be aware that cow teeth don't resemble cat teeth. That even applies to dinosaurs.

67,How did evolution happen?,evolution,support,"It is actually extremely simple and can be explained easily.
Planets naturally change over time. Sometimes a planet will change to a state that allows for a little thing called life. 
The conditions that earth has had for around 4 billion are at that state. 
With these conditions the sun's rays will automatically make life in water in the form of microbes. The microbes will adapt and change as their environment changes around them over many years(we all know environments change). They adapt to better suit that environment whatever it may be. Some microbes will spread and end up in different environments than their ancestors and they will change to suit that environment, now they won't look like their ancestors because they have adapted to their new environment. 
This is how life began and it undoubtedly has happened on many planets all over the universe. 
To understand how todays animals came about is very simple. Look at the herbivores of africa.
You can see that a giraffe is related to a gazelle simply by looking at them. Their common ancestor would have been more gazelle looking than giraffe. They would have grazed on grasses. As gazelles grew up and formed their own family's they would need to travel to find food because the food at their birthplace would be in short supply on account of the other gazelles there. So they would form groups and go in search of food, they would eventually have realised there is also food on the braches of trees. Some gazelles would be content to keep eating grasses because there is enough grass for them but not enough for all, the ones that missed out would start eating leaves. Some leaves would be above their heads so they would have to reach up and it would be difficult so over millions of years they would evolve slightly longer necks, and longer and longer. This process takes a long time and the way it happens is simple. An animal is born with a slightly longer neck, just a tiny bit, but it survives and breeds, another is animal that is born without the slightly longer neck is killed by a predator so its genes don't get passed on in that herd. The longer necked animals keep being successful until and so their descendants necks get longer and longer because it has been proven that works. It takes such a long time but it would and did happen. 
We humans have the ability to perform our own sped up version of evolution on domestic animals. Dogs came from one animal that looked a certain way. But humans can pick a hairier dog out of a litter, he can make that hairy dog mate with a another particularly hairy dog he got out of another litter, the litter from these two dogs will be hairier than the litters they came from. The same can be done with any charecteristic you wish, large skull, loose skin, anything. This is how different breeds of dogs were made, human assisted evolution, this is a fact. It is obvious then that all animals came about this way but with out a guide, it just took a longer time. 
It is obvious that whales came from hippo like creatures, hippos came from the same creature but their ""family"" was successful and kept doing what they were doing. Some of the hippo type creatures branched out and went into the ocean, they would have needed to keep coming back to shore and this is impractical so nature has a way of straightening things out by evolving the hippo-like creatures into whales using natural selection. 
In the end, if there is a god, it is the sun, or the ocean, or the air, or maybe they are all gods, and of course I guess the universe is a god too because it is has made this all possible.

We're not too sure of the process that was followed, but replicating molecules have been formed by random processes in the lab, as well as all the necessary organic molecules and amino acids. Once they are replicating, then those that acquire and use resources best will become more frequent. But a microbe is still fairly complex.
But, of course, the origin of the sun or the planets are not matters of evolution. Generally, the term ""evolution"" is taken to mean biological evolution. Evey though you may hear about stelar evolution or the evolution of planets, in those contexts the word means change only. It isn't related to biological evolution, which is restricted to changes in populations of living organisms.
The microbes will adapt and change as their environment changes around them over many years(we all know environments change). They adapt to better suit that environment whatever it may be. Some microbes will spread and end up in different environments than their ancestors and they will change to suit that environment, now they won't look like their ancestors because they have adapted to their new environment.
Gosh! I could have skipped all of that study about zoology, botany, ecology, embryology, genetics and even that course in evolution and spent 5 minutes to understand the whole thing. I learned that evolution required changes in the genetic make-up of populations of living things. I learned that there were several mechanisms that caused the changes in the genetic makeup - most important being mutation an natural selection. 
This is how life began and it undoubtedly has happened on many planets all over the universe. 
I think you may have left a bunch out. And of course, since we have a grand total of zero evidence one way or the other, I think that it is pushing it a bit to claim that it has ""undoubtedly"" happened on many planets.
To understand how todays animals came about is very simple. Look at the herbivores of africa.
All of them? Even the rhinos and elephants and zebras?
You can see that a giraffe is related to a gazelle simply by looking at them.
I can? I don't think they look all that much alike. Personally, I think that most of the other members of the family Bovidae look more like a gazelle than a giraffe does. Animals like the dik-dik, impala, and eland. Of course, the giraffe doesn't belong to the Bovidae, but the Giraffidae. The only other member of that family is the okapi, which does have somewhat of a resemblence to a giraffe.
Their common ancestor would have been more gazelle looking than giraffe. They would have grazed on grasses. As gazelles grew up and formed their own family's they would need to travel to find food because the food at their birthplace would be in short supply on account of the other gazelles there. So they would form groups and go in search of food, they would eventually have realised there is also food on the braches of trees. Some gazelles would be content to keep eating grasses because there is enough grass for them but not enough for all, the ones that missed out would start eating leaves. Some leaves would be above their heads so they would have to reach up and it would be difficult so over millions of years they would evolve slightly longer necks, and longer and longer. This process takes a long time and the way it happens is simple. An animal is born with a slightly longer neck, just a tiny bit, but it survives and breeds, another is animal that is born without the slightly longer neck is killed by a predator so its genes don't get passed on in that herd. The longer necked animals keep being successful until and so their descendants necks get longer and longer because it has been proven that works. It takes such a long time but it would and did happen.
Wow! It's all so simple. Why do you think that the animal with the slightly shorter neck would be killed? How does the longer neck prevent the predator from killing the animal? In other words, what makes the longer necked animals more successful?
We humans have the ability to perform our own sped up version of evolution on domestic animals. Dogs came from one animal that looked a certain way. But humans can pick a hairier dog out of a litter, he can make that hairy dog mate with a another particularly hairy dog he got out of another litter, the litter from these two dogs will be hairier than the litters they came from. The same can be done with any charecteristic you wish, large skull, loose skin, anything. This is how different breeds of dogs were made, human assisted evolution, this is a fact. It is obvious then that all animals came about this way but with out a guide, it just took a longer time.
It's called artificial selection. But of course, such selection is limited to the characteristics that exist. You don't tell us where these differences that are selected come from. How did one dog get to be hairier than another?
By the way, real evolution did have a guide. That is why animals in the wild appear to be so well designed for the environments in which they live. But of course, that guide isn't at first obvious. It took Darwin and Wallace to see it - and then Huxley commented, ""Of course, how stupid of me not to have noticed.""
It is obvious that whales came from hippo like creatures, hippos came from the same creature but their ""family"" was successful and kept doing what they were doing.
Actually not. The ancestors of whales looked little like hippos. But both do belong to the order Artiodactyla. They probably separated some 50 to 60 million years ago. Any resemblance between them at the level of gross anatomy is more the result of the way they live now than to ancestry. But there is some resemblance in certain bones (ankles) between hippos and some whale ancestors.
Some of the hippo type creatures branched out and went into the ocean, they would have needed to keep coming back to shore and this is impractical so nature has a way of straightening things out by evolving the hippo-like creatures into whales using natural selection.
Really? Then I don't understand why it is that crocodiles were pretty good dinosaur eating machines and they still have legs and they still come back to land and they look remarkably the same now as they did well over 100 million years ago. Why do you think that nature didn't straighten them out? And I'll mention again, whale ancestors didn't look all that much like hipos. 
In the end, if there is a god, it is the sun, or the ocean, or the air, or maybe they are all gods, and of course I guess the universe is a god too because it is has made this all possible.
Thats how I like to think anyway, the earth and the sun and the universe are ""gods"" in a sense. But its still all scientific.

69,How did evolution happen?,evolution,support,"The short and sweet is that we know evolution happened. We have ample fossil evidence, transitional forms, genetic evidence of mechanisms, and evidence in our own human genome, and human embryology. This is FACT.
Did it happen chance, or by the action of a hypothetical God?
It may be none of the above. Evolution is perhaps an inevitable series of changes in complex matter triggered by changing environments. The Big Bang itself has no known cause and we don't know. It may be a property of the cosmos that universes pop out like bubble from the fabric of vacuum by mechanisms we don't yet understand. We know that particles pop out of nothing.
So it may be a natural property of the cosmos that universes pop out of a singularity, even though we don't have the explanation yet or never.
To invent a God is simply the same as my saying ""I don't know."" There is no evidence for any gods ever. And we can explain just about everything since the Big Bang without a God hypothesis.
There is no justification for postulating something called God. We have no definition of god. There could be three kinds of God.
1. An anthropomorphic God, JHWH, Allah, who is a Giant cosmic human being that is omnipotent, but he has human traits and flaws (capriciousness, jealousy, love and hate, cruelty, mercy, and unmercifulness, fits of rage, violence, and klling. He is vindicitive inventing Hell for those who don't believe in him. That is omni-insecurity. He is so improbable as to be considered non-existent.
2. God could be a non-human, conscious entity, that is unknowable. He would not be a he or she. He/She would not be insecure and need worship, would not invent a hell for unbelievers. Being unknowable makes the question of his existence irrelevant.
3. God is non-conscious, non-cognitive, inanimate. It could be a human metaphor for the natural process or processes that belch out universes, and is the summation of the properties of matter and energy that inevitably lead to evolution when the planetary conditions are appropriate by sheer odds. A sun with 9 to 20 planets varying from too close to too far may likely have one or more planets in the zone where liquid water can exist with the right ingredients, gravitation, and temperature to form life. This is my view.

You're grasping for straws here friend, by mixing two separate theories of how life was seeded here on Earth. 
As to what ""organic matter"" contaminated the original experiment Frontline did not give the exact material, but they did trace the source of the CO2 to the supplier and said that improper filtration at the collection of the gas was the culpret. Personally I think they give Miller and Urey more credit than I would. 
However the organic material got in, it is true that the experiment was later tried again, this time more carefully, and it did produce amino acids - neither of which are among the buildng blocks of life. After subsequent studies showed that the Earth's atmosphere was much more oxygen rich than had been previously thought, later experiments were spectacularly unsuccessful in developing amino acids, so much so that competing theories of how the proper combinations of the correct amino acids did come about have been offered - including the seeding of the Earth by comets and meteors, and underwater geothermal vents.

I just gave you two dictionary definitions. Saying that ""macro is just an accumulation of micros"" is the most hilarious thing I have ever heard. Dogs are an example of microevolution. There are so many different types, shapes, colors, etc. But they are still dogs. You can breed a chihuahua to a great dane and they could have puppies. Macroevolution, however, says that things increase in complexity as they ""evolve"". (New organs, limbs, etc.) This has never been shown to be true.
Ignarance is bliss ans so I feel somewhat bad in reducing the level of bliss in your life by informing you that a chihuahua and a great dane cannot breed sucessfully and have viable offspring. Even if the Dane was the mom and the Chihuahua was the dad, the embryos abort early in development. In fact the only reason that the two are considered the same species is that there is a breeding chain that links them. You can breed a Chihuahua with a slightly bigger dog and so on up untill you get to the great dane. However lets assume that all medium dogs were killed, then the two dogs that you mentioned would be considered, by the definition of a speices that you are using, to be different species.
If you want to know why they cannot breed and have offspring I will tell you. During sexual reproduction a half set of chromasomes is recieved from each parent. Thus the child recieves a full set of chromasomes. In the case mentioned here one set is from a great dane and the other from a chihuahua. The genes in the dane's set encode for very large body structures and the ones from the chi. encode for very small ones so you can see that they are quite different. The conflict from the genes is too great and the embryo is inviable.

Scientists who study evolution are known as evolutionary biologists. Those who accept evolutionary theory as the best explanations for the observed data are sometimes called evolutionists.

Yet another unnamed fossil.
That's a bit general, don't you think? What do you mean by similar. You are demonstrating your ignorance of the topic. Sadly, you don't seem to have the integrity to learn what science is or what evolutionary theory claims. It's just great that you can invent a cartoon version to argue against, but what have you accomplished? You only make yourself look foolish.
Moreover, only scientific illiterates speak about proof when discussing science. Maybe it slopped over from an obsession you have with distilled spirits. ""Proof"" is a proper term in that case. It is also proper in mathematics and philosophy. Not in science. But I could beat my gums forever and you wouldn't understand. It would first require a grasp of the basics of science.
Actually, it isn't. It is complex and complicated. It requires diligent study of difficult concepts. But when you grasp the basics, it does become evident. But most creationists aren't willing to put in the effort.
What are you talking about? Have you ever taken a course in biology? Have you ever taken a science course? In my experience, chanting is a religious exercise. Never did I chant when studying biology or when teaching biology. I have chanted as a religious exercise - which had nothing to do with reason or logic - but it was fun.
Only scientific illiterates state that the Miller/Urey experiments are proof. It only demonstrates that you don't understand science or the experiments. By the way, Miller/Urey isn't relevant to evolutionary theory. That isn't evolutionary biology but biochemistry.
My first impulse is to agree that the ""building blocks of 'life'"" were created by a spontaneous process in a laboratory. Over the last 3 decades it has been done countless times with countless initial conditions. But those ""building blocks"" are amino acids.and they have been found in meteors.
But things have progressed far beyond that stage in the decades since. One wonders (and laughs) at an argument that is over 30 years old and has been verified so many times. Amino acids have been shown to form spontaneously under a variety of conditions and have eveb been found in meteors. Ain't no big whoop. Self replicating molecules have been formed in the lab. Lipid membranes have been spontaneously produced.
But none of that is evolution. And that only demonstrates your ignorance. Evolutionary theory deals with living organisms or once living organisms.

Zooming in on Noah's Ark? Satellites Search for Ancient Artifact

WASHINGTON -- Military and private satellite snapshots of Mount Ararat in eastern Turkey reveal an anomaly that researchers say might be the remains of Noah's Ark. 
A soon-to-be-launched commercial spacecraft will focus powerful cameras on the mysterious mountainside oddity to help unravel its true nature.
In the past, expeditions permitted to search the area for what some claim are the ruins of Noah's Ark, while failing to conclusively prove its existence, have succeeded in sustaining debate. The area itself is a geopolitical and religious hot spot, with Mount Ararat sitting in the far eastern frontier of Turkey, near the borders of Armenia, Georgia (formerly part of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the USSR) and Iran.

SPACE.com's Universal Viewer 
Even the late Apollo 15 moonwalker James Irwin was repeatedly drawn to Mount Ararat in hopes of finding Ark wreckage. Through his High Flight Foundation, a non-profit evangelical organization based in Colorado Springs, the former astronaut made six treks to Mount Ararat in an unsuccessful quest to find remains of the ark. 
Irwin's last expedition in 1990 ran into trouble. Turkish police detained him following allegations that he engaged in spying while looking for the Ark. Since 1991, the mountain has been closed due to Turkish military operations against Kurdish rebels in the area. 
Today the exploration of 17,000-foot Mount Ararat and the search for Noah's Ark has moved to higher ground -- thanks to high-tech satellite flyovers.
Flood of data
To get up to speed on this search, it helps to start with the Bible.
Noah was instructed by God to save his family and the world's animals during a great flood that would cover the Earth. To do so, Noah built a large vessel, an ark. What followed was a pouring rain lasting 40 days and 40 nights. According to the Book of Genesis, as the Great Flood receded, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.
Now jump to 1949.
An image from the June 19, 1949 U.S. Air Force Mission that captured a panoramic
view of what is simply called ""the Ararat Anomaly"".
Aircraft imagery of Mount Ararat taken in June of that year and analyzed by U.S. intelligence officials includes a unique feature at the 15,500-foot level on the Northwestern Plateau. Then in 1973 and 1976, through the lenses of classified satellites, this ""whatever-it-is"" also purportedly stirred up the same community. 
""It's called the 'Ararat Anomaly',"" said Porcher Taylor, an assistant professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia, and an expert in satellite imaging diplomacy and the news media. He has been gathering evidence on the novel feature since 1993, including a set of those 1949 aerial shots of the area, now declassified.
Taylor said that arguments have erupted within intelligence circles for decades as to what truly has been seen on Mount Ararat. 
""Debates center on whether or not it's a strange rock formation, a crashed airplane, perhaps a fortress or some other structure hundreds of years old or maybe something more interesting of potentially biblical proportions,"" Taylor told SPACE.com. Certain individuals in the know, he added, believe what is visible in certain satellite pictures is the bow of a ship sticking out of a glacier.
The anomaly is apparently more than 600-feet long (183 meters), Taylor said, at least that part of it jutting out as seen in aerial and satellite imagery. One expert, a naval engineer and architect, when looking at the photos believes ""prongs"" or ""ribs"" of the keel of an ancient marine structure can be identified, he said.
Divided interpretation
Taylor recently took his plight to The Washington Times Corporation, publisher of Insight Magazine. That publication helped fund special snapping sessions using Space Imaging's private satellite, IKONOS 2. 
On four separate dates starting in October 1999 into the summer of 2000, photos of the mountain were taken by IKONOS and processed by Space Imaging, based in Thornton, Colorado.
Space Imaging's Ikonos 2 can resolve objects as small as 3.3 feet (1 meter) across.
IKONOS pictures snapped over Mount Ararat then were contrasted with the aircraft photos taken in 1949.
A seven-person team of independent scientists and analysts scrutinized the batch of images. While clearly the photos show some type of feature, the team was divided in their interpretation. While some felt the anomaly could be human-made, others voted for rock or deferred to inconclusive data, Taylor said.
One team member concluded the anomaly had apparently shifted, suggesting that its composition was foreign and not a chunk of the mountain. IKONOS imagery confirms that the anomaly is ""broken"" in several places.
""The color of the anomaly is uniquely different from the surrounding strato-volcanic rock. The anomaly seems to be very smooth in texture as compared to the jagged rocks,"" Taylor said. 
If it's human-made, then what is it? By using satellites, such as IKONOS, the saga has become a ""space-based Indiana Jones,"" Taylor says.
Ikonos captured this image of the alleged site of Noah's Ark on August 6, 2000.
The annotation show's how this find differs from the anomaly captured in 1949. 
'Ark-eology' via satellite
The next step in the search for the Ark takes to the air, quite literally, is just a handful of weeks.
The QuickBird 2 satellite is ready for launch on October 18 from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. If successfully orbited, it will become the world's highest resolution commercial satellite. 
Operated by EarthWatch Incorporated in Longmont, Colorado, QuickBird 2 can focus on objects down to nearly 20-inches (one-half meter) across. Taylor requested and then received an OK from the firm that they will point the spacecraft's imaging system at the feature in question on Mount Ararat. 
""They are going after it,"" Taylor said.
""As of now we plan to take images ? but have not solidified exactly when we will work his requests into our overall mission planning,"" said Chuck Herring, EarthWatch spokesman.
""Whether we do it in calibration or during commercial operations, we will work with him as it fits in our mission plan,"" Herring told SPACE.com.
Seeing is not easy
Extremely heavy daily cloud cover and perhaps large buildups of snow at the site make it almost impossible for hikers, planes or satellites to see anything -- unless there is a major avalanche, high-velocity wind, glacial meltdown or dissipation of clouds.
""This is a unique and unexplored site on the mountain,"" Taylor said. Nearly 99 percent of all Ark hunters, researchers, expeditions to Ararat have been to the Ahora Gorge. That is on the other side of the mountain, he said.
Time is of the essence, with winter closing in, Taylor said. Moreover, as more commercial satellite capability becomes available, there is increased chance that the anomaly will be identified. 
In particular, hyperspectral imagery from space offers great promise. 
All natural and human-made materials on the surface of the Earth have a unique signature of reflected light from the Sun. This signature is more detailed than can be captured by a conventional camera or the human eye. Hyperspectral sensors can measure this signature and actually identify materials from space. 
What if the ""Ararat Anomaly"" turns out to be less than a Biblical blast from the past?
""I would consider it a great victory either way,"" Taylor said. ""Everybody should realize that the world is truly transparent. The commercialization of space is a direct peace dividend of the Cold War and our space-based military satellites.""
""As for the anomaly,"" Taylor said, ""what it is ? is what it is ? no matter what it is.""",108,110,topic_stance_votes_2

Its the black knight approach to victory.
To excerpt the relevant summary from WIKI:
=======================================
In the film, King Arthur (Graham Chapman), accompanied by his trusty serf/steed Patsy (Terry Gilliam), is traveling through a forest when he enters a clearing and observes a fight taking place between a Black Knight (John Cleese) and a Green Knight (Gilliam again) by a bridge over a small stream. After an exhausting fight, the Green Knight decides to run straight at the Black Knight with an axe, arms above his head. The Black Knight throws his sword through the Green Knight's helm's eye slot. The Green Knight thus slain, Arthur and Patsy ride up to the Black Knight to congratulate him and invite him to join the Knights of the Round Table at Camelot. The Knight is silent and does not acknowledge their presence. Arthur regrets this, (""You make me sad. So be it.""), and makes to continue his journey over the bridge, which the Knight then prevents, (""None shall pass.""). Arthur attempts to negotiate, but the Knight does not move.
Another sword fight takes place between the Knight and Arthur, which is interrupted when Arthur chops off one of the Knight's arms. The Knight denies the injury, protesting, ""'tis but a scratch!"" Arthur points out that the Knight has just lost an arm, which the knight categorically denies again. When Arthur points out the Knight's severed arm lying on the ground, the Knight contemplates it for a moment, then smoothly replies ""I've had worse."", then Arthur replies, ""You Liar!"", and resumes the attack. The Knight eventually loses his other arm and his sword as well. Arthur kneels to pray, thanking God for his apparent victory, but the Knight begins kicking Arthur, yelling, ""Have at you!"". Arthur (trying to make the Knight see sense) says, ""Look you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left,"" to which the Knight replies, ""Yes I have"". Arthur cries ""Look"", pointing the Black Knight's dismembered arm. ""It's just a flesh wound"", retaliates the Knight and continues to kick and taunt Arthur. He loses one leg to Arthur's sword, but insists on continuing the fight, hopping about on his remaining leg and crying, ""Right! I'll do you for that! Come here!"" Arthur, completely fed up by this point, sarcastically remarks, ""What are you going to do, bleed on me?"", to which the Knight screams, ""I'm invincible!"" Arthur retorts, ""You're a loony!"" The Knight is still intent on fighting Arthur, hopping up against him and madly proclaiming, ""The Black Knight always triumphs! Have at you!"" Arthur finally hacks off the Knight's remaining leg.
After Arthur has hacked off all of his limbs, the knight looks down at what remains of his body, then looks up at Arthur who congenially declares ""All right, we'll call it a draw."" Arthur and Patsy resume their journey, while the Knight fumes impotently at them. ""Running away, eh?! You yellow bastards, come back here and take what's coming to you! I'll bite your legs off!""[1]

I'll tell you what, PROVE IT!!! I challenge you to prove it didn't happen. And here's a link of archaeological evidence that say's otherwise about the accuracy of the bible. The only evidence you can produce of anything is that A) Talk and accusations are cheap, and 2) the only ancient artifacts that you'll accept as valid are reflected through the prism of your fairy tale of the evolutionary myth. You can without reservation reject evidence that is only a few thousand years old as incredible or fraudulent while arguing that pieces of bones guesstimated to be a hundred million years old are as reliable as this mornings newspaper. Which by the way, those of us with a sense of discernment realize is also slanted and manipulated by the Left.

149,How did evolution happen?,evolution,support,"From WIKI:
Truthiness is a satirical term popularized by television comedian Stephen Colbert[1] to describe things that a person claims to know intuitively or ""from the gut"" without regard to evidence, logic, intellectual examination, or actual facts. Colbert created this definition of the word during the inaugural episode (October 17, 2005) of his satirical television program The Colbert Report, as the subject of a segment called The Wørd. It was named Word of the Year for 2005 by the American Dialect Society and for 2006 by Merriam-Webster.

Consciousness is intangible, it's an energy force. Everything which surrounds us is a form of energy. Think of anything, read the scientific views on what you are thinking about and you will discover it breaks down to a form of energy. The energy within everything is it's consciousness. Consciousness creates form, manifests itself to a particular form. Every human being is just an energy system. Take any part of yourself and look at it under a strong enough microscope and you will find it consists of atoms, and molecules, take a look at any solid object and you will find it consists of atoms and molecules,take a look at any liquid, or gas, and you will find it is made of atoms, and molecules, these are scientific facts. Each atom is alive, it's an energy form, your consciousness transforms your atomic structure to meet the requirements of the enviroment in which you exsist. This explains why people have different colour skin, and why elephants have big ears, and why fish have fins, etc. Effectively our individual consciousness derives from a greater consciousness, a universal consciousness which some people call GOD.",15,155,topic_stance_votes_2

Really? Wow, I didn’t know that… books with their edjumacational benefits...
Deffinition: Intangible - nonmaterial: lacking material qualities, and so not able to be touched or seen. 
To the best of our knowledge consciousness seems to be [basically] chemical reactions and electrical activity, clearly material activity. This is at least what Neuroscience seems to consider the most probable explanation. 
Oh, I get it… Flashlights and I-Pods have souls and consciousness. 
That really makes absolutely no sense. 
No, this shows that everything is made of atoms, it doesn’t give any reasons to why they are the way they are.

This then leaves them with a stark choice, drop the religious stuff or go insane. It does get quite scary as they become seriously irrational, (Trust me, nothing you've seen here comes close to depths of insanity fundies can be pushed to.) and you're relying that they will have some sort of cut off point where reality will dawn on them and they realise they're talking bollocks.",169,171,topic_stance_votes_1

No... no they don't. They do not have a direct effect on genetics! 
There is plenty of evidence to suggest other animals besides humans are capable of using a thought process to solve conflicting issues. Since you seem so mentally deprived I will give a simple example that even a child could understand... Dogs, able to be taught complex tricks and remember commands which of course involves some form of thought process able to differentiate many commands.
Even though plants have no consciousness...
