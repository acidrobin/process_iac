Kudos to the Libyan court for ignoring scientific and expert mumbo jumbo. After all, what could possibly be more reliable than a confession obtained under torture?
It occurs to me that this is actually kind of scary, since our own justice system seems to parallel this in many cases. Capture somebody who seems suspicious, then torture them until they confess. The only real difference would seem to be that in Libya, they have the right to an open and public trial regardless of circumstances, the nature of the crime, or the nationality of the accused. In the US, there are no such gaurantees for certain accused individuals.
With the super neat changes that we have made to our system, this could happen RIGHT HERE in the US...the only difference being that there would be no international outcry because, unlike syria, we could do it secretly...the public would never have to know...an obvious improvement over syrias legal system.",0,1,topic_stance_votes_2

This issue seems to have fallen by the wayside already. I'm under the impression they will be held like they have been in the past unless a lot more noise is made about it.",1,2,topic_stance_votes_1
