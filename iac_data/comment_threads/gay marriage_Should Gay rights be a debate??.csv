I agree with all of you I don't think we should have to debate about gay people. Its almost like going back in time and debating about blacks being free.

15,Should Gay rights be a debate??,gay marriage,attack,"Striel-
Excellent point. Liberals, politicians, tree-huggers, etc. condemn people who do not particularly like homosexuals or the homosexual lifestyle and state that homosexuals have the freedom to do whatever they want. However, they are violating the freedom of others when they try to pass laws that put people in jail for making fun of homosexuals, making homosexual slurs, or speaking against homosexuality. The hypocrisy and stupidity of our nation today, eh? Interesting, huh? Walking up to a black person and yelling something like ""BURN IN HELL, YOU NIGGER"" is just someone exercising their free speech rights, but walking up to a homosexual and saying ""BURN IN HELL, YOU XXXXXX"" is likely to get you put in jail. Foolish people...
I generally don't mind homosexuals. Stay out of my way, and I won't give a XXXX which gender you prefer in bed. I do, however, think males kissing each other on TV or in public is rather nasty (I don't mind females, though, God help me :() but I have the freedom to think what I want to think, no law or document is going to force me to think that homosexuality is not nasty or is not a sin.",1,16,topic_stance_votes_2

18,Should Gay rights be a debate??,gay marriage,attack,"Katie, there are still many people who take the Bible as being the end all authority to everything. Many of those people interpret parts of bible scripture as being against homosexuality. That is ONE reason some people are against gays, they think it goes against God. Others just think it is ""gross"".

24,Should Gay rights be a debate??,gay marriage,support,"Diffrent religious groups do not have diffrent rights. Although alot of people dislike that group simply because they are that religion, without really knowing them. For example Neo Nazi's dislike blacks and jews simply because they are. Its stupid and wrong. 
Gay rights should not be a debate, because theres not really alot to debate about.
Equal rights for every race, religion, and sexual oreintation.
A main argument for people who are against gays say its against Gods will and is immoral. 
To have laws preventing rights of gays, based on that argument, is a violation of the church and state agreement. 
I don't think a further explination is required.

Anyway, to the question I believe Katie was asking, which is ""Why do I like girls?"" Because it is a decision I made. That is my point in this debate.

LOL
- - -- - -- - - - - - - - 
Gay rights should not be a debate, does anyone disagree. Its a decision that people make. Its wrong to discriminate over things such as these. Saying its not, implies things like liberals rights should be a debate, or black rights should be a debate, etc....
As I have stated in previous posts, the main argument against gays is that its ""immoral and against gods will"". This is ridiculous because of the seperation between church and state.

33,Should Gay rights be a debate??,gay marriage,support,"SilentPoet, I disagree with you.
I think gay rights should be a debate as long as there are people who believe that those who are gay should not have equal rights.
If the government said, ""You voted for a democrat, so you don't deserve equal rights,"" I would be in defense of democrats, even though I am generally a republican.
If the government said, ""You are a Jew, so you don't deserve equal rights,"" I would be in defense of Jews, even though I am a Christian.
People want the government to say, ""You are gay, so you don't deserve equal rights."" I stand up in defense of gays, even though I am not one.
As long as people push for the final statement, I will continue to debate in favor of gay rights.",1,34,topic_stance_votes_1

Gay rights is a debate.
Just as everyone rights are a debate for stupid various reasons.
The question I think at hand is, should it be a debate.
Christians rights SHOULD NOT be a debate
Jews rights SHOULD NOT be a debate
Liberals rights SHOULD NOT be a debate
Blacks rights SHOULD NOT be a debate
etc.....
katie,
""sooo very quick question....whos all for gay rigts and who's not...simple yes or no question.""

Its ok, I definitley didn't want to sound like I was angry I was just trying to highlight my point.
Does anyone on here acctaully think that humanity should debate gay rights? 
Its just another form of racism, sexism, etc...
As wjim said we must debate them and defend the rights of others if persecuted, but I'd like to know if anyone on here wants to persecute gays and their rights. If so... why?

44,Should Gay rights be a debate??,gay marriage,attack,"A one-trick pony, it seems.
I do not think we should debate the rights of homosexuals even if they do support NAMBLA. That does mean they should have a right to legally perform the acts which NAMBLA supports. They simply have a right to believe what they wish.
I believe, given the proper circumstances, vengeance through murder should be legal, but that does not make it right, and that does not mean I have a right to act upon this belief.
