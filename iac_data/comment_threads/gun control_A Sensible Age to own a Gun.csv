We don't have the problem the USA has with ever more youthful drug dealers and school shootings. But your country is not wanting to stop those. Are they?
I am talking about the age being 18 to own a gun not Kids as Young as 11,

a realistc age for gun ownership and military service 
Your post sAYING ANY AGE Is more than the ######## you always go on about. Its evil.
You want to see the killing of our kids as well 
Your insulting remark about military service also shows your

and some of Your Wars

And At least we all vote here at an early age.

Our problem with crime is that we are way too lenient with young, first-time offenders. We give them too many chances before we lock them up for a long time.
Most violent crime is committed by a very small percentage of the population. Lock up that small percentage --or as many of them as we can catch-- and crime rates would plummet.

16,A Sensible Age to own a Gun,gun control,attack,"Let me enter this discussion.
I believe U.S. v. Miller is a case wrongly decided; but it cannot be read to protect only the RKBA of militia members. Miller was a bootlegger. He was a private citizen who was not a member of any state militia. If the Miller court wanted to limit the RKBA to only members of state organized militias, it would have dismissed his second amendment claim by saying something like this: “The defendant is not a member of a state organized militia, and is therefore not a member of that class of persons the amendment protects. Therefore, he lacks standing to pursue a claim that his second amendment rights have been infringed.” 
Additionally, this is how the Miller Court defined the militia:
”The signification attributed to the term Militia appears from the debates in the Convention, the history and legislation of the Colonies and the States, and the writings of approved commentators. These show plainly enough that the militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. ""A body of citizens enrolled for military discipline."" And further, that ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of a kind in common use at the time.” United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174, 179 (1939).
Miller’s appeal was denied not because he was a private citizen who claimed the second amendment protected his RKBA, rather, his appeal was denied because the Court would not read the amendment to protect his RKBA in a sawed-off shotgun:
“In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a ‘shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length’ at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument. Certainly, it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.” Id. at 178.
What you see from this decision is a clear implication that private citizens do enjoy a RKBA and the scope of that right protects arms which are “part of the ordinary military equipment” or which “could contribute to the common defense.” This is a foolish interpretation of the RKBA, because it could be read to protect a RKBA in a flamethrower or a bomber.
Now as for the militia preamble, I have addressed that here: http://www.4forums.com/political/gun-control-debates/6957-revisiting-militia-clause.html. 
I would also consider the distinct phrase “the right of the people,” because it is not limited to the Second Amendment. The phrase “the right of the people” occurs in the 1st., 2nd., and 4th. amendments. As has been stated before by people smarter than me, it cannot refer to a right of the individual citizen in the 1st. amendment, be mutated into a right of the states to arm their militia members in the 2nd. amendment, only to be magically transformed back into an individual right in the 4th.

Listen, being a lawyer is only a license to pretend I know what I’m talking about. It does not give me any ability to divide truth from lies any better than anyone else. In fact I think a law degree is usually a hindrance, because in my opinion the swelled heads people tend to get when they get admitted to the bar often constricts the blood flow to their brains. When that happens we lawyers try to conceal our newfound stupidity with arrogance. 
The phrase you cite means to me that if there was evidence that a particular weapon “has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia” then the 2nd. Amendment would protect an individual citizen’s right to possess it. The Court did not say Miller’s sawed-off shotgun did not meet this criteria. It merely said that no evidence was presented that it did. This obviously begs the question of how you meet this test. I think the Miller Court goes on to announce that one way to prove this would be by presenting evidence that it was “part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.”
This was a newly created standard which no one had heard before, and for this reason no one thought to present evidence in the trial court that a sawed-off shotgun was “part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.” Miller’s case came before the court because of an activist trial court judge who wanted to see the law struck down. Miller promptly jumped bond on his appeal, and no one appeared to argue his case. The Government was the only party to appear before the Court, and no evidence was presented to SCOTUS to establish that the weapon would meet the newly announced test. This is why the Court says “In the absence of any evidence tending to show….” 
This brings me back to the “judicial notice” comment. SCOTUS said “Certainly, it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.” I see this as the test SCOTUS announces for proving a weapon “has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia.” It is the only reason why SCOTUS would mention it. 
The “judicial notice” comment occurs for this reason: In our courts many facts do not need to be proved by direct evidence. There are certain facts which Courts routinely take “judicial notice” as being true, like calendar dates or information contained in its own records. When SCOTUS goes on to say “Certainly, it is not within judicial notice…” it is saying that no one tried to prove the weapon would meet this new test, and absent any evidence proving this it will assume on its own that a sawed-off shotgun would be “part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.” 
So I read Miller to interpret the scope of the 2nd. Amendment as protecting an individual RKBA in weapons which have “some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia;” and the test for establishing this is proof that the particular weapon is “part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.” It is a dangerous decision if followed, because it opens the door for claims to all sorts of current military arms.

Well, even then, I figure your that experience with legal decisions should not be ignored. That is something I lack, even if I only pretend that I know what I'm talking about, too...
Once again, I have to concede that I don't think it's totally unreasonable to interpret it that way. However, I instead interpret the ""judicial notice"" clause as being all that is (was) necessary to determine whether the weapon in question is protected, which was the purpose of hearing the case (if I am not mistaken). (As a rough representation, think of a rhetorical question: ""How can it be useful for the militia if it isn't ordinary military equipment and doesn't even contribute to the common defense?"") To put it another way, although a ""no"" answer to (either of) those questions would disqualify it, a ""yes"" answer to both isn't sufficient for qualification. For the purposes of this case, however, affirming disqualification was all that was necessary.
Hmm... According to my reading, while it is true that nobody argued his case, Miller had died, not elected to forego appearing. [The specifics of Miller's actions are, of course, a side issue here.]
I realize that my position isn't so much a counterargument as a different interpretation, but I wanted to put it out there and see what happened. I also realize that my interpretation gives us no real test for protection, but I (again, in my lay opinion) don't see that as a detrimental issue, only a problematic one no worse than that which follows from your interpretation.

23,A Sensible Age to own a Gun,gun control,support,"You’re right that Miller had died, but it appears he was alive when the case was presented to SCOTUS. This is the timeline as I understand it:
On March 30, 1939, SCOTUS heard the oral arguments in the case. No one appeared to argue the case except the Government.
On April 6, 1939, Miller’s body was found in a creek bed near Chelsea, Oklahoma. He had been shot 4 times with a .38 caliber weapon. Near his body was a .45 automatic from which three shots had been fired, which law enforcement presumed was done in self-defense.
On May 15, 1939, SCOTUS, unaware that Miller was dead, announced and published its decision on his case.
Interestingly, his co-defendant, Frank Layton, plead guilty to his indictment after SCOTUS decided the case, and he was placed on probation for five years which he successfully completed.
I found an excellent U.S. v. Miller website, which has full copies of the opinion, brief filed by the Government, all related petitions, etc. here: 
http://www.rkba.org/research/miller/Miller.html. 
I still think Miller is a gun rights opinion. In addition to what you can see in the opinion itself, if you look at the paragraph we have focused upon that begins “In the absence of…” you will see SCOTUS cite with approval to another case, Aymette v. State. If you look at the case and page SCOTUS cites you to, you will find that Tennessee court saying this about militia arms: “If the citizens have these arms in their hands, they are prepared in the best possible manner to repel any encroachments upon their rights. . . .” Aymette v. State, 2 Hump. (21 Tenn.) 154, 158 (1840). Case cited by Miller at p. 178. (A great cite for gun rights advocates, for this is yet another statement that the purpose for relying on a citizen militia was not to ensure the government would be safe from foreign invasion, but was intended to protect the citizens from the advent of a tyrant.) 
But one fundamental problem with Miller is it does not clearly state what the scope of the Amendment is or how to prove a weapon is protected. It only makes reference to these things in the negative--a sort of “since you didn’t prove this you can’t prove the 2nd. Amendment protects you” decision. It also leaves several 2nd.Amendment questions unanswered. Is the right “fundamental” and deserving of the high standard of strict scrutiny of governmental attempts to infringe upon it? Should it allow the possession of current military hardware? If so, then would the RKBA be limited to these weapons, or would my old single-shot arcade .22 be protected? Should the 2nd. Amendment RKBA be incorporated through the 14th. Amendment to force the states to recognize it? For these reason I feel that Miller is a very poor opinion to use to underpin a coherent understanding of the nature and scope of the RKBA.",23,24,topic_stance_votes_1

I find myself agreeing with you on interpretation.

I have been on other sites where people are not interested in learning about a subject.

I learn a lot more from talking and listening to people as opposed to shouting at them. It makes me a better advocate when I consider other viewpoints. I’m glad you feel the same way.
As far as my job goes, very little of this has any impact on me. The irony is that as such a strong supporter of the RKBA I spend a lot of time making sure people go to jail for misusing firearms or for merely having them in their homes if they are felons. I have never seen anyone attempt to stop a prosecution of a gun use/possession crime on 2nd. Amendment grounds in Virginia. And I can find no Virginia state court case that has ever dealt with the issue. Life goes on while we wait to see if SCOTUS will ever take the issue on and let the other shoe drop.

“And indeed, gentlemen, there exists a law, not written down anywhere but written in our hearts; a law which comes to us not by training or custom or reading but by derivation and absorption and adoption from nature itself; a law which has come to us not by theory but from practice, not by instruction but by natural intuition. I refer to the law which lays it down that, if our lives are endangered by plots or violence or armed robbers or enemies, any and every method of protecting ourselves is morally right. When weapons reduce them to silence, the laws no longer expect one to await their pronouncements. For people who decide to wait for these will have to wait for justice, too--and meanwhile they must suffer injustice first. Indeed, even the wisdom of the law itself, by a sort of tacit implication, permits self- defense, because it does not actually forbid men to kill; what it does, instead, is to forbid the bearing of a weapon with the intention to kill. When, therefore, an inquiry passes beyond the mere question of the weapon and starts to consider the motive, a man who has used arms in self-defense is not regarded as having carried them with homicidal aim.” Cicero, Selected Political Speeches, p. 222 (M. Grant, trans. 1975)
“And I cannot see, why arms should be denied to any man who is not a slave, since they are the only true badges of liberty. . . .The possession of arms is the distinction between a freeman and a slave. He who has nothing, and belongs to another, must be defended by him, and needs no arms: but he who thinks he is his own master, and has anything he may call his own, ought to have arms to defend himself and what he possesses, or else he lives precariously and at discretion. And though for a while those who have the sword in their power abstain from doing him injury; yet, by degrees, he will be awed into submission to every arbitrary command.” Andrew Fletcher, Political Works, pp. 35 and 221 (1749).",25,26,topic_stance_votes_1

30,A Sensible Age to own a Gun,gun control,attack,"[QUOTE=aussieseek.com]Here in Australia we have sensible age limits on Gun Ownership
We don't have the problem the USA has with ever more youthful drug dealers and school shootings. But your country is not wanting to stop those. Are they?
I am talking about the age being 18 to own a gun not Kids as Young as 11,
and 18 seems to be
a realistc age for gun ownership and military service 
Your post sAYING ANY AGE Is more than the ######## you always go on about. Its evil.
You want to see the killing of our kids as well 
Your insulting remark about military service also shows your
ingnorance about my country.
Many of our young people have fought and died in Wars
and some of Your Wars
with guns.
And At least we all vote here at an early age.
In Australia Guns are sensibly restricted to younger age groups. 
Its a set of Gun Death statisics You have in the the USA we dont
have or need.
3 OR 4,000 young people a year isnt it?emoticonXKill 
Dude! You were all over the place with that. WTF?! Who the hell are you even talking too?
First off. If a 11 year old has a gun, his parents/grandparents gave it to him. Chances are, he hunts right along side his father. You'd be surprised that young kids who own guns and hunt with their fathers are remarkably responsible and safe with guns. Also, they have to take a hunter's ed class before they allowed to hunt and the safty of guns are taught there. The other youngsters you are referring to get them from their thug parents/buddies and could care less about anyone's saftey.
Sure, there are accidental deaths when children find their parents guns and play with them. SHAME ON THE PARENTS for not teaching their children right about guns. There are also thousands of firearm accidents that involve idiot adults that have no respect for the weapon. 
The key to gun saftey is education. Sure, kids are curious about guns, but if you take your kid out and show them what a gun can do ...that it can actually kill and teach them about it, they will be less inclined to play with it and have more respect for what it is....which is a deadly weapon and not a toy.

My cousins 4 year old has better marksmanship than i. That doesnt mean i suck though, it means that the 4 year old is pretty good. Im not bad either.
There should really be no ""shooting age"", but there should be an age to purchase a gun. You should be 18 to purchase any gun, even a handgun. But, parents buy guns and give them to their children all the time. I think that should be completely up to the consent of the parent.
And the thread starter has a horrible understanding of America.
If you live out in the country, you usually hunt right alongside your father at a young age, and you usually have a .22 yourself. The school shooters steal their guns, i bet their parents dont consent to it.",37,38,topic_stance_votes_2

Over here in Toronto, we have a gun registry and strict guidelines such as fool proof security checks before buying a gun but still gang members have guns and so do criminals.
Hardly a day goes by without some shooting in Toronto. 
So, what is the difference ? Will enforcing stricter gun laws in the USA stop all the gun related violence by gangs and criminals ?
Nope, if someone wants a gun, they will get it by any means. There was an interesting discussion on guns , here is the link
