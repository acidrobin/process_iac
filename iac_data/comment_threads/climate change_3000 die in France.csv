Why don't Americans care?",0,1,topic_stance_votes_1
1,3000 die in France,climate change,attack,Who says Americans don't care?,1,2,topic_stance_votes_2
2,3000 die in France,climate change,attack,"Our media hardly ever talks about it, yet our media keeps obsessing over a few deaths in Isreal, or the Sniper shooting. Why doesn't our media talk more about the heat wave? Because most Americans don't care just because France didn't help us fight Iraq.",2,3,topic_stance_votes_1
3,3000 die in France,climate change,attack,But those are issues that directly affect us and that we can do something about. What can we do about people dying in a heat wave?,3,4,topic_stance_votes_2
4,3000 die in France,climate change,support,I suppose in your mind you believe that Americans hate the French so much that they don't care if thousands of them die. Perhaps that is the view in your neightborhood in California but I doubt it and as a whole the idea is simply idiotic. People here care about what is happening in France although it is not a top story. I've seen several news reports just about this every day for the last week so there is no doubt that it is being reported on and things don't get reported on this often if no one cares. Perhaps it is hard for us to relate to what is happening there to the same extent that French or other European people can. There is of course the little matter of Iraq and more of our own troubles that consume much of the news here. Don't mistake that for the majority of Americans not caring what is happening in France.,1,5,topic_stance_votes_1
5,3000 die in France,climate change,support,"hmmmm, bigger concern:
International tension and war ooooooooor hot weather",5,6,topic_stance_votes_1
6,3000 die in France,climate change,support,Considering those French died from heat and not because someone killed them... I see a huge difference. :-\,6,7,topic_stance_votes_1
7,3000 die in France,climate change,support,"The government should be able to handle their own problems. If they ask for our assistance we should of course assist them. The people of France do not deserve to be punished by the US because of their Iraq opinions.

8,3000 die in France,climate change,support,"I think the count may be up to 10,000 now...",8,9,topic_stance_votes_1
9,3000 die in France,climate change,attack,"Morfos, do YOU really care? Have you sent money to help the people who's families have died? Or to help families buy air conditioners if they don't have one? How about when hurricane season hits and thousands are killed by floods? What about all the people who starve to death each day? 
It really is so easy to sit at your computer and say ""this is so horrible"" and not do anything about it.",9,10,topic_stance_votes_2
10,3000 die in France,climate change,attack,"Look at how America treats its' own senior citizens/parents. 
The old timers have to cross borders for medications to live, suffer(ranging anywhere from bed sores to death) in old folk homes...ect
 Imagine what the next generation( if any) would be like 
Here recently I heard the American Gov was stiffing the retards.....",10,11,topic_stance_votes_1
11,3000 die in France,climate change,attack,who cares anyway? there'll be millions more dead every day and million more born everyday. so it's no big surprise because the circle life has to continue or else they would over populate the world. so be thankful that it happened or else you might be living in an over populated area like china and india.,11,12,topic_stance_votes_2
12,3000 die in France,climate change,attack,"exactly, why care? we will all die eventually anyway. great reasoning!
(the above was a sarcastic comment)",12,13,topic_stance_votes_1
13,3000 die in France,climate change,support,My thoughts exactly (sarcastically of course). You can justify a whole lot of actions if you just assume that we will all die anyways so why worry how a person dies.,13,14,topic_stance_votes_1
14,3000 die in France,climate change,attack,"Can you imagine how bad France must have smelled? All that French cheese lying around in the heat...I think I would have prayed for death, but that's just me.",14,15,topic_stance_votes_2
15,3000 die in France,climate change,attack,"If what happened after the Iraqi Invasion is any indication many of them probably think that the ""Cheese eating surrender monkeys"" got what they deserved.",1,16,topic_stance_votes_2
