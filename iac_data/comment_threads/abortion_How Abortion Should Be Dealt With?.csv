1,How Abortion Should Be Dealt With?,abortion,support,Abortion is a private matter. It is not the concern of the Church and State.,1,2,topic_stance_votes_2
2,How Abortion Should Be Dealt With?,abortion,support,"If I understand your question correctly, you are asking pro-choice people to state what they think is the major flaw in the pro-life arguement and vice-versa. 
I think that the major flaw in the pro-life arguement is that they use slogans which may sound appealing but, on closer inspection, do not have much substance. 
For example, saying that ""life is precious"" may sound right but one has to analyze what one means by ""life"", which they mostly do not bother to do. When people hear ""life is precious"", people can relate because they see their own lives and those of their friends and loved ones as precious. However, the pro-life people extend that all the way back to the earliest fetus/embryo. I have seen posts of imaginary letters from that early fetus meant to elicit sympathy. This is anthropomorphising (attaching a personality where there is none) on a grand scale. They are imagining a baby with an innocent, helpless personality where there is in reality simply a growing body which will someday (around the third trimester) possess a mind, but not yet. They may have an arguement that the *potential* of that fetus is important (since, after all, we all started as fetuses) but the potentiality arguement is much less emotionally appealing and wins fewer converts than the arguement which appeals to people's imaginations in imagining a helpless, innocent, suffering baby. When it comes to the early fetus, that last arguement is an illusion - imagination is not reality. Reality is what is important.
A second, more minor, point against the pro-life arguement is that they often cannot help but mix in their views on sexual morality into their case against abortion. Many would give exceptions in the case of rape and incest because they feel sympathy toward those women. They have no sympathy toward women who chose to have sex.",1,3,topic_stance_votes_2
3,How Abortion Should Be Dealt With?,abortion,support,"To me the largest flaw in the pro-life argument is that the practice of medicine has it's own ethical controls, and doctors are the ones who should be deciding whether or not an abortion should be done, not politicians or judges who have little to no knowledge of medical issues.

you are that they are wrong. Or perhaps it isn't a matter of

8,How Abortion Should Be Dealt With?,abortion,support,"The mother is providing a service for the child. She is a care giver, and that child needs that care to survive.
I believe quite firmly that no one should be required to provide care against their will. If they choose to provide that care, and then choose to stop providing that care, they should take all reasonable steps to ensure someone else assumes the role of care giver.
For example, if a carer at a mental home has a personal emergency and has to leave, then he should attempt to call in any on-call staff, try and get the next rostered person to come in early, or so on. After he's taken all reasonable steps, he is free of an obligation to stay.
Or if a mother can no longer handle caring for her children, she should attempt to get a friend or babysitter to care for them, or give them up to the state.
Or if a pregnant woman no longer wishes to carry her baby. Unfortunately, in that instance, it is unlikely that anyone will be in a position to assume the role of caregiver.
However, regardless of the eventual fate of the person recieving care, no person should be required, no person should be forced to provide care against their will. They should be able to abandon that person, provided they take all reasonable steps to ensure someone else assumes the role of care giver.
Needless to say, I don't consider a pregnancy to be a 'reasonable step'.",8,9,topic_stance_votes_2

Bell, I completely agree with everything you said. I'll just say that one of my biggest beefs with the pro-life side is their religious stance. I feel that because not everybody has the same religion it is not fair for Christians to think that they can impose their beliefs on the rest of the country just because they are the majority.

25,How Abortion Should Be Dealt With?,abortion,attack,"I consider myself a centrist pro-lifer. My views are that abortion should be legal in cases of rape or incest, and I have less concern with it early in the pregnancy, such as the 1st trimester. But am definitely against it after that. I can confidently say the things you listed aren't the way I believe, and aren't the way most anyone I know believes that's pro-life. I also think more effort should be made to help mothers who choose to have their baby than is given, particularly single women. Some in the PL movement haven't always been very good in this way. I think the pro-choice movement sometimes portrays prolifers the way you described--in the most extreme picture as possible. But it's not usually that way from what I've seen. BOTH sides have done too much smearing propaganda at times, and it has polarized things a lot.
Many times they are empathetic to the mother too--they just don't compromise by agreeing the baby should be killed. I know a guy who runs a counselling service that helps mothers find a way to avoid abortions. They go to great lengths to help mothers support the baby whether that adoption or raising it. This is an example of pro-lifers giving support to the mother. The oft-used pro-choice generalization that ""pro-lifers don't care about women"" is a generalization. Many do. They can care about women and still believe it is wrong to kill a baby.
I've heard the arguments, but no I'm not saying they are equal in terms of frequency of use. Nevertheless, there's nothing wrong with religion being a defining force behind one's views. Religion, at the end of the day, is simply ideology. And ideology is usually behind anyone's views. When religious people argue their points because of their religion, it's just ideologically-driven debate--that's what everyone does. We ALL argue because of whatever ideology we have, religious or not. At the end of the day it all goes back to people's personal moral views, and whether that's influenced by religion or not shouldn't matter. Everyone has their reasons for their views.",22,26,topic_stance_votes_1

29,How Abortion Should Be Dealt With?,abortion,support,"From Wikipedia:
Antiquity (prehistory to 476 AD)
The first recorded evidence of induced abortion is from a Chinese document which records abortions performed upon royal concubines in China between the years 500 and 515 BC. According to Chinese folklore, the legendary Emperor Shennong prescribed the use of mercury to induce abortions nearly 5000 years ago.
Abortion, along with infanticide, was common in the ancient Greco-Roman world. Numerous methods of abortion were used, ""the more effective of which were exceedingly dangerous"". Several common methods involved either either dosing the pregnant woman with a near-fatal amount of poison, in order to induce a miscarriage, introducing poison directly into the uterus, or prodding the uterus with one of a variety of ""long needles, hooks, and knives"". Unsurprisingly, these methods often led to the death of the woman, as well as the fetus.
There have been archaeological discoveries which would seem to indicate early surgical attempts at the extraction of a fetus; however, such methods are not believed to have been common, given the infrequency with which they are mentioned in ancient medical texts. Many of the methods employed in early and primitive cultures were non-surgical. Physical activities like strenuous labour, climbing, paddling, weightlifting, or diving were a common technique. Others included the use of irritant leaves, fasting, bloodletting, pouring hot water onto the abdomen, and lying on a coconut shell which had been heated.
References in classical literature
Hippocrates, the Greek physician whose famous Oath forbids abortion, nonetheless writes of having advised a dancer and prostitute who fell pregnant to jump up and down, touching her buttocks with her heels at each leap, so as to induce miscarriage. [7] Other writings attributed to him describe instruments, fashioned to dilate the cervix and curette inside of the uterus, which he used to perform an abortion upon one of his patients.
Tertullian, a 2nd and 3rd century Christian theologian, also described surgical implements which were used in a procedure reminiscent of the modern dilation and evacuation. One tool had a ""nicely-adjusted flexible frame"" used for dilation, an ""annular blade"" used to curette, and a ""blunted or covered hook"" used for extraction. The other was a ""copper needle or spike"". He attributed ownership of such items to Hippocrates, Asclepiades, Erasistratus, Herophilus, and Soranus.
Tertullian's description is prefaced as being used in cases in which abnormal positioning of the fetus in the womb would endanger the life of the pregnant women. Saint Augustine, in Enchiridion, makes passing mention of surgical procedures being performed to remove fetuses which have expired in utero. [10] Aulus Cornelius Celsus, a 1st century Roman encyclopedist, offers an extremely detailed account of a procedure to extract an already dead fetus in his only surviving work, De Medicina.
In Book 9 of Refutation of all Heresies, Saint Hippolytus of Rome, another Christian theologian of the 3rd century, wrote of women tightly binding themselves around the middle so as to ""expel what was being conceived.""
Soranus, a 2nd century Greek physician, provided some rather detailed suggestions in his work Gynecology. He recommended that women wishing to abort their pregnancies should engage in violent exercise, energetic jumping, carrying heavy objects, and riding animals. Diuretics, emmenagogues, enemas, fasting, and bloodletting, were also prescribed, although Soranus advised against the use of sharp instruments to induce miscarriage due to the risk of organ perforation.",29,30,topic_stance_votes_2

It does appear however that the more extreme prolifer arguments get the attention. Same w/ prochoice. Squeaky wheel...
And my original assertions-- such as the desire to legislate morality for the masses; the selfish need to get involved intimately in the life of someone you will most likely never meet or be in a position to help-- still stand because these are the results of the prolife mvt as a whole. If you do not wish to legislate your morality to the masses, and if you think it is wrong to get intimately involved on such a personal level in a strangers' life, then your position needs reconsidered b/c this is ultimately what happens.
I don't think there is enough empathy and care for the woman if you are circumventing her options, opinions, and wishes by telling her she must carry a pregnancy to term.
Of course there is nothing wrong w/ religion being a defining force behind someone's views. Or lack of religion. Whatever your ideology is you base your decisions on, that's fine and grand.

33,How Abortion Should Be Dealt With?,abortion,attack,"I'd be content with abortion law that allows it early in the pregnancy, but makes it illegal in the 2nd or 3rd trimester. In some ways, that would be a compromise for all.
But the pro-choice side also legislates it's morality to making it legal to kill the inborn baby. Roe v Wade was a legislation of morality--a morality that says women should be able to kill their unborn babies.
That's impossible, unless the woman is physically restrained. No one can truly take away anyone's ability to do what they want (even if it's illegal). The goal of the pro-life movement is stop abortions. The end goal is not to make abortion illegal, though making it illegal is the means they seek to real their goal. The logic is straightforward: if our goal was to, say, stop homicides, we wouldn't do so by making homocide legal. The same applies to abortion. 
Frankly, you're arguing that it should be legal to kill a baby just so a mother can avoid discomfort. I agree women should be given care and empathy, but not at the expense of killing someone, which is where your logic goes. I think there needs to be BOTH--save the baby AND help the mother. The idea that the two should be mutually exclusive from one another, juxtaposed, is a terribly wrong idea.
I disagree. Everyone who votes, supports candidates, supports any given law, etc. is, in essence, trying to get their morality legislated. It's the way our system works. Everytime someone supports a law based on their personal beliefs and ideology, they are trying to see their morality legislated.

??? The ability to choose one's morality is there no matter which side one is on. It's impossible to take away peoples' moral views.
Well, sorry, but I have no interest in using only purely clinical terms to describe a fetus. (Though sometimes I use ""fetus"" as well.) If it's not accurate, then you need to tell that to every OB/GYN doctor that tells a hopeful mother that her ""baby is fine"". There's a reason they don't use the term ""fetus""; because it's clinical and cold. There is basically no diffence in the development of a premature baby between the moment before it exits the birth canal and the moment after. It doesn't just then magically become a baby. (and that's why many people use the concept if viability-outside-the-womb as the point in the pregnancy where they feel abortion shouldn't be done.) I think many in the pro-choice movement prefer clinical terminology because it offers a certain disconnectedness. If it's called a ""baby"" then the risk is run of actually thinking of it in a personal way. IMO, using only clinical terminology is a coward's way out. If you are going to believe that abortion should be legal, then I say have the balls to face up to what you're really doing: killing a baby--someone that, if allowed to live, would grow into a todler, a child, an adolescent, and an adult. That may tick you off, but it's what I believe so take it or leave it. I'm not against you using the term ""fetus"", but don't chastise me for calling it a baby either.
On the flipside, too many in the pro-life movement prefer to be disconnected from the issues the mother is facing. I think consideration for both the baby AND the mother is the best way. I think a lot more mothers would carry their baby to term if they know they had the support they needed, and/or the ability to know they they could give their baby up. In that sense, the pro-life goals of saving lives would be helped by actually giving more support to mothers.

For one, it would go a long ways toward making your movement look less draconian to those of us who see such elements there. (and believe me, there are MANY of us.)

Abortions are surgical. They can have major complications. Anesthesia is involved. They should be done in a hospital, no matter what the perception is.

But since abortion clinics are the ones that would give this, and since they are typically tied to the pro-choice movement, you need to take that up with the clinics and the pro-choice movement to pressure them to do so. These clinics are mostly business ventures, not free public service providers.
There may be sound reasons for abortions to be a hospital-based procedure, but the fact it's often surgical isn't one of them. Surgery is not limited to hospitals--there are many specialty clinics that perform many types of surgeries, and are well-equipped to handle complications. And regardless, some hospitals indeed do abortions. Hospitals are business ventures (mostly anyway--the ones that aren't are non-profit but unafiliated with govt.), and they have their own say in what procedures they offer. 
Again, some hospitals offer abortions. But you'd have to address other hospitals on a case-by-case basis to convince them to offer them because they decide their own procedures.
Either way, the law allows for abortions for even the most trivial reasons. In fact, it would allow abortion for no reason at all.

75,How Abortion Should Be Dealt With?,abortion,attack,"From post #9 in this thread:
The mother is providing a service for the child. She is a care giver, and that child needs that care to survive.
I believe quite firmly that no one should be required to provide care against their will. If they choose to provide that care, and then choose to stop providing that care, they should take all reasonable steps to ensure someone else assumes the role of care giver.
For example, if a carer at a mental home has a personal emergency and has to leave, then he should attempt to call in any on-call staff, try and get the next rostered person to come in early, or so on. After he's taken all reasonable steps, he is free of an obligation to stay.
Or if a mother can no longer handle caring for her children, she should attempt to get a friend or babysitter to care for them, or give them up to the state.
Or if a pregnant woman no longer wishes to carry her baby. Unfortunately, in that instance, it is unlikely that anyone will be in a position to assume the role of caregiver.
However, regardless of the eventual fate of the person recieving care, no person should be required, no person should be forced to provide care against their will. They should be able to abandon that person, provided they take all reasonable steps to ensure someone else assumes the role of care giver.

Just Kidding, got you guys there. Here is my morals on abortion:
I rather prefer the ""morning after"" pill over abortion so if people are not sure if they are pregnant or not they should get the pill before the 72 hours is over.
If a woman is raped she should be able to get an abortion
If a couple or one night stand or etc. were using, birth control, condom, aka safe sex, and they accidentally UNintentionally get pregnant the woman should be able to get an abortion
If a person is stupid and gets drunk, its your own mistake, you took that chance by taking the one to many drinks - so in that case abortion in my opinion is wrong. (BUT: if a drunk woman is raped or taken advantage of - the man intentionally has sex with her knowing she is not infavor of it if she was sober than abortion can be allowed) The drunk thing is tricky - if both the man and woman were drunk and got pregnant the woman should not be able to have an abortion - if the woman was drunk and the man was not drunk and she got pregnant: abortion allowed. Tricky but I still think people who are stupid to get pregnant when drunk should not be able to take that shortcut. 
If a couple plans and succesfully gets pregnant but has second thoughts or doesn't want the child because it might be mentally disabled - to bad. no abortion.
