Of course it would be more difficult for criminals to get hold of guns if there were fewer of them around. It would also make it more difficult for children to get hold of them, or feuding neighbours who, on the spur of the moment, think that waving a gun around might bring about a solution to their problems.

6,A question for supporters of gun control,gun control,support,"Firstly, sinjin is not a baboon. His avatar is colorful, but not indicative of his mental capacities. Be nice, or you'll get banned.
I think he is alluding to the obvious fact that if people had not been allowed to purchase and register their guns, some 200,000 guns/year would NOT have been stolen, thus some 200,000 guns/year would be removed from the cache of guns available to criminals.
However, the falacy of that thought is that guns are in demand by criminals...they will be procured by criminals whether they steal them from law abiding citizens or purchase them on the black market from other criminals.
Outlawing guns will only remove them from law abiding citizens. The criminals will be unaffected.",3,7,topic_stance_votes_2

That would be fewer guns, not less guns. Where did you go to school? What part of ""these 200,000 guns would not be available to criminals"" did you not understand? His point is that SOME, albeit small...impact would be made on the criminal's ability to procure weapons by removing the registered weapons that are about to be stolen and passed out through the black market.
Supply and demand at work.
There you go again...claiming nonsensical statements have been made when there is a valid point made.
Removing guns from law abiding homes would certainly decrease the incidences wherein a child finds daddy's gun and shoots a friend, a sibling or himself.

11,A question for supporters of gun control,gun control,support,"The part I don't understand is how outlawing guns would actually keep them out of the hands of criminals. Would outlawing guns magically make them vanish from existance? No. Will outlawing guns convince criminals to turn theirs in? No. Will outlawing guns make the hundreds of thousands currently stolen firearms that're circulating the underground market networks inaccessible to criminals? No. Will it make it easier for the police to take guns out of the hands of criminals? No. Will it help locate the tens of millions of illegal guns circulating in this country? No.
So obviously outlawing guns will have no positive benefits.
Why would anybody register weapons if they were just going to illegally sell them to somebody on the black market?
And criminals demand guns, so somebody will always be supplying them.
Valid point? I see NO valid point anywhere. Outlawing guns will not make them inaccessible to criminals.

13,A question for supporters of gun control,gun control,attack,"Who do you think they stole them from? Hint: They didn't have to go far. I needn't worry about you stealing my apples if I have no apple tree. If the supply of weapons is reduced demand is unchanged, granted. The ability to satisfy that demand is though.

14,A question for supporters of gun control,gun control,attack,"Fact of the matter: They're already circulating criminal networks. The criminals already have plenty of guns, that means that ending gun ownership will play no real part in ending gun possession by criminals.
Face the facts! There is absolutely no legal access to any narcotics like pot or cocaine, yet criminals are still getting it and dealing in it.
You also needn't worry about being victimized if you have nothing of value.
The supply of weapons will never be reduced through crackdowns on legal gun ownership. Criminals have access to tens of millions of illegal guns already, they're not going to run short anytime soon.
Then what is the justification for trying to make me into a criminal and take my rights away from me?
By infringing on my rights?
You're actually telling me that ending my private right to legally own a gun will somehow prevent a criminal being being able to gain access to a gun through illegal channels? Because if that's what you're saying that you're several different kinds of stupid all wrapped together.
Look at Washington D.C. By far the absolute strictest laws in the entire nation, they STILL need gun shot sensors because people are STILL being shot and killed on a regular basis!

17,A question for supporters of gun control,gun control,attack,"I tend to agree with most of your logic here although I think you overstate a bit. Banning legal ownership of human beings seems to have been mildly effective in this country. Additionally, I think there's a considerable difference between drugs and alcohol, which are rather easy to produce, and the manufacture of a quality sidearm. Countries which have chosen to ban the production and sale of handguns to the public have been successful in reducing gun violence as a consequence. There's no denying it.
Where I completely agree with you is that no amount of restriction on supply will of itself quelch demand. That would require a cultural shift in our country. We must choose not to embrace the traditon that teaches the virtues of being armed. Only then will the aberrations spawned by that tradition be diminished. Fat chance.",17,18,topic_stance_votes_1

We're bordered by Canada and Mexico, we can't even stop illegal aliens from getting into this country, what's to stop illegal guns from crossing the border if demand gets high enough?
Then there's the fact that guns are stolen from the police, both officers and evidence storage rooms.
There's also the fact that even if only the police and military were allowed to have access to firearms, then there would still need to be manufacturing plants to crank out enough supply, and that supply would need to be stored somewhere. And any central storage location can become a target and broken into.

Sinjin, if you think that a total gun ban magically stops crime, read this.
these are statistics from Australia after their oh so benevelent removal of all weapons.
""One year after gun-owners were forced to surrender 640,381 personal firearms to be destroyed, including semi-automatic .22 rifles and shotguns, a program costing the government over 500 million dollars, the results are in... ""
OBSERVABLE FACT, AFTER 12 MONTHS OF DATA: 
Australia-wide, homicides are up 3.2% 
Australia-wide, assaults are up 8.6% 
Australia-wide, armed-robberies are up 44% (yes, FORTY-FOUR PERCENT) 
In the state of Victoria, homicides-with-firearms are up 300% 
Figures over the previous 25 years show a steady decrease in homicides-with-firearms (changed dramatically in the past 12 months) 
Figures over the previous 25 years show a steady decrease in armed-robbery-with-firearms (changed dramatically in the past 12 months) 
There has been a dramatic increase in breakins-and-assaults-of- the-elderly 
At the time of the ban, the Prime Minister said ""self-defense is not a reason for owning a firearm"" 
From 1910 to present, homicides in Australia had averaged about 1.8-per-100,000 or lower, a safe society by any standard. 
The ban has destroyed Australia's standings in some international sport shooting competitions 
The membership of the Australian Sports Shooting Association has risen to 112,000, a 200% increase, in response to the ban and as an attempt to organize against further controls, which are expected. 
Australian politicians are on the spot and at a loss to explain how no improvement in ""safety"" has been observed after such monumental effort and expense was successfully expended in ""ridding society of guns"". Their response has been to ""wait longer"".

41,A question for supporters of gun control,gun control,support,"I stumbled upon this site by following a link posted on a gun forum that I frequent, which should give a hint as to which side of this debate I'll be speaking up for.
First, since this is my first post here and I've only been perusing this site for an hour or so, I need to know if the ""anti-gunners"" that are posting in this thread are Americans or not. It seems to me that the site is frequented by a rather diverse, international group of people, and if I'm right about that, then I think I know the problem with convincing them of the incorrect way they are evaluating private gun ownership in America. 
Even if every single one of the antis posting here is American, the problem is the same; it's an abject lack of understanding of what our Constitution does and from whom our rights derive. Our government was not put together with the notion that those who hold powerful positions are the givers or guarantors of our rights, they are the protectors of them, nothing more, nothing less. God is who, according to our Founding Fathers, our rights derive from, and those of us who agree with that premise get a little testy when mere mortals try to use the protectors of our rights (our government) to contravene the authority of the giver and guarantor of them (God). 
Now, I'm not trying to take this discussion in an off-topic direction and make it about religion. The premise that I describe above is not dependent upon anyone evaluating the existence, or lack thereof, of God in order to accept it as fact. It simply is a hard, cold, wholly provable fact that our Founders believed deeply in the accuracy of that premise, and that they wrote The Constitution with the conviction that they were writing what they perceived God wanted them to write as the cornerstone of its foundation. So if one asks what Madison or Jefferson had in their minds as it relates to the 2nd Amendment, if you take some of their more salient quotes on the subject and combine that with the knowledge that everything they put to writing in our founding documents were directives from God, then there can be no more valid debate about gun control in America without first talking about repealing The Constitution, thus rejecting the permanently-held view of historians and legal scholars since our country's inception that God controls our destiny, not man and/or man's laws. Like it or not, accept the premise or not, believe in God or not, that is precisely what anti-gunners are up against if they want to effectively repeal the 2nd Amendment's original meaning and intent through legislative fiat. And I can back that up.....
*My note: All ""original rights"" come from God, and that is the perspective from which Hamilton uttered these words.
*My note: ""Shall never be construed"" means exactly that; the right was granted to man by God and cannot be overridden by man or man's laws for perpetuity. That's a long time! No matter how you slice it, 230 years doesn't even scratch the surface of how long this right was supposed to be protected by our government!
Maybe it is the case that both Americans and non-Americans alike have never been made aware of just how conclusive the righteousness of the 2nd Amendment, as well as all the others, was thought to be by our Founding Fathers. Maybe they don't realize that, to a man, every single one of them can be quoted describing the 2A as protecting an individual right, no different in its' importance to the governance of the citizenry, in a well-ordered society, than the 1st through 10th Amendments were/are. If present-day government is allowed to damage the strength and unalienable nature of the 2nd Amendment through tyrannical legislation which subverts the supreme authority of the document that grants them their power in the first place, what's to stop them from doing the same to any of the other amendments or precepts of the greatest document ever devised by man? 
You anti-gunners are perfectly within your rights to be anti-gunners. You are not, however, within your rights to demand of your government, or *our* government as the case may be, that they treat one amendment to The Constitution as less important, less fundamental, less unalienable than any other. If you want to be treated with respect for expressing views which our form of government guarantees is your God-given, fundamental, unalienable right to do, no matter who or how strongly someone may disagree with you, then you have to extend to us the same respect for exercising those rights which are guaranteed to us as gun owners with equal power and force of law. Instead of saying, ""There should be gun bans in America,"" say, ""I have banned guns in my home and have decided not to expose my children to them because I feel they cause more trouble than they're worth."" The former says you want our government to break the very set of laws that grants its' power, and the latter says that you have chosen to accept the law for what it is and made a personal decision, that steps on no gun-owner's or The Constitution's toes in any way, to take action that is within your legal power to effectuate in your own life and home.

51,A question for supporters of gun control,gun control,attack,"bhbcu64, I think you argument is confusing the issue by blending together two separate issues regarding the RKBA—the nature of the right (individual/collective) and the scope of the right (absolute/limited). They are independent and must be dealt with in turn.
Let me first address the nature of the right. I agree with your assertion that the founders were “wordsmiths.” The nature of the right could not be more plainly stated by them: “the right of the people.” This is clearly an expression of an individual right. When these men drafted constitutions, they did not write that states have “rights.” They always couched these abilities in terms of “power” and “authority.” Only individual citizens have rights. 
Look also at the 10th. A. These wordsmiths knew how to write out a reservation of power to the states when they wanted to confer power or authority to them. They didn’t do so in the 2nd. A. 
The phrase “the right of the people” was used in the 1st., 2nd., and 4th. Amendments. Your collective right argument takes this tack:
The phrase recognizes an individual right in the 1st. A, is mutated into a collective state’s “right” in the 2nd. A, only to mutate back into an individual right in the 4th. A. 
This argument is incompatible with the assertion our founders were ‘wordsmiths.” You cannot argue—when confronted with the same phrase being used each time—that the nature of the rights is anything but individual in all three Amendments absent the judicious use of some form of Orwellian “doublespeak.” 
Now let’s talk about the scope of the right. When you speak of “Congress shall make no law” you turn away from the individual nature of the right and begin to take on the second issue: what is the scope of the protected right.
I have never argued that any of our rights is absolute in scope. The absolute literal interpretation of the scope of the RKBA has been a favorite sham argument of gun control advocates for years. See:

Here are some questions for your absolutist completely-unlimited-in-any-way-interpretation to ponder: 
Do you suggest that our founders intended to abolish the laws prohibiting libel, slander, and conspiracy to commit a crime when they wrote “Congress shall make no law""? 
If we accept your absolute unlimited scope argument, then could I not sacrifice an innocent virgin child at sunrise on the winter solstice to appease the sun god to ensure the return of spring? 
Could I avoid a charge of murder, or is your argument over the absolute interpretation different when the language is “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof”? 
Have we found a ceiling for your interpretation yet, or does your NO LAW = NO POSSIBLE RESTRICTIONS argument become the truth that sets me free?
Can you find a single SCOTUS case (or one from any of the circuit courts of appeals for that matter) which deals with your logic?
I have. It is the 1st. Amendment case of Konigsberg v. States Bar, 366 U.S. 36, 56 (1961). I cited you to this earlier because I thought it would enlighten you to see how SCOTUS dealt with the argument you are making now, and I thought it relevant to this blog site because it mentions the 2nd. Amendment and Miller [In particular, look at footnote 10]:
“At the outset we reject the view that freedom of speech and association ( N. A. A. C. P. v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449, 460 ), as protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, are “absolutes,” not only in the undoubted sense that where the constitutional protection exists it must prevail, but also in the sense that the scope of that protection must be gathered solely from a literal reading of the First Amendment. [FOOTNOTE 10] Throughout its history this Court has consistently recognized at least two ways in which constitutionally protected freedom of speech is narrower than an unlimited license to talk. On the one hand, certain forms of speech, or speech in certain contexts, has been considered outside the scope of constitutional protection. [FOOTNOTE 11] See, e. g., Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47; Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568; Dennis v. United States, 341 U.S. 494; Beauharnais v. Illinois, 343 U.S. 250; Yates v. United States, 354 U.S. 298; Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476.”
Here are the footnotes:
[FOOTNOTE 10] “That view, which of course cannot be reconciled with the law relating to libel, slander, misrepresentation, obscenity, perjury, false advertising, solicitation of crime, complicity by encouragement, conspiracy, and the like, is said to be compelled by the fact that the commands of the First Amendment are stated in unqualified terms: “Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble . . . .” But as Mr. Justice Holmes once said: “[T]he provisions of the Constitution are not mathematical formulas having their essence in their form; they are organic living institutions transplanted from English soil. Their significance is vital not formal; it is to be gathered not simply by taking the words and a dictionary, but by considering their origin and the line of their growth.” Gompers v. United States, 233 U.S. 604, 610. In this connection also compare the equally unqualified command of the Second Amendment: “the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.” And see United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174.
[FOOTNOTE 11] “That the First Amendment immunity for speech, press and assembly has to be reconciled with valid but conflicting governmental interests was clear to Holmes, J. (“I do not doubt for a moment that by the same reasoning that would justify punishing persuasion to murder, the United States constitutionally may punish speech that produces or is intended to produce a clear and imminent danger that it will bring about forthwith certain substantive evils that the United States constitutionally may seek to prevent.” Abrams v. United States, 250 U.S. 616, 627); to Brandeis, J. (“But, although the rights of free speech and assembly are fundamental, they are not in their nature absolute.” Whitney v. California, 274 U.S. 357, 373); and to Hughes, C. J. (“[T]he protection [of free speech] even as to previous restraint is not absolutely unlimited.” Near v. Minnesota, 283 U.S. 697, 716.)”
You may disagree, but SCOTUS has always ruled against you on this issue. If you ever want to change either mine or the Court’s mind on this point, then you must come up with an argument that goes beyond “because that’s what I think.” Is there anything, anywhere, from any time in our nation’s history which supports your absolute unlimited scope interpretation argument? I am genuinely curious to know if you have something which has yet to be revealed.

When you incorrectly say that SCOTUS “nearly abolished,” aren’t you agreeing the interpretation should be “Congress shall make nearly no law”? Is this what you mean by “[t]hat’s exactly my point”? 
I have read Sullivan before. It does not say what you want it to say. It was a libel suit brought by a public official in Alabama who became upset over a paid political advertisement that was run in the Times:
“The advertisement included statements, some of which were false, about police action allegedly directed against students who participated in a civil rights demonstration and against a leader of the civil rights movement; respondent claimed the statements referred to him because his duties included supervision of the police department.” New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 254 (1964)
Sullivan claimed the false statements libeled him. The case was tried under Alabama’s “libelous per se” law, which only required proof that the statements were false and did not require a showing that the publisher of the statement acted with actual malice. The Times appealed to SCOTUS and asked SCOTUS to use the 14th. Amendment to declare the Alabama law violated the 1st. Amendment.
Read your case, bhbcu64. SCOTUS merely held that in a libel action a public official cannot rely upon a “libelous per se” state law, and the 1st. Amendment required proof that the statement was not only false but was made with malice:
""The constitutional guarantees require, we think, a federal rule that prohibits a public official from recovering damages for a defamatory falsehood relating to his official conduct unless he proves that the statement was made [page 280] with 'actual malice' — that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not."" Id. at 279-280.
SCOTUS did not “nearly abolish” the law of libel. All it did was establish what proof must be met before an official can win a libel suit. This case cuts against your position.
That’s exactly my point. 
I tell you what: If I were ever reckless enough to ask you to defend me on a charge of murder by human sacrifice, then by all means please make the absolute “Congress shall make no law” argument. Just don’t cite Sullivan to the judge….

Please read the Sullivan case before you post on it again. SCOTUS is not using the Black’s definition of “malice.” If you had read both, then you would have realized that Black’s definition of malice is a different, criminal context definition. This is what SCOTUS said: “'actual malice' — that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.” (which, when you think about it, is also a fair description of your arguments). In later cases this standard came to be known by the name “New York Times malice.” You would not so easily confuse it with the Black’s definition of “malice” if you would read your case. 
Now to answer your mocking “where are the mind readers” question: Sullivan tells you this if you would bother to read your case. Justice Brennan, writing for the majority, decided to play the mind reader, starting with this paragraph:
“Since respondent may seek a new trial, we deem that considerations of effective judicial administration require us to review the evidence in the present record to determine [Page 285] whether it could constitutionally support a judgment for respondent. This Court's duty is not limited to the elaboration of constitutional principles; we must also in proper cases review the evidence to make certain that those principles have been constitutionally applied. This is such a case, particularly since the question is one of alleged trespass across ‘the line between speech unconditionally guaranteed and speech which may legitimately be regulated.’” New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 284-285 (1964) (bold emphasis added).
Now here is another question for you: How do you continue to have faith in your NO LAW = NO POSSIBLE RESTRICTIONS argument when the case you cite for this position agrees that a line exists “between speech unconditionally guaranteed and speech which may legitimately be regulated”?
Again, you really should bother to read your case before you allow me to use it against you. The first rule of debating is to make sure your arguments are internally consistent. Your posts raise a new and novel question touching on this rule: Are your arguments really inconsistent when you don’t realize that they are?

How do you continue to have faith in your NO LAW = NO POSSIBLE RESTRICTIONS argument when the case you cite for this position agrees that a line exists “between speech unconditionally guaranteed and speech which may legitimately be regulated”?
You STILL don't get it, do you?
Brennan's opinion ought to make you gun nuts shake in your tidy whities.
What he is saying is that the SCOTUS claims the right to interpret ""NO LAW"" from 1A out of all existence.
If the SCOTUS can claim that some speech, despite the absolute terms of 1A, can ""legitimately be regulated"" what is to stop the SCOTUS from saying that some provisions of of 2A may also ""legitimately be regulated""?
All it will take is for President Obama to replace 3 or 4 Justices, which seems more and more likely, to bring about that happy outcome.

Today you tell me that Sullivan would support the view that none of our rights, including the RKBA, is absolute—and that SCOTUS feels it has the power to define their limits (And you say I should be afraid). Today you complain: You STILL don't get it, do you?
Oh, what a tangled web you weave, bhbcu64! It appears a brief history lessen is now in order: 
I’m the one that gave you this argument to begin with. I started in this thread with you by giving that very same “no right is absolute” explanation. Back then you disagreed with the very position you take today. Surely you remember my original position and your response? You quoted mine back to me when you disagreed with me then (and your own self now):
Bryan,
I have never argued that any of our rights is absolute in scope. 
That may well be your particular belief.
However, the wordsmiths clearly did intend, by their inclusion of the words NO LAW in 1A for the right to be absolute.
What other meaning can these 2 little words be given that are true to their original intent?
That was only three days ago, my friend. Can't you remember now that we started with my arguing that no right is absolute and you went off on an absolute NO LAW = NO POSSIBLE RESTRICTION 1st. amendment argument?
Do you remember I then called you out by citing authority which contradicts your view, and more importantly I challenged you to give me a single case which supports your view?
You applied you powers of research, and do you remember your response? You cited Sullivan and claimed it supported your view. In particular, you claimed it: “nearly abolished the law of libel as it applies to people in the public eye.” 
Do you remember how I then said “no it didn’t”? Do you remember how I quoted you the language from the case to prove this. More importantly, don’t you remember that I asked this follow up: When you incorrectly say that SCOTUS “nearly abolished,” aren’t you agreeing the interpretation should be “Congress shall make nearly no law”?
You remembered it then, because you immediately jumped to correct this obvious contradiction with your argument by spinning it this way: 
SCOTUS set the bar so high in a libel suit as to de facto eliminate libel as it relates to a public official. If the bar is so high as to be out of reach, the net effect is to abolish the cause of action entirely.  You went on to claim libel was abolished because no one could make the factual determination set forth in Sullivan. Your mocking question asked “where were the mind readers?”. 
Don’t you remember that I then re-cited you to the case you still have not read to prove you wrong about it again? Do you remember how I showed you how you were also applying the wrong definition of malice? Do you remember how I answered your “mind readers” question? I pointed out where in the case the SCOTUS justices described how they felt they could be your mind readers. I directly cited a quote from the case which destroys your “Sullivan stands for NO LAW = NO RESTRICTIONS argument.” I’m sure you noticed that I threatened to throw subsequent cases at you which found libel in spite of your claimed “de facto” ban. Have you so soon forgotten how I chided you again for not reading and understanding your case?
Now, today, you try today to take all that history back and pretend this was not the real reason you cited the case. Today you tell me the real reason you cited it is because you believe Sullivan stands for the position that SCOTUS believes no right is absolute. 
How quickly you have forgotten that this was the very position I had adopted when we started! How very quickly you have forgotten that your original argument was not only directly contradictory to what you say now, but that you actually claimed that Sullivan stood for your absolutist position!

That's because it is unreasonable. Especially since the accepted definition of ""hunting guns"" has warped in the last 50 years.

I talk to a lot of people, we all share similar viewpoints.
Here's the thing. We've already established that no right is ever absolute, and we're alright with that fact. Realistically we need to accept certain limitations on exactly what the Second Amendment means and does. If we refuse absolutely everything we're no better than the crazy nuts and anti-gunners. We need to be reasonable on this issue.
What would you suggest as reasonable gun control laws? 
Well if somebody's proven that they're going to go out and willfully murder people for absolutely no reason, they deserve to be locked up or put down.
The people responsible for all the school massacres are sick individuals. I don't think they could be trusted no matter how much rehabilitation they're given.
Well what about a higher price for true machineguns than their semi-automatic cousins? People are willing to pay $1,000 for a new AR-15 (I know, I've seen 'em do it!) what about $2,500 for a new model M-16 made after 1986? Would that be more acceptable?
Actually there's a much larger difference between what I say and what the other side wanted. They advocated a total and outright ban on certain models based on nothing but cosmetic features. What I'm advocating is lessened restrictions until we're at a reasonable level that we can tolerate.
I'm in full support of the repealment of the machinegun ban, the machinegun importation ban, the handgun safety lock law, the ""sporting provision"" of the Gun Control Act and many other insane laws that are of no purpose. The laws I DO support are the ones that are supposed to actually make a difference and inhibit criminals more than honest citizens. 
Yes I know the background check can be superceded by the black market, I'm not denying that and I never have. Because criminals can't buy from licensed dealers that makes it harder to actually set up sting operations and catch them. The only good part about the background checks is that we can say that we're not allowing criminals to get their guns at any legal location.
The thing we have to remember is that the battle of gun control vs. gun rights is unlikely to be settled in one big bill that'll give us everything we want.

Well, I look to the main intent of the 2nd Amendment, which was at least as much about one's ability to defend themselves and their families, as it was about defending the country from usurpers, even if those usurpers happened to be Americans and/or American politicians. ""Reasonable"" is relative to the threat you face. In deciding ""reasonable"" armament to enforce The Constitution from a run amok government, I would focus on the word ""arms,"" as in ""...to keep and bear arms...."" I can agree that nukes and missile batteries might not fall within a strict definition of ""arms."" Arms, as used by the Framers, probably referred to small arms, things that could be carried and wielded by hand. The reason I say that the bigger armament ""might not"" fall into the protected right category is that there is a lot of history in the U.S. of private ownership of cannon and mortar, and I don't recall ever reading about a 2nd Amendment ruling that said they weren't included in the protected right, but I wouldn't feel put-upon if the SCOTUS decided they weren't. I do however, feel very put-upon that I have to ask permission, any degree of permission, to exercise my right to own whatever weapon I want that is at least as effective in combat as any of the small arms that the government might bring to bear against us. I believe to my core that this is a reasonable reading of the 2nd Amendment, and it is most certainly consistent with the reasons that many Framers stated for including the 2nd in the Bill of Rights.
I believe that ""realistically"" we have allowed Congress, presidents and the courts to engage in usurpation already. I am not willing to voluntarily concede more constitutional ground, and I am frankly disappointed when I see/hear gun-owners and self-proclaimed 2nd Amendment proponents offer such vast amounts of concessions simply to appear ""reasonable"" to those who would send our government to our homes to take our guns by force if they had that authority. To me, it's analogous to George Washington sending an envoy to Cornwallis' encampment at Yorktown to offer compromise on thoroughly trouncing him in the final battle because to do such would make the King and the people back in England think negatively of the Revolutionary Army. Who on our side should've cared what they thought? And why should you or I care what gun-grabbers think of our willingness (or in my case, unwillingness) to compromise today? I have a real hard time even thinking about compromising what our Founders bequeathed us as fundamental, unalienable rights. And that my friend, is imminently reasonable.
I can live with this clarification, but this is hardly how you put it when I responded to it. You didn't mention ""murderers,"" just ""criminals."" I used to work with a guy that got busted for two joints back in '63 or '64. It wasn't enough for him to serve one year for each joint (that's right, TWO YEARS IN PRISON for two joints!), but he also lost his voting privileges and his fundamental, unalienable right to own a gun. For TWO JOINTS! These are the kinds of criminals I was responding on behalf of, not whacked out, murderous freaks. The people to whom you refer above should be deprived of their right to live, period, and that will take care of depriving them of their gun rights at the same time.
Of course not! Why? What on Earth would that accomplish, other than artificially inflate the prices of inanimate objects that the government has no business regulating to begin with? You want only rich people to have *unalienable* rights? Are you really serious about this? 
Again, I ask you to please speak only for yourself. The Firearms Act of 1934 went well beyond what I am willing to ""tolerate."" If the Heller case is decided that the 2nd is an individual right, that act will effectively be repealed, as well as the vast majority of gun control laws currently on the books. Would that be an ""unreasonable"" outcome for you? Would it be ""intolerable?"" 
With pro-gunners like this, who needs Sarah Brady?
Right, as long as the government involves itself in the pricing of said weapons.
And just exactly how are criminals inhibited by blanket laws that encompass law-abiding citizens within their unconstitutional mandates? How does charging a law-abiding citizen a premium for a small arm inhibit criminals? How on Earth does it inhibit them any more than the honest citizen? Criminals won't pay that premium, they'll just wait for ol' Honest Joe Citizen to buy one and steal it from him! Will Honest Joe at least get a refund from Uncle Sam for the difference between the ""criminal-inhibiting"" premium and what the gun should've cost to begin with? 
I'm stunned. Really. 
You really gotta take it easy with that ""we"" thing. I'm not going for a repeal of any bill. I'm in it for preserving The Constitution, all of it, and if Heller is decided correctly, repealing bills that the court just made unenforceable would be moot, wouldn't it? I honestly can't imagine how ""unreasonable"" you will see the 2nd Amendment if it's, well, upheld. 
I guess I gotta get out more. The forums that I frequent the most are those that are mostly populated by staunch supporters of an originalist view of The Constitution in general, and the 2nd Amendment specifically. Dare I say, WE don't molly-coddle gun-grabbers in hopes that we can dumb down the 2nd Amendment far enough for us to be viewed as ""reasonable."" It either means what it says, or it means nothing. And if it means nothing, God help us, we don't have a snowball's chance in Hell of keeping any of the rest of it meaningful and enforceable.

Alright I get the point! The trouble here is clarifying what type of criminal should be barred from possessing guns and what type shouldn't be. We've established the murders, those with genuine mental illnesses that render them dangerous to themselves and those around them. 
What about the other classes though, we need to clarify on who can be exempted and who can't be trusted.
Actually it's up to the manufacturers to determine the price they want to charge for their product. Bushmaster charges $1,200 for their AR-15, DPMS charges $700. Why's this? Because. If a manufacturer can legally produce machineguns for civilian sale again then it's only logical to assume that they'd charge more for them than they would a semi-automatic version.
I highly doubt that the Heller case will lead to the repeal of many of the gun control laws on the books. I won't believe this until I actually see it in action.
Wrong.
LOOK! I'm sorry if I'm not coming off as the perfect spokesman for the Second Amendment! I'm not the expert in this!
Gun owners can't afford to project the image of being the type of religiously uphold the belief of ""Anything short of a repealment of every last gun control law on the books is completely unacceptable!"" If we come off as extremists we'll be ignored and get nowhwere.
The politician in me says that for gun owners to get the final say in the matter, they're gonna have to conform to what the majority of Americans define as ""reasonable"". That doesn't mean we should support gun control bills, but it means that it's bad public relations to try and push for everything we want all at once.
Do you honestly believe that gun owners would have any chance at all of getting a bill pushed through that would literally repeal every last single gun control law in the entire nation?",104,108,topic_stance_votes_2

111,A question for supporters of gun control,gun control,support,"Ghost Rider, first let me say that I apologize for the reference to you being similar to Sarah Brady. A bit of hyperbole never really hurt anyone, but it does tend to detract from the main message I was trying to get across to you. In my first post directed to you I responded only to what you said. I didn't take anything out of context or engage in trying to belittle you, just told you where I took issue with what you were saying. The crux of the issue for me is the ""we"" thing. I feel when you use that word so often and so matter-of-factly, that you are trying to speak for people, myself included, for whom you don't have the right. Really, it's not as much that you don't have the right as it is that you don't have the knowledge to make such unequivocal statements in a way that makes it appear that you're speaking for other folks. Maybe I'm being a bit nit-picky, but I can't help it, I do prefer to speak for myself and to make my own case for the issues that I'm passionate about. This is obviously one of those issues.
With that said, I'll try to answer your current post to the best of my ability, without getting carried away with hyperbole.
Oh, no disagreement here at all. The difference though in how you're looking at the issue and how I am is that you're allowing politicians to control the outcome, whatever it might be, while I am demanding that courts reign in those same politicians and make them live by the law that they're sworn to uphold. I focused on Heller because I honestly believe it is our last, best hope to restore the 2nd Amendment to its unequivocal, unambiguous, unalienable glory. Maybe not the ""last"" hope, but certainly it will be a looooooong wait before another court is seated with a Chief Justice that has the cajones to take on an issue that the SCOTUS has been avoiding like the plague for our entire history as a nation. This case is monumentally historical, both in its potential to strengthen the 2nd Amendment or to make it totally meaningless to us as individuals. We've been waiting for 230 years for this! Now is not the time for compromise and/or equivocation, it's time for citizens to rise and demand that the court finally uphold the promise of The Constitution and of the birthright that hundreds of thousands revolutionary patriots fought to guarantee to every citizen. They fought to codify it in law that was meant to serve us in perpetuity in the greatest document ever written by man. Yeah, it's heady stuff. Hifalutin as all get-out, but this is where I'm coming from, and sheeple or no sheeple, politicians or no politicians, I refuse to sully the memory of these great men by buckling under to usurpers who I know in my heart of hearts are wrong, and whom I believe to my core do not have the preservation of individual freedom as their motivation.
I don't ""need"" to clarify my thoughts on this score in the context of this discussion. I do need to get across that I don't want anyone speaking or clarifying for me, and that's really my only bone of contention with you directly. I don't begrudge you your right to come to your own conclusions about this or any other issue, even if I vehemently disagree with you. I just am asking that you present your views that way; as your views, and leave me and the millions of gun-owners and 2A activists that you can't possibly know the accuracy of including them in whatever ""we"" you perceive to be talking about, out of it. Fair 'nuff?
Wait a minute GR, this is not at all how you brought up the idea of ""charging more"" for machine guns. Here's how that exchange went:
And your reply to that, precisely as quoted, was:
You're clearly asking me if I would find it more acceptable to impose some kind of extra charge in lieu of giving the government the power to pick and choose which small-arms weapons you're allowed to keep and bear. At least, I don't see how to read it any other way. Now, if you wish to retract that idea, that's fine with me, but the way you presented it included nothing about market forces which you are saying is what you were talking about now.
If the court finds that the 2A is indeed an individual, unalienable right which shall not be infringed, then how do states that impose 7 or 14 day waiting periods get around that ""shall not be infringed"" part? The court will have a choice if it finds in our favor on the individual vs. collective right issue; either include everything that can be legally construed as infringement within the Heller ruling (which is what I predict they will do), or commit lower courts and themselves to years and years, probably decades, maybe even a century or so, of civil right suit after civil right suit challenging every single law that can be made to appear as an infringement of the right to keep and bear arms in even the most insignificant, inconsequential or tangential way.
This case is HUGE GR. As a gun-owner and/or strong 2nd Amendment advocate, its importance cannot be overstated, and I do believe it has the potential to render a slew of local, state and federal laws null and void. Or, in American legal parlance, unconstitutional.
I don't even remember what this was in response to, and I don't feel like going back to find out, so I'll cede the point, whatever it was. But hey, this wouldn't be the first time I was wrong......I was wrong once before......I thought I was wrong and I wasn't! ;) 
Hey, no big problem really. But you kind of reinforce my main point here; if you're not an expert, refrain from lumping ""us"" all in your conclusions by asserting that ""we"" are unified in them. That's all I was trying to say.
Again, I am not lobbying Congress or my state or my city to repeal anything. I'm encouraging, in the strongest terms I know, the SCOTUS to uphold the supreme law of the land. The ""strongest terms I know"" are nothing more than repeating at every opportunity, my strong and deeply-held conviction that The Constitution means what it says, that The Federalist Papers do a great job of displaying what the Founding Fathers had in mind for every right delineated within the subsequent constitution, and that the simplest, and yet most courageous thing today's Supreme Court can do is rule according to the precepts unequivocally-stated in those documents and publications. I am not asking the court to be activist, I am asking them to do their duty to their oath, and take back the authority to decide and rule on what The Constitution means from a run amok Congress and Executive, and to rule on it as it is written and with full confidence in their knowledge that they know what the Framers intended it to mean.
In post-Constitution-ratification days, I would've been seen as the most liberal of Americans because I would've supported our hard-fought liberation from England. Today I am seen as a right-wing nutjob because, well, I still support our liberation from England, but I deign to support the preservation of the document that cemented the finalization of that separation to boot, and that's the rub. If I am labeled a ""right-wing nutjob"" by the likes of people who would demand of their Congress and President that The Constitution be changed, contorted and ruined by legislative fiat, I wear that label as a badge of honor. I want nothing repealed. I only want The Constitution upheld.
Well, if there really is a politician in you, then my views are probably stepping pretty heavily on your toes. I hope you can see where I'm coming from now though. No, I don't think a bill can accomplish restoring what it took 13 years and hundreds of thousands of patriot-lives to create, but the right court ruling can. Of course, this same ruling has the potential to make my views obsolete too. For me there is no middle-ground. I find nothing ""reasonable"" about 9 unelected men and women in black robes ""ruling"" that the 2nd Amendment doesn't mean what every signatory to The Constitution knew it to mean. If that happens, this discussion will be completely moot because America, for all intents and purposes, will then be dead.

112,A question for supporters of gun control,gun control,support,"Here's the problem with that Seeker. The Supreme Court currently has four judges that supposedly support the individual rights idea, four that don't, and one guy who can vote either way. There's no guarantee that the outcome will be in our favor, meaning that there's a need to keep all options open in case of another bad ruling coming to the light of day.
The Supreme Court has ruled in the past that blacks aren't citizens and not subject to the rights in the Bill of Rights, and they've ruled that women have a right to have an abortion. Many have disagreed with these rulings, we need to keep in mind that such a ruling very well could come down the pike.
Alright I get the picture!
I have difficulty expressing myself in the way I'd like to. I try to say one thing but it doesn't always come out right and comes off as something different. The last thing I want to do is let politicians have anymore say over the people who got them there.
I'm very aware of how big this case is, I know exactly what's riding on it. However my position is that I don't believe that simply ruling the Second Amendment to be an individual right is going to wipe out 74 years of bad legislation. For that to happen the SCJs would have to determine that not only is the right individual in nature, but also that ""shall not be infringed"" translates into ""no law, restriction or regulation may ever be passed for any reason"" and I just can't forsee that ever happening.
You'd accused me of wanting the government to set the price on new make and model machineguns.
Alright!
Good luck with that. In today's world that's gonna be damn difficult.
The politician side of myself says that options are needed and that all bases and angles need to be addressed and covered. If the Heller case goes south, then we're gonna need to bring out the proverbial big guns. What we'd need in the event of a bad ruling is enough public outcry to make congress feel compelled (read scared s**tless) enough to pass a new amendment to the constitution, clarifying that the right of the people to keep and bear arms is not military in nature and is truly an indivudal right.",112,113,topic_stance_votes_2
113,A question for supporters of gun control,gun control,support,"You haven't shown any problem with my rationale that I haven't already accounted for in some way or other. I have predicated all of my predictions with, ""IF the ruling goes our way....."" If it doesn't, then yeah, obviously none of my predictions or hopes, or fantasies if you prefer, will come true. I realize that, but I prefer to think in terms of the ruling going our way. 
I would much prefer that Ginsberg or another one of the dried up ol' farts with more communist....er, I mean, more socialist.... uh, wait, more flaming liberal leanings would retire before HillBill or Obama worm their way into office, but on the other hand, I find it hard to believe that a majority of that august body will lack so much conscience as to totally ignore what the 2A says, or what is extremely easy to prove the authors of it meant it to protect. Constitutionally-speaking, even the Supreme Court does not have that authority, though admittedly, I don't have a clue how we might enforce that truism if they detour even further from original intent than they have already. As I said in my last closing line, if that be the outcome, I will consider our form of government dead. At the very least, it will have been overthrown from within, an ideological, judicial coup, the very reason the Founders put the 2nd in there in the first place, and there will be nothing we can do about it because just as soon as that ruling is made that way, they will be coming for our guns. Mark my words. After that ruling, even talking about it being an illegal one might constitute sedition, or some knucklehead like John McCain will assert it as such and pass another law like McCain/Feingold, and how on Earth we could have confidence that the 1st Amendment will be upheld shortly after the 2nd being completely obliterated is well beyond my ability to maintain even the slightest glimmer of hope for.
And that's fine, you're welcome to that belief. We simply disagree. I don't see how such a ruling couldn't wipe out an awful lot of those laws though, being as Congress has had free reign to disregard the individual-right aspect of the 2nd by an absentee court on the issue. This is really the first time in our history that it is being constitutionally tested in a full and comprehensive way, and as such, we, or more importantly, the Congress and the courts haven't had guidance on the issue from past decisions. 
My train of thought is pretty elementary; if the ruling goes our way, that means that the court took notice of a large dose of original intent. Once the threshold of original intent has been crossed, and it becomes the basis for ruling the right an individual one, how much of a leap is it to rule likewise that all of the laws that ignored the 2nd's status as a protected indivdual right by putting heavy restrictions on the free exercise of it would then be unconstitutional? Personally, I don't see how those laws could stand, but hey, maybe I'm mistaken and you're right. We may get the opportunity to find out, but we may not.
Is that what you think I'm saying? I do believe that most subsequent laws passed after a successful Heller ruling will be challenged in court by one side or the other, and as such, some will stand and some will be deemed unconstitutional. I tend to think the major point of contention will be around defining the word ""arms,"" but whatever, of course there will be subsequent laws. The difference being that they will have to be written within the parameters that the ruling dictates, something that has not been the case for our entire history, except of course, for the short period of time after ratification when all of the founders were still alive and still active in government and would decisively repel any attempted weakening of any part of their brainchild, The Constitution. But for at least 200 years, Congress has been left to interpret the 2nd Amendment as they wished, and 20,000+ laws on the books that have never been constitutionally tested is the consequence of SCOTUS' abdication of their responsibilities. Surely an affirmative ruling in Heller would have a significant effect on a lot of those laws, no? I just can't envision how it wouldn't, but again, you might be right.
Umm....No, I believe I responded directly to something you said, which, in this post, you admit was not clearly-stated. (shrug)
Huh? So you think it's next to impossible to get The Supreme Court of The United states of America to consider their duty under The Constitution? If it's that difficult, then maybe this country is already dead. Certainly getting 5 people to see things through a constitutional prism is easier than getting 535 politicians using their votes mostly for pandering to special interests to see it that way, isn't it? But wait, I guess the following answers my question:
I've got news for ya my friend, if Heller is decided against the individual right, the 2nd Amendment is dead. There's no coming back from that decision because it means that not only the uninformed masses and a Congress that has already proven its disdain for constitutional limits on its power didn't care about the meaning of The Constitution, but the SCOTUS will have proven they have signed onto the same seditious, traiterous anti-American mindset. That would be the coup de gras to The Constitution. The Grand Finale to the American dream of an enduring representative republic. A dead 2nd Amendment is a dead Constitution is a dead America. 
I can't believe that anyone could really think that today's Congress would go all conservative on the court and restore the 2nd Amendment after the court had basically repealed it. That would be the net result of a wrong decision in Heller, wouldn't you agree? 
I am also incredulous as to how you consider it almost impossible to expect the court to follow its duty, but you think Congress will do their job for them if we just threaten not to vote for them and make a lot of noise. Unless you are referring to actual ""big guns"" rather than figurative ones, that's what I'm getting from your two previous quotes.

You have quite a bit of nerve, you know that? None of the other rights enjoy such wide reaching scope and magnitude, it's ludicrous to assume that such would be different here.

I don't have any particular problem with my government listening in on suspected terrorists calling into this country, even if they are talking to a US citizen. In fact, of all the problems I have with today's government, that is one of the very few things that they're doing that I believe is a major tenant of their job description; protect the country from violent enemies. If you're talking to suspected terrorists, I contend that law enforcement's duty is to monitor those kinds of communications, and that foreigners should have no expectation of privacy when calling into our country to plot against us. It's pretty basic stuff, and I don't think it takes a constitutional scholar to understand the prudence or legality of monitoring the communications of people whom we know want to kill us.

I was under the belief that we had American citizens detained there as well.
I do, because absolutely anything can turn you into a suspected terrorist. That's why we're fighting so hard to never let the bill that would allow the Attorney General to deny firearms ownership to suspected terrorist individuals.
There's no guidelines for what makes someone qualify as a suspected terrorist, there's no way of knowing when you get on the list, there's no way of getting off the list. You're branded a suspected terrorist for life and there's no oversight on it.
Just remember that ""in the name of protecting the country from violent enemies"" politicians want to pass a bill that will ban gun ownership to anybody whose name is in the suspected terrorist watchlist. And you don't get informed of why you were denied, so that's a constitutional violation.
The whole point of this off-angle tangent was to point out that the Supreme Court hasn't stepped in and done their duty to rule any other terrorist-era rights violation as unconstitutional, so they're obviously not doing their job.
