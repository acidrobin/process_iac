How about this chloe - that would be murder. That baby is alive. A fetus, no matter which way you slice it, is not a person. The argument that life begins at conception or at the quickening or when daddy blows a wad, is at its face flawed. To make this point, some eggs that are ""conceived"" don't attach to the lining of the uterus and are rejected from the body during menstruation. Are we to say that those are lost souls? 
Here is an idea, if you don't like abortion, don't have one. But don't stand in front of a clinic and throw mean words and lettuce, I assume, or maybe cabbage, at some girl who has to make a hard decision.

After the following quick survey we shall see
That smallest human lives are still human indeed
Just read what is said by the scientific community: 
As surprising as this may be to some people, there is no debate within the medical community as to when life begins. Life begins at conception. Therefore, every ""succesful"" abortion ends the life of a living human being. 
Consider the testimony below from an assortment of leading embryology textbooks:
The Developing Human: Clinically Oriented Embryology, 6th ed.
Keith L. Moore, Ph.D. & T.V.N. Persaud, Md., (Philadelphia: W.B. Saunders Company, 1998), 2-18.
""[The Zygote] results from the union of an oocyte and a sperm. A zygote is the beginning of a new human being. Human development begins at fertilization, the process during which a male gamete or sperm ... unites with a female gamete or oocyte ... to form a single cell called a zygote. This highly specialized, totipotent cell marks the beginning of each of us as a unique individual.""
Essentials of Human Embryology
William J. Larsen, (New York: Churchill Livingstone, 1998), 1-17.
""In this text, we begin our description of the developing human with the formation and differentiation of the male and female sex cells or gametes, which will unite at fertilization to initiate the embryonic development of a new individual. ... Fertilization takes place in the oviduct ... resulting in the formation of a zygote containing a single diploid nucleus. Embryonic development is considered to begin at this point... This moment of zygote formation may be taken as the beginning or zero time point of embryonic development.""
Human Embryology & Teratology
Ronan R. O'Rahilly, Fabiola Muller, (New York: Wiley-Liss, 1996), 5-55.
""Fertilization is an important landmark because, under ordinary circumstances, a new, genetically distinct human organism is thereby formed... Fertilization is the procession of events that begins when a spermatozoon makes contact with a secondary oocyte or its investments... The zygote ... is a unicellular embryo... ""The ill-defined and inaccurate term pre-embryo, which includes the embryonic disc, is said either to end with the appearance of the primitive streak or ... to include neurulation. The term is not used in this book.""
Adding to the consensus of contemporary textbooks, is the testimony of older medical texts as well:
 * Human Embryology, 3rd ed.
Bradley M. Patten, (New York: McGraw Hill, 1968), 43.
""It is the penetration of the ovum by a spermatozoan and resultant mingling of the nuclear material each brings to the union that constitues the culmination of the process of fertilization and marks the initiation of the life of a new individual.""
* Biological Principles and Modern Practice of Obstetrics
J.P. Greenhill and E.A. Friedman, (Philadelphia: W.B. Sanders, 1974), 17.
""The zygote thus formed represents the beginning of a new life.""
* Pathology of the Fetus and the Infant, 3d ed.
E.L. Potter and J.M. Craig, (Chicago: Year Book Medical Publishers, 1975), vii.
""Every time a sperm cell and ovum unite a new being is created which is alive and will continue to live unless its death is brought about by some specific condition."" 
In addition to the consistent testimony found in medical textbooks, there is some equally conclusive evidence that exists on the public record. In 1981, a United States Senate judiciary subcommittee received the following testimony from a collection of medical experts (Subcommittee on Separation of Powers to Senate Judiciary Committee S-158, Report, 97th Congress, 1st Session, 1981):
 * Professor Micheline Matthews-Roth
Harvard University Medical School
""It is incorrect to say that biological data cannot be decisive...It is scientifically correct to say that an individual human life begins at conception.""
* Dr. Alfred M. Bongioanni
Professor of Pediatrics and Obstetrics, University of Pennsylvania
""I have learned from my earliest medical education that human life begins at the time of conception.""
* Dr. Jerome LeJeune
Professor of Genetics, University of Descartes
""After fertilization has taken place a new human being has come into being. [It] is no longer a matter of taste or opinion...it is plain experimental evidence. Each individual has a very neat beginning, at conception.""
* Professor Hymie Gordon
Mayo Clinic
""By all the criteria of modern molecular biology, life is present from the moment of conception.""
* Dr. Watson A. Bowes
University of Colorado Medical School
""The beginning of a single human life is from a biological point of view a simple and straightforward matter – the beginning is conception.""
The official Senate report reached this conclusion:
Physicians, biologists, and other scientists agree that conception marks the beginning of the life of a human being - a being that is alive and is a member of the human species. There is overwhelming agreement on this point in countless medical, biological, and scientific writings.
This, of course, should come as no surprise since the American Medical Association (AMA) declared as far back as 1857 (referenced in the Roe. v. Wade opinion) that ""the independent and actual existence of the child before birth, as a living being” is a matter of objective science. They deplored the “popular ignorance...that the foetus is not alive till after the period of quickening.” Doctors knew it during the 1800's and doctors know it today. Human life begins at conception.",11,14,topic_stance_votes_1

And anyone with any scientific understanding at all knows and clearly understands that dead things don't GROW; much less grow into an individual that resembles the very people who's copulation produced the fertilized egg that grew into the child in question.
This is pretty convincing evidence that life begins at conception. Here is a video of Ron Paul who is also a Doctor, speaking about abortion and the rights of the unborn.

Without sounding absurd, you feel convinced that life begins at conception.

We can't define a per se beginning of life, and I have to be careful here not to feed into the hands of pro-lifers, life, in the form we know it today (again, being careful not to feed into creationists hands), comes from life. The argument I was posing reffered to our definition of person and as it refers to law. A fetus, according to the law, is not a person.

Are you actually implying that if left to grow unimpeded, as a gestation period, that cancerous tumors will attain intelligence and sentience, much like an unborn child/zygote; if will if left to grow to term? I doubt you are actually trying to say that Brutus as it wouldn't even pass the smell test for a seventh grader today.
[QUOTE]Without sounding absurd, you feel convinced that life begins at conception. I take the stance that yes, the processes of life may exist shortly after conception (in as much as they are separated from the mother). That being said, we should really not consider when life ""begins"". 
That being said; on the contrary, because you do sound absurd in your stance. This reply is like saying hang around as I throw out all common sense and everything i know about science in order to equate an unborn child to a timor for Gods sake. And let's not even consider thr fact that because the fertilized egg grows from a specific point in time, every time, that that means it must be alive. Even though in every other aspect of life, growth means life. 
Your argument was not bait at all brutus. It was the revealing of your very shallow perspective that is centered on protecting the selfish rights of the woman over the rights of her totally innocent and dependent unborn baby. 
And to deny that we can define an actual beginning of life is another cop out because I just did above, with reasonable evidence to support why it is right and true. Especially since we're speaking about the beginning of intelligent life which in all cases, a healthy fertilized egg, when allowed to grow to term unimpeded will most assuredly grow into. And unlike a tumor, a fetus, when allowed to grow to term doesn't kill the woman carrying it.
As to your very lame back pedaling correction, that the definition of life only matters according to the legal definition of when it begins is wrong also? Because Roe v Wade doesn't even deal with when life begins, but only deals with the womans alleged rights. That is the crux of the argument between pro abortion and anti abortion advocates. Your side has never wanted to actually deal with when life begins; only protecting this billion dollar industry.

Here we see the typical tactic of using emotive language to demonize one side while sanctifying another.

Not in all cases,no. But are you going to claim that no woman has ever died in child birth, or that there are not significant health risks associated with pregnancy?

Words to live by Archie...",20,21,topic_stance_votes_2
21,Horton Hears a Who,abortion,attack,"I think that science really can't answer the question of what is a life as it is more of a moral question (not that you are saying science could answer it). One could also use an argument (and I don't use this one) that one should default to accepting all reasonable definitions of human life to be ""on the safe side"". A reasonable definition could be one that is held by a large amount of the population. 
Now i think science can tell us what is or isn't a human based on only science criteria. From what I have read it seems you could define any fertilized human egg as a human (noun). This doesn't mean much in terms of moral debate but there has been debate in the past on whether or not someone can use the term ""human"" in that manner. 
So to define human life I think one should consider it as a moral question as opposed to a science question. It is also a little more difficult now because you already have an answer you want to achieve. If you believe abortion is ok then you will want to formulate your ""human life"" definition around that. As a personal story I was actually ""pro choice"" before I actually considered the issues. The way I formulated a new position was taking what I already believe (don't kill innocent human life...[simplified]) and then decided what a human life is and followed that principal. In other words, I felt I didn't use result based reasoning to get a position. This is much harder to do, in my opinion, after the fact.",19,22,topic_stance_votes_1
22,Horton Hears a Who,abortion,attack,"Just to throw in my 2 cents... I'm pro-choice (both from a rights and a Malthusian perspective) But I'm not going to kid myself (hehe) that life doesn't start before the baby comes out. It's not necessarily a person yet, but the thing is still alive even if it might not be sentient from conception.",22,23,topic_stance_votes_2
23,Horton Hears a Who,abortion,attack,"I believe life begins at conception as well. And likewise I believe, as you do apparently, that that growing life is not a ""being"" early on since it must ""grow into an individual human being"".",16,24,topic_stance_votes_2
24,Horton Hears a Who,abortion,attack,"Erring on the side of caution is, by definition, erring. Moreover, why is that side the ""safe"" side? Why isn't the other side the ""safe"" side? If you're going to ""err"" on the side of human rights, isn't the side to err on the side that protects the rights of the human that's indisputably human?
So you're going with what amounts to moral relativism?
And you ""could"" define only a borne offspring as a human, or only a third-trimester fetus as a human, or only a month-old (one month past birth) offspring as a human. I think the whole ""could"" thing doesn't get us anywhere.
I agree that it's much harder to do it in that order, in the sense that most people have their opinion and have the desire to stick to it before they're informed enough to consider objective standards.
That said, I'll share an anecdote of my own:
For many years I've been contemplating just what life is from a scientific standpoint. I've checked many a biology textbook for a definition or list of criteria to distinguish life from non-life. Every definition proper I've ever found is extremely lacking. (Example: a book might define [living] organism as ""any individual living creature, either unicellular or multicellular"" but then it defines cell as ""the smallest unit of life,"" so we get nowhere.) Most books use a list of criteria that include metabolism, ability to reproduce, self-preservation, genetics, and usually a couple others. These generally do a decent job of distinguishing ""life"" from ""non-life"" if we use our preconceived notions of what is living and what is not as a standard for comparison. (But this begs the question: if we're using preconceived notions as the standard, why do we need the definition?)
My conclusion is this: A zygote fails to meet most of these criteria. It should not be considered alive by people looking to use a scientific interpretation of the facts. It has no ability to reproduce, no metabolism, no method for even expressing the desire for self-preservation. It reaches these stages later, when it is capable of surviving in a natural environment outside of the womb.
Note that this line of argumentation that turns a blind eye to other issues is not meant to be presented as the only valid (or even the most valid) approach.",22,25,topic_stance_votes_2
25,Horton Hears a Who,abortion,attack,"Because he is taking the debate to a completely absurd place TQ. How can you possibly compare a cancerous tumor to an unborn human being and expect me to respect your analogy. I dare you to take any normal average seventh grader and ask him or her to answer the following question true or false and see what they say to the question; ""An unborn baby is the same thing as a cancerous tumor that grows and kills its carrier"" TRUE or FALSE! How many 13 year old children would equate the two as the least bit similar or comparable at all?
None would in my opinion, especially since they are so much closer to experiencing the newness of life. So why shouldn't I scoff at allegedly intelligent adults making such stupid and absurd analogies regarding the unborn? 
The only strawman builder here is brutus for comparing an unborn human being to a cancerous tumor. And how incredibly sad that you are blind to that fact.
That argument might work if you weren't now redefining the debate. Remember tq, it was brutus who first stated that, and I quote: My argument was bait. We can't define a per se beginning of life So he denied that the beginning of life can be defined, and therefore determined. He also went on to say this: Tumors start to grow when you are exposed to radiation. And they grow and live independently of you, in as much as your body has no control over those cells, much like a zygote.  Are they too human?   
Are they too human? Huh? And you wonder why I reacted at such an incredibly inaccurate statement that attempts to compare cancer to a human being? You say above that brutus was right to say that a cancerous tumor is alive, but i have clearly shown where he compares a tumor to being like a human in order to marginalize a developing human baby to that of a cancerous tumor. And you're trying to insist his point is accurate?
Of course not. I have two daughters so I have run the complete gambit of emotions and concerns that my daughters either wouldn't be born healthy, or that my wife would experience life threatening problems in child birth. But just because complications in child birth DO happen, that in no way delegates child bearing as equivalent with a DISEASE; which is precisely what the argument that you're defending implies that you believe.
And can a more SEXIST argument for defending and justifying abortion even be conceived of? I think not.
I said this tq:

No, I'd say you missed the point by a wide margin.
No, I (and I'm going to assume Brutus) are showing that using your criteria for determining ""life"" does not work, as using your exact reasoning, a tumour is considered alive. No where, in no way, did anyone say a tumour was to be considered ""human"". It was an analogy used to show the errors in your argument.
See above.

*I see you edited while I posted-You are implying that the doctors/health care workers providing this service are solely interested in making money, and that they will fight tooth and nail to continue to do so, with no regard for the welfare of their patients. It's very similar to your reasoning behind rejecting scientific research-ie the scientists can't be trusted because it's a multi-billion dollar industry, so they say what will get them the grant money and get their name in the journals. You are effectively labeling an entire profession as corrupt, fraudulent, money-grubbing liars.

27,Horton Hears a Who,abortion,attack,"I clearly stated in my post this wasn't an argument I use but one that can be made. 
As for the human rights thing you refer to...that gets into a different question and I don't think is relevant in my point.
Which is why I said science doesn't really tell us anything.
I think you have to have a conclusion consistent with your beliefs. Many people are very inconsistent with their beliefs thus coming up with crazy ideas of when abortion is or isn't ok. This, once again, brings up the question of the correct belief and whether or not one is consistent with it. It is fairly impossible to change to beliefs but you can change an inconsistent view. 
I think my problem with this is that you are trying to find a science answer to a moral question. Science can define something however they want for whatever reason they want and it still is as arbitrary as any other definition. In other words, science has no authority on defining life other than to define it for simply purposes of communicating. Their definition has no moral significance to it.",25,28,topic_stance_votes_1

My point was that I've been looking for a science answer to a science question, independent of abortion. (My greatest single effort in researching and trying to devise criteria for the purpose of a science talk about abiogenesis with no attention whatsoever paid to morals or abortion.)
Which is why I am looking for a non-arbitrary one. ;)

29,Horton Hears a Who,abortion,attack,"Oh, well science seems to define life in a few ways depending on what they are describing.

It really only have relevance to the science that is being done...not anything moral or relating to abortion (unless you are saying a word can be used a certain way I suppose).
The only way to find a non-arbitrary answer is to have a faith. At least that's my opinion :)
Well science can be a tool to determine things once a moral system is set up. For example if you think everything blue is evil and call a blade of grass blue thus confirming it to be evil then science could say ""no, the grass is green""...that's a horrible example but you get the point :p .

Incidentally, Seuss was a POLITICAL cartoonist who published more than 200 political cartoons during WWII. He was quite the propagandist then and his effectiveness did not lower with the age of his readers.

It's offensive for a man to tell a woman how to view her pregnancy and what to do about it based on a religious dogma she doesn't believe in.
A potential human is not an actual human, unless it goes back to that unproven concept of ""soul"" again, and the belief ""soul"" occurs at conception.

Now let's take that sperm and inseminate a woman with it. That sperm fertilizes an egg from her and IMMEDIATELY THE TWO BECOME ONE AND THEY START TO GROW.

I submit that sentience isn't based on anything you are doing, but is based on our potential. Babies can't do anything at all but grow and absorb what ever their parents instill within them; but we value them as sentient beings. And since everyone of us came from the same place and have memories of being young, small and defenseless; how can you now claim that the unborn have no value when you love and appreciate your own life so much?

If she also dies; he will be charged with two counts. How can the law say that under that circumstance the baby is a person with rights, yet if the mother decides to abort that child, it loses its rights as a person if the woman decides that she doesn't want to carry to term.

Yes.
Consciousness, self-awareness, the ability to perceive pain that comes as the result of nerve cell development. The newborn baby has this, the fetus, up to 24 weeks gestation does not. 
Pure potential? No, that is wrong. Like I said, a potentiality does not equal an actuality. Either it has sentience or it does not. 
The fact that they can absorb and apply in learning and practice is sentience.
It includes the ability to make choices about my body. The fetus has no sense of value. The basic idea of value comes from sentience as well as social interaction. It doesn't come from the pure fact that something is ""alive"" or because there's a possible potential, as well as other potentials. 
The difference is the fetus was wanted. That's what would give it protection. There is nothing to say it's an actual sentient human person whose rights trump the rights of the woman to control her body. In fact, it was the woman's freedom to make choices and have security over her own person which was violated by the drunk driver. She may have believed the fetus was a ""baby"", and didn't want it interfered with, even in the early stages of gestation. That's her right to believe that about something that's a part of her body, and no one can decide for her, either way. 
The law isn't absolute that the fetus is a person.

You're saying that these things are certainties, but you're lacing your arguments with conditionals. If there is no spontaneous abortion. If there is no deleterious genetic defect.

Today, 59 percent of all abortion doctors are at least 65 years old. That's not a typo: nearly two-thirds are beyond legal retirement age. Most doctors who perform abortions specialize in obstetrics and gynecology; according to a study done three years ago, the percentage of OB-GYN's willing to perform abortions dropped from 42 percent in 1983 to 33 percent in 1995. (Doctors going into what's called family-practice medicine were thought by some to be part of the next generation of abortion providers, but a study published in October revealed that only 15 percent of chief residents doing family practice had any experience with the simplest abortion procedure.)
OB-GYN's learn the surgeries and procedures associated with abortion during their hospital residency programs. A 1991 study showed that only 12 percent of these programs now routinely teach abortion, and, according to Philip Darney, a professor at the University of California at San Francisco's medical school, all indications are that the percentage is ''still trending down.''
One factor in this is the growth in hospital mergers.-- Many bring together institutions with no religious affiliation and Catholic hospital chains like the Sisters of the Sorrowful Mother. The Catholic Church is, of course, firmly against abortion, and typically, one immediate result of this sort of merger is the elimination of abortion training and birth-control counseling.
Few medical schools dare to even mention, much less teach, the mere facts of abortion. My wife finished medical school last year. She never heard the word ''abortion'' mentioned in a classroom. Which medical school was it that neglects to expose students to what is one of the most common surgeries among American women? Yale.

PERSONAL INTEGRITY????? Are you kidding me? Are you so lacking in any understanding of reality that you think women who MURDER their own unborn children actually walk away with their personal integrity intact rather than being haunted by a deep and very personal guilt? Don't you understand that for all of the pro-abortionists excuses and justifications for this infanticide, in the end, in that woman's reality, she knows deep within her HUMAN SOUL that she has killed her own baby? And here's some evidence of the after effects of this National disgrace called abortion. http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/ASMF/asmf14.html
Is Abortion Safe?
Psychological Consequences:
Clinical research provides a growing body of scientific evidence that having an abortion can cause psychological harm to some women. ""Women who report negative after-effects from abortion know exactly what their problem is,"" observed psychologist Wanda Franz, Ph.D., in a March 1989 congressional hearing on the impact of abortion. ""They report horrible nightmares of children calling them from trash cans, of body parts, and blood,"" Franz told the Congressional panel. ""When they are reminded of the abortion,"" Franz testified, ""the women re-experienced it with terrible psychological pain ... They feel worthless and victimized because they failed at the most natural of human activities -- the role of being a mother.""[106]
The emergence of chemical abortion methods poses a new possibly more devastating psychological threat. Unlike surgical abortions, in which women rarely see the cut up body parts, women having chemical abortions often do see the complete tiny bodies of their unborn children and are even able to distinguish the child’s developing hands, eyes, etc. [107] So traumatic is this for some women that both patients and researchers involved in these studies have recommended that women unprepared for the experience of seeing their aborted children not take the drugs. [108] Long-term psychological implications of this experience have not been studied.
Researchers on the after-effects of abortion have identified a pattern of psychological problems known as Post-Abortion Syndrome (PAS). Women suffering PAS may experience drug and alcohol abuse, personal relationship disorders, sexual dysfunction, repeated abortions, communications difficulties, damaged self-esteem, and even attempt suicide. Post-Abortion Syndrome appears to be a type of pattern of denial which may last for five to ten years before emotional difficulties surface. [109]
Now that some clinicians have established that there is an identifiable patterns to PAS, they face a new challenge. What is still unknown is how widespread psychological problems are among women who have had abortions. A Los Angeles Times survey in 1989 found that 56% of women who had abortions felt guilty about it, and 26% ""mostly regretted the abortion.""[110] Clinicians’ current goal should be to conduct extensive national research studies to obtain data on the psychological after-effects of abortion.[111]
With the growing awareness of Post Abortion Syndrome in scholarly and clinical circles, women with PAS can expect to receive a more sensitive appreciation of the suffering that they endure. Fortunately, a growing network of peer support groups of women who have had abortions offers assistance to women who are experiencing emotional difficulties.
Many post-abortive women have also been speaking out publicly about their own abortion experiences and the healing process they went through.. Women or family members seeking information about this particular outreach can contact American Victims of Abortion, 419 7th Street, NW, Suite 500, Washington, D.C., 20004.
The Government is charged with one main responsibility. And that is to insure ""LIFE, LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS"" for all of its CITIZENS, no matter how small they are. And if the Government refuses to protect the most innocent and weakest among us CAPO, then how safe are any of us in the long run?
Why am I not surprised. You think that enabling her to commit infanticide is actually giving her a choice. How pathetically, and typically liberal of you. Forget the consequences to her from the guilt and sense of failure as a woman for resorting to such a senseless act as a solution for her problems; Forget that she just learned to run from her responsibilities in life and to justify and excuse her mistakes, by killing if need be. 
Actually, it's people like me that these girls and women come to for real help once they get a full serving of your lip service that accomplishes nothing more than to aggravate an already serious problem by telling them that the only solution is to kill their baby; that with enough cash they can solve their problem through infanticide. We help her to stop and calmly look at their situation and look down the road of life at the long term affects of todays decisions. Not just at the next 9 months and the allegedly immediate, yet shallow solution that abortion offers.

There are essentially two issues which must be resolved concerning unborn embryos and fetuses. The first is, ""Are they human beings?"" The second is, ""Should they be recognized as persons under the law?"" 
We've already established that there is no debate on the first question. Embryos and fetuses are fully and individually human from the moment of fertilization on. If this were not true, if unborn children were not demonstrably human, there would be no need to even talk about rights of personhood. ""Removing a fetus"" would be the moral equivalent of pulling a tooth. This, however, is not the case, and so the debate must now enter the political arena.
There is a very real sense in which the need to answer this second question is, in itself, an absurdity. If you look up the word ""person"" in your average dictionary (we'll use Webster's), you'll find something like this:
Person n. A human being.
A person, simply put, is a human being. This fact should be enough. The intrinsic humanity of unborn children, by definition, makes them persons and should, therefore, guarantee their protection under the law. For more than thirty years, however, this has not been the case. The situation we are left with is this. In America today, there is a huge and singular group of living human beings who have no protection under the law and are being killed en masse every day. Is that not astounding?! It is astounding, but not wholly unprecedented.
There have been at least two other instances in American history in which specific groups of human beings were stripped of their rights of personhood as a means of justifying their horrible mistreatment. African-Americans and Native-Americans both felt the brunt of a system which denied their humanity, stripped their personhood and subjected them to horrors beyond measure. While the legal framework that made such injustice possible has now been removed, it remains firmly in place for unborn Americans.
There remains one, and only one, group of human beings in the U.S. today for which being human is not enough. The inconvenience of their existence has resulted in a legal loophole of shameful proportions. What is a person? A person is a human being (unless, of course, you haven't been born yet, in which case we'll define personhood in any way possible so as to exclude you, kill you and forget you).

The fertilized egg has one more potential, only one further possibility of becoming a baby, compared to the sperm or egg seperately.
Are more potentials what makes it a human person, or more DNA? This one stage, the fertilized egg stage, is held up as sacred. It seems to be in a contrived way.

What the abortion issue boils down to is control over a person's body. Just as the govt. can't 'force' people of certain religions to take blood, even if it would save their life, the govt. can't 'force' a woman to carry a baby she doesn't want. You couldn't force me to donate a kidney that would save the life of another. You can't force a woman to carry a baby to term. Her right to liberty/freedom supersedes the 'potential' rights of the 'potential' person. We cannot allow our govt. to start managing what we can or can't do in the doctors office. 
I understand the pro-life position. And I agree that the fetus is alive. But that doesn't supersede the physical integrity, the borders if you will, of the woman's body. Our govt. doesn't have the power to make her carry a baby to term that she doesn't want to carry to term. The govt. has no business sitting in the doctor's office with us.
Imagine-- If they one day come up with a way to take stem cells and make new hearts out of them, but only 1% of adults have these particular stem cells. Imagine if one person's cells could grow hearts for 1000 sick people that would absolutely die without them. Imagine now that the operation is nearly painless and I'd only be in the hospital for 4 hours. Could the govt. FORCE me to have the opp oration, even to save 1000 people? No. It wasn't given that power in the constitution so it doesn't have the right, even though by not harvesting the cells those people are sentenced to die.

In order to be precise, this might be a little more detailed than necessary. The Federal constitution certainly has nothing to say about abortion one way or the other. Given that fact, the principle of federalism espoused in the Amendments 9 and 10 would grant the individual states the authority to decide their abortion policy. I don't know which state you live in, but abortion happens not to be covered in my state's constitution either, and as a result, the state is entitled and has the authority to prohibit doctors from performing abortions, and punishing those who choose do. This is why the states, historically and prior to Roe v. Wade, enacted laws that prohibited abortion.

My point on suicide is to say that no such right exists, period. It was expressly denied as a right by Locke, and that view has continued throughout our history because of a rights theory that relies on a Creator. Therefore, the court cannot be wrong to say the Constitution does not confer a right to suicide.

Yes, but, in the case of green hair, the constitution would protect MY right not to have green hair (whether it would be under 'free speech' or whatever). We agree, I think that anything not expressly forbidden or protected by the Constitution would be up to the states.
No, I agree with you that the constitution protects some rights of all citizens and specificities some powers of the govt. But there are certain things liberties we give up when we 'choose' to use govt. services. For instance, on a public road you must obey the speed limit. On your own road, you can do what you want (ie. NASCAR). Now the govt. has a right to say no Tax money will go to fund abortions (and that also, could be something that could be voted on). But private treatments between a woman and her doctor should be beyond the purview of the govt.
I agree that if one day the pro-lifers could get citizenship conferred on a fetus there would be a chance that they could try to stop abortions and to some extent the law does make a distinction (ie. third trimester abortions and etc...) but it think that the right of the individual woman to control her body should remain paramount esp. in early term of gestation.
As the power of the church diminishes, individual liberty increases. The fight over assisted suicide will one of the last victories necessary for a truly secular society. It is purely from a religious standpoint that the right of an individual to choose when and how they die has been disallowed. If you remove the religious connotations of suicide if becomes nothing more than another right of control over the individual's body.

As to whether we agree on the federalism amendments, I'll tentatively say that we appear to be in general agreement.
My point was in response to antonia's theory of Constitutional rights, which was, ""where it is not spelled out, we have a right."" The Constitution does not spell out that the use of public money grants the government the right to regulate. You won't find that anywhere.
The way you can consistently say that the government may regulate where the Constitution does not ""spell it out"" is to say that the legislative bodies are entitled to enact laws.
So you do not believe that a doctor should be held responsible for malpractice? After all, any treatments that a doctor would provide (or refuse to provide) his patient is merely a private transaction, correct?

Citizenship has nothing to do with whether an individual has basic rights under our law. One could not get away with murdering an illegal alien, for example.
You again refer to the right on the woman to control her body, which I have said is not a right, and I have pointed out very clearly that it is not a right, and why it is not a right.
First of all, it is perfectly plausible to deny on secular grounds that a right to suicide exists for the simple reason that the premises of secularism are just as unprovable as the premises of any other religion.
Second of all, a truly secular society is not desirable since it removes the only possible grounds for the actual existence of rights; that is, it removes the rational possibility that rights are real. Secularists can argue that rights are necessary, or that they are nice little things. But they cannot say that rights are real for the simple fact that rights are metaphysical; they are moral claims.
Society might be fine for a little while understanding that rights really don't actually exist, but that it should act as though they do.

However, it may be of interest that the federal government put rights in the constitution but that means they have to be put there...not that they are already there. In the mean time, a state can very easily create what they feel are rights. For example, if Massachusetts thinks gay marriage is a right then they have the authority to make it so. 
Strike it down using which law or provision of the constitution? Judges don't get to decide what laws they think are good or bad...they get to decide (in this case) if a law violates a higher law such as the constitution. 
No, the civil war was not about state vs federal despite unrealistic claims by some non-scholars. The federal government has some powers and the states have some powers. The federal government has no power to set a drinking age for example. Now the federal government can pressure a state (which is what they did) but they have no constitutional authority to do so.

8th? How is requiring a hair color a punishment? That makes no sense. The first amendment violation I think has no merit either. Requiring people to act a certain way has nothing to do with speech. And how can it violate the 4th when nothing is being searched and seized? I don't think those are valid arguments. Please explain if you think they are.
I see absolutely no provision that could strike down a law requiring green hair. States have always restricted dress codes and actions...for better or worse.

Laws against marijuana seem to be rather stupid when you allow tobacco yet those too are constitutional. And finally, laws requiring companies to not have Trans-Fats are, in my opinion, stupid and probably unfair laws but those are constitutional. The constitution is a very limited document for a very good reason. It is meant to give the greatest power to the people to decide for themselves how they want to be run.

Since the concept of personhood has thus been vaguelly but not specifically defined, there is a lot of disagreement on whether the concept of person with rights applies to the unborn. 
I continue to think that we are not having a specific enough discussion on the details of what constitues a person. I, and many others, think that at least two attributes are needed for personhood and, thus, rights:
1) The being in question is human - i.e. has human DNA.
2) The being in question has at least a rudimentary mental existence.
Instead of such a list of characteristics of ""person"" to aid in defining it, pro-life people consistently say that ""life starts from conception"" without analyzing what that means. So many times, I have asked the question - ""What specific changes occur to the unfertilized egg at conception that changes a non-person to a person?"" and have been met with silence. The only way I can interpret that silence is to say that pro-life people do not have an answer that can stand up to scrutiny, so they remain silent.

As for rights to ones own body vs right to life of an unborn, there are some - apparently including some of your oponents - that would view the right to ones own body as absolute. I would disagree with those views since, as you know, I do view the fetus as gaining rights of personhood once it gains mental existence. Luckily for women with an unwanted pregnancy, this happens quite late in the pregnancy so she would have had roughly six months to decide. The onset of fetal rights would represent a sort of deadline for her to make that decision. After that, I would think that she would be obligated, for the sake of the rights of the person inside her, to carry the fetus to term (except for risks to life or health). 
Apparently, even most pro-choice proponents support restrictions on abortion rights in the third trimester, so your opponents do not represent the majority pro-choice view.

How did a criminal have that right revoked? It was a consequence of the criminals action. Now, if a woman gets pregnant on her own terms why do you feel no consequence is to be observed? Why now do the rules change? If you instead compare the criminal to the unborn then what has the unborn done to deserve a loss or rights? What is the injustice done? The unborn had no choice in the matter at all!

You could, if our ship sank and the only way for me to live was for you to swim, dragging me to shore while performing mouth to mouth the whole time, you'd be within your right to let me drown. The fetus is completely Dependant on a fully formed, thinking person who must have the choice as to whether they will carry and care for the unborn. Again, without the right to control her reproductive system, a woman would be an unequal member of society as compared to males. Society could never even pretend to have equal rights if that existed so there goes your theory out the window anyway. It just so happens that a fetus, inside someone has to have their permission to be brought to term.
A woman can accidentally get pregnant anytime she has sex. Men can do whatever they want and never have to worry about it (and believe me, if men could carry babies, there would never have been laws against abortion). If abortion was illegal, then a woman would either have to abstain from sex or risk being FORCED to carry a baby she doesn't want, possibly ruining her career and/or many other life goals, going through the pain of birth, then either having to raise the baby or give it up, possibly causing both mental anguish now and later. That's why. Women would never be in complete control of their life.
We tell people they don't have the same rights as someone else all the time. A pregnancy can happen even if all precautions are used. The sentient, formed, woman can't be forced to grow something in her body that she doesn't want in there. In any dispute there is a winner and a loser. In this case the 'soon to be person' can't force someone to pay that kind of price to give them birth. The 'baby' doesn't have control of their life. They can't survive without the full support of the mother's body. This forms a relationship that must be voluntarily entered into by the person who is being completely 'used' as the life giver.
For a completely dependent unformed insentient being that can't survive without complete aid from the mother.  Its the same reason we can unplug the machines keeping people alive! When someone's a veg. its fine to unplug the machine. Think of the mother of that machine.

You've been trying to railroad CUNxTime into declaring a foetus a non-person by saying that if we don't declare a foetus a non-person, the woman's right to control her own body overriding the foetus's right to live would lead to a slippery slope whereby CUNxTime's right to wield his fist would override your right not to be injured by him.
Here you are, saying that:
This is a false dichotomy because we don't need to resort to declaring a foetus a non-person in order to give the woman's rights priority. There is no slippery slope; the relationship that exists between a woman and her foetus is unambiguous and is in no danger of being confused in law with your relationship with CUNxTime.

The alternatives you offered CUNxTime claim to exhaust the possibilities, but do not. Specifically, your rhetorical question:

I know. You merely drew a false logical conclusion from what would happen if we didn't declare a foetus a non-person, with the implication that we must in order to avoid a slippery-slope where CUNxTime ends up getting to punch you whenever he feels like it.
You are equivocating. Trials are conducted to establish guilt. The consequences - including rights being revoked - are not determined by the trial but by law.

Identical circumstances is what the issue is. When you say ""right to ones own body is above the right to a unborn"" as an argument for abortion then you can't add arguments or you render the original argument useless. You get to the point where you ask ""why does is this true in this case but not this case"" and the answer comes to a different argument. For example you could say ""well the unborn is not a person"". So the real argument is not that you have a right to your own body above that of the unborn but rather an unborn is not a person and therefore has no rights as a person. But when you give reasons like ""too much burden"" then you can apply that equally and identically to a one year old and yet we come out with a different answer.

I apologise without reservation; you are correct that it was petty and unnecessary.
As I mentioned, your earlier question presupposed that the personhood of a foetus was not in doubt. You would not have done that unless you believed it pivotal to your argument. Yet you have subsequently insisted that you have no problem with the selective revocation of rights without declaring someone a non-person. Where does this leave your argument?
But what is your justification for ignoring the ways in which the circumstances differ? If you are free to do so on a whim, I can do the same and ignore the context which allows us to discriminate between an innocent and a criminal, and thus declare that laws of incarceration are unsafe and unjust. Please, explain why you are allowed to ignore context while I am not.
There are only legal rights. They may reflect certain moral values but there is no obligation for them to do so. Does your argument then boil down to a complaint that the law does not reflect your personal moral beliefs?
And you have so far provided no justification for making this arbitrary generalisation. I maintain that there is no ambiguity, no riskiness, no slippery-slope inherent in a law which singles out the circumstances of a mother and her foetus. There is no chance of such a law being used by CUNxTime to defend a physical assault on your person, so why are you trying to say there is?
Oh, but there is. A criminals rights are infringed by incarceration, on the grounds that the rights of others will be thus better preserved.
Why, if the argument is spurious and arbitrary? Why should I not point that out?
Abortion law is clear, and applies only to a mother and her foetus. You've tried to call the validity of that law into question by tossing out context and pretending the law applies to persons in general. Why should I play along? The law doesn't apply to persons in general; your game of 'what if' is not one I need play.",283,285,topic_stance_votes_2

I stated it was a belief and if I didn't then I am now :). But my belief derives morality. I don't use the law as a basis for morality. 
Well if my words were taken that way let me just clear it up by saying I do not refer to the law because something could be consistent with the law yet the law can be inconsistent itself. 
To avoid the personhood argument altogether actually. In other words, I didn't want to get an answer to the ""rights of mother over rights of ____"" to be ""because _____ is not a person"". So the hypothetical was merely to see if the situation changes given an equal platform of ""personhood"" and whether or not that is consistent. 
Hopefully that makes more sense.
Actually, it would but obviously in a more reasonable manner. If states could actually vote on the issue I'd probably at least feel some sense of justice on one level. 
I'm arguing it should strive to be consistent with itself and moral. So should one be able to kill the child if adoption is not immediately available? 
I don't claim a slippery-slope that will cause me to be allowed to assault someone, I merely claim that the argument given is not consistent.

290,Horton Hears a Who,abortion,attack,"I didn't imply you should. Rather the reverse. The point I'm making is that when you speak of rights, there are attendant practicalities you cannot merely wave aside. You claim that some rights are not endowed by government (or any other human authority). That is untrue. For you to have a right, there must be a signatory authority to whom you can appeal to have that right upheld. If that is not the case, you do not have that right, merely an opinion as to what you ought to be entitled.
Which rather begs the question why? Is it because you find it difficult to argue against that answer?
Then women seeking abortion would simply travel to an amenable state. But it doesn't just fail on a practical level: why do you believe the decision is more appropriately made at state level? You've switched from excluding context and arguing based on shared personhood to including irrelevant context such as geographical location.
What a bizarre non-sequitur.
So now you've abandoned the 'assault' slippery slope and replaced it with the 'killing a child because adoption isn't available' slippery slope. My response is the same: the law is clear and unambiguous and is in no danger of being interpreted as a license to kill children whenever convenient. Either demonstrate otherwise or cease and desist the false analogies.
Not at all. You were arguing just before that your right not to be injured by CUNxTime should override his right to control his body. Neither of you have committed a crime, you are equal in the eyes of both law and morality, yet you insist your rights should take precedence over his. You're correct, of course, but that's the point, isn't it?

No, perhaps I didn't explain this well enough in the last post. It serves a few purposes. One, to see if a consistent thought is given. Two, to show why ""minding your own business"" is not a valid argument if one takes my belief. Three, to show that, in fact, the argument on abortion really does/should come down to the question of ""person"" (leaving out this option exhausts all others).
You simply can't argue every argument on a subject at once.
I switched to a more ""constitutional"" mindset. Even if abortion was available in Kansas (ha) and not Texas I would still feel Kansas was wrong. Don't get me wrong, this is why I said ""feel some sense"" as opposed to feeling all better. I believe it is a state question because of the 10th amendment. 
This is really off the topic though.
Then let me explain again. An argument I heard (paraphrased) was that the undue burden is a reason why abortion must be allowed and that when the child is born and an undue burden happens then adoption is allowed. So much question is what happens if adoption is not immediately available? Would killing the child be ok? Obviously in the case of pregnancy the option isn't available for 9+- months. 
I do not speak of the law here because the law doesn't have to follow a consistent path nor a moral one (but I believe it should do both). I'm speaking on a pure moral basis.

In any case you've already torpedoed yourself by insisting that rights may be selectively revoked based on other criteria. So by your own reasoning it doesn't come down to personhood.
Suffering happens, because there is no available 'out'. Your point being...?
Why are you asking me this? Do you think I'm going to say yes? Do you think me saying no helps you in any way?
You're clearly angling towards a claim that I'm being inconsistent. I'm not. Any foetus may be terminated prior to a given gestation date. That facility is extended to mothers on the grounds that prior to that date termination of the pregnancy is, all things considered, a tolerable solution. Beyond that point it is not considered tolerable, because of physiological changes in the foetus. End of story.
Then your complaint is that your personal morals are not reflected in the law.
All you're succeeding in demonstrating here is how and why you can't square your morals with abortion. You're choosing to exclude context, choosing to exclude the physiological state of a foetus as opposed to a fully developed child, and essentially saying 'if I pretend a foetus is indistinguishable from me, I can't figure out how to make it OK to abort a foetus without making it OK to kill me too'. Well, yeah, if I pretended the same things I wouldn't be able to do it either :)

I'm just asking. I'm getting the idea you think I'm more cunning than I am. I have no secret strategy :).
What do you mean by physiological changes to the fetus? 
No, again, I am not speaking in terms of law here.
Which is exactly my point. We consider, for our purposes discussed here, that a 1yr old child is no different than a 40yr old adult. With the issue of abortion it is considered by some that the fetus is different enough to not get the protection of life. So this isn't exactly a question of right to control ones own body over a right to life but really a question of what most call ""personhood"".

I recommend reading up on the subject. Google 'foetal development'.
If you're not commenting on the extant abortion law, what are we discussing?
That does not follow. 
We discriminate between persons based on other criteria all the time; you've admitted as much, yes? So your leap from 'different enough' to 'non-person' is unfounded.
But OK, let's entertain that leap as reasonable for a moment - where does it get you? We're still using a consistent, medical judgement of eligability for abortion, so your slippery slope arguments (killing children, justifying assault) still don't apply.
When we get right down to the nub of the matter, you just don't like things the way they are. You're trying to dress up that distaste in the trappings of a logical objection, trying to show that pro-choice advocates are muddleheaded or inconsistent or wrong on some objective philosophical level, but such is not the case.
Where do you draw the line? Do you, for instance, object to birth control pills which (usually as a secondary line of defence) prevent implantation of a fertilized egg? Do you object to using 'morning after' pills? How about choosing to eat a lot of meat, which raises the body's ammonia levels and inhibits implantation - is a woman who eats meat guilty of murdering her baby?

But it does. The fetus (or unborn baby) can't force a woman to carry it if she doesn't want. The woman must make that choice. Once she does, she's on the hook.

Abortion advocates don't want to talk about facts or science, but they love to talk about ""choice"". ""This is America...We're free to choose...You can't legislate morality!"" Nothing has so clouded and confused the politics of this debate more than the misconstrued application of this one little term. The bottom line is this. Choice is nothing apart from the context to which it is applied. Individual choices are either recognized or restricted based upon the circumstances at hand. That's how our laws work. You simply cannot talk about choice in isolation.
For thirty years, however, abortion advocates have sought to bestow upon choice a nobility all its own, a nobility it has no claim to. They refuse to be called ""pro-abortion"", but they gladly accept the label ""pro-choice"" (despite the fact that there are countless other issues for which they are decidedly not pro-choice). The fact is, laws against rape, murder, assault, theft, speeding, drunk-driving and even smoking are all ""anti-choice"". They take away legal protection from one particular choice in order to protect a more foundational freedom. All such laws are ""legislating morality"". That's the only way society can survive. Personal choices that infringe on the life or livelihood of another human being must be legislated against. Therefore, anyone who defends legal abortion by simply arguing that people must be free to make their own choices is either ignorant or dishonest.
Furthermore, in almost 99% of all U.S. abortions, the woman having the abortion chose to have sexual intercourse in the first place. Therefore, it could just as easily be argued that these women already made their choice when they chose to engage in behavior that often leads to pregnancy. Ultimately, restricting a woman's right to abortion does not restrict a woman's right to not be pregnant. Abortion, after all, does not keep a woman from being pregnant. Abstinence does that. Abortion simply ends the pregnancy of an already pregnant woman by killing the embryo or fetus living within her.
In the end, we are only free to choose so long as that choice doesn't kill or harm someone else, and our government exists to take away those choices that do. Nobody argues that a man should be free to choose when the context is sexual assault. What a fool he would be to try and justify rape by saying, ""My body, my choice."" Why? Because rape is a violent assault which involves more than just one body. And so is abortion. The heart of the issue is not ""choice"".

Where is the woman in all your considerations who must go through these great physical changes, even possible risks?
GASP!! The evil TART!! Burn her at the stake!!! Make her lower that hemline and button her blouse!!! The wicked daughter of Eve! The temptress, causing the downfall of man! I mean, to have sex! Why can't women act like ladies? They won't even remain silent in church nowadays, nor in the kitchen when cooking meatloaf for hubby. 
If some player gives her crabs, must she just live with it?
Well, yes, it does. It forces her to remain pregant.
And abortion, then abstinence also works.
It takes away the rights of the woman in favour of her fetus. The woman and the fetus do not have the same, body nor the same mind. The woman is developed in those areas. Like I said before, for anti-abortionists, the fetus is defined more by its potential, or by what it is not in actual reality, or by an underlying mythology that it has a soul. They speak of nothings and myth, and press this as a logical argument to curtail women's rights.",318,319,topic_stance_votes_2
319,Horton Hears a Who,abortion,attack,"Perhaps, for some pro-choice advocates, choice is the only thing that matters. However, for most, there are certainly other reasons involved for our support of abortion rights.
Speaking for myself and for many others who hold similar views, abortion rights are not considered as an all or nothing right. Specifically, we don't support abortion being allowed under all circumstances - so, therefore, we do not view abortion rights as being absolute. For most of us, it is important to look at what it is that is being aborted when considering the balance of rights of mother and fetus. While the embryo/fetus is just a body without any level of mind - i.e. when there is ""nobody home"" in the body - then all that is left is its potential to become more. It is not a person worthy of rights AT THAT MOMENT, just as a body that has no upper brain function left after a major accident would also no longer be considered a person - i.e. brain dead bodies are not people. It is equivalent to the religious view of a body without a soul. As for its potential to become more, though many of us do value that potential, we do not value it so much that we would take away the very valuable right that a woman (or indeed any person) has over the use of their own body. 
Once that body gains a mental existence (or, in religious equivalent, a soul), then many of us do view the fetus as gaining rights. At that point, we start balancing the rights of the fetus with the rights of the mother. If it is a risk to the mothers life or major health risk, then the mother's rights would still win out. Abortion for non-critical reasons would remain limited. Indeed, I believe that those statistics are very small anyway (i.e. the number of ~third trimester abortions that are performed for non-critical reason). 
Since polls (see the abortion section of pollingreport.com) show that over 80% of Americans would restrict third trimester abortions, this means that, indeed, most pro-choice supporters do not view choice as absolute but do take other factors into consideration - contrary to the points you made in your post.
If I can ask you a question: Most pro-life supporters seem to think that personhood magically starts at conception. What SPECIFIC changes do you view happening to the egg during fertilization that turn a non-person unworthy of rights into a person worthy of rights?",318,320,topic_stance_votes_2
320,Horton Hears a Who,abortion,attack,"So according to you it's consistent to insist that personhood be the determining factor when the rights of women and foetuses come into conflict, while insisting that personhood shouldn't be the determining factor in other situations where rights are on the line. Hang on, I'll get my dictionary... :)
The physiological changes judged by medical professionals to represent the point at which consciousness and therefore suffering can occur.
Then we are doing nothing more than exchanging opinions, and your attempts to paint my morals as inconsistent are spurious and irrelevant. Many moral codes of conduct are inconsistent. Therefore I can be inconsistent if I want to be - not that I am, mind you :)
Then your argument is entirely meaningless; you won't allow it to apply to anything. 
You point blank asserted that rights may be denied without denying personhood. Yet you simultaneously insist that in the special case of abortion, we must deny personhood. When I point out this inconsistency, you deny that.
If there's no slippery slope, then there's no ambiguity, and no problem. Your whole premise is that abortion law is dangerously inconsistent, yet whenever I try to pin down this alleged 'inconsistency' and ask what risk you think it presents, you say 'No, it isn't that, or that, and I never said it would lead to that either', despite clearly worded questions raising the issues as concerns of yours.
It's starting to look like you don't have an argument, because every interpretation I make of your words, you say it's wrong. What am I supposed to do, figure out for you what you should mean in order to make me wrong?
What 'certain arguments'? What's inconsistent about abortion law? What's inconsistent about the medical judgement of suffering?
Once again, you say the only consistent approach is to declare the unborn a non-person. Yet you have no problem denying or allocating people rights in other circumstances without declaring them a non-person. You're the only one being inconsistent here.
Which is ironic, really. You want to present an argument that abortion laws - or perhaps the justifications given for them - are inconsistent with the wider picture, yes? Yet because your argument falls to bits when applied to the wider picture, you want it to be given special treatment.
I mean, maybe I'm doing you a disservice; you keep telling me I'm not 'getting' your argument, so maybe it really is my fault. Just to clear things up, could you make a firm commitment to agree or disagree with the following statements:
1. Rights may be denied a person, or the rights of others upheld to their personal detriment, without declaring them a non-person.
2. Declaring a foetus to be a non-person is the only way to apply abortion law so as to be consistent with the application of other rights-affecting laws.
Then we merely disagree upon where it should be drawn. Medical professionals judge a first semester foetus no more capable of suffering than a fertilized egg.

It has to do with the fact that your vehement and righteous opposition to the killing of unborn 'children' does not extend to actual children. Try to wave it away if you like, but the fact remains you are a moral relativist when it comes to extinguishing the lives of innocents.
Choosing to portray it in a way that sounds wrong does not make the act itself wrong. 'Discarding 1.4 million unwanted mindless growths' makes it sound positively like a public service - does that mean it is?
I don't for a moment pretend abortion is as straightforward as excising a cancer. It's an emotionally charged issue for all involved and may have lasting psychological consequences, and I see it as tolerable, no more than that. But equally it is not the murder of 1.4 million Americans, and pretending it is does not make you right.

I'm just trying to get a handle on your reasoning, that's all. Excising a mindless lump because, after much soul-searching, the parents decide they can't look after a baby = bad, blowing up a healthy, alert, conscious child because someone in the same city block might be thinking bad thoughts about America = OK.

Most conception are going to be spontaneously aborted anyway, so the concern is when the woman purposely chooses and takes control of her own body. 
To be denied a million dollars is unfair punishment to me personally. I have the potential to have that, if others share their wealth. The fetus has the potential to be a person, if the woman shares her body. Potential, potential, not actual reality. 
So what value does the ""unborn"" have over the sentient born who are killed, the latter having lives and families and the ability to experience physical and emotional pain as well as happiness?
But war is all about killing people. It couldn't be a war otherwise. Sex was not started for the sole purpose of having an abortion. Ha, who is right or wrong in a war is decided by the victors. You are using moral relativism to decide what an acceptable or ""necessary"" loss of life is and is not.

However, there was no developing memories, it was not a ""you"" or ""I"", anymore than a sperm or an egg separately.

Now, do those words really expose an inability to distinguish between different circumstances? My only point, one that doesn't actually bear upon our discussion at all, is that one cannot support the death penalty and oppose abortion on the absolute grounds that 'killing is wrong'. That's all.
If a fertilized egg is judged to have that 'potential', then so must the sperm and egg at the instant before they met, and the instant before that, and so on. Denying conception - by any method including deciding not to have sex - is a destruction of that very same potential.
If you are tempted to scoff at this suggestion, because nothing 'real' is being destroyed, good. We're on the same page; I've just read a bit further.
You make that distinction because you are convinced that your particular moral relativism is justified. You see yourself as pragmatic and hard-headed, prepared to face up to tough choices. Me too. We're still both moral relativists.
I don't see it in any way irrelevant to point out that for all your 'look in the mirror' and 'look at a newborn baby', you're still prepared to sanction the death and maiming of innocent children - children whose mental existence and capacity for suffering are unquestioned.
I don't want to go too far down the 'war' parallel. I certainly don't want to get bogged down in an argument over whether any given war is justified or whether any particular strategy ought to be preferred - suffice it to say that I agree with you that war, and consequent loss of innocent life, is sometimes unavoidable given our present level of technology and cultural sophistication.

Let's see... 50 million women of childbearing age, averaging 2.09 children each, which is 18 months without ovulation, leaving around 30 years of unused fertility. So in any given year about 609,000,000 eggs go to waste. Now, sperm. Wow. 10,000,000 active ones per emission, let's say once a day on average for all 100,000,000 eligable men, gives us a whopping 365,000,000,000,000,000 frustrated tiddlers. It's hardly worth deducting the lucky ones. Now, potential Americans could be formed by any combination of those sperm and those eggs, so we multiply up to get 222,285,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. Add in abortions and we get 222,285,000,000,000,000,001,400,000.

Aw, don't dismiss me so lightly; you'll hurt my feelings :)
Think about this really carefully now. How can they have no potential to become human beings? If that were true, there is no way that becoming a human being could lie in their future. Are you saying that a currently unfertilised egg has no potential to be fertilised?
We are both walking, talking proof that currently-unfertilised eggs do have the potential to end up as human beings.
'Allowed' is a misnomer. It implies we could just put the egg somewhere and let the process occur unmediated. In reality, the mother contributes almost 100% of the raw materials and a considerable amount of regulatory control. She builds the foetus, and until it develops a mental existence there is no suffering caused should she decide to stop.
Life starts a little later, actually, biologically speaking. But you're not talking about life. At the risk of inviting another distortion of my viewpoint, a cancer is also 'alive'. You're talking about something more specific than life: potential Americans, and as I've pointed out, if the fertilized egg is a potential American then logically so must the egg and sperm have been, collectively, in the instant before fertilisation. If that were not true, fertilization could not occur and an American could not pop out at the other end. That's what potential means.
Very pretty, but I don't really understand the significance. Yes, I was once a fertilised egg. Before that, I was an unfertilised egg and a sperm, one of millions of potential combinations only one of which was realised. Should I feel guilty for 'murdering' all the rest of that potential by swimming too fast? Because make no mistake, that was 'me' at work.
If you're going to insist on talking about potential, you have to be consistent. What's the difference, in terms of 'murdered potential' between preventing a sperm and egg meeting that would otherwise have resulted in a fertilised egg, and destroying said fertilised egg?
Already done long ago - I swam faster than the rest. You've done the same. We all have.
What I now call my body was once a mindless lump of tissue. My mind hadn't developed yet. What I think of as 'me' didn't exist, so aborting that foetus wouldn't be killing 'me'. Nor would it be denying 'me' anything, because I didn't exist. It would be denying that lump of tissue the chance to be animated by a mind, perhaps, but that's hardly the same thing.
Steady on, old boy; let us not stumble needlessly into that pit we call Liars Corner :)
I appreciate that you feel strongly about this, so strongly that you simply cannot believe anyone could have an alternative viewpoint without being dishonest to themselves or others. But that's a failure of your imagination, and you should hesitate before blaming others for it. It's rude.
In other words, only a fool would be a moral absolutist.

342,Horton Hears a Who,abortion,attack,"Sorry for being flippant - but I'm not distorting what you're saying.
Correct, but that's not all you're saying or have said. You clearly and unambiguously stated that a person may be denied rights without declaring them a non-person. That contradicts your claim that we must define a foetus as a non-person to deny it rights. 
I can't help that there's a contradiction there. I can't make it go away. And when the main thrust of your argument concerns consistency, I think it's somewhat hyopcritical of you to be selective about to whom it should apply.
If there is no mind, what exactly is doing the suffering?
Yet you also stated that persons may be denied rights without declaring them a non-person. So if I find it hard to follow the 'logic' of your argument, I feel I'm not entirely to blame :)
If that was the impression I gave, I apologise. My position applies absolutely to the question of rights superceding other rights - such determinations are made all the time in all manner of circumstances without ever declaring anyone a non-person.
No, but I think we have crossed purposes somewhat.
As I demonstrated an understanding of earlier, you're arguing against a particular justification for abortion, yes? Rights of the mother superceding those of the child. Ok. You've raised concerns that such a justification is inconsistent. If I recall correctly, you presented them thus:
1. You suggested, by posing a particular question, that the same justification could be used to defend CUNxTime striking you. Even if that question were not rhetorical, you clearly saw it as a potential problem, yes? Otherwise you would not have asked that question.
2. You've implied that elevating one right over another is not how things are done elsewhere. Certainly whenever I've produced an example you've said you don't 'see it' as being a question of one person's rights overruling another's.
The first claim of inconsistency is false because the logic used to justify abortion would not justify assault on your person. You do not fit the criteria which makes it tolerable to destroy a foetus, and CUNxTime's circumstances do not match those which qualify a pregnant woman to exercise control over that foetus. This directly parallels the specificity of abortion law itself.
Secondly, we clearly and demonstrably do elevate one person's rights over another's in all manner of circumstances, without declaring either one a non-person. So the notion that this justification is inconsistent with the resolution of other moral issues is also false.
I don't think I said there was a right to incarcerate. I simply said that some of a criminal's normal rights are superceded by the rights of others. That applies whether you treat rights as a moral imperative or a legal guarantee.
If you can spare a moment to check, you'll see that what we disagreed upon were the requirements for you to have a particular right, not how they are arrived at. Rights are an expression of what we feel is morally correct or can show to be practically beneficial, but you do not have any particular right unless it is guaranteed by a potent authority. Until such time as that is true, you only have an opinion as to what people should be due. Practicality vs idealism.
That's why I take exception to arguments of the form 'X has a god-given right to Y, so we shouldn't infringe it': there's no such thing as a god-given right. Your personal beliefs about god may lead you to believe he intends certain things for us, but that's all. In some cultures, men have a 'god-given' right to do all sorts of things to women - there, as anywhere, 'god-given' is merely a reflection of their own opinions and traditions.
If you want to convince me that a foetus has rights which supercede those of the mother rather than the other way around, before that foetus has a mind or is capable of suffering, I feel I'm entitled to more than just an appeal to 'god-given', because that's really just 'I'm right, and god thinks so too'. I also think appeals to 'that justification is inconsistent' are weak when your position is still one of rights superceding others.
Has that cleared up our burgeoning misunderstanding? :)",334,343,topic_stance_votes_2
343,Horton Hears a Who,abortion,attack,"What you have shown in this response Peeling is that you have no problem applying the most shallow rationalizations regarding the development of new human beings. As long as you can keep the debate limited to unfertilized eggs and sperm, or zygotes, or fetuses; then you can keep it so impersonal as to not be about human beings with minds. Well let's look at a site that caters not to abortionists, but to new mothers, and about to be, mothers. 
Notice how different the language is than that which you have subjected me to in your bloviating about how insignificant a fetus is because in your opinion it's just a mindless mass of tissue. 
http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu8K4Xf...es/Page604.htm
Here is the description of the development that takes place in just the first and second month to remind you that we are actually dealing with human beings here. And notice the rapid growth that takes place in the second month.
First Month
The process of implantation begins after about 5 to 7 days when the sperm fertilizes the egg, and the egg attaches to the lining of the uterus. The fertilized egg then begins to grow in the uterus, doubling in size every day. At this stage of development the baby is called an embryo.
Shortly after implantation the placenta and umbilical cord begin to form. The placenta and umbilical cord take care of the nourishment and oxygen being provided to your baby and carry away the baby's wastes. Your baby is enclosed in a sac of fluid to protect the baby from bumps and pressure.
In another week the baby has a spinal cord. Within a few days , she develops 5 to 8 bones of the spinal column (vertebrae). By the end of your first 6 weeks of pregnancy, your baby has a head and trunk. The eyes, brain, mouth, inner ears, and digestive system begin to form, as do tiny buds that will be the arms and legs. The heart also forms, and it begins to beat on the 25th day after conception (5 to 6 weeks after the last menstrual period).
By the end of 6 weeks your baby is about a half inch long (1 centimeter) and weighs a fraction of an ounce (or a few grams).
By the end of this month, most mothers start feeling nausea termed as “morning sickness”. It gets worse for some mothers as months progress while others may not experience this symptom at all.
Second Month
This month is part of the most critical aspect of your baby development. It is imperative to take precaution against external factors like drugs, viruses, or environmental factors such as pesticides which may cause birth defects.
Your baby's development is very rapid during the second month. By the end of the second month, all of your baby's major body organs and body systems, including the lungs, liver, and stomach, have begun their development cycle. Eyelids form and grow but are sealed shut, and ears are formed. Ankles, toes, wrists, fingers, and sexual organs start developing. If your baby is a boy, his penis will appear as part of the organ growth.
By this month end your baby starts looking like a miniature human infant rather than the small cell it was conceived as. The baby is a little over 1 inch long (3 centimeters) and still weighs less than 1 ounce (less than 28 grams). The baby is now in a sac called the amniotic sac.
The expectant mother may start having enlarged breasts nad prominent nipples. There may be some tenderness and pain in the area due to an increase in the body hormones. There may be increased vaginal secretion and the mucous plug begins to form. The expectant mother may feel an increased urge to urinate because of increased pressure from the uterus due to the growing fetus.
Now, in addition to the above, let's get past this mindless lump of tissue assertion of yours. Does a mindless lump of tissue FEEL PAIN? Of course not. Because there's no mind to transfer to, or the pain or receptors to receive it, right? Then explain this Dr's opinion to me and continue to justify your attempted minimizing of who and what the unborn are in reality. They do feel pain which confirms that they do have minds. I believe that even hear and have thoughts. And since they have brains, that is actually not a leap at all to believe.
http://www.gargaro.com/fetalpain.html
DOES THE FETUS FEEL PAIN?
Summary of a presentation given by Dr. Paul Ranalli on ""Pain, Fetal Development, and Partial-birth abortion"" on June 27, 1997. (I personally attended this presentation). Related links are included below.
The fetus can feel pain at 20 weeks. This is probably a conservatively late estimate, but it is scientifically solid. Elements of the pain-conveying system (spino-thalamic system) begin to be assembled at 7 weeks; enough development has occurred by 12-14 weeks that some pain perception is likely, and continues to build through the second trimester. By 20 weeks, the spino- thalamic system is fully established and connected.
There are three different indicators providing evidence that the fetus feels pain.
Anatomical
- pain receptors spread over the body in stages: 8-16 weeks
- pain impulse connections in the spinal cord link up and reach the thalamus (the brain's reception center): 7-20 weeks (summarized by Anand, K.J.S., Atlanta)
Physiological/Hormonal
- fetuses withdraw from painful stimulation
- two types of stress hormones, normally released by adults subjected to pain, are released by adults subjected to pain, are releases in massive amounts by the fetus subjected to a needle puncture to draw a blood sample:
(a) from 19 weeks onward (N. Fisk; London, England)
(b) from 16 weeks onward (J. Partch; Kiel, Germany)
Behavioral
- withdraw from pain
- change in vital signs
A 20-30 week old fetus actually will feel more pain than an adult. The period between 20-30 weeks is a uniquely vulnerable time, since the pain system is fully established, yet the higher level pain-modifying system has barely begun to develop.
Below is a graphical represenation depicting this mis-match in pain detection and pain modification

347,Horton Hears a Who,abortion,attack,"Mothers with wanted pregnancies look forward to the baby being born and, during the pregnancy, enjoy imagining what it will become. They feel an attachement to whatever stage the baby is at that moment because of the hopes for what it will become. Their attachement is based on expectation and potential. The web sites catering to new mothers oblige them in this affection by calling even a zygote a baby.
However, a zygote and a baby are very different in reality. Apart from human DNA and the start of the growth process it really has no similarities to a baby itself, though it will eventually develop into a baby - i.e. potential.
If the zygote had no potential to turn into a baby then I have no doubt that the great majority of mothers would feel very little affection for it. Its worth to them is almost purely in what it will become - again, ""potential"".
The main point to argue is that a potential something is not that something. I can potentially be a billionaire. That does not make me a billionaire. So, a potential baby is not a baby and it is erroneous to call it that except if, as in these web sites, you want to cater to the emotions of the mother by calling it something it is not.

349,Horton Hears a Who,abortion,attack,"That was my reason to post a link to that site Ao, because I wanted to show how people through out the real World refer to the unborn. What you call zygotes are developing children; future human beings; babies to be. By whatever impersonal label you place on them, they are still developing human beings with all of the value that you yourself possess.
What I marvel at is that you can't see how incredibly ridiculous this paragraph is. ""Apart from human DNA and the growth process it really has no similarity to a baby itself""? Talk about taking the meat out of the argument! A fertilized egg does have HUMAN DNA, and it DOES GROW! Which proves it's alive because we all know that dead things don't grow. But still you'll deny the unborn their humanity. Go figure huh?
Thanks for making my point...
And neither is your comparison a valid one. Becoming a billionaire is something someone accomplishes through personal effort, it isn't a state of being as is the result of the birth process. Just as a pregnant dog will always deliver a litter of puppies, so will a woman always deliver a human baby. It has nothing to do with the will. No matter how much a woman wills it, she will never deliver anything other than a human baby.
This photo is of a Fertilized human egg (zygote) having reached the blastocyst stage Zygote contains a fluid filled blastocele which is preparing for implantation into endometrium of uterus.
http://www.fotosearch.com/comp/LIF/L...~-3D605008.jpg
So at this point of its development it has very little in common with a baby. But that's only because of its stage of development and not because of any inherent flaw with its existence. This zygote hasn't even attached to the uterine wall yet so although it is a fertilized egg, it's future development into a human being isn't yet assured. And this is the stage when abortions take place, so to imply that zygotes are aborted is completely fallacious, because it's fetuses that women choose to get aborted, not zygotes. Here are pictures of aborted babies. Maybe they will help drive home the reality of what is actually being discussed here regarding this disgusting and inhuman practice of what allegedly civilized human beings are doing to 1.4 million unborn babies per year in America alone.

In the long run it doesn't really matter if the pics are real or not. The fact is that there is no way to prevent pregnancy with 100% accuracy.

381,Horton Hears a Who,abortion,attack,"Well even if I were saying that it still isn't a contradiction. If you say you don't need sugar to make a cake but to make a spice cake you have to have sugar (this isn't true by the way :p) then you aren't contradicting yourself. You just are applying a restriction on a broad statement. 
Thinking about it I believe you are using a different definition of ""consciousness"" which is appropriate. So ignore what I wrote.
I think rights can supercede another right but I think it applies absolutely and is inconsistent if you say ""it can here but not here and only here if this occurs"". It is completely random and really has no basis for logic. Of course the normal abortion argument I get will then come down to something like a person is something that is human and conscious (at some varied level) and once that point occurs the right to life exists. So it really comes down to a person argument in those cases. But I believe you would be arguing that being a person (by whatever definition) is irrelevant. Is this correct?
Which, you'd have to admit, probably has caused some confusion. Even more so since you are having multiply discussions at the same time.
Well not only justification for abortion but anywhere that kind of argument would apply....but yeah.
Yes, a potential problem indeed. The key word is potential.
Two things here, one: we have a different idea of rights and two: I don't think your example showed two different rights where one trumped another. Instead it was a government function of power overruling a government issued right via due process. Certainly an ok thing to do in my opinion but if you were to apply that to abortion then you'd have to give the same due process like we discussed before and once you do this then we really get back to the question at hand because at some point you need some logic for a law...or at least an argument I suppose.
But it potential could. 
But right off the bat you make the argument useless to even make (the argument CUNxTime used). That criteria of who gets ""rights"" is what is at issue not that a right to life is overruled by a right to ones own body. I believe it was understood by CUNxTime as well as others here that ""person"" implies certain rights. 
See above as I disagree that rights overrule other rights in some but not all circumstances. 
Are you sure? I copied the phrase ""right to incarcerate"" somewhere. What rights are superseding other rights anyway?
Again I disagree with this statement. A government granting rights often times has nothing to do with morality. Again, I just agree with the DoI and you are free to not. 
And this is just your opinion as well. It is rather clear that our country was founded on the idea that we have rights outside of government. 
If you are of the opinion that a right only exists when the government says it does then of course the fetus has no rights and furthermore the woman has no constitutional right to abortion either (assuming we apply the law correctly). I'm not even sure how you could ever claim a right if you don't have it and get away with it under your idea of how rights exist. Do you argue that one ""should"" have a right? I think that gets into a different debate so I'm gonna stop on that one.",343,382,topic_stance_votes_1
382,Horton Hears a Who,abortion,attack,"I could argue that point, but OK, I understand the spirit in which you're making it. 
However, this 'application of a restriction' is exactly what I said it was several posts ago: special pleading in the case of abortion. You want to make it a unique kind of 'cake' that requires sugar. And unlike 'spice cake' which by definition refers to a particular recipe presumably including sugar, here the 'recipe' for abortion is what is up for grabs - you need to show it needs sugar.
Incidentally, let's not use this cake metaphor any more; it's driving me nuts.
It's trivial to find many such examples you would agree with. As a parent, I can choose to home-school my child - but my neighbour cannot intercept my child on the way to school and take her to his house for schooling. Similarly I can ground my child for being rude, and restrict her movements - were anyone else to do that they would be charged with kidnapping. And so on and so forth.
What I'm arguing is that there are clear medical and contextual arguments concerning the various rights, responsibilities, obligations and consequences involved, and arbitration can be made without dragging 'personhood' into it. Indeed, I think arguing on the basis of personhood alone is less safe, because it removes from the foetus various protections against unsanctioned abortion.
Quite, and I apologise.
I think you need to explain why, though. I can't see any logic that would permit the distortion you describe. Can you? If I present a justification for abortion that doesn't mention personhood but instead factors in the relationship between mother and foetus, the undeveloped mind of the foetus etc etc, can you really distort that justification to legitimise assault?
If you're referring to trials, my answer is as before: trials establish guilt - or more generally, they establish whether a particular statute applies to a particular person or situation: whether they qualify. With a mother and foetus, there is no point having a trial to establish whether the statute applies.
If I used that phrase, it was sloppy. I did not intend to represent a specific 'right' as such, merely that a person can be lawfully locked up, some of their normal everyday rights rescinded, in order to protect other rights.
Steeeeve, I don't disagree with the DoI. I'm stating a clear, simple fact: you only HAVE a right if it is guaranteed by a potent authority. I'm not saying anything about whether that right exists in the abstract, is moral, was derived from morals, or anything else.
Say you enter a funfair, and at the gate I hand you a voucher entitling you to a free hot-dog. Do you now have a right to a free hot-dog? It depends entirely upon whether *I* had any authority to hand out those vouchers and whether I can make good on that promise. If I was just some guy yanking your chain, you have no hot-dog related rights whatsoever. Even if I was serious, your 'right to a hotdog' ultimately depends upon my goodwill or alternatively the power of a higher authority to force me to make good on my promise.
The DoI may include rights percieved as 'god given', but like I said, that's just a reflection of the signatories' philosophical beliefs. You now have those rights because they are part of the government/citizen contract.
Ought to have certain rights, transient governance notwithstanding, hence those rights are part of the contract to which all US governments are obliged to be signatory. It's very straightforward.
That's a slight distortion. It exists if it is in the contract between government and citizen; it is not something the government (or at least a democratic government) can revoke or extend willy-nilly. Hence the flagrant opportunism exhibited post 911, where all manner of rights-violating laws were bum-rushed through Congress under the banner of patriotism - but that's certainly a different discussion.",382,383,topic_stance_votes_2

384,Horton Hears a Who,abortion,attack,"I, and most on the pro-choice side, make a clear distinction between what IS and what WILL BE. Again, a potential something is not that something. I am a potential billionaire but that does not make me a billionaire. I would love to be treated as a billionaire since I have that potential but that would be ridiculous. Another analogy (that gets around your objection to that particular example) is that every kid is a potential adult. That doesn't mean that they should be treated as adults when they are four years old because they have a very high probability of automatically becoming adults given time. 
They are human. So are all the cells in our bodies. I really don't care whether a cell has full human DNA or not. I will not value that cell or cells for that point alone. When I scratch my arm, I am killing millions of such cells. 
As for it growing, the growth alone only has worth in that it is a process that will lead to something that we DO value - i.e. full human persons. 
The main difference in our thinking process is that you seem to treat a potential something as that something. We all value babies. However, you seem to say that something that can become a baby needs to be valued as much as a baby. You certainly have the right to think that but it is very unconvincing. Most of us can tell the difference between a potential something and that something. A child is not an adult, even though it will become one. So, a child should not be treated as an adult because it is a potential adult. An unfertilized egg has the potential to become a person. Should it be treated as a person?
Pictures can stir emotions but as rational beings we need to not jump to conclusions but to try to understand the situation as it actually is. When I see a picture of a mangled body, I get an emotional reaction because I quickly emotionally jump to the conclusion that the person who inhabited that body must have suffered when that damage was done. That is the main thought that drives my emotions at seeing pictures of mangled bodies. However, as a rational person, I need to step back and ask whether that actually happened - i.e. whether someone actually DID suffer that mutilation. There, I trust science since it supplies evidence and that evidence says that, for the great majority of abortions which happen in early term, there is no pain, or indeed no mind whatsoever. There can't be because the brain is insufficiently developed. Therefore, our gut reactions when seeing those photos are just wrong because they are based on imagination, not reality. Similarly, we can get a gut reaction when seeing operations or when seeing dead bodies cremated or worked on by an undertaker. Just because we have a gut reaction doesn't mean that the knee-jerk conclusions we jump to based on those gut reactions are at all based on reality.
As for your comment ""So at this point of its development it has very little in common with a baby. But that's only because of its stage of development and not because of any inherent flaw with its existence."": I never said that the zygote has any flaw with its existence. It is perfectly formed for its purpose at that stage of development. However, the stage of development IS important. After all, the zygote is just a stage of development from the unfertilized egg - where that development involved fertilization. Again, I suspect that your main arguement is that we need to value a potential something as much as that something - so a potential baby needs to be valued as much as the baby and, under this reasoning, stage of development does not matter (with the exception of the stage of development of fertilizataion). Most of us on the pro-choice side disagree, so stage of developement DOES matter since it is important to us what has already developed - future is less important to us than present.",350,385,topic_stance_votes_2
385,Horton Hears a Who,abortion,attack,"Sorry, but I don't see why my rationalisation deserves to be called 'shallow'.
Your rationalisation equates a fertilised egg with a newborn baby. It appeals to 'potential', without being in the slightest consistent regarding the existence of potential in a fertilized egg vs the sperm and egg a nanosecond prior to fertilization. If there is any evidence of superficial thinking to be found in this discussion, I think we will find it there.
It isn't the words I'm choosing that prevents an egg or a zygote or an early-term foetus being a human being with a mind. It's the fact they don't have minds.
Again, you're projecting your own argument on to me: you keep using one word, baby, in order to equivocate, to falsely endow a foetus with properties it simply does not have.
As others have pointed out, hardly any abortions are carried out after the stage mentioned here, and even that small number tend to involve extraordinary medical justifications.
But ok, let's look at what's being claimed here. Pain receptors form early on but aren't wired up to anything. They connect to their destination by 20 weeks, enabling the physical reflex responses mentioned. However, there is no mind to appreciate or comprehend those signals for another seven weeks or so:
From here, which is a very in-depth study of neonatal pain.
For there to be suffering, there must be an awareness and understanding of pain, otherwise it's just signals travelling along nerves, indistinguishable from any other signals. Add to that the very, very small proportion of abortions carried out at such a late term, and the fact they usually have exceptional extenuating circumstances, and it's clear that the overwhelming majority of abortions do not court any danger of inducing suffering in the foetus.
I'll reiterate, in the hope that it will inform your interpretation of my arguments: I perceive abortion as tolerable. I can quite understand why some people would emotionally balk at the prospect, and it's entirely possible that I might be one of them if faced with the reality of the decision - I think it would very much depend upon how far gone the foetus was. However, I don't believe my squeamishness - untested at that - should be forced upon others who may be sufficiently motivated or clear-thinking to make a different choice.

As those who have read my posts can attest to, I have often stated my support for restrictions on late term abortions since the discoveries of neurologists have shown that the brain in late term fetuses (beginning around the third trimester) can be developed enough to allow for what I term a ""mental existence"" - which includes rudimentary thoughts, emotions, sense of pain, etc. There has been contraversy about when fetuses can first experience pain. However, those that claim that fetuses can experience pain early fail to differentiate between reflex action and an actual sense of pain. Most scientific studies that have allowed for discussion and debate among scientists on this topic reveal that it is late in the pregnancy that pain can first be felt.

It's your opinion. It's not a fact at all. Explain why they can feel pain between 7 and 20 weeks of life if they have no minds?
http://www.gargaro.com/fetalpain.html That's a pretty neat trick for someone with no brain.
Wrong again. I'm referring to the unborn with the same dignity as I would any other human being. After all, an unborn child at the abortion stage has all of the inherent qualities of a born infant except the experience of breathing, itself. Unless you can actually prove that they don't feel pain and can't think or process information while in the womb? Can you actually prove that claim? I think not. But there is strong evidence to support what I'm saying. http://www.medicinenet.com/script/ma...ticlekey=51723 
But studies have shown that your unborn child can hear sounds as early as 20 weeks and will be startled by loud noises at about 25 weeks. Very loud sounds can cause changes in your baby's heart rate and movements, and sometimes even cause them to empty their bladders.
Instead of the womb being the quiet place scientists once assumed, it is actually awash in sounds, particularly the whooshing of your blood and digestive system, the thumping of your heart and your voice, which sounds louder than it would transmitted through the air since it reverberates through the bones and fluids in your body.
Noises from outside your body are more muffled but they also make it through surprisingly clearly, says Robert Abrams, a fetal physiologist in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at University of Florida. Low frequency sounds, such as those above middle C, tend to be more audible than higher frequency ones. Men's voices, for instance, come through clearer than women's, and music also is easily recognizable.
It appears the fetus can even hear specific speech patterns and intonations, although probably not recognize words themselves, Fifer says. Some studies have shown that babies after birth will recognize -- and be comforted by -- a story read repeatedly to them while in the womb or even by particular songs, like the theme from a television show watched regularly during pregnancy.
So not only can they feel pain at least as early as 20 weeks, if not earlier, but they can hear and process information at that early stage of development. Remember that it say's above that they feel pain between 7 and 20 weeks, so it's somewhere in between that stage of development. What do you do with that info Peeling?

I also think you might be misreading the graph presented on that page. It does not show 'pain felt' and 'degree of pain modification'. It shows the development of the pain system and the development of the pain modification system.

Does that mean you can sit in front of your unplugged TV and see a 99.9% perfect picture?
Furthermore, 20 weeks only gets you as far as nerve impulses travelling between the receptor and the thalamus. There is still no mind to interpret or appreciate that as pain.
At the 'abortion stage'? Are you perhaps referring to the latest possible abortion date, here, and not the point by which the vast majority of abortions have already occurred?
Then you think wrong; I already provided a link in support of my analysis. There is no evidence of anything so coherent as a mind prior to 27 weeks-ish.

You seem to often equate even early embryos or zygotes with babies because they will someday become babies - so you attach the value we place on what the fetus will be in the future to what it is at that moment. Your arguements seem to revolve purely around potential. Is there anything that you value in the early fetus/embryo in what it is AT THAT MOMENT, not counting potential? 
A way I can think of to address that question is to present a hypothetical - i.e. an early fetus (say 12 weeks old) that, for whatever reason, stops development and never progresses farther. Is there anything you would value in that fetus and, if so, what and why? It will never develop farther into a feeling baby with emotions, thoughts, experiences, etc. It will always stay a partially developed body with no mind of any sort present. 
If you wouldn't place much value in such a fetus, then it seems that your argument is purely about potential. I can respect your value for potential but, of course, disagree that it is more important than a woman's right over her own body. If you do place value in that fetus, then I would be very curious what specifically it is that you would value.
Where my own views are concerned, I would place no value in an early fetus that halted its growth but I would place value in a late fetus because, at that point, it would have some level of mind that I could empathize with.

413,Horton Hears a Who,abortion,attack,"Then, apart from arguements about potential, your arguement against abortion at any stage is that there is, in your mind, a possibility that even early fetuses can experience pain. Am I right in that appraisal?
So, it seems that our main difference is that I trust that scientific consensus can tell us the truth about reality (in this case, when a fetus can feel pain or have a rudimentary mind) and you trust that your religion tells the truth about reality where, presumably, your religion implies that early fetuses have some level of mind, sense of pain, etc. Otherwise, apart from the importance we place on potential and on the importance of a woman's right to her own body, we do have some overlap in the reasons for our views - namely, that some sense of empathy drives the decision of when to restrict abortions. That difference in world views is an insurmountable one - i.e. science vs religion.
Given the range of scientific views, I have no doubt that, as you already showed, you will be able to find some scientific opinion that is more closely related to yours. However, scientists aren't right just because they are scientists. The scientific views that have withstood the test of time and, more specifically, the test of analysis and criticism from the scientific community - these are the scientific views that have proven most reliable. Where fetal pain is concerned, the scientific consensus is that the fetus cannot feel pain until late in the pregnancy - mainly since it is viewed that the cerebral cortex needs to play a role to actually register that pain and the connections and development of that cerebral cortex is insufficient at early stages. Many scientists actually push that point farther since they expect that consciousness is required, but those views still seem controversial. Either way, the scientists who view early fetuses as being able to experience pain fail to be able to explain how any early nerve impulses and reactions are anything other than simple reflex action - not experienced pain. The bottom line for me is that, since I myself am not an expert in biology, I trust the experiments and scientific method and scientific community scrutiny that has come to a consensus of determining that only late term fetuses can experience pain. I know you have much less trust in that scientific community. That difference in world views is likely insurmountable and we will just have to agree to disagree.",407,414,topic_stance_votes_2

Since my hypothetical stated that this fetus would never develop beyond the state that it was as 12 weeks, this would mean that it would have no mind, no emotions, no thoughts - it would just be an underdeveloped body. I suppose that some future technology might have the capability of keeping such a being alive indefinitely but, again, what exactly do you think would be alive? What would be the value of a being that is only body, no mind? Perhaps you think such a being would have a soul and, through that soul, some sense of mental existence. If so, then I could understand your view as well, though I would disagree in an existence of a soul in that fetus. What if it had no soul? Would that matter to you? In other words, if it really was JUST a living body - no mind and no soul.
A 20 to 24 week old fetus is still too early to experience pain since its cerebral cortex and connections to it are not sufficiently developed. At least that is the consensus view of scientists that I have read from a few such scientific group summaries. The 24th week starts getting closer to that fuzzy edge of the beginnings of cortical development that start allowing for the higher level brain functions that define mentality. I often have stated that I understand mental existence to be able to begin ""around the beginning of the third trimester"". Official start of the third trimester is apparently the 29th week. Many scientific reviews start mentioning relevant progress even a few weeks earlier than that, which is why I have left that point not firmly set but use the word ""about"". Any legal ruling on abortion restrictions based on such initial mental development would have to have a much more extensive scientific debate and discussion to come to some date that gives enough benefit of the doubt. 
Either way, nearly all scientists (at least the ones that are able to defend their views fully to the scientific community) deny that first trimester fetuses and embryos can have any sense of mind, pain, etc. Therefore, I have no problem with first trimester abortions - where the great majority of abortions happen.

Very premature babies may need pain relieving drugs
By Roger Highfield, Science Editor
Last Updated: 11:57pm BST 27/08/2001
THE unborn child may be able to feel pain as early as 20 weeks into pregnancy, a finding that suggests pain relief should be considered for the 2,500 extremely premature babies born each year who may be subjected to painful procedures.
The head of a government-appointed expert group said a foetus was definitely aware of pain by 24 weeks, perhaps as early as 20 weeks, according to a review of the latest research.
The Medical Research Council's expert group, chaired by Prof Eve Johnstone of Edinburgh University, makes a strong case for additional research on ways to prevent the unnecessary suffering of extremely premature children.
Prof Johnstone said these babies had to undergo painful procedures, such as heel pricks, blood monitoring, injections and insertion of breathing tubes. ""We ought to study this carefully.""
So what have I shown here? Above I have shown that a 21 week old preemie can survive outside of the womb and that it obviously has a mind, feelings and a soul as it is a living person at that point. And here I have shown that it has been proven that fetuses at that age DO FEEL PAIN. And yet we still allow them to be aborted and the abortion industry is fighting any legislation requiring the use of pain relievers during abortions. 
Does that make sense to you? Does that cause you to respect this multi-billion dollar industry that survives on the corpses of 1.3 million murdered children a year? And yes Ao, I continue to refer to them as children because if the practice of abortion was never conceived of in this Country, then each year, 1.3 million more new babies would be born on average than are currently allowed to exist.",416,417,topic_stance_votes_1

The Minnesota man was charged with second-degree murder on Tuesday in the death of his girlfriend's unborn child, marking rare use of a state law that allows a murder charge even though the mother survived. The couple also has a 6-month-old child together.
Dino M. Scott, 20, smirked and made an obscene gesture on camera before he beat Namrata Ceisel on Sunday, the criminal complaint alleged. She later suffered a miscarriage.

Beside, the only reason the baby exists at all is due to the actions of the parents and not because of anything the child did to cause or create the problem of its existence. So why should he pay with his life for a problem he never created?
Regarding your kidney analogy, a more accurate correlation that would fit is that a person could go out and knowingly destroy their kidney by doing all the wrong things after being told they're diabetic, for example, and yet once they have done the damage, they are able to pull an innocent person from a crowd and force that person to donate their kidney to them against that innocent persons will who had nothing at all to do with creating the problem.
Sure, that's the law. But why can they have it both ways? Either the child is not a person and has no rights of a person until it's born, Which is how pro abortionists justify infanticide or it does have rights of a person and deserves to be protected in the womb. It's like society is saying that in this one instance in society, we will leave it up to the individual woman how we will define her unborn baby. If she doesn't want to keep or protect her baby, we will allow her to label it a non person and a stranger can go in and forcefully kill/abort that healthy developing child.
On the other hand, if the woman happens to want to keep and protect her unborn baby, we will allow her to label it a person and if a stranger forces himself upon her and kills/aborts her healthy developing child against her will; he will be charged with murder. My problem here is that it isn't the baby itself that is being considered in defining its value as a person, but its the mothers opinion that determines its value as a human being.

For one thing, you keep pushing this false image of abortion, as if it were something careless, irresponsible couples offhandedly jot down on a notepad stuck to the fridge underneath 'buy more milk'.

There are over 100,000,000 women in the USA. Not all are of childbearing age, but do the math. The notion that abortion is nothing but a get-out-of-parenthood-free card for the irresponsible is nonsense.
Secondly, there is no similarity between aborting a foetus and yanking a full grown adult randomly out of a crowd and operating on him. The former has the potential to eventually become conscious, aware, and capable of suffering, provided the mother consents to continue her vital role in its development, while the other is already conscious, aware, and capable of suffering.
False. If you were right, the mother would be legally entitled to abort her foetus at any stage, which isn't the case. First and foremost the developmental status of the foetus takes precedence, with the mother's wishes only considered should circumstances permit.

Facts on Induced Abortion in the United States
January 2008
INCIDENCE OF ABORTION
• Nearly half of pregnancies among American women are unintended, and four in 10 of these are terminated by abortion.[1] Twenty-two percent of all pregnancies (excluding miscarriages) end in abortion.[2]
• In 2005, 1.21 million abortions were performed, down from 1.31 million in 2000. From 1973 through 2005, more than 45 million legal abortions occurred.[2]
• Each year, about two out of every 100 women aged 15–44 have an abortion; 47% of them have had at least one previous abortion.[3]
Number of abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44, by year
• At least half of American women will experience an unintended pregnancy by age 45[4], and, at current rates, about one-third will have had an abortion.[5,6]
WHO HAS ABORTIONS?
• Fifty percent of U.S. women obtaining abortions are younger than 25: Women aged 20–24 obtain 33% of all abortions, and teenagers obtain 17%.[7]
• Black women are 4.8 times as likely as non-Hispanic white women to have an abortion, and Hispanic women are 2.7 times as likely.[7]
• Forty-three percent of women obtaining abortions identify themselves as Protestant, and 27% as Catholic.[3]
• Women who have never married obtain two-thirds of all abortions.[7]
• About 60% of abortions are obtained by women who have one or more children.[7]
• The abortion rate among women living below the federal poverty level ($9,570 for a single woman with no children) is more than four times that of women above 300% of the poverty level (44 vs. 10 abortions per 1,000 women).*[3]
• The reasons women give for having an abortion underscore their understanding of the responsibilities of parenthood and family life. Three-fourths of women cite concern for or responsibility to other individuals; three-fourths say they cannot afford a child; three-fourths say that having a baby would interfere with work, school or the ability to care for dependents; and half say they do not want to be a single parent or are having problems with their husband or partner.[8]
CONTRACEPTIVE USE
• Fifty-four percent of women who have abortions had used a contraceptive method (usually the condom or the pill) during the month they became pregnant. Among those women, 76% of pill users and 49% of condom users report having used their method inconsistently, while 13% of pill users and 14% of condom users report correct use.[9]
• Forty-six percent of women who have abortions had not used a contraceptive method during the month they became pregnant. Of these women, 33% had perceived themselves to be at low risk for pregnancy, 32% had had concerns about contraceptive methods, 26% had had unexpected sex and 1% had been forced to have sex.[9]
• Eight percent of women who have abortions have never used a method of birth control; nonuse is greatest among those who are young, poor, black, Hispanic or less educated.[9]
• About half of unintended pregnancies occur among the 11% of women who are at risk for unintended pregnancy but are not using contraceptives. Most of these women have practiced contraception in the past.[1,10]

427,Horton Hears a Who,abortion,attack,"AA, what is the legal cutoff point for elective abortion? When you find that out, you'll notice that it refers to the age of the foetus. So, exactly as I said in my last post: ""First and foremost the developmental status of the foetus takes precedence"". Only after that are the wishes of the mother considered.
Really? Hmm. Let's look:
Ok, so your 1.4 million per year estimate is a little out. No big deal.
And what did I say before? Failure rate of contraception is about 1-2% per year? Sounds familiar :)
That's just an extrapolation of the figures above.
So it's not like they aren't giving parenthood a chance.
I have to say, it saves me so much time and effort when you post your own rebuttals. So the very source you affirm as 'respectable' disagrees with your disdainful assessment of motives for abortion.
That's more like it. It's disappointing to see the figures are that high, but even so, they're trying. 
Ok, so in reality only 11% of abortions result from 'heat of the moment' irresponsibility, with the rest attributable to poor sex education, inconsistent use of contraceptives, and contraceptive failure. So you're 11% right :)
Why? Because you say so? I'm sorry, but it doesn't work like that. The specific role a mother must consent to play in constructing a foetus, the real risks undertaken by the mother in performing that role, the absence of mental function in the foetus - all these factors are considered when ruling elective abortion before a certain stage in pregnancy to be legal. You might want your analogy to be relevant, but it simply isn't - it bears no resemblence to the issue at hand.
Is the stranger in your analogy 'potentially' or 'actually' a conscious human being capable of suffering? If the latter, *poof* goes any relevance to the discussion. Is this stranger's continued welfare contingent upon the woman continuing to endure discomfort and risk to her health? No? *Poof*, there it goes again. Is this 'randomly picked innocent stranger' personally the only solution to the woman's problems? No? *Poof*.
What relevance does this have to our discussion? Have I expressed support for late term abortion? Ummm.... let's see.... no.
Allow me to remind you of what the point being made actually was:
My reply can be correctly interpreted in two ways: you have rights over your children that you do not have over a stranger, and that a stranger does not have over your children. Since you have not actually disagreed with that response, am I to take it you accept it as a valid example of the kind you demanded?
As to whether I support the right of a parent to kill their child or whether that is what we're discussing in abortion, the former is a strawman I won't bother tackling and the latter is simply your opinion, one you refuse to justify in any rational or consistent manner. You equate a fertilised egg with a newborn baby (all your arguments and analogies boil down to that equivocation), but when challenged retreat behind claims of 'potential'. When I challenge the consistency of those claims, and 'potential' is suddenly not your friend, you get upset and start calling me 'shallow', amongst other things.
What we're talking about is the right of a mother - who based upon the statistics you sourced probably did not behave irresponsibly and, again based on your material, is most likely motivated by selfless concerns - to cease constructing an incomplete and mindless foetus. That's the unvarnished reality once you strip out the emotional appeals to cute little newborn babies and the nasty, selfish, sluttish harlots who murder them.",425,428,topic_stance_votes_2
428,Horton Hears a Who,abortion,attack,"At 21 weeks, the premature baby is out of the womb and moving but that doesn't mean that it is thinking or feeling yet. I suspect that your suspicion of it being a ""thinking, feeling human being"" is that it simply looks like a miniature version of a baby. Science tells us that it will not start to think or feel for at least a few weeks yet. Meanwhile, every effort is made to keep it alive until and after it reaches that stage since there is no reason not to and its value in the now very near-term potential is important.
That is why I put the hypothetical that it will NEVER grow into anything more than it was at 12 weeks. By placing the condition on that hypothetical, I tried to exclude the very arguement of potential that you are once again introducting in this paragraph. Specifically, the premature 21 week old has potential, the 12 week old that will never grow into more does NOT have potential by the very definition of the hypothetical.
Having re-stated the original hypothetical, what is it in that 12 week old fetus that will never develop farther that you value? It will NEVER feel, it will NEVER have emotions or thoughts. It has NO potential since, by the definition of the hypothetical, it will NEVER change. Future technology could keep it alive despite that lack of further development, so it would not NEED to die. What is it that you would value in that forever underdeveloped fetus? What you keep that non-developing fetus with no potential alive nevertheless if one could?
I know that this is not a real situation but the only reason I brought up the hypothetical is to see if you have any arguements besides the one based on potential. Perhaps your arguement about potential is your only one. That is certainly a possibility. If that is the case, then I think we have no choice but to agree to disagree and leave it at that since, for those of us on the pro-choice side, though potential may be important, we view a woman's right to her own body as more important.
I explain it by the fact that there are some scientists that claim that a cortical connection is not required to experience pain. Though the majority of scientists disagree, the organization which was referred to in your quote would apparently prefer to give the benefit of the doubt.

Is Abortion Safe?
Psychological Consequences
Clinical research provides a growing body of scientific evidence that having an abortion can cause psychological harm to some women. ""Women who report negative after-effects from abortion know exactly what their problem is,"" observed psychologist Wanda Franz, Ph.D., in a March 1989 congressional hearing on the impact of abortion. ""They report horrible nightmares of children calling them from trash cans, of body parts, and blood,"" Franz told the Congressional panel. ""When they are reminded of the abortion,"" Franz testified, ""the women re-experienced it with terrible psychological pain ... They feel worthless and victimized because they failed at the most natural of human activities -- the role of being a mother.""[106]
The emergence of chemical abortion methods poses a new possibly more devastating psychological threat. Unlike surgical abortions, in which women rarely see the cut up body parts, women having chemical abortions often do see the complete tiny bodies of their unborn children and are even able to distinguish the child’s developing hands, eyes, etc. [107] So traumatic is this for some women that both patients and researchers involved in these studies have recommended that women unprepared for the experience of seeing their aborted children not take the drugs. [108] Long-term psychological implications of this experience have not been studied.
Researchers on the after-effects of abortion have identified a pattern of psychological problems known as Post-Abortion Syndrome (PAS). Women suffering PAS may experience drug and alcohol abuse, personal relationship disorders, sexual dysfunction, repeated abortions, communications difficulties, damaged self-esteem, and even attempt suicide. Post-Abortion Syndrome appears to be a type of pattern of denial which may last for five to ten years before emotional difficulties surface. [109]
Now that some clinicians have established that there is an identifiable patterns to PAS, they face a new challenge. What is still unknown is how widespread psychological problems are among women who have had abortions. A Los Angeles Times survey in 1989 found that 56% of women who had abortions felt guilty about it, and 26% ""mostly regretted the abortion.""[110] Clinicians’ current goal should be to conduct extensive national research studies to obtain data on the psychological after-effects of abortion.[111]
With the growing awareness of Post Abortion Syndrome in scholarly and clinical circles, women with PAS can expect to receive a more sensitive appreciation of the suffering that they endure. Fortunately, a growing network of peer support groups of women who have had abortions offers assistance to women who are experiencing emotional difficulties.
Many post-abortive women have also been speaking out publicly about their own abortion experiences and the healing process they went through.. Women or family members seeking information about this particular outreach can contact American Victims of Abortion, 419 7th Street, NW, Suite 500, Washington, D.C., 20004.

Society has decided that the 'baby' is a fetus until certain developmental stages are reached. After that point a woman no longer has the 'choice' of whether or not to carry it to birth. This compromise allows women to have control over their bodies and forces them to make a choice before the 'baby' is fully developed. I believe that this compromise is necessary if women are to ever enjoy the same rights as a man. Sex IS a fact of life and women are entitled to enjoy it, just as men are.

487,Horton Hears a Who,abortion,attack,"Unfortunately, Archangel, I believe the situation is very simple. Either the woman has rights over her body or the fetus has rights over the woman's body. If the woman is not allowed rights over her own body, the fetus' rights will supercede the woman's rights which means, therefore, all other women's rights will become hollow (all other rights do center upon that particular right, after all). In that situation there is a case to be made that a woman's position is remarkably similar to those times, in history, when she was considered just an object and not a life. Since I believe a woman is a human being and a life, just as every one else is, and I believe her rights are more important than a fetus, I am Pro-Choice. After all, I, personally, cannot understand how someone can say that a fetus (who is not physically, mentally or emotionally matured or developed) has more important rights than that of a woman (who is).
If you are, then, going to speak about responsibility... I have this to say... conception and abortion are two different processes. Really, the real issue between PLers and PCers is abortion NOT conception. If conception WAS also part of the issue, that still does not mean you will have a case to make. If women aren't guaranteed the same sexual freedoms that men are, then we have still, essentially, given a fetus the rights over a woman's body (Men will likely still have all their sexual freedoms and the only difference between men and women, which is relevant to this case, is the FACT that men cannot get pregnant).

When you call abortion murder, do you consider abortion murder at all stages of a pregnancy or only in late term? Assuming that you consider all abortion murder - since the great majority of abortions are performed in the first trimester of pregnancy, what exactly is it that you would think is being murdered? You might call it a ""baby"" at that stage but what do you think that embryo is at that moment? Do you think it thinks, feels, senses perceptions, feels pain? What specifically is it about what that embryo actually IS that draws your sympathy? Is it only the knowledge of what it will BECOME - i.e. one of us - or is there some aspect of what the embryo is at that early stage that draws your sympathy? 
Here, I am trying to distinguish between any value you might place on the embryo due to its potential vs value you place on the embryo for what it actually is at that point in its development (its present, as opposed to its future). Most pro-life arguements seem to revolve around the embryo's potential. Many if not most on the pro-choice side also value potential but not as much as we value the mother's rights over her own body, so arguements purely about potential largely fall on deaf ears. 
The pro-life arguement would be more effective in convincing people if genuine reasons were presented for valuing embryos for what they are at that particular state of development. As an example, many on the pro-choice side, including myself, value late term fetuses since they can have the beginnings of a mental existence of some sort so that there is ""somebody home"" in that body that can potentially suffer, feel, have emotions, etc. For us, that value then supercedes the mother's right to her own body (with the usual exceptions of rape, and risk to mother's life or health) so we would largely agree with restrictions to late term abortions.",493,494,topic_stance_votes_2

512,Horton Hears a Who,abortion,support,"This is correct, but don't try to explain it to anyone brain dead or a anti-choicer because they simply can't get a grip on reality. There are several types of procedures; one is called dilation and extraction which is used very late in pregnancy and involves dilating the cervix so the fetus comes into the vagina feet first. This is the stuff of the anti-choice movement's famous cartoons pretending that a ''baby'' right out of a Good Housekeeping ad is killed on the verge of live birth. In reality, the fetus involved is often already brain-dead or otherwise hopelessly flawed, and the procedure protects the woman's health, including her ability to have children in the future. The procedure may also be used to remove a fetus that is already deceased, but they don't tell you that part in the anti-choice brochures, and you certainly won't hear these facts from anti-choicers that were raised on propaganda like archangel. You should also know that the procedure is very, very rarely used. In-fact it's way less than 1%... not even 1/4th of 1%... even less than 1/8th of 1%, around only 0.14% - but they make it sound like it's a common procedure emoticonXRolleyes 
There are also some very good legitimate reasons for this form of abortion, one is called Hydrocephalus, but the anti-choice movement doesn't want you to learn about it either. You won't hear people like archangel talk about Hydrocephalus, because they don't have any medical background, and don't have a clue as to what it is. Hydrocephalus is when a fetus has abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the cavities of the brain. The fetuses head may expand to a abnormally large radius of up to 250% of a normal skull at birth, making it impossible for it to pass through the cervix. Eventually the pregnant woman would die without this procedure!
Not only that but because of the abnormally large amount of fluid accumulating in the fetuses skull, compression of the brain by the accumulating fluid eventually causes irreversible brain damage, and other life threatening complications. The anti-choice movement doesn't want you to learn about any of those facts either. As the hydrocephalus progresses, torpor (a non-physiological state) sets in. Around 90% of fetuses with spina bifida usually end up with Hydrocephalus. So as you can see when this procedure is used it is NOT used on a normal fetus as the anti-choice propaganda wants people to believe. The fetus usually already has irreversible brain damage or is already dead, so they feel absolutely nothing, another fact that the anti-choice propaganda doesn't want you to know about. That's a LOT different than the cartoons used by the anti-choice movement where they try to trick you into thinking that the fetus was right out of a Good Housekeeping ad, or the faked photoshopped pictures that archangel commonly posts. The fact is that the so-called term of 'partial birth abortion' is not even recognized as a medical term by the American Medical Association, nor the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The term is pure propaganda used to scare non-medical people into whipping up visions of torture on perfect fetuses, and nothing could be further from the truth!",509,513,topic_stance_votes_2
513,Horton Hears a Who,abortion,attack,"I don't know if you're purposely lying or just ignorant Ingus, either way though, everything you have said here is a delusional fairy tale. Here are some actual facts to consider.
Facts:
1.4 million abortions are performed in the US per year, 44% on women who have had previous abortions, 82% on women who are unmarried or separated. This is enough for 43% of American women to have an abortion during their lives at present rates.
89% of abortions in US are performed before 12 weeks, 1% after 20 weeks (90% of these for non-medical reasons).
D&X (Dilation and Extraction) A late-term (post 20 week) procedure in which the fetus is brought feet first into the birth canal, a large needle is inserted into its skull, its brain suctioned out, and the fetus removed. Popularly known as ""partial birth"" abortion.
D&E (Dilation and Evacuation) A late-term procedure in which a serrated forceps is inserted into the womb, and the fetus dismembered and removed. More common than D&X, above.
In D&X or D&E the fetus is usually, but not always, killed first, by cutting umbilical cord or via injection of digoxin or other lethal agent. The rationale for not killing the fetus before suctioning its brain or cutting it to pieces is a better medical outcome for mother, and that the nervous system of fetus not sufficiently developed to ""appreciate pain.""
Women who have had late-term abortions for non-medical reasons tend to be young, living with their parents, and to have involved their parents in the decision. The inference is that it just took a long time for the families to reach a decision to abort.
– US News & World Report, January 1998, pp 20-32
To survive, a very premature baby usually must have developed at least 23 weeks. – US News & World Report, March 30, 1998, p60.
Conclusions:
Women who seek abortion do so often because there is no one they can turn to for the love and help they need to raise a child. As long as so many of our men are not man enough to help raise their children, beating those women with the blunt instrument of the Law will generally be the wrong solution. We need to build consensus on abortion, rather than to continue a polarized debate that so far has led to a widening gulf between the political left and right that threatens the integrity of our society.
Late term abortions, however, are particularly grisly, whether the unborn fetus has its brains sucked out through a needle, or whether it is cut to pieces in its mother’s womb. Although there is national disagreement as to whether a fetus at a given stage of development is a baby, there is no disagreement that it is rapidly becoming a baby, and that late-term abortions tread perilously close to infanticide, especially considering that only about 10% of them are done for medical reasons. Fortunately, they are performed rarely enough that doing without them will not cause a major dislocation in our society. While we tone down the pro-life and pro-choice shouting, let us also back away from non-medical D&E’s and D&X’s, and do so in our morals, in our medical ethics, and in our Law.

542,Horton Hears a Who,abortion,attack,"If, in saying that abortion is not murder before 12 weeks, you mean that you would allow abortion before 12 weeks but not afterward, then it might interest you to know that your opinion would lie within the majority opinion in the US. From CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll. Jan. 10-12, 2003. (N=1,002 adults nationwide. MoE +/-3%) from http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm , apparently only 29% of Americans would make abortion generally illegal in the first trimester (minus the usual exceptions), 68% would make it generally illegal in the second trimester and 84% would make it generally illegal in the third trimester. Polls from earlier years show similar values.
These statistics show some interesting trends. First, they show that not all pro-life proponents advocate making abortion illegal in the first trimester since nearly 50% of Americans call themselves pro-life while only 29% would keep abortion illegal in the first trimester. These numbers also show that the majority of pro-choice supporters would make abortion generally illegal in the third trimester since nearly 50% of Americans call themselves pro-choice and only 10% (from the Poll) would make abortion fully legal in the third trimester.
So, the pro-life and pro-choice positions are not firmly set at the extremes but have some variation. It is a fact that is nice to know since, in this forum, one most often hears from posters with views on the extreme edges (i.e. abortion always legal or abortion never legal). My own view is to keep abortion legal in the first two trimesters and generally illegal in the third (though I might push that into late second trimester) since the mind can start to exist in late term and that is what I most value - the existence of the human mind.",498,543,topic_stance_votes_2
543,Horton Hears a Who,abortion,support,"From what I have read, I agree that the mentioned exceptions do account for nearly all the abortions performed in the third trimester. However, I think that there are political advantages for having some sort of law solidifying that third term generally illegality with exceptions in law (which Roe vs Wade seems to do but is not advertised enough). The main draw of the pro-life camp is the sympathy that is drawn to abortion of late term fetuses. If you take away that arguement by officially making most reasons for late term abortions illegal (apart from the risks to health and life, and rape and incest), then you take much of the bite out of the pro-life arguement. Aparently, the UK did something similar where late term abortions where mainly banned. This took the bite out of the pro-life movement and they haven't had any real strength since to push that level earlier. 
I personally don't view the great majority of abortions as murder since, even the majority of those performed in late term, are performed as a sort of ""self-defense"" against risk to the mother's life or health and the ones performed in earlier terms are performed on fetuses and embryos that are just bodies with ""nobody home"". If no mind exists yet, then I cannot view abortion as murder. However, that line starts getting much fuzzier once one gets into the possibility of abortion for arbitrary reasons at near term. If a fetus were a few days from birth and the mother had an abortion done on it, it might border on being called murder - depending on the reasons.",508,544,topic_stance_votes_2

545,Horton Hears a Who,abortion,attack,"Sounds to me like someone is ""filtering"" your bible. Don't you want to hear both sides of the story Christina? Many forms of killing were considered perfectly legal in ancient Israel, and levitical law listed many of the exceptions. Generally, levitical law permitted killing in times of war, the commission of justice and in self-defense. Now here is an interesting bit of information that you will never hear a anti-choicer admit. Sometimes, God even gave Israel permission to kill infant children. In Samuel 15:3, God ordered Saul to massacre the Amalekites: ""Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; put to death men and women, children and infants, ox and sheep…"" Most Christians do not know about this because it has been hidden, mislabeled or censored from them so they are uneducated about it, and who do you supposed censored it? The bottom line is that you will NEVER find anyplace in the bible that says that abortion is bad. The bible also does not say that the fetus is a human being. Because of this some religious radicles have to twist the truth around to make it ""look"" like the bible is against abortion, when in fact it is not. Fortunately, the Jews are legendary for their fanatical preservation of the law, and they have never considered abortion to be a sin. That alone should make many anti-choice advocates stop and reconsider the legal basis, holy or otherwise, for their opposition to abortion. 
Now, if you are going to live your life by the word of a man made book like the bible, then lets examine it and how you live to see if you're a hypocrite or not. The Bible plainly and clearly forbids wool/linen clothing. Leviticus 19:19 ""You shall not let your livestock breed with another kind. You shall not sow your field with mixed seed. Nor shall a garment of mixed linen and wool come upon you."" Do you or your family members wear wool or linen clothing Christina? The Bible plainly and clearly condemns tattoos. Leviticus 19: 28 ""You shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor tattoo any marks on you: I am the LORD."" Do you or any of your family members have any tattoos Christina? The Bible forbids various grooming styles for men. Leviticus 19:27 ""You shall not shave around the sides of your head, nor shall you disfigure the edges of your beard."" Does any of your family members shave Christina? The Bible says don’t eat pork, ham or bacon. Deuteronomy 14:8 ""The pig, because it has a split hoof but doesn’t chew the cud, is unclean to you: of their flesh you shall not eat, and their carcasses."" Do you or any family members eat pork, ham or bacon Christina? We could go on like this all night. The point is that when you say that the bible says that abortion is wrong - YOU are wrong, as it NEVER says that anywhere in the bible, and yet there are plenty of other things that the bible clearly does say not to do - that you probably do - do, so that would make you a hypocrite IF you are living your life according to this man made book called the bible.",527,546,topic_stance_votes_2
546,Horton Hears a Who,abortion,attack,"No Christina, you are reading into that, and that is being disingenuous. The bible ALSO contains verses that indicate the fetus is not a human being, and that suggest abortion does not involve killing a human being. Whomever is ""translating"" the bible for you is putting their own bias on it. It's time that you learn to think for yourself. There is a good pdf on the net called the wisdom of abortion which you should read. It will show you both sides of the story and some examples I will list for you below. 
In the Bible, breath, soul and human life are synonymous. A body without breath may be alive but it lacks a human soul and therefore is not a human being. For example, in Genesis Adam becomes a “living soul” in a two step process. First, Adam’s body is created, much as the fetus is created in the womb. Genesis 2:7: ""And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground."" . . Adam’s body is created but he is not yet a “living soul.” The verse continues: . . . ""and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul"". So only in step two, after God gives him “the breath of life,” does Adam become a living soul. The same idea, that it’s the breath that makes us human, appears in Ezekiel 37:8-10, too. The verses describe human bodies that lack breath: ""And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but there was no breath in them"". As in Genesis, there is flesh and skin but no breath, therefore no human life. The verses continues: ""Thus saith the Lord GOD; Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live. So they’ll live as human beings only when they possess the breath of life. So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army"". These verses show that a body doesn’t become a human being until it’s animated with the breath of life.
These verses in the bible directly contradict the idea that the zygote is human at conception.
Let’s discuss one more verse. Luke 1:31 describes a prophecy of the conception and birth of Jesus. The verse is: ""And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus"". Now suppose God wanted the Bible to teach that a zygote is a human being. Then the verse would have instead said: “And, behold, thou shalt conceive a human being in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus.” But it does NOT say that because until the babies first breath God does not consider the newly-conceived zygote to be a human being (yet). Miscarriages are another good example of this, one that religious radicals try to discount.",530,547,topic_stance_votes_2

549,Horton Hears a Who,abortion,support,"It's a false dichotomy that some critics of religion have cast religion in by saying that submitting to spiritual authority and thinking/reasoning are going to be juxtaposed. One only need look at giants like Galileo, Newton, and Kelvin to see that such isn't necessarily the case at all. That's not to say that the poster you responded to is on that level, but please don't make assumptions about whether or not someone has thought through an issue or not. Many of us are pro-life because we believe it is the reasonable thing to do, and it so happens that our religion and reason almost always work together hand-in-hand for doing good in the world such as valuing life and saving lives. You've no doubt heard the arguments given and just because you reject them doesn't mean their wrong. Heck, even many pro-choice people are often against abortion as a procedure. (Remember the old Clinton statement ""safe and rare""?) Please don't automatically jump to prejudiced conclusions just because you hear the terms 'religion' and 'bible'. 
Then what would ever BE ""evidence"" for something like that? One's view on whether abortion is ok or not is a moralistic one--we're not talking about someone trying to prove, say, that something happened historically, or that someone is guilty of a crime. ""Evidence"" isn't really the right term for this. Since ""evidence"" is a term we would use for a much different kind of discussion, I assume what you really mean is ""argument"".

Facts:
1.4 million abortions are performed in the US per year, 44% on women who have had previous abortions, 82% on women who are unmarried or separated. This is enough for 43% of American women to have an abortion during their lives at present rates.
89% of abortions in US are performed before 12 weeks, 1% after 20 weeks (90% of these for non-medical reasons).
D&X (Dilation and Extraction) A late-term (post 20 week) procedure in which the fetus is brought feet first into the birth canal, a large needle is inserted into its skull, its brain suctioned out, and the fetus removed. Popularly known as ""partial birth"" abortion.
D&E (Dilation and Evacuation) A late-term procedure in which a serrated forceps is inserted into the womb, and the fetus dismembered and removed. More common than D&X, above.
In D&X or D&E the fetus is usually, but not always, killed first, by cutting umbilical cord or via injection of digoxin or other lethal agent. The rationale for not killing the fetus before suctioning its brain or cutting it to pieces is a better medical outcome for mother, and that the nervous system of fetus not sufficiently developed to ""appreciate pain.""
Women who have had late-term abortions for non-medical reasons tend to be young, living with their parents, and to have involved their parents in the decision. The inference is that it just took a long time for the families to reach a decision to abort.

Who's having abortions (race)?
While white women obtain 60% of all abortions, their abortion rate is well below that of minority women. Black women are more than 3 times as likely as white women to have an abortion, and Hispanic women are roughly 2 times as likely.
Who's having abortions (marital status)?
64.4% of all abortions are performed on never-married women; Married women account for 18.4% of all abortions and divorced women obtain 9.4%.

Why women have abortions
1% of all abortions occur because of rape or incest; 6% of abortions occur because of potential health problems regarding either the mother or child, and 93% of all abortions occur for social reasons (i.e. the child is unwanted or inconvenient).
At what gestational ages are abortions performed:
52% of all abortions occur before the 9th week of pregnancy, 25% happen between the 9th & 10th week, 12% happen between the 11th and 12th week, 6% happen between the 13th & 15th week, 4% happen between the 16th & 20th week, and 1% of all abortions (16,450/yr.) happen after the 20th week of pregnancy.
Likelihood of abortion:
An estimated 43% of all women will have at least 1 abortion by the time they are 45 years old. 47% of all abortions are performed on women who have had at least one previous abortion.
Abortion coverage:
48% of all abortion facilities provide services after the 12th week of pregnancy. 9 in 10 managed care plans routinely cover abortion or provide limited coverage. About 14% of all abortions in the United States are paid for with public funds, virtually all of which are state funds. 16 states (CA, CT, HI, ED, IL, MA , MD, MD, MN, MT, NJ, NM, NY, OR, VT, WA and WV) pay for abortions for some poor women.

Otherwise, a woman's bodily integrity is still being usurped by someone who has wished to impose their views on a woman's body from the outside. Since all forms of discrimination are abhorrent (and most, if not all, are officially illegal), to me, and women are one group that can be highly discriminated against, I do not believe that abortions should be performed simply because they are the wrong gender, they have genetic abnormalities or they do not fit the eugenic criteria that the parents wanted them to fulfill. But I do not believe that severe deformities that could cause extreme pain to the fetus, eventually, or mother or the inability to carry through with a high-risk pregnancy due to a severe lack of means to fulfill the pregnancy's medical needs, fits any definition of discrimination.

563,Horton Hears a Who,abortion,support,"It seems that you yourself have some reservations about what type of abortions can be done in late term (bolded text). As an extreme case, would you allow a woman to have an abortion a few days from term because she decided that she didn't want to have the baby after all? Judging from the reservations you mentioned, I would guess not. This would mean that you also would place reservations on when abortions can be performed and not leave it completely up to the woman. After all, not all people make wise decisions. 
My personal view is that, up to roughly the beginning of the third trimester, there is only one person's rights that need to be taken into account since, prior to a fetus gaining any mental existence, it doesn't make sense to me for a fetus to have rights since they are mere bodies without minds. Sometime in the late second or third trimester, the fetus starts acquiring a rudimentary mind so that it might suffer pain, have emotions, simple thoughts, etc. In my view, this justifies giving it rights to life. Then, it is a balance of rights of the mother vs rights of the fetus. When there is a risk to the mothers life or major risk to her health, or if she was a victim of rape or incest, then I would still allow the woman the abortion in the third term. Indeed, there might be other exceptions to discuss. I agree that, if it is determined that the fetus is severely deformed and will suffer if brought to term, then, for the sake of the fetus, it might be best to abort it - ""mercy killing"" of a sort. That would have to be discussed in detail since some might consider it justified to abort if the fetus has any life-limiting abnormalities, thus distorting that exception. 
I think that any law should take into account general exceptions that are reasoned out and make sense (which of course can be a relative judgement). I simply think that letting abortion happen at any stage for any arbitrary reason is itself unjust since, in late term, there are two people involved, not just one.
I differentiate between abortions in early term vs abortions in late term since, in early term, the embryo/fetus is only a body. In late term, it can have a mind and, in my view, should get some rights as a new person. 
Defining murder purely on legal grounds (i.e. what is illegal killing as the laws are currently defined) is relative to the laws that currently exist. Prior to Roe vs. Wade, nearly all abortions would most likely have been legally considered murder. Did that make all abortions really murder? I say no. I find it more relevant to analyze what the term murder means based on reasoned analysis, independent of any legal status, and whether it applies to abortion. From that analysis, I personally came to the conclusion mentioned in my last post.",560,564,topic_stance_votes_2

We can have a debate at least, even if we don't agree. I don't agree there's a human presence in early development. It would depend on how one defines a human. DNA itself doesn't suffice, that exists in other places besides the fertilized egg in the uterus.

I think some people view it as disloyalty if one disagrees with other members of ones own camp, or they think that the ""enemy"" is engaging in ""divide and conquer"". I think it is far more important to try to address all sides in as honest a discussions as one can to try to understand the reasoning of all sides. Sometimes, this leads to a change of attitude on either side. Most often, it is just a useful learning experience. Either way, as long as both parties remain cordial (typically, more difficult when dealing with the opposite camp), then it is an enjoyable experience.
Given that you give the woman the choice automatically, under all circumstances, then you are effectively rendering any fetal rights as moot and non-existent. You would then, as an extreme case, allow a woman to abort a fetus one day from birth if she decided at the last moment not to have the baby - even it both she and the fetus was healthy, and there was no other compelling reason. Such an abortion would certainly bother me from a fundamental view of human rights. Doesn't it bother you?
I would have a strong sense of sympathy for the fetus. Out of sight is not out of mind. I would recognize that, at that very late stage, it can feel, have emotions, feel pain, etc - just like a newborn. The woman, on the other hand, had nearly nine months to decide to get rid of the pregnancy. Waiting until that last moment would be pure irresponsibility. I think there should be a deadline for deciding for arbitrary reasons - roughly until the beginning of the third trimester. After that, when there are two minds involved, not just one, then I would advocate balancing rights where, most often (cases of woman's health, risk of death, etc.), the woman's rights would win out. However, in rare cases such as the one I mentioned, then I do think that the fetus's rights would win out. Balance doesn't mean that one automatically wins every time. That seems grossely unjust. 
Perhaps your fear is that, once one starts limiting late term abortion rights to certain exceptions, then some new circumstance might come up which is not addressed by law but which would be a compelling reason for the woman to have an abortion. I agree that that would be a risk, and would hope that some provision by law could be set up for new exceptions. Meanwhile, the exceptions would have to be spelled out as extensively as possible to exclude those possibilities. Yes, it would be an imperfect system but, in my view, less imperfect than a system that would allow a woman an abortion for any arbitrary reason at any arbitrary time - such as the example I gave.",580,581,topic_stance_votes_2

Either the woman can make the choice under all circumstances (barring any separate ideology) or it is not her choice, as I, then, view it as another making the choice for her. It is a woman's body being unwillingly co-opted by a zef for use and, thus, it is her choice and her choice alone when making the decision.

Is its location (inside vs outside the mother) so important about what it inherently is? 
Otherwise, if you do have sympathy toward the about-to-be-born fetus, then why do its rights have a negligible weighting factor while the mother who wants to abort at that late stage (in the extreme case, for no other reason that she changed her mind at the last moment) has an 100% weighting factor no matter how that balance of impact on mother vs fetus pans out?
I suspect that you mainly are concerned about the unexpected situation where a woman would be justified in having an abortion, while the law would not have predicted that exception - or other such concerns. I suppose that, in that case, it comes down to a judgement factor of what concerns weigh on us the most. For me, I would be more concerned with the rare case of a fetus being aborted for truly unreasonable reasons - arbitrary reasons such as the one example I gave. Another large concern is a political one. Namely, given the example of the UK, introducing laws restricting third trimester abortions helped resolve the abortion conflict so that early trimester abortion rights are essentially safe now in Brittain. Here, those rights are not safe - especially given the more concervative weight of the Supreme Court. Introducing laws restricting third trimester abortions to more generally acceptable exceptions could well have a similar effect to what I understand it had in the UK. Namely, it could leave early term abortion rights here safe as well.
