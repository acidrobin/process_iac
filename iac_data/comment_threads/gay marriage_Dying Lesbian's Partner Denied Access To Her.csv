(Miami, Florida) Janice Langbehn and Lisa Pond had planned to take their three children on a family cruise. The Olympia, Washington couple had been together 18 years and with their children were looking forward to the holiday.
But just as they were about to depart on the cruise from Miami, Florida. Pond, a healthy 39-year-old, suddenly collapsed. She was rushed to Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami with Langbehn and the children following close behind.
But once Langbehn and the children arrived at the hospital the hospital refused to accept information from her about Ponds’s medical history. 
Langbehn says she was informed that she was in an antigay city and state, and she could expect to receive no information or acknowledgment as family. 
A doctor finally spoke with Janice telling her that there was no chance of recovery.
Other than one five minute visit, which was orchestrated by a Catholic priest at Langbehn’s request to perform last rites, and despite the doctor’s acknowledgement that no medical reason existed to prevent visitation, neither she nor her children were allowed to see Pond until nearly eight hours after their arrival. 
Soon after Pond'’s death, Langbehn tried to get her death certificate in order to get life insurance and Social Security benefits for their children. She was denied both by the State of Florida and the Dade County Medical Examiner.

Note the above.
She was informed she was in an ""anti-gay state""...
1) As I have pointed out before, some of the ""anti-gay marriage"" amendments go well and beyond just ""no gay marriage"" to antagonizing gays by stating in law that gays cannot perform certain legal functions, regardless of whether or not it is called ""marriage"".
2) Does anybody have any real doubt that if the two ladies had just walked in as ""friends"", that this problem would not have happened?
3) I think this furthers my point regarding how some people's actions and statements FURTHER anti-gay bullying, and that refusing to acknowledge this relationship, or ""blame"", is futile.
The hospital perpetrated this gross violation of human decency invoking the STATE stance.",0,1,topic_stance_votes_1
1,Dying Lesbian's Partner Denied Access To Her,gay marriage,support,"My GOD! anti gay or not, where's common decency?? My heart breaks for that poor family. I hope that hospital has to pay through the nose for what it did to those poor children, denying them the opportunity to see their dying parent. I really don't care what the politics are in that poor, backward state. there is simply no excuse for treating childen like that. Also, this is a hospital, and there was an accurate medical history available to them they did not avail themselves of. This is gross negligence!",1,2,topic_stance_votes_1
2,Dying Lesbian's Partner Denied Access To Her,gay marriage,support,I agree...,2,3,topic_stance_votes_1
3,Dying Lesbian's Partner Denied Access To Her,gay marriage,support,There is no possible way you can defend the actions of the hospital or staff. These people should be ashamed of themselves.,2,4,topic_stance_votes_1
4,Dying Lesbian's Partner Denied Access To Her,gay marriage,support,"Pathetic.
Its such a joke that the anti-gay side claims that gays are a threat to the family. I would like to see them come up with some situation where this was done to a heterosexual family.
This story indicates clearly exactly who is a threat and to whom.",4,5,topic_stance_votes_1
5,Dying Lesbian's Partner Denied Access To Her,gay marriage,support,"Yeah, but then they'd have to admit that the reason it was done to a ""heterosexual family"" is because that family was black, interracial, Jewish, or some other object of prejudice.
And there is no way they would admit that comparison...",5,6,topic_stance_votes_1
6,Dying Lesbian's Partner Denied Access To Her,gay marriage,support,That story is so very sad. That poor family.,6,7,topic_stance_votes_1
7,Dying Lesbian's Partner Denied Access To Her,gay marriage,support,"I guess Florida is a state for the gay population to move they're happy little asses out of, I've never been to fond of the state anyway, but I digress. As long as we do not have the right to marry, there is paperwork, that is imparative we as couples must have drawn up and filled as needed. Wills, power of attoney, durable POA(medical),etc. Consult an attorny and protect your family,and it's rights!! These papers give you the rights that marriage provides automatically",7,8,topic_stance_votes_1
8,Dying Lesbian's Partner Denied Access To Her,gay marriage,support,"Whether this has anything to do with marriage or not, it is deplorable that A PERSON who loves another person should be denied a hospital visit for any reason other than concerns related to health. The hospital staff erred in denying the visits, especially those of the children. The denial of the partner's bedside visit is also deplorable. There is no legitimate reason to deny a peaceful visit from any friend or family member to the bedside of a dying person unless it would negatively affect the health and well being of either party. If it positively affects the health and well being of either of them, it should certainly be permitted.
I think the hospital staff should be chastised and punished to the point of remembering this incident forever as a reason to relax their prejudices and get with the program. There is nothing wrong with gay/lesbian people that love and understanding cannot cure.",1,9,topic_stance_votes_1
9,Dying Lesbian's Partner Denied Access To Her,gay marriage,support,This is just terrible. It's ironic in a sick twisted way that the right claims that we being gays are destroying families and were tarnishing some leave it to beaver image from the 50's of the idealistic naive familiy when they deny her partner and their kids to see her in her fianl moments! It just breaks my heart. I mean this is just so sad. How can people be so mean and so narrow minded? Not even you people who argue morality and such on this forum can weasel some pitiful excuse for this tragedy.,9,10,topic_stance_votes_1
10,Dying Lesbian's Partner Denied Access To Her,gay marriage,support,"I feel that I must point out that, in the past, you have argued that gays can get sufficient rights that straights get from marriage by going to a lawyer and getting the proper papers drawn up. I trust you have changed your opinion on that now?",3,11,topic_stance_votes_1
11,Dying Lesbian's Partner Denied Access To Her,gay marriage,support,"The problem is that there is no test the staff can administer to determine love. They can't tell if someone is really a loved one, or just some freak off the street that gets off on looking at unconscious people. Restricting access to family members is not an inherently bad idea, but it must include in its definition of family same sex couples. And since the only way to guarantee that definition is legally, what we have here is one more reason why gays should be allowed to get married.",9,12,topic_stance_votes_1
12,Dying Lesbian's Partner Denied Access To Her,gay marriage,support,"That has nothing whatsoever to do with my post that you replied to. I was agreeing with a post by Flygirl which pointed out that the hospital displayed a basic lack of common decency, which I trust you also agree with. Gay marriage or not, the hospital could have and should have allowed visitation. After all, some hospitals do--they are each a business and can do as they choose. There is a lot of activism going on in terms of getting hospitals to do this. See Gay rights groups launch hospital rating system, and the report itself.",11,13,topic_stance_votes_1
13,Dying Lesbian's Partner Denied Access To Her,gay marriage,support,"Sure I agree with it. The thing is, you used to argue (not in these exact words of course) that decency on the part of the hospital wasn't required, all that gays needed to do was visit a lawyer and they'd be all set. I am asking you to clarify that position now to see if you still hold that opinion or if you've changed it, specificially in light of this event. Simple question, no gotcha waiting to pounce. :)",13,14,topic_stance_votes_1
14,Dying Lesbian's Partner Denied Access To Her,gay marriage,support,"This event actually very much underscores the need for it. Given the absence of a compassionate hospital or civil partnership rights, if the visiting partner had medical PoA or Durable PoA (which, from what I've seen, isn't very hard to do), then all visitation rights would have been guaranteed. I also doubt I've argued that a hospital shouldn't be required to be decent, or that 'visiting a lawyer' would mean one was 'all set' in every way. Drawing up good paperwork to cover such situations is simply a smart thing to do, and many of the pertinent things that marriage would give can indeed be covered by this sort of thing.",14,15,topic_stance_votes_1
15,Dying Lesbian's Partner Denied Access To Her,gay marriage,support,"Sorry, pronoun trouble. What does ""it"" refer to here? I'm guessing you mean some sort of legal document, but I'm not sure.
And would you think to carry around that piece of paper at all times? And, for that matter, is a hospital actually required to obey such a piece of paper? Recall if you will the Shavio (sp?) case. By law the husband was next of kin and should have been the one to determine how long support was to be maintained. But her birth family stepped in, and the hospital caved to their wishes. If a hospital can do that, why should we assume that they would always obey documents with no actual law supporting them that go against the hospital's stated policies? Especially for something as ""out there"" as a gay couple.
And since I never claimed that you said either thing, I guess we're still on the same page.
So you haven't changed your opinion then, is that what you're (more or less) saying? You still think that seeing a lawyer and filling out some forms will, at least in this instance, provide the same protections that a full fledged marriage would give?",15,16,topic_stance_votes_1
16,Dying Lesbian's Partner Denied Access To Her,gay marriage,support,"Sorry if I was unclear--I simply mean this case underscores the value of having such legal security as power of attorney.
Yes, a Medical PoA is a notarized legal document; my understanding is that a hospital is just as required to obey it as they would be marriage status, if not more so. If they didn't, the couple would have enormous recourse to sue, just as they could if a hospital disallowed visits by a married partner. I'm no lawyer, but I've researched that much, at least. Hospitals are very accustomed to documents like medical PoA and Guardianships. They are well aware of the legal implications of not honoring them.
Again, I doubt I've argued that ""seeing a lawyer and filling out some forms"" will provide all the same protections. In terms of hospital visitation--this instance--from what I know, a medical PoA would indeed suffice. Obviously a civil partnership such as marriage or civil union would require less work and cover other specific cases.",16,17,topic_stance_votes_1
17,Dying Lesbian's Partner Denied Access To Her,gay marriage,support,"And again, not what I said that you've argued. Look how in agreement we are!
Plus, as I understand it, a POA only works if you have the document on you when you need it. If you don't carry the medical POA with you at all times, then you're SOL. Hardly fair or equitable.",17,18,topic_stance_votes_1
