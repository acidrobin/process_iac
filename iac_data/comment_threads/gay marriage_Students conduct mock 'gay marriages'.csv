Parents angered by lunchtime ceremonies on campus
Posted: February 19, 2005

Â© 2005 WorldNetDaily.com
Students at a California high school conducted mock same-sex ""wedding"" ceremonies at lunchtime on campus, prompting protests from angry parents.
The school's Gay-Straight Alliance promoted the event at Silverado High School in the high-desert town of Victorville Feb. 11 to mark National Freedom to Marry Day.
Six female couples and three male couples took part in the ceremonies at the school's outdoor central gathering area.
About 40 parents, community members and students showed up in chilly, rainy weather to protest the event, the Los Angeles Times reported.
One protester, Therese Shore, said her son Andrew Stading, a Silverado senior, was reprimanded by school officials the day of the event for wearing a custom-made protest T-shirt bearing slogans such as ""Gay is not the way"" and an obscene slur about homosexuals, according to the Times.
""I don't want them shoving homosexuality down my child's throat,"" Shore said.
One student's father, objecting to a taxpayer-supported school holding such an event, held up a sign reading ""I don't.""
""I think the school and the district made a terrible, terrible judgment,"" he told the Times.
The district issued a statement, calling the ceremonies ""a lawful exercise of the right of free speech guaranteed to public school students under state and federal law.""
Some protesters objected to school rules barring religious demonstrations on campus.
""I'm Christian. I'm not allowed to bring my Bible, preaching to people,"" said sophomore Christina Wilson, 15.
Wilson and others carried signs with such slogans as ""God objects.""

I just want to know.... 
Why? 
If they spent more time learning and preparing their minds for the real world instead of spending time in mock gay marriages of which they probably don't take seriously to begin with --- it just doesn't belong in a school of learning regardless of whether you support the sexual lifestyle or not, a school is not a center for people to promote their sexual lifestyles!!! Period!!!! what next --- Tranny Day?

The problem is that there is obviously a double-standard. If they are so eager to allow students the right to free speech in such matters, they should be consistent and allow things like students preaching christian sermons on school grounds.

So they conducted a mock wedding...who cares? They spoke up about their sexuality. Good for them.
Personally, I think it was a pretty good idea, even if they did do it in a way that would surely attract a lot of critism and problems. At my school we do things a little differently, but hey, I live in a completely different state and area, so there we go. We had a day at our school where all GLBT teens wore neon orange hoodies or shirts, but didn't say what they were for.
The school figured it out...eventually. Most of the students actually thought it was great and were asking how it was that we got up enough courage to tell a bigoted area who we were and what we were. It was great.

I also think it is very disingenuous to assume that any counter-opinion toward homosexuality is bigotry. Gay rights people really need to come to the point where they realize there is usually a huge difference between someone who shares an honest counter-opinion on the morality of homosexuality and someone who beats or abuses gay people.

49,Students conduct mock 'gay marriages',gay marriage,attack,"As I see it, there are three sources. The Old Testament, as you say, is about hating those who believe differently and punishing them. The New Testament, however, isn't quite as you state it. The new Testament tells you how to live and tells you to hate sin, but it also tells you to accept the beliefs of others and let God issue judgement. Finally there is the teaching of Jesus. Jesus himself tells you how to live but tells you to accept the beliefs of others, letting God issue judgement. The difference between the teachings of Jesus and the teachings of the New Testament as a whole are that Jesus does not teach to hate the sin; he teaches not to hate.
Yet the root of today's most commonplace ""Christian"" principles seem to me less founded in ""loving the others as you would love yourself"" or ""letting God issue judgement"" than in ""hating the sin"". Claiming to hate the sin but love the sinner is a nice little slogan, but when hating the sin is what guides us then that slogan means nothing.

50,Students conduct mock 'gay marriages',gay marriage,attack,"Where? I've never read that.
In my experience, everyone tends to make Jesus into what fits them, rather that approaching the text about him with an open and humble mind, willing to learn and not apply him to others. Lets see if Jesus was the all-inclusive altruistic humanitarian you say he is:
- He said no man comes to the father except through ME."" Only 3 possibilities here: either he was an ego-maniac, someone who didn't tolerate other religions as a way to God, or he was simply telling the truth.
- He claimed to be God, and that was an affront to Judaism and many other religions.
- He left no room for lust, thoughts of sexual immorality, even saying it was sinful to think about these things. (Matt. 5-6) No harm done to anyone--so much for a Jesus who understands that humans will be human.
Ironically, to the pharisees of his day, he seemed just as politically incorrect as some probably seem to you today. 
I think you take the one thing you can't stand the most in Christian thinking and XXXX it out of proportion. Most Christians I know of don't spend much time thinking about homosexuality and to me they are better known by the humanitarian things they do. Even James Dobson, perhaps the most vilified man by the gay lobby, has far less on his website about homosexuality than he does family issues, mending husband and wife problems, etc. Listening to some of Christianity's critics here, one would think the religion's very core teaching was about hating gays--ironically that's the very opposite and 99.9% of Christians don't hate gays. That's the truth, deal with it. The Fred Phelps' of the world are actually very rare. If you are going to give a fair assessment of Christians, you need to also show all the good things they do: feeding homeless people, getting food to areas of the world with starving people, operating orphanages, after school programs for youth, homeless shelters, and many other things. Organized religion makes an easy target but that doesn't mean we shouldn't be fair in our assessment.

I was simply answering the implication that morality and religion are always related, but that's not true.
That's because the overall and overwhelming consensus is that the passage you are talking about isn't about the context of slavery, but about something completely different. If the Bible's view was that slaves always obey their masters, and that slavery is ""very moral"" (as you say) then the story of the Israelites leaving Egypt under Moses' leadership wouldn't have been there.

Even if there were many people who were against freedom of speech, the government passing a law restricting this, could be found unconstitutional in court.

There is hardly the same kind of consensus against homosexuality and gay marriage that there is in support of freedom of speech. General support for freedom of speech has not changed. It spans accross centuries, generations and ideologies, religions, or non-religion. There are logical arguments in support of freedom of speech, unlike the fallacies which are used to argue against gay rights. Gay rights have advanced, unlike for example the ideology that we can't have free speech, as a result. 
There are others, supporting slavery. There are others supporting many areas of morality we no longer believe in. The overwhelming consensus of Christianity was not always against slavery, but once in support of slavery. Ineresting that we can use context when looking at things society will not tolerate. However, oppression of gay people is the one thing still acceptable in some circles, so it is okay for many Christians to use the Bible and their religious beliefs and doctrines to support this one particular act. No further reasoning is considered necessary, unlike with other acts of oppression society no longer has any support for.

Sorry, but you are wrong on this--morality does indeed have a great effect upon our constitution, regarding the amendments and other laws as well. I think it is safe to say that the founders of the constitution crafted it because they it's principles were RIGHT. Legislation does not take place in an ideological vacuum.
Only because the 1st Amendment is there--the amendment would not have been added in the first place if enough people didn't feel that giving freedom of speech was not the right thing to do: this is morality, my friend.
That's because of activist judges who have taken the 14th amendment out of context.
This just isn't true. You're assuming that just because some southerners at one time tried to misuse the Bible to justify what they did, that the Bible must indeed claim that. You've fell into their trap yourself.",62,63,topic_stance_votes_2

That is why almost every single person believes in freedom of speech. That will not change very much at all, unless there is a logical argument against general freedom of speech.
Of course it was a moral issue. And through logical arguments, the minority was able to convince the majority. I don't believe there are a majority who would amend the Constitution of the U.S. to ban gay rights. 
Is any decision you don't agree with simply, ""activist""?
I am correct. For most of it's history, Christianity did generally support slavery...

64,Students conduct mock 'gay marriages',gay marriage,attack,"No, but the sale of alcohol is banned on Sundays in some states. There are a whole plethora of so-called ""blue laws"" that impose one group's morality on everyone and they are perfectly legal. I doubt that many of the states that have Blue Laws are eager to change them, either. So your assertion that government can't force a religious view on the population is false and disproven every Sunday in many states. 
It also says that a woman must obey her husband at all times......Damn, why couldn't I have married a strict Christian woman. :)",60,65,topic_stance_votes_2

67,Students conduct mock 'gay marriages',gay marriage,support,"Actually, the bible and christian religion does give information of how to specifically treat your slaves and servants. It gives detailed instructions on what to do with slaves.
Jesus even mentions them.
There is no repudiation of slavery or slaves, but there are instructions on how to go about it. Logically, this means that Jesus wasn't fighting against it, but actually working for it.
Therefore, the Bible, which is the word of GOd, and Jesus is GOd, supports slavery.
As for Activist Judges, that's merely a rhetorical cop-out that people use when a court makes a decision they don't like.
The government also had Sodomy Laws. Not everything it does is what it's supposed to do or ought to do as a government. Blue laws are antiquated and need to be chucked.",67,68,topic_stance_votes_1
