1,"Creation, Evolution, and Religion",evolution,attack,"faith means hope and therefore no one 'hopes' for evolution. religious people hope because they truly want it to be fact. evolution is a theory and is excepted as an essential. its like ""the world is round"" discovery; it is only in its infancy.",1,2,topic_stance_votes_1
2,"Creation, Evolution, and Religion",evolution,attack,"from Webster's Main Entry: faith
Pronunciation: 'fAth
Function: noun
Inflected Form(s): plural faiths /'fAths, sometimes 'fA[th]z/
Etymology: Middle English feith, from Old French feid, foi, from Latin fides; akin to Latin fidere to trust -- more at BIDE
Date: 13th century
1 a : allegiance to duty or a person : LOYALTY b (1) : fidelity to one's promises (2) : sincerity of intentions
2 a (1) : belief and trust in and loyalty to God (2) : belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion b (1) : firm belief in something for which there is no proof (2) : complete trust
3 : something that is believed especially with strong conviction; especially : a system of religious beliefs
synonym see BELIEF
Would your definition of faith to be?:
b (1) : firm belief in something for which there is no proof
If so, then neither can have a strict mathematical ""proof"".

I could go with 2 b (1), (2), or the first part of 3 for the definition I would apply to this question.

8,"Creation, Evolution, and Religion",evolution,attack,"2 a (1) : belief and trust in and loyalty to God
Since science doesn't have gods, this doesn't fit. So science isn't religion.
(2) : belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion
Science doesn't have doctrines. Science is a tool to learn about the world around us. Science progresses by challenging and questioning.
b (1) : firm belief in something for which there is no proof
Nope. One doesn't believe in science. One recognized and accepts the most parsimoneous explanation for the observed facts available.
(2) : complete trust
Certainly not. Darwin questioned the leading scientists of his day. Today, the process of peer review means that no one is trusted. That is why in publishing new science, the data and methods are explained in detail. That is why work is frequently repeated by other scientists. Science is always checked again.",1,9,topic_stance_votes_1

In order to apply your responces to the definitions, you would have to prove that evolution (the process by which all things existing were created) is scientific.

10,"Creation, Evolution, and Religion",evolution,attack,"No, sweetie. Evolutionary theory is the unifying concept of the biological sciences. It has been science for well over 200 years. It has been found to be science by U.S. District Courts, U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeals, and by the Supreme Court of the United States in every decision that considered it for the last 40 years or more. Only scientific illiterates believe that somehow evolutionary theory is not scientific, not because they have a rational basis for denying that fact, but because they have a problem reconciling their religion, based on ancient mythology, with observations of reality.
And I'll tell you one more time, sweetie. Evolution is not the process by which all things existing were created. Evolution is a biological science and applies only to living things. If you are going to discuss this stuff, then you need to at least have the integrity to invest enough effort to understand the terms. Creation is not evolution. Outside of biology the word means change and nothing more.
I am aware of that. But you are wrong. I will assume it is because of your ignorance and not dishonesty. Nothing in science is accepted on faith. Your continued insistance that it is so only underlines your ignorance of the matter. You are an example of why our high school graduates rank 40th out of 42 nations in their knowledge of science and math (we did better than Somolia and Croatia as I recall)

12,"Creation, Evolution, and Religion",evolution,support,"Let's just say for arguement's sake that these definitions are true:
faith: firm belief in something for which there is no proof
proof: something that induces certainty or establishes validity
If there is no complete proof for evolution, wouldn't scientists be taking a step of faith in believing that it is true before it is completely proven? 
The definition of believe...
believe:to accept as true, genuine, or real.
sounds very much like the definition of acccept...
accept:to recognize as true
so I would say that evolutionists to ""believe"" in an idea for which there is no complete ""proof"" and therefore must have ""faith"" in a scientific sort of ""religion"".",1,13,topic_stance_votes_2

Evolution is not, as creationism claims to be, the ""Grand Theory of Life,the Universe, and Everything"" (we all know the answer to that is 42!).

If you are interested in the beginings of the earth, speak to a geologist. If you're interested in the beginings of the universe, seek out a physisist, a cosmologist or an astronomer.

42,"Creation, Evolution, and Religion",evolution,attack,"Nice try, Taiyles. But if you believe that you will make progress in convincing a creationist that he doesn't have the right to define the words that biologists use, they you are a dreamer. There are several threads here in which I have been trying to explain what science is and how it works. Still they object to evolution because it is only a theory.
Just as gravity is a theory of physics, evolution is a theory of biology. We agree on the definition. I learned it many years ago on the first day of my class in evolutionary biology. By that time I understood the meanings of the specialized words. Sometimes I think that part of the problem is that creationists don't understand what the words mean - just as they miss the meaning of the word theory when used in science. I learned it like this back when Kennedy was President:
Evolution is a change in the frequency of alleles in a population over time.
If that is not what one means by evolution, then there needs to be a modifying word or the context must clearly indicate otherwise.
For those who don't understand the words, I'll define them.
frequency means ratio. allele means one of two or more variants of a gene. population means a group of interbreeding organisms. over time means from generation to generation.",1,43,topic_stance_votes_1
43,"Creation, Evolution, and Religion",evolution,attack,What the hell is an evolutionist anyhow?,1,44,topic_stance_votes_1
44,"Creation, Evolution, and Religion",evolution,attack,"I agree with Lurch, Seeker. The term ""evolutionist"" must first be defined, as the answer to your question depends very much on that. Now, if by evolutionist you mean:
(a) Theory of Evolution- it doesnt say anything about the begining of the world. It only talks about the change in frequency of alleles over time.
(b) Evolutionary Biologists- That depends on the biologists and on how familiar they are with the scientific literature on the subject. That in turn would probably depend on how much they need this knowledge for their line of research.
(d) Anyone who ""believes""* in evolution- In this category I am including scientists, non-scientists who have studied evolution, examinded the evidence and have a pretty good grasp of its concepts, and people who just ""believe"" because that's what they were taught. Since this group includes everyone from scientists to my 4 year old nephew who loves dinosaurs, it's impossible to make generalizations about their opinions. There are probably as many points of view as there are people. My niece, for example, belives that she is dreaming the world, and when she wakes up, she will be born (that girl has some straaange ideas! We think she'll grow out of it... maybe) 
* Just a note: I've always thought that ""believing"" in evolution was a lot like ""believing"" in tables. If you prefer to take the tables existance on faith, rather that checking the data that verifies it, you may as well eat off of your metaphorical knees. And if you've already done your research and scoured the literature, well, you know the table's there and you can use it to do things with.
