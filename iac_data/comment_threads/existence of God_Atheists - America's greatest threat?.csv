A recent survey found that 54% of Americans believe atheism presents the greatest threat to our society, even more than non-Christian religions such as Islam.
http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2004/04/27/9453#repeat
That has me wondering what our fellow forum members think about the matter. I've included a poll which I hope you'll take time to vote in, and I am looking forward to any and all comments.

2,Atheists - America's greatest threat?,existence of God,support,"Hi Eddie,
A fair enough question I suppose. I have no further info about the news article or the wording of their poll. 
What I'm personally looking for is to try to understand if Christians feel their way of life is endangered by atheists, and what the nature of their feeling of endangerment is, i.e., dwindling church attendance, complete repudiation, etc. I don't for a moment think believers feel physically threatened and the word ""threatened"" might better be thought of as ""concerned"".

3,Atheists - America's greatest threat?,existence of God,attack,"Good post, billsco.
Concerned? I can’t conceive any way that atheism can concern me or my environment. I personally know several that contribute to the community in positive ways just as much or more so than those that believe in God.
I do feel concerned for them, though. My belief system carries me beyond the physical and into the spiritual, which forces me (spiritually) to grieve for them. I am not a religious nut insofar as religion is concerned, but am towards Christ. I have no methods, no rituals, or scheming routines so I am free to express my belief with compassion. Nuff said on that.
If a person is “good”, he or she is acceptable, if not they are a menace to society. Religionists are not good people, whether they are so-called Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, etc.
If I worship the Truck God and treat people with respect, show love, honor and am trustworthy, then my faith in my Truck God is irrelevant. When I love my wife and kids with all my heart and provide for them the best I can, when I participate in social functions, help feed the poor, take care of the elderly, it makes no difference if there is a god, I am not a threat.
Of course, if I am a religionist, and my livelihood depends on how many people believe in God, then I could count all atheists as enemies. Heck, I might start a petition around my neighborhood to prevent those kinds of people from buying homes here. I would have a reason to discriminate, right? Yea – right.

Another Pentecostal church, another preacher, another set of believers, says something different.

Honestly, I can see why christians may see this as a veritable threat. For one, many atheists will make postulations-some of them valid, some of them simply blather, about inconsistencies in the bible and deceitful things your parents told you. They also study a very sacred item and ideology; through theology they may discover a few things that gnaw away at the bible's relevancy and credibility. This, to me, seems to irritate christians and make them feel a bit questionable about their beliefs. Atheism, to many christians, is rightfully conceived as an attempt to undermine everything christianity stands for and has done throughout the course of history.

18,Atheists - America's greatest threat?,existence of God,attack,"Let me play devil's advocate and argue against religious diversity. In my view, a very important role of religion is to give people certainty about the meaning of life and also for the rules of right and wrong behavior. Religious heterogeneity subverts the authority, the persuasiveness, and positive influence of these beliefs, so they no longer do as well what they are intended to do; they no longer do what people need them to do. Beliefs becomes mushy, tepid, tentative, and somewhat arbitrary as people adjust them in order to get along with everyone else. And people frankly begin to adopt illogical beliefs like that all paths lead to God. I was raised in a religion which taught that if you were not a faithful member, you do not go to heaven. There are other religions that teach the same thing, so all these people in a religiously diverse society like the U.S. are saying all paths lead to Heaven, but how can the exclusive religions all be right? 
On the other hand, I will concede that religious diversity tends to soften religions, and sometimes they need that. For example, from what I see, Muslims born and raised in the U.S. tend to have a more moderate, healthy oritentation than a Muslim raised in an exclusively Muslim country.

No, because the beliefs are not defined. A religion is a defined set of concrete beliefs and precepts. An atheist is free to modify the beliefs, or completely change them, at any time. They are based solely on the individual. I see this posted a lot, and I suppose on some level there is some truth to it, but atheism is far from being a ""religion"" IMHO.
I can take the fact that God doesn't exist based on far more than blind faith. That's an incorrect statement. The simple fact that there is no physical evidence of his existance is pretty good proof that he doesn't exist. Of course I can never prove a negative, but the available evidence provides me with much more than blind faith upon which to base the decision that he doesn't exist.
As for why should an atheist care, I believe that's exactly Sinjin's point. If you are an atheist, there is no end reward, ie heaven, that you are striving for, and no punishment, ie hell, to fear. Therefore, an atheist living an exemplary life is doing so stricty of his/her own choosing, not for any selfish means or out of fear of punishment. To me, that is a more noble or ""evolved"" reason for doing so.

Not 100% proof, but strong evidence nonetheless.
As for your murder analogy, a person is dead, what other evidence of a murder do you want? It wouldn't be a murder investigation if someone wasn't dead, it would be a missing person's investigation.

My personality dictates that I need some kind of proof or evidence before I believe in something, I'm a skeptic. I think that's inherent in most people with a scientific background. Nothing is taken to exist or be a fact until it can be physically proven in a repeatable experiment.
For those that are believers, they choose to accept something until someone proves otherwise. They dont' require proof, only faith.

Existence exists - and the act of grasping that statement implies two corollary axioms: that something exists which one perceives and that one exists possessing consciousness, consciousness being the faculty of perceiving that which exists.
If nothing exists, there can be no consciousness: a consciousness with nothing to be conscious of is a contradiction in terms. A consciousness conscious of nothing but itself is a contradiction in terms: before it could identify itself as consciousness, it had to be conscious of something. 
If that which you claim to perceive does not exist, what you possess is not consciousness.

Well, depends on what is trying to be manipulated I would say. I think religious people have, through their belief system, an anchored, unshakeable foundation. That it is wrong is where the problem lies, IMO, and causes the rest of a society to slow its progression. Consider: when a new religion appears, its ""priests"" are the clear leaders, defining the faith, acting as messengers and mouthpieces of the new god. As the faith matures, I think the roles reverse and priests become servile to the masses. Case in point: the Rev. Jerry Falwell in regards to 9/11. His congregation of like-minded believers was clearly telling him where the fault lie in the tragedy -- gays were to blame and this was God's punishment. When he was publicly chastised he recanted, only to re-recant to his congregation. Who's leading whom here? 
Are people, outside of what they believe about religion, naturally skeptical or naturally gullible on the whole? My experience would tell me they tend toward skepticism. Religion muddies the water and tends to make otherwise healthily skeptical people irrational.

I think it was some offhand comment you made about papal infallibility that I pointed out was not entirely accurate. It is a bit off topic. Agreed. Couple more comments, though.
Regarding the following exchange:
Based on your comments regarding papal infallibility, it doesn't appear that you have a solid understanding of what 'papal infallibility' means as it is defined within the RCC. Often, arguments against something one does not understand are not reasonable arguments. (Consider creationist arguments for an example of this.) I may not have a complete understanding of papal infallibility as defined within the RCC, but I have a good enough understanding to know that your comments do not demonstrate a solid understanding of it. My own pursuit of truth has nothing to do with your understanding of papal infallibility. 
At some levels, this may be true. Though the RCC will do whatever the RCC will do. What the RCC does may have an impact on individuals outside the RCC through various channels (media, legal, political, personal contact, etc.) But the doctrine of papal infallibility has no direct impact on anyone's beliefs unless they allow it to have an impact on their beliefs.
The assumption of Mary was one of the 'infallible' proclamations by the Pope when speaking Ex Cathedra.

Billy Graham picked up the ball where Norman Vincent Peale left it after reinventing God in the mid 20th century.

That statement alone relegates God to nothingness, although I'm afraid it eluded the audience.

I othink you misunderstand my statements. I am not saying that hell is not a reality. I am not saying that Billy Graham does not believe in it. Hell is simply eternal separation from God. The bible says that the only way to God is through Jesus. That is to be sure. But, it is how this is presented by christians with which you argue. 
I have never preached hell and damnation. None of those have ever turned anyone toward God. God himself told the children of Israel what would happen if they turned their back on Him. It did not stop them anyway (read Jeremiah for background).
It is God' love, mercy and grace that are appealing to people. God is love is not a New concept. It is well established from the very beginning. It is who God is. All he does is out of love, because it is who He is. You nor I always understand it, but we are not the ones who get to define what is and is not loving. That would be ludicrous as it would result in sheer chaos and foolish actions. That is where moral relativism comes from. 
If, however, love is defined then to know what it is is the highest of all callings. God defines love as Himself. Therefore, the highest of all callings is to know God. To look simply at the surface actions and not dig deeper into things leaves one with a wrong view. 
That is the point I was trying to make. You mischaracterize what people are doing. To say that Billy Graham is a terrible person because he tries to scare people into believing is simply wrong. NOthing BG has ever done was out of a desire to induce fear. 
If he believes that the highest of callings is to know God (love) and it has had a profound impact on his life (and he does and it has) then why would he NOT want others to experience such a thing. 
If you found the most amazing thing in the world to you and it was life transforming and the people you love did not have that, would you not want to share it with them. That is Dr. Graham's motivation. For you to beleive otherwise would necessarily be based on a lack of knowledge and therefore be somewhat prejudicial.

You, as anybody are certainly qualified to speak of love. I did not say you were not. I said you are not qualified to DEFINE love as you cannot see everything. To say that what God did or does is not love is a little like the pot telling the potter that he should have swirled more at the top. 
The next part will likely answer the bootfitters tirade as well. God did not create man perfect. In his image, yes, but images are not perfect. They are representations. One would not take a photograph and declare it to be as good as the person. If that were the case, I suspect there would be a large number of men married to Elle McPherson. God created man to be lead. God created man with a need for God. 
He did not give man everything he needed to see the future. Why is seeing the future so important. Because to truly love someone we must know what is REALLY for their best, not just the best in the next twenty minutes, but what will benefit them most for a lifetime. Our (humans) view is far too limited to truly discern. It is one of the reasons that dependence on God is the only real way to love. 
This is the point I was trying to make. You are quite right to see shades of Job in what I wrote; it is predominantly the point I was making. God can and has defined love. Love, as a concept is quite difficult to define in words (especially in the english language), however, God defined love in a word, Jesus. This is essentially the christian belief. For us to claim that the God of the old testament (which IMO they are one and the same) did not love is saying ""I get to define love and the only one who made all of creation and sees both forward and backward throughout all of time and beyond does not.""
Does that clarify my point Billsco? I would like to hear your thoughts on it.

Is there anyone else in this forum that actually claims to be perfect, to never have made a mistake, hurt someone they love, been hurt, acted in anger when they should not have?

If you were talking to someone that had no concept of God, or any supernatural being, you wouldn't have to prove that he doesn't exist.
This is getting back into the whole not being able to prove a negative idea. The problem is, there has to be a BELIEF in the negative before there's any reason for it to be disproven, or to express a belief otherwise.

However not sure on the ground state thing, if they have no concept of this it doesn't mean the thing does not exist or that they don't beleive such a thing doesn't exist - the fact a child has never heard of elephants does not stop them existing. Knowledge of the concept of a thing is needed before you can believe it is true or disbelieve it.
However as Atheism is generally a disbelief in god (as if you don't understand the concept of God then you would never have heard of the concept of Atheism - neither exist to you) you are relying on absence of physical proof (you essentailly have a hearsay kind of proof as you have been told he exists) and you are choosing to beleive that this physcial evidence (or absence of it) is dominant over the hearsay evidence (a positive in this case, even if the eventual belief is negative).
I dunno, I can see how Atheism can be shown to be illogical purely on semantics, but I doubt anyone can show a way for religion to be more logical way.

First, I don't understand your fixation on the term ""Yuppy"".

Did that still make me a Yuppy in your eyes? emoticonXRolleyes 
Secondly, I find it interesting that you would classify ANY part of the Bible as ""fairy stories"". If you are a true Christian, then you also believe that the Bible IS the word of God. Do you think that God writes children's tales?
Now, there are parables in the Bible that are used as tools to bring a more concrete understanding of God's more abstract concepts to the masses, many of whom were illiterate and possessed only a rudimentary knowledge of many things, but I'd hardly label these as ""fairy tales"". 
Thirdly, religion, by definition, doesn't require the achnowledgement of a supreme being. Religion has several meanings. For example: ""a cause, principle, or system of beliefs held to with ardor and faith"" as taken from Merriam Webster Online Dictionary.

177,Atheists - America's greatest threat?,existence of God,attack,"Hi JP, 
I'm actually an agnostic, but for shorthand reasons I've simply gone to calling myself atheist rather than getting bogged down in the definition and not discussing the substance.
IMO, agnosticism is simply the truest position a person can possess. Your five-leaf clover example will suffice. We can never be expected to examine every last clover stalk on the earth, and every other hospitable planet in the universe, before becoming five-leaf clover atheists. But one certainly can be agnostic about it after an exhaustive search reveals no such thing. It also does not preclude the fact that some odd mutation is not at this very moment, or some time in the future, producing one. For that reason, agnosticism becomes a honest conclusion. Certainly not a vacuous one, which is another reason I will sometimes define myself as an atheist. I don't want people assuming I'm riding fences and too lazy to get down.
You would make a fine agnostic. I hope you continue exploring.
regards",143,178,topic_stance_votes_1
178,Atheists - America's greatest threat?,existence of God,attack,"Very well said. There is no proof of the existence of any God or gods. Even the most faithful Christian cannot KNOW with certainty that God exists in reality, apart from the mind/spirit of the individual. The only evidence any individual can offer for the existence of a God or gods is personal experience -- which is by its very nature, subjective. The individual mind can make any experience mean just about anything. (One person's suffering could be another person's joy.)
It is fine to believe in a God or gods. But belief is not knowledge. It is faith. As such, there is no proof. Once there is 'proof' (or substantial evidence in reality with no evidence to the contrary), then it no longer takes faith to believe something.
I'm not certain if I would fall under the category of agnostic... I personally believe that God exists. I have had personal experiences that are enough to indicate to me that God is real (though the actual God that exists may be distinct from what I am able to comprehend this God to be). HOWEVER, I recognize that currently, we do not have any proof or even substantial evidence in reality that there is a God or gods. Perhaps we never will have this evidence in the realm that we occupy. Perhaps we will.",178,179,topic_stance_votes_2
179,Atheists - America's greatest threat?,existence of God,support,"Very true. 
I guess that's where my ""ground state"" idea comes in. If there is no God, or there was no concept of God, then Atheism would not exist. Therefore, I view atheism as being ""first"", or the ground state.
This is one of, if not THE, biggest ""problem"" I have with believers - the use of logic and reason only when it fits their agenda, and then falling back onto faith whenever the going gets tough.
I actually have more respect for someone that says ""I believe in the Bible and feel no need to justify that belief in any way."" than someone that tries to justify or support their belief in God and the Bible using science and logic.

In other words, I see Agnosticism as vacuous because I don't see them trying to find an answer to the question ""Is there a God?"". Instead, I see Agnosticism as ""who cares if there is or isn't?""

I understand what you are saying, thank you for your fuller response. Unfortunately I don't believe I can agree with you. Is it your contention we cannot define anything unless we are omniscient? Would that defense work at my murder trial if I went on a spree? Since we can't see everything, I could contend that we don't properly know the definition of murder and whether it wasn't for the best.
I think I can define love, its three broad meanings: between two people, between friends and family, and with humanity and nature in general. I have numerous problems with God's actions in the O.T. and N.T. as they relate to love, and I have, in effect, put him on trial. As a prosecutor, I most definitely would be pressing the issue that not only should the pot have been more swirled at the top, but it should have been made without the holes in the bottom. You, as the defense attorney, can only respond that I have no business claiming to know what a pot should look like. 
I know when my wife comes home from work today, I'll happily sit with her on the porch outside listening to how her day was, and later we'll enjoy a quiet meal together and we'll probably plan our weekend. I know at every step what I've done is best for her, because I love her now. What happens in twenty years is beyond us, but if I'm gone I hope the memory of quiet spring evenings with her husband fill her with peace. 
To interject another entity into the equation only detracts from the attention we can give each other, IMO. And he's constantly asking for more and more of it.

182,Atheists - America's greatest threat?,existence of God,attack,"I see. Although in my experience it has been the other way around, that the ones who are really just apathetic call themselves atheists because they have never looked into the subject to hear or understand agnosticism. I do see your point, and there are many who do take this disinterest. However they exist in all branches of religion, and while atheism/agnosticism may be stereotyped as having more than the usual, that does not mean those who strongly and intelligently hold these beliefs are less validated.

For example, to use the example of you with your wife. You are quite correct that you are indeed loving her by listening to her day.

However, we were discussing whether or not things that God did as stated in the old testament are love or not love. I don't see how you or I could define that. I did not bring another entity into it.
Were you not the one who said you did not believe that God was a loving God, if he existed because of the things that the old testament attributes to him.
