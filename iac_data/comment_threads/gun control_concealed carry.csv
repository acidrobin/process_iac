0,concealed carry,gun control,support,"ok, i live in kansas which is currently going throught the motions of instituting a concealed carry law so i been thinking about it
there are 3 general ways to reduce crime
1. high penalties, example along time ago in arabia (could still be happening, i dont know) your right hand was chopped off for stealing, this punishment was even worse since the left hand is considered unclean and its an insult to your host to touch anything with it, everytime you would do anything in public you had to explain that you had been a thief.....this cannot be implemented well here in america
2. more police, enough to catch folks in the act, again, cannot be implemented costs too much money
3. prepare your citizens to deal with criminals, there are many ways martial arts can work, but take too much time and training, a concealed firearm is the quickest and easiest way to be ready. tear gas and tasers are alternatives but are not garunteed. a determined or high opponent can take a bullet to the heart and still kill the person shooting him/her, try to tell me that teargas would stop him/her
now i remember someone somewhere saying, if you have it, then you _will_ use it eventually, i have this to say
i was in high school when the high profile school shootings of the nineties happened, i was a gun nut, these XXXXXX made me look bad, so i started carrying a rather large folding pocket knife, and i swore that if somebody started shooting people in my school then i would do whatever i could to stop it, fortunatly i never had too. now im in college, and i still carry that knife, 7 yrs i have carried it with the intent to defend myself and those around me, yet the only use it has had is breaking down boxes for the dumpster, dont tell me the presense of a weapon means a crime will occur.
now i have gotten smarter, i will happily help society defend itself in a reasonably fair engagement, but the government has made certain that no one has a gun in public places, they disarmed me, so they are on their own
an interesting note is this, after going through the exhaustive requirements the gov wants to ensure that you are a safe carryer, they still prevent you from carrying in certain areas, the proposed law disallows concealed carry in universities, schools, businesses that disallow it, and anywhere children congregate
imagine wearing a ballcap for a month, then being told that its a felony to wear it when you walk into a library. just when you become comfortable and forget you are wearing it then your supposed to remember that you cant in this place
and why not in a university, people there are considered legal adults, after paying the money and doing the training, putting my fingerprints on record i would not be able to carry 70% of my time in public, the other time i work in a gun store, not like someone is going to rob them in daylight, seems criminals, even armed ones, avoid places saturated with guns, something to think about huh?

1,concealed carry,gun control,support,"Welcome aboard! I am in Kansas too (near Emporia).
I think Sebelius is going to veto it. I don't know if we have the votes to over ride the veto or not. I have heard rumors that Kerry is considering Sebelius for a running mate. All I can say is ""Take her and good riddance. We can't take much more of her math"".
Interestingly enough, that is because their left hand was the one they used to wipe. True.
exactly
3 for 3! College must be doing you some good!
Excellent point. On the one hand, it is good to keep people from getting killed. On the other hand, if somebody is going to die, I would prefer it not be me. 
These conditions were put in place to placate the liberals. I don't think the bill would pass without them. While they absolutly fly in the face of common sense, especially since the measures called for in the new bill are actually stricter than those required of law officers in kansas, for some reason they make the liberals feel better. I don't think that there will be much of a problem with businesses that disalow it, except maybe in socialist Johnson County. This is Kansas, where most people can still at least find ""common sense"" in the dictionary. 
Yes, the university one is quite possibly the most nonsensical. I will never understand why people seem to think that the mere presence of a weapon makes it somehow more likely that there is going to be a problem. I have lots and lots of guns, right here at my house. Last year, the murder rate at my house was 0. I think that we can most likely maintain the same this year.

2,concealed carry,gun control,support,"i am at PSU in pittsburg kansas, another thing i just noticed
a friend of mine just got back from iraq, where he was trusted to ride on top of a humvee and fire a full automatic .50 caliber M2 (thats an extremly powerful weapon, pierces armored personel carriers even...is a fixed machine gun if you dont know) and he arrives here only to find that he cannot buy a pistol cause he is 19, a pistol which is a close copy of his sidearm, whats up with that
he was paid to carry this arm in an area where murderers have little chance of getting caught, yet he cannot buy one here, where most criminals get caught

hmm, i wonder why no antis posted to my previous thread, i figured i would find it on fire",2,3,topic_stance_votes_2
3,concealed carry,gun control,support,"The antis kind of duck out after a while, especially on the concealed carry issue. Since the numbers don;t support them, they don;t have much by way of a leg to stand on here.
IT has been a while since an anti tried to take up the cause in a good intellectual debate here, it seems they prefer emotional responses. Most of our really serious antis have left, right now the ""hot topic"" seems to be about gun free school zones and guns on airplanes.
It always seemed a bit odd to me that an 18 yr old kid can jin the military and be given access to cannons, rocket launchers, mortars, machine guns and bombs, but we apparently cannot trust them with a 9mm or to drink a beer.
Odd to say the least.",3,4,topic_stance_votes_2
4,concealed carry,gun control,attack,"I'm curious, how much does the military check on the recruits? I mean, do they do background checks and is there any restriction on joining?
I don't understand age limits on alcohol, anyway. I guess drinking to bodyweight maybe, so very young'uns don't kill themselves with alcohol poisoning. Is it really a trust issue?",4,5,topic_stance_votes_1
5,concealed carry,gun control,support,"When I joined up I went through an SC check (the second level of clearance). Not sure what it checked but you fill out a load of forms and after a while they come back and say ok you're in! Of course this is the British military, things might be different in the States.
And of course access in the military to weapons is highly restricted and supervised to a level that would not be possible in civie street.",5,6,topic_stance_votes_1
6,concealed carry,gun control,attack,"yes they do a record check before you enlist. they go deaper if you are in need of a security clearance.
gee, what is wrong with Kansas, and Illinois telling the milatary that the staet know more about how old you should be to get ahold of a gun?

Congratulations, you are in the army! They are considering dropping the high school diploma requirement because they are having trouble filling hteir quotas. They are thinking a GED style entry test instead, or just going off your ADSAP.",7,8,topic_stance_votes_2
8,concealed carry,gun control,attack,"Gah. At least they train you to use the weapons correctly, yes?",8,9,topic_stance_votes_1
9,concealed carry,gun control,attack,"Sigma, depends on the branch. Army soldiers get a less stringent course in training and much more lax qualifying requirements. Marines on the otherhand really enforce marksmanship and have more stringent standards. Yet they give all the new expensive toys to the Army since the Marines have to share a budget with the Navy, go figure.
I'm currently in my 2nd year of college at EKU here in KY. I've considered joining the Marines, and still might in the future. I'm only 19, so I've got time to complete college and then decide whether I want to work at a job or join the military. I really think it's something that all people should go through, just to show them the realities of life and possibly get to see places besides the good 'ol USA.
mathurin, you're treading a thin line when it comes to preventing trouble and asking for it. Unless you can truly prevent something, it's better to retreat, helping anyone along the way, and get proper help or equipment to handle the situation. Either way, courts won't look kindly on you performing 'police' duties and being a civilian, whether you saved someone or not.",9,10,topic_stance_votes_2
10,concealed carry,gun control,attack,In general they train you on the weapon you are going to be carrying. I have a buddy in the army who couldn;t figure out how to load and fire an AK.,9,11,topic_stance_votes_2
11,concealed carry,gun control,support,Wow... A monkey could figure that out!,11,12,topic_stance_votes_2
12,concealed carry,gun control,support,"Actually, it has some signifcant differences from most US made firearms that would hinder you from firing it without a bit of trail and error or priot knowledge. Take the magazine for instance. Most US firearms utilize a straight insert, detent-retention type. AKs on the other hand but be rocked into position. If you insert it straight, it won't fit/lock. Another is the saftery. The main types here are button, thumb lever and garand-style triggerguard. The AK though requires removal of the hand from the grip and to physically move the dust shielf/saftey downward. It's a big object and takes considerable movement to operate, not something an American accustomed to our firearms would realize off-hands since it's complete away from the grip area and an odd shape. Of course, it shouldn't take you too long to figure these features out if you take the time to look over it.",12,13,topic_stance_votes_2
13,concealed carry,gun control,support,You would certainly think so. I believe one of the things they took into consideration when designing it was ease of use for a conscript army. HE was at a total loss as far as attaching the magazine (apparently since there is no real mag well) and the safety eluded him.,12,14,topic_stance_votes_2
14,concealed carry,gun control,support,"the USMC gets short changed by the navy, rember the guys ""signing there checks"" are not reqired to quilifie with there weapons at training. 
how much training also depends on what unit you end up in, i was in a support unit, but i was fireing something at least every 3 mth. i was trained in clearing buildings. 
still there are diffrent rules for weapons handling in comdat from carring in public.",14,15,topic_stance_votes_2
15,concealed carry,gun control,support,"Actually the m14 had a very similar magazine insert as the Kalishnakovs. 30 seconds of playing around and you would figure that out. As far as the saftey. 1. it is a joke. 2. 30 seconds of flipping the lever up to block the action and 2. flipping it down to free the action would cover that ""task"". As far as the mechanics of using your hand in that awful way.. well i would regard the ak as no more difficult in making toast.
That is scary. My WUM-1 came with no instructions and it took me 5 minutes to figure the WHOLE thing out including breakdown and reasemmbally",14,16,topic_stance_votes_2
16,concealed carry,gun control,support,"I was thinking about where I learned to shoot an AK. I am not sure I ever actually did. I just picked the thing up, took a look at it, and all the pieces just kind of fell into place. The safety would pretty obviously be the big switch on he side. There is really no other option. THe mag well could be considered confusing, but if you have a magazine, you should be able to figure out pretty quick how that all goes together. I don;t think anybody ever even told me how to field strip the thing. You pull the top cover and right away shoudl go ""huh, so that't how it works""
It would seem to me that, being in the military, he shoud have had instruction in the proper care and feeding of an AK-47. Odds are, whoever the enemy is, wherever the enemy is, some of them are going to be using an AK or an AK derivitive. It just seems like there are an awful lot of situations in combat where it might be right handy to be able to pick up your enemies gun and use it. You can only carry so much ammo after all.",16,17,topic_stance_votes_2
17,concealed carry,gun control,support,"I spent 4 years in the 82nd airborne, and no one ever mentioned AK’s to us. There was no training with foreign weapons at all.
I don’t have an AK (yet), but is a Saiga 20 near enough? It took a few minutes to figure out loading and unloading, and a few more to dissemble it. The hardest part was getting that top cover off, then it was intuitive.",17,18,topic_stance_votes_2
18,concealed carry,gun control,support,"I have done a lot of international travelling, most of it ouside of europe, and a large portion of it in conflict zones. Wherever you go in the world where there is conflict, you will find the ever reliable AK-47. For years te russians ad chinese gave the things away. They were so popular that the company that built them (and still does to an extent) is going under becasue there are so many of them available ont he surplus market that you can pick them up in sub sahara africa for a $20 bill, including a dozen loaded magazines.
To me, it just seems like it would be common sense to teach our armed forces to use the most popular assault weapon in the world. The M-16 is a good gun, but outside of the US military, and the militaries of nations friendly to the US, the M-16 is a pretty rare weapon. On the modern battlefield, if you bend over and pick up a dead mans weapon, there is a better than average chance that it will be an AK. IT is rediculous that our troops don;t learn to operate one in basic training.
The Saiga 20 is pretty much an AK modified to fire 12 gauge rounds, so yes, it counts. IF you want to improve the performance of the Saiga, you can pop that puppy open in install a rubber bumper pad to speed up the cyclic rate (just like an Uzi). Add a 8 rd magazine and you have one of the better home defense weapons you will ever find (IMHO). THey make a Saiga 20K with a 16.5 inch barrel that would probably be even better than the 20 (which has a 23 inch barrel) for home defense since it would be a little more maneuverable in tight quarters (like a hallway).
I have not had much chance to play with a Saiga. I assume that, since it is the same basic design as an AK, you could open the action, dump in a handful of sand, then load it and fire it just fine, like you can the AK. HAve you had much oppurtunity to try yours out?",18,19,topic_stance_votes_2
19,concealed carry,gun control,support,"I have done some sheet shooting with it. The Saiga 20 is 20 Ga. version. The only problem I have found is you need to use the right length ammo in it. If you try to use 2 3/4"" shells in the 3"" mag it will fail to feed 75% of the time.
I am not going to try dumping sand in it and shooting to satisfy your curiosity

20,concealed carry,gun control,support,"Doesn't the Saiga shotgun have a gas regulator on the gas tube? I believe you have to adjust it for perfect feeding, without abusing the gun of course. There's a site out there specifically for them, with lots of tips and tricks. You can even convert them to a pistol grip following the sunset of the AWB. It just takes 10-or-less import parts, a dremel, and an AK FCG. AR-15.com's AK forum had a step-by-step guide for a 7.62 version.",20,21,topic_stance_votes_2
21,concealed carry,gun control,support,"Duh.....mind fart....the one I have played wiht was a Saiga 12k. Try changing the position of your gas regulator to feed the non mag rounds
Come on! You can do it with a regular AK. What's the worst thing that could happen? Tie it to a tree and a string to the trigger so if it blows apart it doesn;t kill you. Inquiring minds want to know....",20,22,topic_stance_votes_2
