Same-Sex Couples Must Be Allowed To Marry In New York, Court Rules; Lambda Legal Says Decision Is ‘Historic, Well Reasoned and Fair’ 
Lambda Legal brought the case under the state Constitution, saying gay New Yorkers weren’t being treated equally under the law because they couldn’t marry 
(New York, February 4, 2005) — A New York State court ruled today that same-sex couples must be allowed to marry, in a decision that Lambda Legal called “a historic ruling that delivers the state Constitution’s promise of equality to all New Yorkers.” Lambda Legal filed the lawsuit last year, representing five same-sex couples seeking marriage licenses in New York City.
In a 62-page decision issued this morning in New York City, State Supreme Court Justice Doris Ling-Cohan said that the New York State Constitution guarantees basic freedoms to lesbian and gay people – and that those rights are violated when same-sex couples are not allowed to marry. The ruling said the state Constitution requires same-sex couples to have equal access to marriage, and that the couples represented by Lambda Legal must be given marriage licenses.
“I was even more moved than I thought I’d be when I heard about this ruling. All of us cried – me, Mary Jo and our 15-year-old daughter. For the first time, our family is being treated with the respect and dignity that our friends, coworkers and neighbors automatically have,” said Jo-Ann Shain, a 51-year-old New York City resident who is a plaintiff in the case with her partner, Mary Jo Kennedy, 49. “Last week, Mary Jo and I celebrated our 23rd anniversary together, but we’ve never had all the protections and rights that come with marriage. We need these protections to take responsibility for each other and for our daughter, and we are enormously grateful that the court saw that and said our family should be treated equally.”
“This is a historic ruling that delivers the state Constitution’s promise of equality to all New Yorkers,” said Susan Sommer, Supervising Attorney at Lambda Legal and the lead attorney on the case. “The court recognized that unless gay people can marry, they are not being treated equally under the law. Same-sex couples need the protections and security marriage provides, and this ruling says they’re entitled to get them the same way straight couples do.”
In today’s ruling, Justice Ling-Cohan said, “Simply put, marriage is viewed by society as the utmost expression of a couple’s commitment and love. Plaintiffs may now seek this ultimate expression through a civil marriage.” The ruling (which is stayed for 30 days in case the city chooses to appeal) says the New York City clerk may no longer deny marriage licenses to same-sex couples. If the city chooses to appeal the case, it has about a month to file a notice in state appeals court. Justice Ling-Cohan’s ruling also said, “Similar to opposite-sex couples, same-sex couples are entitled to the same fundamental right to follow their hearts and publicly commit to a lifetime partnership with the person of their choosing. The recognition that this fundamental right applies equally to same-sex couples cannot legitimately be said to harm anyone.” 
“This ruling is historic, well reasoned and, above all, fair,” Sommer said. “Our clients got full and fair consideration in this case, which is all we asked for. The court obviously looked carefully at the state Constitution and the rights and protections that same-sex couples were being denied because they couldn’t marry. This decision is grounded solidly in the law and the state’s Constitution.”
Justice Ling-Cohan has been a New York Supreme Court Justice since 2002. Before that, she was a judge in Civil Court for the City of New York for seven years. Voters in Manhattan (in districts including Chinatown and Lower Manhattan) elected her to both positions. When Ling-Cohan ran for the New York Supreme Court, she was the only candidate in a field of 12 who was nominated by four parties, including the Republican and Democratic parties. She received 50,384 votes on the Republican Party line; her support from the Republican Party line was higher than the majority of the other candidates. 
The 2000 U.S. Census counted 594,391 households in the country where same-sex couples live together. Of those, 46,490 (or 7.8 percent of the national total) are in New York State, and 25,906 (or 4.3 percent of the national total) are in New York City. City and state law provides some limited protections and rights to same-sex couples. 
Lambda Legal filed the lawsuit in March 2004 seeking marriage licenses for same-sex couples in New York, arguing that denying marriage to same-sex couples violates the state Constitution’s guarantees of equality, liberty and privacy for all New Yorkers. The case was the first of its kind to be filed in New York since the Massachusetts high court ruled that same-sex couples are entitled to full marriage under that state’s Constitution.
Lambda Legal is currently litigating cases seeking marriage for same-sex couples in New Jersey, California (with NCLR and ACLU) and Washington State (with NWLC). The Washington State Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in that lawsuit on March 8, and a decision is pending from the trial court in the California case. A New Jersey state appeals court heard arguments in that case in December, and a decision is pending. 
Sommer is Lambda Legal’s lead attorney on the case, Hernandez v. Robles. Jeffrey S. Trachtman and Norman C. Simon of the New York City law firm, Kramer Levin, are co-counsel on the case.

Court, and they decide, just like they decide if you really have the ""imaginary"" Rights, which are in the constitution.
However, the entire process of rights is a long, arduous one. Originally, none of the Bill of Rights in the Constituation ever pertained to the people anyway, outside of Federal Intervention. None of them applied to the States. 
This only changed according to the 14th amendment, but even then it was ignored by the courts and said it ""didn't apply to the states."" THey basically ignored what was written.
As the process goes, no one has any rights untill each and every right in the Bill as well as one's not mentioned are brought before courts to make a precedent. This process has been going on from 1897-1972, but has stopped since, and there are 2 more enumerated rights in the Constitution which have not yet gone through the court process which applies Rights Protections to the States, giving people civil liberties.
Right. It matters if the Supreme Court says you have that right, and they most likely will, if they have any scruples.
Don't you love how congress can just redefine marriage without using any reason, logic or justification? It's funny how downhill AMerica has fallen.
So, wanting not to be denied marriage based your sexual orientation is not wrong, is what you are saying =D Bigotry at its best. All citizens are protected under the law for equal treatment. Forcing someone to marry someone else, whom that person has no attraction, or getting nothing, is not equal, just as separate but equal is not equal.
You have the right to marry anyone, as long as that person is the same race as you. :) Yawn, same logic, same tired argument.
Yes. Hopefully they will see silly, unconstituational, immoral laws for what they are.",32,33,topic_stance_votes_1
33,New York State Supreme Court 2-4-05,gay marriage,attack,"I must argue that your understanding of the Constitutional framework is flawed. First, the framers of the Constitution did not intend the Constitution to list out every single protected right of the people. Mosts Federalists were opposed to even having a Bill of Rights because they did not want anyone to construe it as the only rights held by the people. In fact, they specifically put in an ammendment that the Constitution cannot be construed as a list of the only rights held and protected by the people. The Federalists who opposed the Bill of Rights claimed that if no Bill of Rights was present, the government would operate only using the specifically listed powers. If a Bill of Rights was appened, well that is a document which specifically lists out things that a government cannot do. It changes the line of reasoning that people use; it changes them from thinking in terms of what the government CAN do to what the government CANNOT do. The Federalists argued that as long as the people understood that they must only allow the government to do what the Constitution says it CAN do, the the government will be less likely to restrict freedom. The Constitution does not give the government the power to deny freedom, equality, or the rights of the people in any fashion. According to the Constitution, the government has absolutely no power to instute a Defense of Marriage Act.
But the legislature is composed of men who want their policies put into law, just as the judicial branch is, and just as the executive branch is. The framers of the Constitution knew this; they knew that the legislative branch would try to get as much power as it could, even if the Constitution did not give them that power. They knew that the same would hold true of the executive branch and the judicial branch. All three of those branches step outside of the power granted to them by the Constitution. This is why our framers implemented these branches in the first place. By implementing a seperation of powers, it becomes much more difficult for one of those branches to step outside it's realm of power because if it does, the other two branches are free to rise up against it. This does not mean that one of the branches cannot step outside of its power, but it can only do so if the other two branches do not stop it. Each branch is limited in a significant fashion; the house is tied to the opinions of the people while the judicial branch is far removed from the will of the majority but is limited in power compared to the ability to amend the Constitution. It was the hope of the founders that this sort of setup would allow the branches to step outside their realms of power only when there is a morally justified reason for doing so. I feel like I've only given an overview, but going into detail would require far too much room; there is plenty of justification for these branches listed in The Federalist Papers.
So the judicial branch has truly only sort of stepped outside of its realm of power in that it denies the authority of a federal bill which the legislature had no Constitutional authority to pass. Certainly the founders could not have predicted every power the Federal Government would need, nor even most of the powers, so such bills passed by the legislature are not always bad things. It is the job of the Supreme Courts to strike down any laws passed by the government which are immoral and unnecessarily destroy freedom and equality, not those which are merely Unconstitutional. 
None of this necessarily gives the New York Supreme Court the legal authority to overrule a bill passed by the federal government, however I'm pretty certain that the New York Supreme Court is bound by the Constitution of New York. They have decreed that the Constitution of New York allows same-sex marriage, which indicates then that the Constitution of New York is illegal under the current laws of the federal government because it professes that people must recieve equal treatment under the law. I will also argue that although the Supreme Court of New York does not have the legal power to overrule such a declaration, they do have the moral authority to overrule it and that it is their job to step outside the power granted to them by their government in order to perserve freedom, equality, and happiness. The judicial branch of New York exists to protect the freedoms of the people, not to preserve the bills passed by the federal government. It is the job of the people and the other branches of government to overrule a deviant branch of government if it steps outside of the power granted to it without a moral reason for doing so.",32,34,topic_stance_votes_1

Marriage is a union between a woman and a woman or a man and a man.
Following your logic, heterosexuals have exactly the same ability to access this right to marriage as do homosexuals. However, your logic fails, because it's not possible, nor reasonable to force heterosexuals into a homosexual relationship or face the alternative: nothing. OH NO, the Heterosexuals want unequal treatment! BOOOO. Marry the Fags, you all have the same right! Your concession is accepted.
The institutions are not equal if it only allows you to marry people to whom you have no biological connection. YOu fail to comprehend the ability to have a RIghT. To have a right, you must have reasonable access and ability to exercize that Right. Marriage, being a Universal Human Right, is not equally accessible through a mechanism to homosexuals, for it's not biologically sound to force a homosexual to choose between heterosexuals or nothing.
It's wrong to only allow Heterosexuals to marry, and not have an easily accessible, sound mechanism for other Humans, especially when you have no business telling them what they can and cannot do in their private, consentual life.",47,48,topic_stance_votes_1

Sorry, but I don't buy it. Unless you live on a deserted island, there are certain sociatal norms that need to be followed in order for you to live in that society. In India and parts of Asia, if you have to relieve yourself, you cop a squat by the side of the road and do your business. Try that in the US and you'll get arrested and thrown in jail. Why? Because US society has established differing norms of behavior than India and Asia and we accept those norms.
Marriage is highly relevant. Just ask Anna Nicole Smith or Donald Trump's new wife how relevant it is. :)
That's not the definition that our society with its Christian background accepts or condones.
OK, I'll take your argument apart in pieces. 1. What would be the purpose of defining marriage as a homosexual only union? It is anti-biological and an intelligent species understands the need to procreate.
2. If heterosexual marriage was illegal, heterosexuals would live together, have kids and continue on their merry way. They wouldn't be forced to marry a same sex partner any more than gays are forced to marry opposite partners now. They could simply carry on their heterosexual relationship unencumbered just as gays can do today. Your logic doesn't hold up to scrutiny.
First, marriage is not a Universal Human Right. There are many instances in which marriage is prohibited. It isn't an absolute.
Secondly, marriage is defined as one man, one woman. Your attempt to redefine it as something that it hasn't been in Christian societies, since at least the 13th Century, is to argue a ""right"" based on a fallacy.
Just as I can't claim that I don't have to pay income taxes because I'm redefining ""Native American"" as someone born in America, you have to meet certain criteria to become part of a married couple. It's OK to not meet the criteria, it just means that you can't enjoy the benefits of that group, just like I can't enjoy the benefits of being a Native American because I don't meet the criteria for that group. 
Marriage was initially established to protect children and provide for their welfare as well as establish certain rights for the mother with respect to her husband's assets, progeny, etc., 
None of these benefits were intended for same-sex couples because same-sex couples were considered a perversion of nature at the time that our laws were established.

When a society has norms which are social evil, and all probably do, the people are forced to follow those norms, this is true. But we, as a society, have the same responsibility not to be evil that anyone else does. We have the responsibility to realize that our norms are evil and change those norms accordingly.
The idea that we should disallow same-sex marriage simply because it is a norm in society implies that we do not have a reason to deny same-sex marriage except for the norms of the society.

Again, we need to remember that cultural marriage (a ceremony, commitment between a man and woman in love) is the marriage, and the only role the govt. plays is giving of benefits for it. The govt. role isn't the marriage, it's the recognition of the marriage.
It's true that different cultures and periods of time viewed marriage differently. Centuries ago marriage was an aquisition of a wife by a man--women were treated as a glorified form of property. But it could be argued that even then, the one thread through the centuries of marriage is the man/woman dynamic. This should not surprise us, because early on procreation would have set that standard. One could also argue that historical cases of gay relationships were not really marriages, as marriage has pretty much been considered to refer to man/woman relationships.
With that said, we also need to note that benefits as given by the govt. in the U.S. did not take place early on at all. So really, marriage benefits given by the govt. is a fairly recent pehnomenon.

Both arguments are of the same general subject, both arguments are fairly weak in their opposition to allowing same sex marriages. One thread is dealing with the legality and this one has strayed into the rhelm of the biblical. 
Oh darling, I am well versed in the whole Soddam and Gomorrah sham too. Here let me explain:
Genesis 19 describes how two angels visited Sodom and were welcomed into Lot's house. The men of the city gathered around the house and demanded that Lot send the visitors to the mob so that they might know the angels. [The Hebrew verb yada (to know) is ambiguous. It appears 943 times in the Hebrew Scriptures (Old Testament). In only about a dozen of these cases does it refers to sexual activity; it is not clear whether the mob wanted to rape the angels or to meet with them, and perhaps attack them physically. From the context, it is obvious that their mood was not friendly]. Lot refused, but offered his two virgin daughters to be heterosexually raped if that would appease the mob. The offer was declined. God decided to destroy the city because of the wickedness of its inhabitants. The angels urged Lot and his family to flee and to not look back. Unfortunately, Lot's wife looked the wrong way, so God killed her because of her curiosity.
God was apparently not critical of Lot for offering his two daughters to be raped. However, God was angry at the other inhabitants of the town. He destroyed Sodom with fire and brimstone (sulfur). He presumably killed all of the men in the mob, their wives and other adults, as well as children, infants, newborns, etc. It is unclear from these few verses whether God demolished the city because the citizens: 
1. were uncharitable and abusive to strangers 
2. wanted to rape people 
3. engaged in homosexual acts. 
The Church has traditionally accepted the third explanation. In fact, the term sodomy which means anal intercourse is derived from the name of the city, Sodom. But the first explanation is clearly the correct one. As recorded in Matthew 10:14-15 and Luke 10:7-16, Jesus implied that the sin of the people of Sodom was to be inhospitable to strangers. In Ezekeiel 16:48-50, God states clearly that he destroyed Sodom's sins because of their pride, their excess of food while the poor and needy suffered, and worshiped many idols; sexual activity is not even mentioned. Jude disagreed with God; he wrote that Sodom's sins were sexual in nature. Various biblical translations describe the sin as fornication, going after strange flesh, sexual immorality, perverted sensuality, homosexuality, lust of every kind, immoral acts and unnatural lust; you can take your pick.
We are faced with the inescapable and rather amusing conclusion that the condemned activities in Sodom had nothing to do with sodomy.
The story of Sodom and Gomorrah actually condemns inhospitality and idolatry, not homosexuality. Read the Scriptural cross-references: Deuteronomy 29:23, Isaiah 1:9, Jeremiah 23:14, Lamentations 4:6, Ezekiel 16:49-50, Amos 4:11, Zephaniah 2:9, Matthew 10:15 / Luke 10:12, Luke 17:29, Romans 9:29, Jude v.7, Revelation 11:8

Hate to remind you but the story of Soddam and Gomorrah does show that the men left their wives to be with other men. This illustrates ADULTERY above anything else. 
Also, if you want to be picky about mores of the time, homosexualilty between men was widely assumed to mean that one man took on the role of a female, which at the time were concidered lesser beings that even a DOG! 
What the whole issue was was over men allowing themselves to be put in a submissive role.

Think of it--a Biblical reference to an entirely gay city! Forget San Francisco. Forget West Hollywood. Sodom had to have topped 'em all, because every male in the whole friggin' place was gay!

The word ""know"" does NOT only mean to have had sexual intercourse. The problem is in how the word, ""yada"" is translated and interpreted.

Romans 1:26 and 27 clearly speak of same-gender sex by both men and women, the only passage in the New Testament that does so. Rom. 1:18-32 speaks of Gentiles (heterosexuals) who could and should have known and served and given thanks to God but would not, so God gave them up and let them do whatever they wanted to do, and that resulted in degrading and shameful acts, including same-gender sex. It is almost a moot point, but Paul is not listing sins for which God will condemn anyone, he is listing sins that occur because people have forsaken Him.

180,New York State Supreme Court 2-4-05,gay marriage,attack,"Homosexuals are not an oppressed group in the same sense of black people and native americans. This is obvious for two reasons:
1.) They have not experienced anything remotely similar to the suffering of these groups; homosexuals have never been enslaved or forced onto reservations in the U.S. for being gay. They've never been sold on auction blacks for being gay. Homosexuals have never had to drink from their own segregated water fountains or use their own restrooms. The overall economic standard of gay people is basically on par with white anglo-saxon typical Americans--so they haven't suffered economic loss. Mostly what they call ""suffering"" is having to have people look at them funny when they show public affection with another gay person. Hardly suffering. Occassionally there are isolated tragic cases where gay people are harmed and a few have been killed, such as in the case of Matthew Shepard. but such cases of hate killings toward homosexuals are rare. 
2.) Homosexuals are not a group in the sense that there is a cultural ethnicity. Black people, Jews, native Americans, etc. are all ethnic groups. Yet gay pride organizations and activists are trying to portray this small percentage of people who happen to engage in the perversion of sex with people of their own gender the same as an ethnic group. They've basically refused to stop at all costs to portray themselves this way, even though their entire ""common denominator"" is nothing more than their behavior (sex with their own gender), even at the cost of lowering decency standards in our country, porn becoming more prevalent, cheapening the institution of marriage by trying to say their bizarre sexual antics (same-sex) should be called a ""marriage,"" and other things. They are basically trying to piggy-back off of the civil rights movement, using the plight of black people and others to their political advantage. They've put a lot of effort into trying to take all the focus off the obvious fact that it's about what they DO, and tried to make people think it's about a state of being. This is irrelevant, because the behavior is still there and most people view it as, well, disgusting.
Now, let's also note some other things . . .
Have gay people been ""oppressed?"" Yes, in some ways. There are times they are denied jobs because people finding out about their behavior, or denied housing. There are other examples of discrimination that shouldn't be there even though they do engage in behavior that society considers taboo. But let's not buy into the idea that it's on par with the slaves of the 19th century, or the native americans herded up onto reservations. We need to at least be realistic and not overstate things--to put gay people on par with blacks regarding oppression is pretty much an insult to the slaves of the 19th century. So when a group like people who engage in homosex with others has the Bible ""thrown at them,"" it's because of their behavior. But when blacks had the Bible ""thrown at them,"" it was wrongly applied because they were an ethnic group (something that can't be said about people who engage in gay behavior).",174,181,topic_stance_votes_2

Against the Laws of Nature - Romans 1:26 
Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural (physin) relations for unnatural (para physin) ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural (physin) relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another.
Romans 1:26 
In the preceding passage the Greek words physin and paraphysin have been translated to mean natural and unnatural respectively. Contrary to popular belief, the word paraphysin does not mean ""to go against the laws of nature"", but rather implies action which is uncharacteristic for that person. An example of the word paraphysin is used in Romans 11:24, where God acts in an uncharacteristic (paraphysin) way to accept the Gentiles. When the scripture is understood correctly, it seems to imply that it would be unnatural for heterosexuals to live as homosexuals, and for homosexuals to live as heterosexuals.
Now my own thoughts:
I also have a problem with this notion that God could give people over to lusts. How does God give people over to these feelings, that are against their personal nature, if they always had their own free will?

Romans 1:26 and 27, at first glance, appears to condemn gay and lesbian activity. Paul criticizes sexual activity which is against a person's nature or disposition. But in Greek society of the time, homosexuality and bisexuality was regarded as a natural activity for some people. Thus Paul might have been criticizing heterosexuals who were engaged in homosexual activities against their nature. He might not be referring to homosexuals or bisexuals at all.
The verses preceding 26 might indicate that he was referring to sexual acts associated with idol worship. The verse is too vague to be interpreted as a blanket prohibition of all same-sex activities.
ROMANS 1:24-27 
This passage has been used by some Christians to make an issue over how ""unrighteous"" and sinful homosexuals are. In fact, it has been used to support the view that AIDS is the ""penalty of their error which was due."" What is fascinating about this kind of application is that it is totally at odds with what, I believe, Paul was really saying. IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE POINT OF ROMANS CHAPTER ONE YOU MUST READ ROMANS CHAPTERS ONE THROUGH THREE. The outline is as follows: 
I. The Gospel is for EVERYONE, Jews and Gentiles. (1:16) 
II. Why? Because God's wrath is against ALL unrighteousness. (verse 18). 
II. The Gentiles need the Gospel. (1:28-32) The examples of their ""uncleanness"" include idolatry and homosexual acts which are either connected to or resulting from idolatry. 
III. But the Jews are just as unrighteous as the Gentiles. (2:3) 
IV. ""All have sinned"" and are ""justified (made right with God) FREELY by God's grace (unearned love) through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ."" (3:23-24) 
While Paul is certainly not favorable toward the homosexual acts that he is writing about it is interesting to note that Paul classifies them ""unclean"" which is not necessarily a ""moral"" precept. (According to the Holiness Code lobsters and shrimp are ""unclean"" also.) He may be pointing out that though the Jews are different than the Gentiles in that they are ritually ""clean"" (according to the Old Covenant) they are still just as much in need of the grace of the New Covenant. 
Let's look at some of the verses in this section: 
Verse 27b ""And receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due"". Is Paul here saying that those who committed homosexual acts were punished in some physical way...as in venereal disease? Or could ""uncleanness,"" being cut off from the Old Hebrew Covenant, be the penalty of the Gentile's error? 
28 ""And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to adebased mind, to do those things which are not fitting..."" People often take this to mean one of the following things: 
- Since homosexuals didn't retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind. 
- Since the Gentiles were idolatrous God gave them over to a debased mind of homosexuality. However, I believe that Paul was saying the following: 
""Since the Gentiles did not retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a debased mind. The debased mind is NOT homosexuality but a mind that is centered on unrighteousness, hence the listing of what the Gentile mind is full of in verse 29. 
- 29-32 This list of ""unrighteousness"" is being applied to all Gentiles, not Gentiles that commit homosexual sex acts. It is the Gentiles ""who are worthy of death."" These verses are really just an exposition of verse 18. 
- 26-27 Another interesting point to consider is that people often use verse 
- 26-27 to prove that Paul used an argument from ""nature"" to prove that homosexual activity was wrong. However that kind of usage of the word ""nature"" is highly unlikely as Paul usually uses the word ""nature"" or ""natural"" to mean not what ""Mother Nature"" does but instead he means ""the previously accepted common usage"". Nature is not a great teacher about ethics and humans are nowhere called in scripture to emulate it. What is more, homosexual activity DOES go on in the animal world. 
It must be remembered also that Paul was referring to homosexual ACTS, not homosexuals. AND NO ONE KNOWS WHAT HOMOSEXUAL ACTS PAUL WAS TALKING ABOUT... NO ONE KNOWS THE BACKGROUND... We must ask ourselves ""what type of homosexual acts was Paul talking about?"" Was he talking exclusively about homosexual acts connected with idolatry? (Perhaps that was the only kind of homosexual activity he was familiar with.) Was he talking about pederasty? Was he talking about homosexual acts committed with slaves? Was he talking about people of heterosexual orientation committing homosexual acts? Just exactly what type of homosexual acts was he concerned with? Do people have the Right to just ASSUME that these verses were a blanket condemnation of homosexual sex in every context? 
In my personal opinion Paul was referring to same sex sexual acts committed in idolatrous worship by people he regarded as heterosexual. Even the most conservative theologian can only give their opinion as to what type of same sex acts Paul was referring to. No one can state that God clearly condemns all homosexuality activity based upon these verses. It is just too vague. 
As for me, based on the context of Paul's writing in Romans chapters 1-3 I choose to believe that God's New Covenant of grace embraces those who believe in Jesus; being a Jew doesn't make you better than a Gentile; being a heterosexual doesn't make you any better than a homosexual. Romans chapters one through three strike at the very heart of self-righteous pride. It is amazing that some Christians continue to lord their own sense of righteousness over gays and lesbians as if their heterosexual sex acts make them somehow better, or less in need of grace. We are all in need of grace and we ALL have that grace in Jesus Christ.",172,198,topic_stance_votes_1

Aberrant and devient are not interchangable words. Homosexuality is not aberrant because there would first have to be a consus of agreement that heterosexuality was the ""Proper"" course of sexual behavior and identity. 
Since there is a vast disagreement as to what is ""proper"" and in what set of circumstances, ""aberrant"" is not aptly used here. 
Also your assumption that homosexuality ""will always"" be a small percentage of the population is speculative. Since we already know that percentages of certain individuals posessing peticular traits is already a variable to say it ""will always"" be a small percentage cannot accurately be utilized. 
No one suggested it did. Also, your attempt to seperate humans from the animal kingdom on the whole is simply ignorant of fact. Humans are animals.
Then you attempted to suggest that other animals relationships are somehow different than humans...you don't know that...not to mention your assumption is highly speculative.

Gay Marriage hurts society as a whole. Without the sole capability of reproducing, it hampers the growth of society, and further leads to the miseducation that this inert ability to reproduce should be acceptable. (""In Defense of Marriage"", has studies detailing how the basic function of reproducing in society is one of the major causes for social, cultural, and mental development in society).
We MUST preserve tradition. Not take advantage of it, because its weakening. If people slowly stopped celebrating the 4th of July, I'd be damned if a bunch of people suddenly wanted to make it ""Communist Russia Day"" because after all, the 4th of July isn't that popular anyway.
The State rewards normal functioning traditional families, because they function normally in society, contribute to the societies growth, and are a benefit to the country as a whole. A homosexual couple, no matter how hard they try, cannot cultivate the normal productive enviroment a heterosexual couple can.
As with many people against Gay Marriage, I personally have nothing against gay couples or what they do behind closed doors. They may think my style of living is wrong, just as I think theirs is, and they are welcome to do what they want, as long as its not degrading our society.",223,238,topic_stance_votes_2

You are quite free to maintain your concept of your ""marriage"" within your church. But to extend your particular concept into secular law, you do not, in the USA, have that right.
You speak of ""the church"" Which church is ""the"" church?
I can agree with that, as long as those ""clubs"" do not attempt to impose their particular clubs bylaws on society in general.
Unproven speculation. You have presented not one shred of evidence to support such a preposterous assumption.
Where is your evidence of such?
Please provide the source of these supposed studies.
OK. Let's go back to believing the ""traditional"" beliefs that earth is flat and the sun revolves around the earth while we are at it.
Again, idle speculation.
""Red herring"" argument.
So, all those studies that show that same-sex couples are just as good at parenting (through artificial insemination, surrogate motherhood, adoption) as straight couples are all false?
I know of no gay person or couple that believes your style of living (ie.: marriage) is wrong...... for you and your mate. It is just not right for us. It is you who cannot accept that concept. We are in no way degrading society by being different than you are.",238,246,topic_stance_votes_1
