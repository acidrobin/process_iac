SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - California's Assembly on Thursday killed off a bill that would have allowed gay marriage in the nation's most populous state.
The measure, defeated in a third and final vote, mirrored a bill that also failed last year and proposed making marriage in California ""gender-neutral"" and a ""personal relation arising out of a civil contract between two persons.""",0,1,topic_stance_votes_2

10,California lawmakers kill off gay marriage bill,gay marriage,attack,"So you gave us a story by Stanley Kutz. He works for Focus on Family and James dobson. How biased is that? Of course he is going to write such rubbish and twisted statistics. 
read on...
The proponents of same-sex marriage have long argued that committed lesbian and gay couples should have the same legal options as committed straight couples, including marriage. Same-sex marriage opponents have shifted from one argument to another in an effort to find one that can appeal to the increasing number of Americans open to equal rights for gay people. Since the 1990s, opponents have argued that allowing same-sex marriage would undermine the institution of marriage. In recent publications, Hoover Institute scholar Stanley Kurtz has expanded this argument and provided evidence to support it. He argues that Scandinavian ""registered partnerships"", which provide same-sex couples with almost all the same rights and responsibilities as marriage, are ""both an effect and a reinforcing cause of this Scandinavian trend toward unmarried parenthood."" According to Kurtz, ""Once marriage is separated from the idea of parenthood, there seems little reason to deny marriage, or marriage-like partnerships, to same-sex couples. By the same token, once marriage (or a status close to marriage) has been redefined to include same-sex couples, the symbolic separation between marriage and parenthood is confirmed, locked-in, and reinforced.""
Eskridge, Spedale, and Ytterberg dissent from Kurtz's speculative causal link between registered partnerships and what he calls the ""end"" of marriage in Scandinavia. To begin with, the authors question Kurtz's logic. Family law throughout much of the West has, arguably, undermined marriage as an institution by making it easier to exit and by providing civil alternatives with some of the benefits and few of the obligations. But expanding the eligibility of marriage, or a parallel institution, to same-sex couples who want to take on the civil obligations as well as the benefits of marriage does not logically undermine the institution of marriage. More important, the evidence from Scandinavia refutes rather than supports Kurtz's logic. Long-range trends in marriage rates, divorce rates, and nonmarital births either have been unaffected by the advent of same-sex partnerships or have moved in a direction that suggests that the institution of marriage is strengthening. Finally, the authors focus on the security of children in Scandinavia and find none of the ill effects posited by Kurtz.
In a concluding section, Eskridge, Spedale, and Ytterberg raise normative questions relevant to the ongoing search for arguments to deny gay people civil equality. The big loser in such a campaign is marriage. By scapegoating gay marriage (or partnerships) as the ""cause"" of marriage's decline, pseudo-conservatives tend to reinforce the actual causes of the decline - the options straight couples are utilizing, such as no-fault divorce and cohabitation rights.

Study: Gay Unions Don’t Harm Marriage
Conservatives fighting the prospect of gay marriage have been trying to get a lot of milage out of reports (from Stanley Kurtz) that the state of marriage declined dramatically in Scandinavian after gay unions were legalized. The problem is, those reports seem to have been a bit hasty: in reality, the state of marriage is better than it was before. 
Christopher Curtis reports: 
According to [economist Lee Badgett of the University of Massachusetts] ""It is true that the Dutch nonmarital birth rate has been rising steadily since the 1980s, and sometime in the early 1990s the nonmarital birth rate started increasing at a somewhat faster rate. But that acceleration began well before the Netherlands implemented registered partnerships in 1998 and gave same-sex couples the right to marry in 2001."" 
Among Badgett's findings: Heterosexual marriage rates in the Scandinavian country of Denmark actually increased after adoption of same-sex marriage. They are now the highest they have been since the early 1970s. The majority of families with children in Scandinavia and the Netherlands are still headed by married parents. In Norway, 77 percent of couples with children are married and 75 percent of Dutch families with children include married couples. By comparison, 72 percent of U.S. families with children are headed by married couples. Acceptance of same-sex partners has not weakened commitments to children. In fact, the average Scandinavian child spends more than 80 percent of his or her life living with both parents -- more time than the average American child. 
This certainly won’t end the debate on the impact that gay marriages might have on the institution of marriage generally, but if people use this data appropriately it should deflates some of the bluster of conservatives who are convinced that they have hard evidence to support their anti-gay beliefs.""

Senate committee revives bill to legalize gay marriage 
- By BRIAN MELLEY, Associated Press Writer
Tuesday, July 12, 2005 
(07-12) 19:50 PDT SACRAMENTO, (AP) -- 
The quest to legalize gay marriage was revived Tuesday by a Senate committee that approved the measure that was slipped into a fisheries research bill after it failed in the state Assembly.
The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 4-1 in favor of the bill that mirrors one that fell four votes shy last month in the Assembly.
The measure by Assemblyman Mark Leno, D-San Francisco, one of six openly gay members of the Legislature, would make California's marriage laws gender-neutral as the issue is headed for the state's highest court.
Sen. Sheila Kuehl, D-Santa Monica, who said she was speaking in support of the bill as a lesbian and not as a senator, said the bill reflects the civil rights issue of the day.
""Our community's in the middle of the griddle and I'm proud of it,"" Kuehl said.
Opponent Randy Thomasson, who has proposed a constitutional amendment for next year's ballot that would outlaw gay marriage and remove most of the benefits of domestic partnerships, said the bill smacked of an abuse of process.
""This is really a no-brainer,"" Thomasson testified. ""It's sad when it was defeated in one house it was reincarnated here.""
Leno was able to keep the issue alive by persuading another lawmaker to let him gut and amend a bill that passed the Assembly that aimed to collect information from fisherman. He replaced it with the language from his gay marriage bill. He defended the move by saying his bill had already passed Assembly committees and would now face public votes in the Senate.
""I understand there is at times a nefarious reputation to the gut and amend process,"" Leno said. ""That is, rightfully, when it is used at the end of the session, sometimes in the dark of the night when public hearings are short circuited. Nothing could be further from the truth with this bill.""
Leno's bill would amend the state family code to define marriage between ""two persons"" instead of between a man and a woman. It faces a vote in another Senate committee as soon as next month. If the full Senate passes the bill, it would be the first legislative body in the nation to approve a gay marriage bill.
It took a court order last year for Massachusetts to become the first state in the nation to legalize same-sex marriage.
Leno said he still would need to round up three votes in the Assembly if it makes it through the Senate. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a moderate Republican, has not taken a stand on the bill, but has said voters or judges, not lawmakers, should make such social changes.
Republican opponents have argued that the issue was decided five years ago by state voters who approved a ballot initiative prohibiting the state from recognizing same-sex marriages.
However, a state judge in San Francisco ruled in March that state laws prohibiting gays from marrying are unconstitutional and the issue is likely to end up before the California Supreme Court in the next year.
While representatives of several civil rights groups spoke in favor of the bill, hundreds of opponents crowded in a Capitol hallway waiting for their turn to speak against it. Scores of the bill's foes, many from the Russian and Ukrainian communities in the Sacramento metropolitan area, added their voices in opposition, including one man who addressed the committee entirely in his native tongue.
