Why God Likes Atheists Best
Wurt Keinheimer
First of all, atheists aren't always asking God for stuff. YOu don't hear atheists going around saying ""Oh God, please give me a Sony Play Station!"" or ""Dear Lord, please don't let me lose my erection now!"" or Heavenly Father, don't let my daughter get a nipple ring!""
I mean, think about it from God's point of view. He listens to that kind of stuff, and lots worse, from His believers twenty-four hours a day, three hundred and sixty-five days a year, millennium after millenium, no weekends off, no vacations and no overtime pay. After a while that has got to get old. So God probably really appreciates His atheists for procurring their own Sony Play Stations and erections and whatnot.
But that's not the only reason God likes atheists best. He also really digs it that atheists don't go around gossiping and spreading rumours about Him like His believers are always doing. You don't hear atheists talking about how God is this kind of guy or that kind of guy, or how God caused this terrible event or did thus-and-such to so-and-so.
Heck! How would you feel if everybody and their brother was spouting off about what you did or why you do the things you do? Cuz you know it all gets back to Him in the end, right? After all, he is God.
I figure one of these days He's gonna come looking for everybody that's been spreading rumours and gossip about Him. He'll come down from Heaven and round up all the Baptists and Rosicrucians and Hindus and Buddhists and Jews and Moonies and Quakers and Shakers and Episcopalians and all His other believers. Then He'll gather them unto him in the Sky Dome in Toronto and really let them have it!
He'll say, ""Who do you think you are, talking about me behind my back? Who are you to say Who I am? How dare you define Me?!""
Now, you gotta figure those blievers are gonna be feeling pretty embarrassed when He confronts them that way and they'll probably go all quiet and sheepish and contrite. So, being a skilled orator, God will no doubt seize the opportunity of the silence in the Sky Dome to press His point, verily saying, ""From now on, mind your own business, like My atheists do. You take care of the human stuff. I'll take care of the God stuff. And if I ever need you to define me, which is highly unlikely, I will let you know. Till then, just keep your mouth shut about Me.""
Of course, being God, He might word it a bit differently but I'm sure that would be the gist of His Message. And boy oh boy! Wouldn't you love to be there to hear Him give His Message? I know I would. But, being an atheist, I might not be invited. At the very least, God probably won't be sending me complimentary tickets to that particular Sky Dome event. But hey, I figure that's why he created ticket scalpers.
Anyway, there's another reason God likes atheists best. In His guise as God the Father, arguably the best parent ever, He's gotta love the self-reliant independence of His athiest offspring. He's gotta adore the fact that His atheist kids stand on thier own two feet and aren't forever tied to His spiritual apron springs. And it must be no small comfort to Him that His atheist boys and girls don't blame Him for their failures and don't expect Him to provide for their successes. Heck! He must feel immense pride and relief that His athesit progeny take responsibility for their own actions and realize that their own actions are the only thing they have to make the world a better place.
Dang! Is it any wonder God likes atheists bests? Of course not. It's only logical. Besides, I'm an atheist, so I know on a level beyond logic, that atheists are His favourites, His chosen people, His representatives on earth. 
After all, I just created this God for the purposes of this essay and I'd have to be crazy not to have Him like me best. Wouldn't I?",0,1,topic_stance_votes_1

7,Why God Likes Atheists Best,existence of God,attack,There are two kinds of people that can follow the teachings of the Christ. One follows: Because he walked on water; Walked out of his grave; Holds the keys to hell itself. The other follows the man because of the value he placed in his teachings.

10,Why God Likes Atheists Best,existence of God,support,"No, not true at all. G-d desires for us to willingly love Him suprememly and for our lives to be guided by Him just as any earthly father would guide his own children.

11,Why God Likes Atheists Best,existence of God,support,"OK, I'm opening myself up to the religion forum because I've been thinking about this stuff a lot recently, and Bassman, your post sums up in many ways what my thoughts have been about.
You say atheists 'reject' God and 'choose to end up in hell'. I find this idea completely illogical.
There has never been a choice, in my mind. 
To give you some background, my parents are irreligious*, and my grandparents are devout CofE Christians. I went to Sunday School. I mentioned this in one of EDO's threads. I had my own 'revelation' at a very early age, and the concept of 'organised religion' has been, to put it bluntly, laughable to me ever since. I have (and still do) occasionally leaned towards versions of Deism but nothing else.
This has never been a conscious choice. This has been a process of deduction and rationalisation since as far back as I can remember. I tell you honestly, as much as it is a cliche, I could no more believe in the Christian God (or any other specific God) than I could in Santa Claus or Russell's Teapot.
So I have two questions for you, to start this off:
1)How does your belief system respond to what I've said (I'm sure you've heard it before)
2)Do you remember making a conscious choice to have faith?
*Best adjective I can come up with: They're definitely not religious, but I wouldn't say they're atheists either. I've had a couple of talks with them about it and they just don't seem to really think about it, it doesn't impinge on their world as something that requires thought. They are children of the 60s so maybe that has something to do with it, but regardless, they both had a 'religious upbringing' and they both see religion as something unnecessary and foreign. Not foreign in a bad way, just something that isn't part of their life.",11,12,topic_stance_votes_2
12,Why God Likes Atheists Best,existence of God,support,"I was raised Christian myself and even wanted to be a minister in my later teen years. When asked if I where Christian, I would announce with a great deal of pride that I am a born again Baptist Christian.
Having a religion is a great deal like a marriage times ten. When you’re in it, you are blinded by the beliefs and even if you read or see evidence against your respective faith, it has no effect on you. In a bad marriage, you have to walk in on your wife cheating to finally wake up. And basically; I was woken up in such a way. I made the mistake of listening to a religious debate where a Jewish man stated; “I can not believe in a God that would send bears in to kill children for making fun of a Profit!” That one statement crushed my world. The odd thing about it? I read the whole bible with blind faith and never even considered to question the acts in it.
This was a very painful period in my life. It caused me to question everything I knew. I re-read the bible slowly with an open mind and used logic and questioning to determine if what I had based my life on had any real merit. Now I don’t recommend this to anyone. Loosing your faith is a horrible ordeal that will cause fear and pain with many sleepless nights. I would equate it to coming off heroine (Not any real clue what heroine that is like).",12,13,topic_stance_votes_2
13,Why God Likes Atheists Best,existence of God,attack,"Absolutely reprehensible comment. How in the same breath can you say that God desires us to willingly love him, and if we don't, he will consign us to hell for an eternity of torture? And it would have been our choice! What madness.

And if Christ was a complete sacrifice for our sins, shouldn't he be suffering for an eternity as that would be the only logical propitiatory sacrifice, seeing that Adam has been condemned for eternity?
So if some people die and go to hell, that means they've been judged. What, therefore, is the purpose of the general resurrection? Condemned souls coming out of hell? Or pulled out of heaven? What is the state, and where as those who will be resurrected?",15,17,topic_stance_votes_1

20,Why God Likes Atheists Best,existence of God,support,"Bassman, you're still avoiding answering the questions. Your interpretation of Revelation does nothing in this regard. What sort of god wants people to willingly love him, only to torture for eternity those that don't? No longer is it willingness, but compulsion out of fear.
Hence the hold that Christianity has on the gullible.

Millions of people are neither gullible nor stupid, yet they are devout believers in Christianity, Islam, Judaism or whatever
Their beliefs are sincerely and honestly held.
They are usually sensible enough to believe that the Bible is not literally correct. They do take its teaching seriously, they do believe in God and the hereafter.
Yet in your arrogance they are all dismissed as simple-minded",21,22,topic_stance_votes_2
22,Why God Likes Atheists Best,existence of God,attack,"So how should one address people who believe in fairytales? Just because beliefs are sincerely held does not in the slightest make them valid.
I don't know that any non-believer sets out deliberately to insult; it's rather a case of seeing otherwise sensible people being led astray by myth and the feelings that come from that.
I'm glad you said that some people are usually sensible enough not to take all the Bible literally. But the same 'sensible' people can just as easily shout down 'fundies' for their literalistic interpretations. We then see Christians at each other's throats. Yup. Very sensible.
So if the Bible is the word of God, why are there 'fundies' and non-fundies? And that is one reason why some of us here see such nonsense in religion.

The kernel of morality is in fine print on the backside of the greeting card.
A better idea would be to simply teach the whole ear of corn's worth of morality and use more apt object lessons relevant to todays time.
There are strong simularities between St. Nick and the Christ. The only difference seems to be to what length people are willing to take the ruse and how much emphasis they want to put on the story.
St. Nick, aka Santa Clause, could very well become a diety worshiped by billions.
Today, we belive we know that that simply is silly.
