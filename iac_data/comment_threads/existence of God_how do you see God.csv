2,how do you see God,existence of God,support,"Hi Matthew,
I voted for #1 because that's who my heavenly Father is, unconditional Love. But He is also a Holy God and a Jealous God who wants the relationship with us that He created us for. God wont compromise and requires obedience from His children. Have you read where it say's that ""God chastens those whom He Loves"" ? That means that as a parent will punish and correct a child they love, so will our heavenly Father. I know I have been corrected by Him on many occassions. 
God is a personal God who is interested in and actively involved in my life. He is with me every moment of every day and cares about the smallest decision I must make in life. Before I received jesus as my Savior I couldn't even read the bible because it made no sense to me. Immediately after receiving Him, I understood the Word of God clearly because apart from Christ, we are blind and deaf to the truths of God. I felt the Holy Spirit come into me and I was filled with new life which is what being born again means. From that moment on I have been an alien in this World and alive in Christ with the ability to understand and comprehend spiritual insights that never even existed to me prior to being born again.
I knew that all my sins were forgiven and that I had received the free gift of salvation that jesus died on the Cross for. This is real, it is life and it is why we are here. And it doesn't matter what sins we have commited Matt, because Jesus died for ALL of them. ""For all have sinned and fall short of the Glory of God, not one is worthy, not even one"". ""It is by Grace that we are saved and not by works, so that no man should boast, it is a free gift of God"".",1,3,topic_stance_votes_2

The bible is the LIVING WORD of GOD and can only be understood fully by those who know Him personally. It's giberish to all others. Also, why do you exist ? Why was man created in the first place ? That question haunted me as a young teen. I wanted to know the reason for my life, what is the reason I live ? He answered those questions for me so now I know that I come from Royal Lineage and am a child of a King of Kings and Lord of Lords. I'm not an orphan who is lost as I was before knowing I was unconditionally loved by my Father in Heaven.
Your view of the God of the OT is very skewed my friend. But it will take a lot more time than this forum allows to deal with the culture, conflicts and sense of justice that existed then in comparison to our modern way of thinking. Imagine if we could take the most barbaric heathen from 4000 years ago, take them around on a 2 week tour and show them the hi-tech modern, efficient methods, and the actual fetuses of the 6000 human babies we so effectively abort each day in this Country alone. Do you think they would consider their time more or less barbaric than ours ?
It is all relative to our perspective Matt, so from the perspective of the Age of Grace, the Age of the Law seemed harsh. But don't forget that the same God who gave us the Age of the Law, also gave us the Age of Grace which we currently reside in. And you can thank what Jesus did for this Age.",6,8,topic_stance_votes_2

I respectfully disagree, however, that not knowing why we exist makes life meaningless. I have no idea why we have come to be what we are. I suspect there really is no reason and I don’t have a problem with that in the least. I don’t find that difficult to comprehend, nor do I think it is a cause for despair. It doesn’t change the amazing “outcome” for me, no matter how or why we got here.
I think things are pretty wonderful the way they are, even if I am not royalty. The world is pretty amazing on its own.

16,how do you see God,existence of God,support,"No Matt, that's not what I'm saying at all. The truths and principles in the OT still stand up today and always will. Some of the customs and traditions of that period no longer apply but the OT never promoted those customs and traditions as eternal standards to live by.
I'm not going to defend or attempt to justify how other believers interpret the bible Matt. But I told you on another forum as well as this one that God loves you in spite of your homosexuality. Maybe sharing of my own shortcomings will help you to understand how God doesn't compromise with any of us where sin is involved. 8 months after getting saved God told me very clearly in a word of knowledge, ie prophetic utterance to quit smoking cigs and He would use me in a powerful way. Dont quit and I would fall away for 30 years and stumble into other sins of the flesh due to my disobedience in that one area.
I screamed no Lord, I'll never deny or turn away from you. Needless to say, I wasted 30 years of my life struggling with sins of the flesh and cigs until 2 years ago when I was miraculously delivered from my addictions. But before I was delivered I had to finally put those cigarettes down and finally trust God to see me through the withdrawals. I also suffered from lust, pot smoking and drinking. Basically my personal life was a mess and I was miserable. Today I am free of all addictions and am finally living the victorious God always intended for me. 
The point is that as long as I lived in disobedience to God's will, He would never allow me to move to the next level of spiritual growth. That night two years ago He showed me that I was grieving the Holy Spirit which indwells me and was in jeopardy of being given over to a reprobate mind. He showed me how on one hand I had His unconditional Love while on the other hand, I was sacrificing that Love for cigs, beer, and a little pot that quenched the Spirit within me. Finally I saw what a waste it was compared to His Eternal Glory and Love and the rest is history, I was delivered.
The gay community continues to blame and demonize the Christian/ evangelical community for insisting that in order for gays to get right with God, they must give up their lascivious ways. It is exactly the same way for we straight people. We must live apart from acts of lust, adultery, orgies, and equally lascivious though heterosexual behavior. Your problem is with God my friend, not me or the Christian community. I lived with a friend who was a guy in Utah for 2 years once, without sinning once with him. 
You see Matt, I think your constant threads about spiritual questions and God is strong evidence that He is reaching out to you in a big way. And you are open to His voice and spirit in equally as big a way. You also know that the things I say are true and honest beliefs spoken without personal motive or private agenda. I know you dont want to hear this part, but submit to Him as your heart is telling you to. Worry about working out the next step after that. But first accept the lords salvation that is available to you and He will guide you into all understanding regarding your future with Him. And know that He will never lose or forsake you.",16,17,topic_stance_votes_2

21,how do you see God,existence of God,support,"Exactly! Being gay and having gay sex may not have been an acceptable custom to those who needed childern in an agricultual scoiety. Levitical law has no place in our culture. Also in a culture that considered women property and slaves to men anything that made a man a woman would be shunned. Once again not relevant to our culture.
Yet they are not asked to give up being heterosexual. The church is asking gay people to give up a God given part of themselves. That is why we demonize certain religious sects because they would make us something God did not intend us to be heterosexual. What kind of God creates His children a certain way then punishes them for who He created them to be. That is insane. That is like if I have a child with blue eyes I am going to beat him and disown him because of his blue eyes or saying that the only way I would love that child is to have him cut out his blue eyes or ware color correcting contacts.
Well then you will understand that I too have had a ""prophetic utterance"" when He showed me that my gayness was His gift to me to be cherished and celebrated. That my husband is His gift to me and He blesses our marriage. I also have come to understand that you are right the Holy Spirit is working hard to change the hearts of those who have hardened their hearts towards gay people and do not accept us as full children of God; created just as He created us.

Look at the panic taking place in Russia and Europe where the birth to death ratio is reaching zero. They fear that within one generation they wont have a new generation of workers to replace the retiring generation od seniors. Why do you think that the consequences of our sins are less serious today than they were 4500 years ago ? 
You assume much my friend. If being gay was God given then He never would have condemned it in the bible. And it isn't the Church that is asking people to give up being gay, it is just upholding what it believes God's will is pertaining to sinful acts of the flesh. Just like the church condemns adultery for straight people. It's no different to God.
I know this is going to hurt you, but it needs to be pointed out. Did God make Mentally Retarded Children as they are ? Or Mongoloids ? Or the Physically Handicapped ? Or Children born with diseases that devalue the quality of their lives ? Or are these handicaps the result of our fallen natures. And most importantly, doesn't God love each of these people equally in spite of the physical maladies that afflict them ? So I dont believe it was Gods will that a small percentage of humanity should be gay, approximately 5%. But neither did he choose that I should be born with a deviated septum. Either way He still loves us equally in spite of our flaws. But that doesn't mean He created us this way. It means He allowed us to live in spite of our flaws.
If you are right and aren't deceiving yourself then I applaud your epiphany. And I will praise God in eternity for His truth and His grace regarding the homosexual condition. But I submit you are hoping your beliefs are correct but know nothing of the kind for certain. Don't fight God my friend. Receive Him and be saved, both you and your significant other. Seek His will for your lives and trust Him to guide you both into understanding His will for your lives. He will never leave you or forsake you Matt. He died for you because He loves you more than life itself.
Why would I care how others perceive me when I know that I am following the God of all Creation ? And if at the end of life it is found that I am right to believe my God and to take His Word literally, is that the definition of a fanatic ? I dont think so.

Or maybe you use the usual response to this, that He ""allowed"" it to happen--knowing all along that it would.

But our world isn't so simple. There is not only one possible outcome of God allowing us to have free will. There is a potentially infinite number of outcomes.

40,how do you see God,existence of God,attack,"Jyoshu, I’m not jabbing at you by any means. In no way do I consider you a radical. The point is we can’t assign blame to God for the carnal aspects of our lives. There is a reason God made the earth and all the physical laws that we have to abide by. We are here to overcome whatever it is, and those things that we can’t overcome, we have to ask for help from Him, which He already promised to take care of. Just because I fell off a building and died, doesn’t mean God did it or allowed it. I just didn’t watch where I was going.
The ""radical religionist"" part stems from all the ""God made me this way"" nonsense, which is not so. We are the ones that shape our lives by the choices we make. Just like the retarded boy next door, for example – God didn’t do that horrible thing, which not only affects him, but also his parents, siblings, other family members in a detrimental fashion. That retarded boy will never overcome that, but God uses that natural occurrence for those of us that do understand the way of things. Christ said He couldn’t spare us from these things, but that He has a way out through Him because He has already overcome the world (John 16:33). When that boy’s parents understand that their son’s troubles will spare a soul from the tribulations of this world, and that Christ can spare theirs, then they can have peace. So many – too many – people point a finger at God for the natural occurrences of life. A kid suffers at the hand of a child predator, not the wishes, wants, or allowances of God.

I am alluding to other things there but that statement is not really that material to the argument. If the christian God is as described in the bible (and lets face it, if we are talking about the christian god then we have to accept the bible as the authority on his nature, we have little other choice), then for me to say He is inconsistent or unloving is a little like a painting complaining about the painters skills.

59,how do you see God,existence of God,attack,"Maybe I should start another thread about this, but it seems relevant here, so here it goes.
Here, in a nutshell, is the problem with the idea that God is in control of everything, or to blame for everything, or behind everything. Whatever phrase you want to use.
If this is so, it means that God has already chosen who will ""choose"" him and be saved, and those that will not ""choose"" him and go to hell. If, as in this situation, we do not have any control over our own outcome, then there can be no criterion by which to choose who goes to heaven and who goes to hell. This means that it has to be chosen arbitrarily. To use Calvin's own imagery, God is holding everyone in his hands over the fires of hell and letting some slip through his fingers. The idea that God is arbitrary runs completely counter to the idea that God is entirely purposeful and deliberate.
Free will is what gives life, and this world, purpose. Otherwise, we are just unknowing cogs in a machine, unknowing players in a twisted, cosmic, tragic comedy.
Determinism, or whatever phrase you prefer to use, makes God arbitrary and life meaningless. Does this sound like the kind of God you believe in or would want to believe in?",59,60,topic_stance_votes_1

I agree except for the part where you link ""in control"" and ""blame"" as being the same.
He can be in control and still not cause bad things to happen. Because He is in control, He will not interfere with our choices. If He had preset my outcome from birth, then how am I to truly choose? And if He preset those things that directly affect me, then how can I overcome adversity. Because He is in control, I am permitted to make mistakes, or become successful.
If He can't change things, then prayer would be an exercise in futility.

It is better than most evidence we use when referring to other historical events of this antiquity. The sheer volume of documentation is overwhelming concerning the bible. There are other things too.
It is very consistent of a God who is love, and who wants love (freely given love) to show people that they are not able to do it on thier own. Hence the purpose fo the law. It was there to show people the need for god. God has always said that belief in him is what leads to justification. Even in the old testament when Abraham (then abram) is told that Sarah (then sarai) will bear him a son (even in their ninetys) it says ""and abram believed god and he was declared righteous."" This happens before abram tries to have a son or sacrifice his son or any of that. He merely believed. God called him righteous. 
NOw, in the new testament, God sends his own son so that ""whosoever"" should believe in him would be saved. I find this remarkably consistent.

71,how do you see God,existence of God,attack,"In a manner, yes, love. However, remember that love is defined by God and he defines it using the law. If we keep all those commandments then it is considered love. 
NOw don't get me wrong, I am not saying that plenty of people don't love and are not christian (did I throw enough negatives in that sentence?). People who are not christian and do not believe in God do loving things. But that is not the same thing, doctrinely or theologically that we are talking about. There are a number of greek words for love. The kind of love where we do loving things for others is called Philadelpia. Translated brotherly love. (yes that is why the city is named that way. There are lots of biblical named cities in PA, bethlehem for instance). The kind of love we are discussing the greeks used the word AGAPE for. Unconditional love. Love completely without regard to self. Love for ones enemies.
The christian doctrine is that Jesus said ""love your enemies."" He asked what profit is there if a person loves their friends. His words were ""Don't even the gentiles do this?"" His point being that non believers do that. They Philadelphia their friends. Jesus also said, a good man would die for his friends. But Jesus died while people were still his enemy (that is somewhere in the bible but I cannot locate it at the moment). For those who hated them. His words at the cross, ""Father forgive them for they know not what they do."" This was for those that were nailing his hands to the crossbeam and his feet to the longer part. Imagine that for yourself if you can?
Imagine the person that you dislike the very most in this world. Imagine a molester or rapist or murder and saying, ""I will gladly take their punishment so that they can go free. And oh, by the way, I am going to do it whether or not they accept it, so it all may be in vain.""
When you see all the rules and laws of the old testament you clearly see a god that was ""perfect"".
Next we get into the things god commanded including killing women and children. God is not only love, he is also justice. Would you want a God that did not act justly? No one would say, I want a god who will let anyone in at anytime no matter what they did. It does not matter. 
God does not just save everyone according to the christian doctrine. He made for payment of the necessary penalty so that those that accept it can receive it freely. However, some may choose not to accept it and then they will be held to the standard the christian god has defined.
Others who are more trained in this may feel free to correct me where I am wrong. This is just my understanding of it.

Let me just ask you this question to consider. If I insisted that I'm a spirit filled Christian who was receiving Prophetic Words of Knowledge from God while at the same time openly having an adulterous affair which is clearly against Gods will, would you encourage my walk with Christ as it stands, or would you call me a flaming hypocrite ? You'd call me an obvious hypocrite.
Gaetano:
The situation of adultery involves a victim or victims. That's why it is wrong. People are suffering as a result of that behavior. I am talking about the spouse or spouses that are being cheated on.
Archangel: 
Then why do you insist that just because you're gay you deserve a pass on Gods standing statutes regarding morality and submission to His Holiness and Perfect Will for us ?
Gaetano:
Perfect will for us? Who is us? Maybe you are referring to you? For gay people submission to his holiness is celebacy. You are welcomed and encouraged to experience sex and romance within the confines of your blessed marriage. Why wouldn't someone who is gay insist on a pass, you got one did you not? Why is that? Does your attraction and/or marriage to a member of the opposite sex cure cancer or create jobs? Does it stop wars or global warming?
Will it help you to realize that your god is blatantly unfair to those who are homosexual? The answer is no to all of the above. Matthew has said repeatedly that his sexuality is a gift from god.

80,how do you see God,existence of God,support,"Actually, I did read. The declaration of righteousness comes far before the action. Only after belief. There is no where in this section that shows that abram did anything other than believe god. In particluar see verse 6In fact, the entire section shows clearly that this was initiated and completed by God:
In fact the hebrew word for ""believed"" is (transliterated because I cannot put in the actual hebrew text) aman. This word means to ""trust or believe"" and has the connotation of a baby being carried by a nurse. It is completely independent of any action. Please note that the ""He"" in verse six is capitalized and therefore refers to God and the word ""lord"" is the actual name of God (tansliterated Yahweh) or spelled YHWY.
This cannot be a more clear example of God's action without requirement of human response. It is pure graciousness.
This sectino comes after Abram's first child is born through Hagar. God is telling him that child will not be his heir but rather another. I believe abram was already well into his nineties at this time.
