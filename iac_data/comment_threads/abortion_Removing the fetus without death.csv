Assume that there is a way to abort/remove/extract the fetus from a woman without killing it
As a pro lifer would that be acceptable?
As a pro choicer would you feel that still respects the womanâ€™s body?

The big question is one more of could we do it on the nessary scale when there really isn't the demand or funding availble.

When have you ever heard a pro lifer on these threads mention what plan they have for the fetus after it has been saved from its near fatal proceedure.
It is clear to me after reading many of the pro-life arguments that their position is in no way one that is arrived at thru concern for the life they want to save. It is simply arrived at thru dogma and self centered self importance. They have a distinct need to prove to others that they are more moral, or more godly than the person they are disagreeing with.

3,Removing the fetus without death,abortion,attack,"I was approached with this arguement myself once. The one about what the pro-lifers are doing to provide for the unwanted babies.
I would answer this way. It is much healthier to have a C-Section or a natural birth than an abortion. The methods used for such things are always harmful, emotionally and physically to the mother. I would say that if they don't want the baby, than let it live and then put him up for adoption. Many girls and women who have abortions know about the pain and suffering they go through in such operations, and they're much more willing (after the abortion) to provide for a baby till it's born; unless they're an irresponsible person who lives for sex and uses abortion as a way out.
They know it's wrong, and the feeling of guilt which almost never leaves them is an emotional ball and chain they need to carry around for years and sometimes the rest of their life.
There are orphanges and other institutions that will take care of a child. And believe me, there are plenty of people out there waiting to adopt a baby more than anything.

6,Removing the fetus without death,abortion,attack,"Some would say the same about pregnancy as well, and there is no way you are telling me that cutting someone open is less harmful to a mother than having an abortion. If this were the case then this is how it would be done. Abortion may be harmful in some cases but it is just plain wrong to say it is more harmful, especially if you take into account possible physical and 'emotional' damage during pregnancy as well. If you are going to claim something like this, you need to back it up with stats - at the very least the rates of postnatal depression vs similar post abortion depression and the risk of death and injury from an abortion compared to the same from 9 months pregnancy and birth (which whilts unequal will still favour abortion slightly).
No one lives for sex and uses abortion as a way out, or perhaps someone does, but then they are monumentally stupid. I'd say that it is better to prevent suffering than risk it unnessarily. An early fetus is incapable of feeling anything, there is nothing you can do to it that will make it suffer in any way, why turn dumb matter into an unwanted child if it harms no one? Later stages of pregnancy I have no problem with protecting, its suddenly changed from a growing set of cells into something that is aware of what is done to it at which point I would recognise that it deserves protection and the best chance of a pleasant continued existance as possible.
Someone who doesn't agree with abortion might feel this, but you need to back it up otherwise. We have no problem with ending billions of lives over the course of our lives, if we don't think that they matter (cooking and even having food, having an immune system, disinfectants etc). If you don't recognise the organism as something worth worrying about, why would you? I say that its more likely that its more an embarrasment for most people than a feeling that they have killed someone (though to be fair, I can't back that up).
If its white and a baby. There are far more unwanted children, even if we exclude aborted feti, than there are potential adopters. 
Nor will there be economic upheaval if there isn't (though there will probably be some regardless soon). Honestly though, do you think you would care more if it were blacks or jews being killed rather than feti and embryos? I'd certainly hope so...if you condemn abortion clinic bombers you are setting a certain double standard. 
I just don't think that a potential person can ever outweigh the wants and needs of an existing one, and 99% of the time pro-lifers agree. Soon as you realise that its not actually 'babies' being aborted then its a lot harder I think to hold a universally pro-choice opinion",4,7,topic_stance_votes_2

You can find the testimonies of many women and girls who have had abortions there.
You have presumed a couple things in your post, and I wish that you would slow down on the assumptions that come into your mind. My views on abortions do not differ between the race of the mother or child. And I certainly do not feel guilty about killing animals for meat. And you will not try and equivocate the killing of animals with the killing of humans in this debate. That's a ridiculous arguement and not one to bring up in such an issue as this.

Check that site. And if you're talking about something other than animals, let me know. But please, if you are, do not try and bring that up. The killing of animals for meat is hardly something to talk about in an abortion issue.
My Mom was a qualified nurse, and she's told me that it does indeed harm the woman much more to have an abortion. Sucking the fetus out and pills and things that create toxic environments for the baby in order to kill it not only hurts the mother physically and psychologically, but any of those methods may harm her fertility as well as give her extreme pain many weeks afterwards. My Mom had eleven children, and she never felt extreme pain so long after giving birth. You want you're proof, there it is.

As I've already told you, it does harm people, and believe me, there are many monumentally stupid people out there already.
Perhaps if you were unconscious (or in a coma) and I shot and killed you simply because I was your Dad and didn't want to support you, do you honestly think that an arguement like ""She couldn't feel anything, what's the harm?"" would stand? No way!
--Why turn dumb matter into an unwanted child if it harms no one?--
Because the irresponsible girl or women who didn't consider this before they had sex is obligated to take care of it. The father issue is another thing, but the mom is solely responsible for that kid. And a kid is not dumb matter. You yourself could not arise from dumb matter (define dumb matter) you arose from a living person, you were a living person when you were in your mom, and you're a living person as you read this text.
And are you saying that putting kids in orphanages is worse than killing them simply because they MIGHT be unwanted?",7,9,topic_stance_votes_1

13,Removing the fetus without death,abortion,attack,"Numbers, not testimonies. Medical statistics I will trust, you are just dealing with a small sample of people who have had abortions. Where we to just use that I'd point to the vast difference in the number of abortions conducted and the number of testimonies there and say that clearly its a minority who has a problem - which is clearly pointless
Without looking at actual statistics of how many people suffer unjury through abortion and how many are treated for depression etc (and weren't suffering before) we can't say anything conclusive either way.
You missed the point, if I don't consider a fetus a person, then why should I care about it more than something else. Life itself isn't special and despite hundreds of debates here no one has been able to define human (as its term for a category of things that don't really exist). Feel free to have a go if you like though, I just think a mind is the thing that matters, I don't see why comparing DNA between things is relevant.
That isn't proof, child birth can cause huge amounts of problems both physiologically and psychologically - it just isn't serious very often. Without the statistics you can't say which is worse or how often there is no difference.
You've said it can harm you, not that it does with any regularity or that it harms you anymore than a pregnancy or birth will.
I afraid that's a ridiculous arguement and not one to bring up in such an issue as this. Not only would I be showing some kinds of brain activity in a coma (which doesn't nessarily mean brain dead) but there are other factors involved as well based on what other people want not to mention that there is a difference between something that has never had a brain and someone who is asleep. It might worry you to know that if you end up brain dead on life support then you will most likely get your machine switched off. 
Dumb matter = something without an intelligence or mind. 
Are you honestly saying that you don't think there is a difference between a child and a blastocyst or even a sperm or egg? What would you class as yourself, your mind, part of your body, your entire body? Given that every single atom in our body is replaced at least once over the course of our lifetime I don't see how we can be anything physical.
Until something has a developed brain why should I worry about it - its the same as feeling empathy with a chair. It has no feelings, no thoughts, no experience or memory - its just a wet mass getting bigger until it develops enough to gain these things (at which point I don't beleive you should be able to abort it). If the mother is obligated to care of a child, then she has to have the ability to prevent this from occuring otherwise you are really just punishing her with a child. 
I don't think it is better to kill a child than have it go unwanted - but I see no problem with preventing that child from coming into existance because it would be unwanted. Its no different really from not having sex in the first place.",9,14,topic_stance_votes_2
14,Removing the fetus without death,abortion,attack,"My Mom is not a testimonial machine. She was an official nurse at a hospital and I would bet she knows a lot more than you men do about this. Don't try and act like my Mom was feeding me a bunch of nonsense.
And I have read testimonies about women and girls who have abortions. I research this stuff, and I know what I'm talking about. Not all women go through this, but all the risks involved FOR the mother make abortion much more dangerous for herself. Therefore, it is safer to have a birth than an abortion. 
Such operations need to be done while the baby is INSIDE the mother's body. (Such as tearing the baby to pieces, for instance. THAT is dangerous) Whether it's pain or fertility or uterus damage, the abortion methods cannot gaurantee safety for the woman and insures many risks involved that endanger the health of the woman. Pregnancy is natural and unless it is a C-Section, requires no surgery into the womb or body unless the baby is having trouble coming out.
Speaking of testimonies, have you ever read a testimony from someone who had their baby killed because they thought it was for the best and said how much they later regretted their decision? They said that they are much happier now (those that got pregnant again and let their baby live) because they have a child. And the grief still hits them whenever they think of their living child. Such things are not as scarce as you make them out to be.

How many testimonials have you found where people had no problem at all with having an abortion? Just finding them is going to be harder, no one denies that there is never complications in abortion but you are making it out as if they are 100% garaunteeded.
Guilt is complicated to measure and hopelessly subjective as well. Someone who doesn't particularly want to get an abortionprobably shouldn't, but there is also the pro-life side trying to make people feel guilty as well. I'm sure a lot of people feel guilty about having children as well when they can't afford it or when it keeps them in a relationship they would prefer not to be.

17,Removing the fetus without death,abortion,attack,"I guess statistics are what you want. I'll post some here that I got from http://www.angelfire.com/nj3/rebekah8370/
95% of abortions are done as birth control, 1% are done because of rape/incest, 1% because of fetal abnormalities, and 3% due to the mother's health problems. 
Abortions outnumber live births in 14 major metropolitan areas. 
45% of the women that walk into an abortion clinic have already had at least 1 previous abortion. 
Child abuse has gone up 500% since the legalization of abortion. 
95% of women who have had an abortion say that the abortion clinic gave them little or no information about the fetus living inside of them. 
Many people believe that women who are victims of rape and become pregnant by this violent act is a good reason for them to have an abortion. In Victims and Victors (Acorn Books, 2000), a book written by David Reardon, Amy Sobie, and Julie Makimma, 192 women were interviewed. These women had had abortions after they became pregnant from rape. Nearly all the women said that they regretted the abortion, and over 90% said they would discourage other rape victims from choosing abortion. 
49% of pregnancies in America are unplanned. 50% of these unplanned pregnancies are ended by abortion. Out of all women who have abortions, 75% say they had an abortion because the baby would have interfered with their life; 66% say that they couldn't have afforded a baby; and 50% said they didn't want to be a single mother or were having problems with their partner. 
14,000 abortions are done because of rape/incest. (This only makes up about 1% of all abortions.) 
I guess you can see that psychologcially, it most certainly does effect women; and much more than you thought.
Plus, have you seen the child abuse that has gone up since abortion was legalized?! This is for the living children. Do you think such a law should be allowed when things like this happen?

This needs some more stats to go with it before we can start to really analyse it, backgrounds, reasons for abortions etc.
Global warming has also skyrocketed with the decline in pirate numbers
This is a rather odd question to ask, what exactly did people expect to be told?
However 10% said it was a good thing, thats 1400 people a year by your numbers. Counciling is the issue here rather than an abortion one, we can't judge on this until we see from the other side of rape victims who kept their babies. Not to mention that regret can cover a huge range.
Seem valid reasons to me
Until we can see the full story on the benefits and harm of rape and abortion we can't say anything. 
Those stats have said practically nothing, this isn't something that can just be solved with some nice soundbites to back up a political view. It requires genuine study, at the very least you need to compare rates of depression in mothers and people who have abortions, and factor into account the rates of depression experienced previous to conception.

""Contraceptive Use Among U.S. Women Having Abortions in 2000-2001
By Rachel K. Jones, Jacqueline E. Darroch and Stanley K. Henshaw 
CONTEXT: Knowing the extent to which contraceptive nonuse, incorrect or inconsistent use, and method failure account for unintended pregnancies ending in abortion, as well as reasons for nonuse and imperfect use, can help policymakers and family planning providers support effective contraceptive use. 
METHODS: Contraceptive use patterns among a nationally representative sample of 10,683 women receiving abortion services in 2000-2001 were examined, as well as reasons for nonuse, problems with the most frequently used methods and the impact emergency contraceptive pills have had on abortion rates. 
RESULTS: Forty-six percent of women had not used a contraceptive method in the month they conceived, mainly because of perceived low risk of pregnancy and concerns about contraception (cited by 33% and 32% of nonusers, respectively). The male condom was the most commonly reported method among all women (28%), followed by the pill (14%). Inconsistent method use was the main cause of pregnancy for 49% of condom users and 76% of pill users; 42% of condom users cited condom breakage or slippage as a reason for pregnancy. Substantial proportions of pill and condom users indicated perfect method use (13-14%). As many as 51,000 abortions were averted by use of emergency contraceptive pills in 2000. 
CONCLUSIONS: Women and men need accurate information about fertility cycles and about the risk of pregnancy when a contraceptive is not used or is used imperfectly. Increased use of emergency contraceptive pills could further reduce levels of unintended pregnancy and abortion.

None of which can justify killing. Career and Financial limitations can be fixed by giving up for adoption. (A person shouldn't risk getting pregnant if they're THAT concerned about their career anyway.)
A good, kind person can come from an abusive family. Putting the child up for adoption might be better if the family is abusive. At least, better than KILLING it and giving it no chance at all.
Plus, there is no child on this earth that isn't a financial burden. Health problems, disease and infections are all risked in sex. Considering ""Health Needs"" Things like that should be considered beforehand. Birth Control is far from perfect, and it's failure to prevent pregnancies is no reason to kill.

47,Removing the fetus without death,abortion,attack,"First, your statement implies that you believe that killing a child is better than letting it live with inadequate careemoticonXConfused Inadequate care is nothing compared to killing, and you know that. Letting them live is a small mercy, at least.
Second, if abortions is made illegal and the woman cannot kill it or get rid of it before it is born, than she'll have to take care of it herself. The Man should do the same of course, but that could start an entire new thread. If a mother doesn't take care of the baby, she'll endanger her own health and safety. She'll be forced to (along with Dad, but that's another thread) take care of that child for her own safety. There's nothing to stop her from putting the child up for adoption later.
""Since you care highly for these unborn persons , I'm hoping your answer will contain something about helping pregnant and poor women obtain adequate prenatal health care.""
The ""poor"" women can use the money they would have spent in having an abortion and use it too take care of their child. And there are plenty of ways to get help in medical care and things like that. And besides, if they didn't want to be pregnant because of money problems, well too bad. It's their fault for not thinking more before going into sex. A baby should not have to die for your own pleasure life.
Now this is just a thought, but how about taking the money from the funds that support abortion and turning it into money for those who have financial problems because of their pregnancy?

48,Removing the fetus without death,abortion,attack,"Not what I said, implied, nor feel. I'm asking you questions; you shouldn't infer my beliefs based on that. I think that if anti-choice people want to control a woman's reproductive system, then they need to address how she is going to get adequate care, how she is going to deal with abusive family relationships, etc. You're the ones that want to force a woman to give birth; If it were up to me I'd say give her all the options, give her all the education, and allow her to deal with the consequences (if there are any.) Besides, since you care so much about the innocent fetus, why should the fetus have to suffer at all b/c the mother has problems? It shouldn't, eh?
(Your statement I bolded) How? How will she be forced? I don't understand. Adoption is an alternative to parenting; of course she can do that later; no one is arguing that. I'm just trying to help you understand that it's nine months to that point, and those nine months are very important for the baby's health.
Why did you quote ""poor"" women? What does that mean? 
Do you know how much abortions cost? Compare the cost to the cost of taking care of oneself for a nine month period, plus additional medical costs. Don't forget, if Mom can't work b/c of her pregnancy, there's issue there too.
Of course you feel financial problems should not be the cause of abortions. But they are; that's reality. So that needs to be addressed; to just sweep it under the carpet under the guise of ""Should of thought of that before going into sex"" and shutting the door isn't going to help anyone.

I do not want to force a woman to give birth. I don't want to force her to get pregnant either. If they don't want to give birth, they shouldn't get into sexual activites that include that risk. Like I've said before, it's nobody's fault but their own if they don't like it.
I'm not entirely settled on what I believe about pro-choice people, but I do know about abortion. For now, I'm calling myself against abortion. And you're right in two things. Anti-choice people should not try to control a woman's reproductive system, and women should be given proper education regarding these matters. I do think the option for letting the baby live should be a bit more open though.
The fetus may suffer abuse or bad family during its life, but at least it may live and may turn out into a nice, respectable person. You never can know for sure, and I don't think an option for killing it on those grounds should be available. Being killed is worse than living with a chance. Dead, well. You have no chance at all.
A woman who doesn't take proper care for her unborn child will endanger her own health, that is how she'll be forced to take care of it. Nine months, I know, can be extremely strenuous. Not that I've given birth emoticonXDonno , but my Mom has, 11 times. So I do know it is tough, but in answer to your question, the mother will have to bear it.
You are correct. 200-700$ is small compared to the extra things she'll need for nine months. But medical help is often needed after the abortion too, so it can be more as well. But the risk is still run when having sex, it's not the baby's fault.
It will help the babies, won't it? The woman (and man) must be held responsible regardless of reasons for things they didn't think of beforehand. Should the option to kill be allowed for that?
I got my info from here. http://www.aclu.org/reproductiverigh...s20040721.html
I don't have any numbers regarding where the money goes, but I think I can make an educated guess.
1.5 million abortions every year.
That's about 30,000 abortions every state.
17 do government funding for abortions, that's about 510,000 abortions for them.
That's 51 million dollars if each one was only 100$.
51 million dollars is a whole lot of money. For those that need it to live through their pregnancy, a sum that big could greatly aid them. And that's just the smallest amount possible. Think of it; with the older babies are (in weeks) that get aborted, think of how much more they would cost? It would be really nice if this sort of money could be used to help women through pregnancies.
I don't know if abortion clinics or planned parenthood things. Sorry, I'm not well informed on how they work.
17 states use government funding for abortions.",49,52,topic_stance_votes_1
52,Removing the fetus without death,abortion,attack,"If you desire to abolish abortion, than yes, you are forcing (some) women to give birth. That's the truth of the anti-choice position. It's an awesome decision to make for someone, regardless of their input or lives. I hope you get to talk to some women/girls/couples who face unwanted pregnancies so you know more about their lives.
So you're saying that women who have sex consent to giving birth? Do you consent to getting into a car accident every time you're in your car? 
I'll say it again; sex is not always about procreation.
You know about abortion? How is that? 
Anti-choice people should not try to control a woman's reproductive system? Aren't they, though? They are telling her that she must give birth. They are telling her that even if she were raped, even if she used birth control, even if she's 13, she has to have the baby? 
I hope that you are begining to understand where pro-choice people are coming from, specifically me: It's very upsetting to me to think that some (stereotype alert) old, rich, white man in a state capital whom I've never met, nor ever will meet introduces laws that would force me to give birth, a life changing, altering, and serious ordeal. I struggle to think of a comparative analogy. Can you?
Does your stance on abortion come from a moral standpoint? If so, then I ask, why not allow the woman to deal with her morals? She's the one who has to live with herself; let her decide what to do. I say completely educate her about the post-abortion psychological/physiological effects, make her aware of what could happen. 
So are you saying that you wouldn't do anything in an abusive situation? 
Of course you think it's better to allow the fetus to live than die no matter what the situation, but you're kind of glossing over what I was originally asking. What are you going to do/tell the pregnant girl in this situation? Please don't just sweep it under the rug. It's a real issue, and one girls/women get abortions for.
What of the women who don't take care of themselves on a regular basis? Do you think that they are going to magically change overnight b/c they are pregnant? Eat healthily, quit smoking, quit drinking, quit drugging, go to the doctor for checkups, exercise? I find myself repeating myself...what if she is too sick to work, and simply can't afford survival? Can't pay rent, can't pay utility bills, can't pay groceries? That's going to endanger her and the fetus, and she's not going to magically be able to pay those things just because she's pregnant. 
Medical help is often needed after the abortion? Like what? Don't forget that medical help is sometimes needed after birth as well.
You keep coming back to this (bolded sentence). I get the point already; do you get the point that people have sex for other reasons than to have children?
This is very personal, don't even answer-I don't want to know- just ask yourself- Have you ever had sex? If yes, do you consent to being a father every time you do it?

I guess the big thing of this debate (or rather, something I use very often) is about whether a woman considers health risk, financial risks, family risks and career risks before having sex. I've not had sex, not sure about whether I personally ever will. But that is irrelevant.
So many different things you've brought up that I (as a person against abortion) need to think of before taking away abortions is, to me at least, shifting the burden of responsibility. You've asked me before what ""I"" would do for those unwanted unborn babies and what ""I"" would do to ensure their care. It seems to me that those question should be put to the mother and the father. ""THEY"" are the ones who had sex. ""THEY"" are the ones who ran the risk to their health, finances, career status and family status. ""THEY"" did it, ""THEY"" take resonsibility for ""THEIR"" actions. Should the baby have to die so they can avoid responsibility?
I would not prevent men and women from having sex. But having the option to kill so they can run clean of the risks involved is wrong and immoral.
Oh, by the way, only about 1% of women who have abortions are rape victims. 1 percent is small to the other 99% who have it for other reasons.

Sometimes people who get abortions are taking responsibility for their actions; they are aborting their problem. It's not an ""easy way out"" or avoiding responsibility, it's taking care of their problem. It may be immoral to you and many others, it may not seem ""right to kill"" so they can have sex -(and no one looks at it like this by the way; unless it's a repeated form of post-sex birth control, which disgusts me) but it's an option and people have to deal with it.

I'm taking away their license to kill a young, defensless baby. There shouldn't be a choice regarding letting it live or killing it. The decision and burden is on them, and aborting is not just getting rid of a ""problem"", they are picking the easy way out for convenience sake.
This is definitely a tricky subject. For those couples that have abortions because they believe they are doing the right thing could start an entire different topic with debates on what's right and wrong.

I'm not trying to ""punish"" her for having sex. Nothing wrong with that (until I develop a wider more informed view on it concerning my beliefs) and there should be no punishment whatever.

Perhaps not everyone, but many.

I believe life begins at conception. Now, if you want to talk about the few hours in which the sperm and the egg just combine and are fertilized, yes, techincally that may be the time when it is not a baby yet. But nobody gets an abortion for those (I'm sure you know why) and nobody even knows about it till weeks after that happens. By then, in six weeks, it has arms, legs, a head and bones. And what if it doesn't have a nervous system? It still is a living human being with or without one, and it's going to get one eventually.
As a matter of fact I did meet someone (online) who had had an abortion. She was a mother of... 2, I think, and her baby was significantly far ahead in its growth time. (She had had it for quite a few weeks) She was, I believe, one of the victims who have been told the possibilities of health problems for the baby in its life and was induced by the doctor and medical team into having an abortion for the best; despite the babies large chances of survival and birth without such things.

She told me that the doctor had said that it ""definitely"" had undeveloped limbs and a bad case of illness that would have handicapped the baby in its mental capabilities. She did tell me that it was a heart-breaking decision and that she still mourns over her babies death. I didn't talk as civilly towards her as I could, but I did remain firm on the subject with her that they were only possibilites and that she did not even let the baby live to have a chance.

But it is going to be a punishment, if you abolish abortion. Mom's going to get punished for her sex life, whether you see it like that or not. If she's pregnant, doesn't want it, and is forced to continue (man, sounds like hell to me every time I type is out-a hellish society where women must surrender their reproductive organs to the whims of the gov't, to the morality of some people who consider their morals to be the best and push them against everyone else) that's punishment. Plain and simple. I can see it now; the finger wagging gov't official; ""You should have kept your legs together!"" to the 16 year old scared girl who's parents have disowned her, or will force her to keep the baby. How about the crack addict who prostitutes herself for crack? The 13 year old who didn't have any idea what sex was really for? The any year old who was raped? Incest cases? Or the poor, in debt so far up to her ears, 20 year old with no support system, and unable to work b/c she's so sick, about to be kicked out of her apartment, beaten by her boyfriend for ""catching pregnant""?
Tell me this; why do pregnant girls/women have to remain pregnant, in your opinion? Because it's the right thing to do? Is there such an absolute?
You don't sound dumb at all; just young. There's a difference. :)
Necessary evil...abortion in circumstances as above. If that's what the girl wants, and she's educated about her decision (as well as other options) then that is a necessary evil. Anyways, on a different tangent, don't we need evil to see the good?
You're right, development shouldn't matter much if you're looking at it from a morality standpoint, b/c it's going to 'eventually' get those necessary body systems for function. So if your morality is your argument, then those don't really matter.
My thoughts are that it's incapable of thought or independent action. It has no pain centers, so there's no pain. It's like, nothing. My dog has more significance to me than a 6 week old fetus. Ah, blaspheme, many will say. That's fine. I know I treat my dogs better than many, many people treat their children.
Wow, that's a horrible story. Sounds like she was a little railroaded into that decision. I hope you have some sympathy for her; she regrets her decision, and that's tough stuff. It's so easy to judge, so hard to feel empathy.

71,Removing the fetus without death,abortion,attack,"From what I gathered from his book, there is no evil intention behind it; necessarily. Doctors find it alright to do abortions (the pro-abortions ones) and as such, they believe that any circumstances regarding pregnancy or risks, they feel it is their job to try and convince them to do it. They don't consider anything morally wrong on this, they pretty much feel as if they did their job and that it's another accomplishment under their belt.
For one thing, I did not come into the topic and search for her to berate her. She came to me in my posts and challenged me.
Reason 1 -- There have been mothers who have been told of such things happening to their unborn infan,t and they let their baby be born. Guess what? They were fine. This doctor or medical team could very well have been wrong, but I think the persuasiveness of the doctor convinced her they were concrete.
Reason 2. -- Perhaps. But I think it would be a better idea to tell her the baby still had a fighting chance. It still had a significant way to go before birth. That might have eased the pain in knowing it MIGHT have problems, but that something good could still come from it.
Reason 3 -- No, I think discounting it was a low value of the human life. Killing it is worse than letting it live with a chance. That sounds better than a suggestion of total death, wouldn't it?
Reason 4 -- I could have dealt with her more ethically, I admit. But I did not berate her like an old granny coming to switch her cane at her adult daughter and telling her to be grateful for everything she did for her. But she made the choice to come to the topic, read it, see my things and try to rebute what I had said.

72,Removing the fetus without death,abortion,attack,"My sin concept is based on my religion. The abortion issue is a whole other thing unaffected by my religion though, so don't attack that.
I've read threads on this already. The laws of this country prohibit murder and killing of any person. A fetus is a person, isn't it? It looks an awful lot like one at five or six weeks, and that's the usual time for abortions. I could give you a link to some aborted babies at that age, unless you don't feel comfortable looking at them.
I'm going to punish her for becoming pregnant when she is doing everything possible that risks it? How is that unjust?
Not all the abortion cases are about rape, especially the ones you mentioned. You cannot generalize and stretch extreme circumstances like these over the whole lot of abortions going on for other reasons. (And rape victims frequently believe in letting the baby live instead of continuing the violence by killing.)
Plus, you are trying to compact every possible thing that can go wrong in a single case, and then you're trying to generalize this. If abortions are outlawed and women (and girls) are made to carry out their pregnancies, I would bet parents would be more careful about letting their child have sex; considering abortion is no longer a solution.
If you mean ""moral"" absolute, well... since America no longer bases its laws on a moral absolute, then it can't be argued on those grounds.
I believe a baby is a person like you and me and deserves to live. And it should be considered murder to kill them; regardless of people thinking they can play God and end the life of an infant because of physical or medical deformities. (Sure, kill all the sick ones. That shows REEEAL humanity)
Why do they have to remain pregnant? Well, in the first place, they don't need to become pregnant. The don't ever have to get pregnant. I think they should remain pregnant till the baby is born because they voluntarily performed such actions as to conceive.
Thank you, I think I understand now.
Don't worry, I won't condemn you for thinking your dogs are smarter and more capable than a baby that has yet to be born. :) Perfectly reasonable.
No pain? Well, neither will a five year old in a coma if you kill him. Just because feeling isn't present doesn't mean it isn't murder.
No independent action? A baby can kick, suck its thumb and even react to different types of music. That sounds like it needs a brain to do that.
I do have sympathy, but not necessarily the kind you're thinking. I'm sad because she was persuaded through her doctor and/or medical team that it had to happen. And I do believe she was human enough to feel bad about her decision, I never forgot that. Believe me, it was kind of a shock when I read it and I didn't feel very happy afterwards.
You're a woman? Maybe I'm clueless, but I thought from your avatar that you were a man. Oh well, I guess I can be glad I didn't base my responses on the gender I believed you to be.
I will never have to make that decision, true. But it doesn't invalidate anything I've said. A person can still have a valid and correct view on a situation regardless of gender. But I can tell you this, that the biologically fertile being was born from another biologically fertile being that chose to let them live. I think their children should be allotted the same rights.
You're welcome. :-)
I don't know about female degredation in religion; but regarding pro-lifers of both genders:
I think religious persons are more active pro-lifers than pro-abortionists because they have an absolute to base their beliefs on. A pro-abortionist can't excuse himself from such laws. Since more pro-lifers have found a moral basis for their views, they speak out more than a person who is pro-life with no other weapon than their belief in human rights and the justice system.
Women who fight for rights concerning this are merely trying to ridicule their own religion if it happens to condemn them for abortions and that strikes them as taking away their rights. They count that as degredation so they can scream about injustice.

I think you may have gotten the wrong idea. I'm fighting for women's choice; the choice to remain pregnant, the choice to not remain pregnant. I'm not in the streets promoting abortions; big pictures on signs proclaiming ""Kill your Feti! Kill your feti!"" Do you see the difference?
I've seen the pictures. It really doesn't matter what they look like. There's just nobody home; how can there be, without a fully developed neural center? How can you kill someone that's not there, and has never been there?
You do understand that I'm not interested in late (3rd) trimester abortions at all, and even 2nd ones are iffy in my mind, with few stringent exceptions. 
People do not always have sex to make babies. To condemn them for this is ridiculous, idealistic, and fantasy.
Even if there is just one woman who was raped somewhere, I would not deny her a choice about her own violated body just because statisically the chance of her circumstance happening is very small.
And that's great; since I'm pro-choice- that some rape victims choose to remain pregnant. More power to them; like heck if I feel I would be more qualified than they to make such a decision.
A. Do you think I'm way off the mark here? Do you think that these things never happen?
B. You bet parents would be more careful? Do you think that parents have that much control over their kids? And hey, don't forget about the kids who don't live at home anymore. You need to meet some more XXXXXX if you think that people are going to be more careful about having sex if abortion is no longer a solution. :)
Man, you're generalizing all the individual reasons women have abortions under the heading of ""convenient"". I'm trying to show you that there's more to it than just ""convenience"". 
There we go. We're just going to butt heads until the end of time. I believe that a woman has priority numero uno, and since it's her body, she is the best decision maker in this situation. She has to live with herself, psychologically and physically. I don't.
Who said kill all the sick ones?
Do you think that everytime someone has sex they are voluntarily committing themselves to get pregnant? 
Your sarcasm is not appreciated, nor will help you get your point across. And on top, I didn't even say that. I said, they have more significance to me than a six week old fetus. A dog has personality, thinks, and determines it's actions. A six week old fetus isn't even 'there'.
Careful where you use the word ""murder"". I'm sure you're aware that ""murder"" is the illegal killing of a creature. Abortion is not murder, soldiers in the field aren't murdering anyone, etc. 
I knew this coma thing would come up. Is the child dependent on it's mother? Does the child have a fully developed brain, did the child have independent thought, and, lastly, does the mother want to keep it? Couldn't she just disconnect the life support? Is that moral?
No, wait, I really don't want to get into that. A kid in a coma is not the same as a 6 week old fetus in the womb. The End.
A six week old fetus? 
I'm glad you read about her experience. I hope you will not condemn her for her actions. That situation sucks.

And I don't want my religion to influence the laws of america any more than I'd want someone elses. I think that based on the laws of murder and killing in this country that a baby in the womb is a person as well.
I've run into arguements on this several times before; the one about whether a baby is conscious or whether there is a mind or soul inside that would make it an actual person. My view is... well, I'll give you a reference to Bernard Nathanson's book. Chapter 10: The Vector Of Life, The Hand Of God
A baby is capable of being born before nine months and before it is fully developed. It might be slow and behind in its mental developement and may not even be able to think of its own. But it is alive, and killing it then would be considered murder. I don't know why it isn't considered the same with babies in the womb.
I know they don't have sex just for procreation. Does that give them the right to kill?
Perhaps you're talking of love. I wouldn't hold it against any man or woman to love, after all, my Mom and Dad had to to make me live.:) But that still doesn't excuse killing. It would see more like selfish love to do things that risk pregnancy and then kill because they want nothing of it. The baby never did anything wrong and didn't suddenly appear of its own will inside the mother. Why should it have to die? So they can do this and be able kill freely?
The overwhelming majority of all abortions, (95%), are done as a means of birth control. 
Only 1% are performed because of rape or incest; 
1% because of fetal abnormalities; 
3% due to the mother's health problems.
I found it here. http://www.abortiontv.com/Misc/AbortionStatistics.htm
If you are willing to allow the death of at least 1.5 million babies around the world, I would think making it illegal and making just that 1% of women carry their babies to birth would be a better idea. It should to you, if I understand you correctly.
I don't deny it does happen. But not as much as you're trying to extrapolate. Look at that site again.
I think more people would be careful about it. Those females who don't have it just for the fun of it. It would reduce abortion rates quite significantly anyway, wouldn't you think so?
And the baby has his/her own body too. The question is this: Does the mother have the right to abort her baby based on concerns for her own body? I'm not saying she can't kill for her own safety (In that debate, only the mother can decide) but if she doesn't have anything to worry about beyond normal pregnancie risks;. Such as disease or infection because of the fetus and such.
I don't care what the woman does with her body as long as she doesn't harm the other one.
You didn't, I was more or less grumbling from one of the arguement brought up in pro-abortionists' debates on the possible concerns of the mother. 
No. But the risk is there 100% of the time, and they do it anyways. Shouldn't the mother (and father of course) be held responsible since they did it? It isn't like someone forced them to and told them to live with it. It's ridiculous to say they should be allowed to kill simply because they didn't do it for pro-creation.
No, no no. You misunderstood me. I agreed with you whole-heartedly on what you said, I meant no sarcasm. Maybe I should think more before adding smilies.
A woman's body has nothing to do with the army, nor does the baby's. I think the definiton of murder should be more like this. ""To kill brutally or inhumanly."" And believe me, the methods used are most certainly inhumane. I'm talking about 2nd trimester or third trimester thing, I'm sure you must understand.
Very true.
Perhaps not always. But there's no way to tell. The thing is this: Are you willing to let it be killed simply because it is incapable of these things?

Any of the reasons for abortion are just as frequent in regular conception. The answer is ""No, I will not give you a license to kill for any reason.""
How about, instead of killing the innocent baby to solve the problem, punish the rapist (spelling?) and have him provide for it till birth? 
Then she shouldn't behave like one. After all, she doesn't want a baby, why act like one?
You have a very different responsibility idea than I do.
Nope. 2nd and 3rd trimester's usually require such things as inserting tools into the womb to cut the baby in pieces (and it CAN feel pain now) and sucking them out through a tube. That, or putting a device inside that creates a toxic environment for the baby, killing it slowly.

Let me ask you this. If someone decided it was morally right to kill any family member that might effect their life in a negative way, would you allow them to do whatever they want? 
Punishment for murder in any case in America is a moral in itself. There may be moral views suggesting that killing is justified in the case of revenge. But morals are already used in creating a law that makes killing murder in any case. Nobody complains about morals being pushed on them then.

Plus, there is a personal view that the baby is a person from conception. Those are personal views, but currently the first one made the law.
Only pro-lifer are poked in the chest because of their personal views when the pokers themselves don't even realize the reasons that make them pro-abortionists stemmed from their own personal views.

ECTOGENESIS 
Development of Articial Wombs 
Technology's threat to abortion rights
Sacha Zimmerman
Sunday, August 24, 2003
Cornell University's Dr. Hung-Ching Liu has taken steps toward developing an artificial womb by removing cells from the lining of a woman's womb and then, using hormones, growing layers of these cells on a model of a uterus. The model eventually dissolves, leaving a new, artificial womb that continues to thrive. 
In Japan, Dr. Yoshinori Kuwabara, a professor of obstetrics at Juntendo University, has created an artificial womb. He has successfully delivered goats from this artificial womb after just three weeks of gestation. Kuwabara says that, with enough funding, his ectogenetic chamber could be ready to use on a human fetus within five years. 
Roe vs. Wade is predicated on two basic ideas: a woman's right to privacy (including the right not to be pregnant) and the viability of the fetus -- defined as the ability to survive outside the mother's womb, currently placed at 24 weeks of gestation. 
Complete ectogenesis could dismantle both of these premises. First, it could make Roe's viability issue moot because with ectogenesis a fetus could be technically viable outside the mother's womb from the moment of conception. 
That would surely impact the other idea underpinning Roe: a woman's right to privacy. With ectogenesis, an unwanted fetus, rather than being aborted, could be removed from a woman and placed in an ectogenetic chamber to be adopted later. The woman's right to privacy would arguably not be invaded because removing the fetus to implant in an artificial womb need not be any more invasive than the abortion she was originally seeking. 
As bioethicists Peter Singer and Deane Wells write of ectogenesis in their book ""Making Babies: The New Science and Ethics of Conception"" (Charles Scribner's Sons, 1985), ""Freedom to choose what is to happen to one's body is one thing; freedom to insist on the death of a being that is capable of living outside of one's body is another."" 
The pro-choice movement is ignoring the prospect of ectogenesis at its own peril. If and when ectogenesis becomes a reality, it will redefine the abortion debate. 
Just consider the issue of viability: 41 states ban abortion after viability. If ectogenesis is achieved, will abortion become illegal in each of those states? Many pro-lifers will certainly be prepared to argue yes. Isn't it about time pro-choicers start thinking of what they will say in response?

98,Removing the fetus without death,abortion,attack,"Well, I might have jumped the gun a bit in assuming that your morals come purely from religion. Mainly, I was reacting to a general trend among pro-life posts that seems to assume that people who are pro-choice are not moral. I, personally, have never met a pro-choice person who didn't have a code of ethics about right and wrong behavior (i.e. morals). 
I would agree that, in essence, legislators vote to pass laws based on their inherent sense of ethics. This sense of ethics might have been inspired by religion, or by rational deliberation, or by instinctual reactions (ex. there are many examples of animals essentially sacrificing their needs for the needs of the group, so instinct does play a role in our sense of morality). However, it is against the constitution for laws to be introduced which purely promote a particular religious point of view, without having general reasons behind them as well.",95,99,topic_stance_votes_2

This isn't true. If Church X is the only church that thinks the color blue is immoral and State Y decides to introduce a law banning the color blue then this isn't unconstitutional. Now if the law said ""anything that Church X said is immoral is against the law"" then this would not fly with the US constitution.",99,102,topic_stance_votes_1
102,Removing the fetus without death,abortion,attack,"Morals can be inspired by religious belief, but I would think that those morals that are inspired by religious religious belief fall in at least two general categories:
1) Morals that would still be held even if the person didn't hold those religious beliefs. For example, morals against killing other innocent people hold across almost all segments of humanity. You don't need to believe in God or any supernatural existence to feel that killing innocents is wrong. I have no problem with these types of morals playing a role in the decisions of legislators. As long as there is objective non-religious reasoning behind a particular moral stance, then I would not have major objections in its being considered.
2) Morals that are specific to a particular religion. For example, the requirement of some religions not to eat pork. I would not condone any law that says ""You are not allowed to eat pork because our religion tells us we can't"". There has to be some general reason - ex. I heard that such religious restrictions were put in place to begin with since pork quickly went bad and made people ill. It would be similar to our laws against injesting certain harmful drugs. Where abortion-law is concerned, I would say that a law that says that ""Newly fertilized eggs should not be aborted since certain sects of Christianity believe that the soul enters upon conception"" would be an imposition of a religious position, and would thus be against the constitution. On the other hand, if one makes a law that says ""We value a newly fertilized egg enough to protect it by law since it has the potential of becoming a person"" - that is a more general judgement call which, though I disagree with it, would still be a valid arguement to present.",101,103,topic_stance_votes_2
103,Removing the fetus without death,abortion,attack,"Considering that your definition of the term ""correct"" code of ethics is simply your own opinion, then I could say the same thing: I have never met a pro-life person with the correct code of ethics. Much of what we are debating in these abortion threads is precisely what our ethics are behind our choices of where we stand on abortion. Whether those ethical codes are right or wrong depend on your assumptions. You simply assume different things than I do. For example, from an earlier discussion, you seemed to assume that a mental existence might be possible early on in the pregnancy whereas I don't.
If State Y banned the color blue for PURELY religious reasons, that would be against the constitution. Whereas, if State Y banned the color blue because Church X was pushing for it (which drew attention to that color) AND because there were general reasons to outlaw it, then that would be ok.",102,104,topic_stance_votes_2
104,Removing the fetus without death,abortion,attack,"I don't think it is my opinionat all. I believe in an absolute right and wrong. I never set my opinions as the absolute either.
I don't know of any law that had a ""reasons"" list attached to it. If a state rep, for example, voted to ban color blue for purely religious reasons than that is fine. Even if all the state reps thought this way this, the banning of color blue would neither be respecting the establishment of a religion nor would it be preventing the free exercise of a religion.

It mostly comes down to opinion and personal preference. People certainly have trends in what they consider right and wrong, but there has been no evidence to prove one particular path uniquely right.
When laws do not infringe on anyone's constitutional rights, then often simple majorities rule and the law is never challenged.

The reason for a state rep voting on a law does not violate the 1st amendment. Establishing a religion or preventing free exercise of one does. This would be saying the Church of England is the official church of the USA and all muslims can't practice their religion here. A very simple amendment that doesn't stretch beyond what is says.

If you have no evidence for that absolute ethics, then that simply leaves you back at the starting point - your ethics, like mine and everyone elses, are a matter of opinion.
Imposing aspects of a religion on the whole populace is also covered under that first ammendment. For example, if one tried to impose 90% of the rules of the Church of England on the populace, do you really think that that would be allowed under the constitution. Within your arguement, it sounds like you think it would be allowed. I know that different justices have different points of view, just as with certain other ammendments.

108,Removing the fetus without death,abortion,attack,"No, as I said, a proof is an absolute..so if you ask for proof that an absolute can exist you already accepted that one in fact does exist.
I would say 90% of the church of Englands rules are put onto to the people. Amendments can't be skewed to mean anything other than what they say...why? There is no basis for doing so! The 1st amendment is very clear....no establishing and no violation of free exercise. If a law said ""the Christian God is the only true God"" than this would violate the 1st amendment. It is a very long stretch to say ""can't respect establishment of religion"" means can't pass a law if someone feels its right based on religious reasons. A good example might be passing a law limiting childrens access to porn. If every state rep said ""porn is against my religious views therefore pass"" then this wouldn't be a violation of the 1st amendment even if challenged.",108,109,topic_stance_votes_1

The main reason that our Supreme Court exists is because interpretation of the constitution is not as straight forward as you would like it to be. Different justices, all of which have studied the Constitution in depth, have different interpretations. As it stands now, there seems to be a general understanding of separation of church and state based on the constitution. If the new justices that Bush appointed start changing that accepted doctrine, then that will spell a certain type of doom for the freedoms we have enjoyed in this country for over two centuries.

You mean it would spell doom for the judge created ""freedoms"" we have enjoyed the last 50 years.
Well you can't win an argument with a constitution that has no meaning (in the view of the living constitutionalist).

112,Removing the fetus without death,abortion,attack,"No, I don't think that an absolute ethical system exists. I believe that there are trends in human nature that lead to certain ethical stances (ex. against murder of innocents) that are general to a large percentage of the world's population, but the specifics of an ethical system depend on both people's assumptions about their world and the goals that they cherish. THis can lead to a fairly wide range of valid ethical systems. People have their own preferences, as you do and I do, but that does not make those stances absolute.
As for my asking you for proof, as I said before, I did not ask you for proof because I believe an absolute ethical system exist. I asked you for proof to show that your arguement was false - i.e. your arguement that your ethical system is not purely opinion. I knew perfectly well that you had no evidence of an absolute ethical system. How do I know that? Because there is no absolute ethical system - no one has ever come up with an arguement with evidence which supports just one.
As for the issues of the constitution, you take a literal reading of the constitution, as do some justices. Other justices do not take a literal reading. Historically, the interpretations have been more mixed than you think. Anyway, the leading interpretations of the constitution unfortunately seem more determined by politics than by substance. I would not be too optimistic if I were you about possible changes to the laws of this country based on the religious right stance of Bush and other neocons. The only reason he won is that he was able to convince the vast stretch of moderates in this country that he was not dangerously extreme and that he was perceived (wrongly in my opinion) as being better at keeping terrorism at bay. If religious right stances start to become law, the Neocons will loose their power VERY quickly.
