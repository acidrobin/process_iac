Personally, I am in favor of executing kidnappers (or rapists) that kill. There is a point when a person kidnaps (I assume) that they must decide to kill or not. If they don’t kill they risk being identified by the victim. 
Personally I am more interested in the deterrent effect of capital punishment over the punishment aspect.

Sundowner, I have no evidence of innocents executed. BUT, there have been many death row cases overturned or commuted sentences recently because of DNA evidence. It makes you wonder how many would have been executed before the DNA evidence has been used.
Is anyone in favor of “punishment” as compared to deterrence?  If someone were to torture and kill one of my kids, I don’t think killing them would be punishment enough. Let me torture them before they die; now that would be punishment. But what if the guilty person were later found innocent. Should I then get to torture and kill the next person convicted of the same crime?
I really want these criminals removed from society. I really don’t care if they are killed or not unless there is a real deterrence. But what would the acceptable rate of innocents killed be. Eventually, it will happen, if not already.

This is probably the most popular list of ""innocent"" people to be executed. Note that the most recent on the list is 1984, and most cases are from 1900's-1930's. While all of these present theories that the accused or executed may have been innocent, they all share 1 popular theme, conclusive evidence has never been presented in a court of law that overturned the conviction. I am not saying it is not possible for some of them to be innocent, but in the eyes of the law, they are still guilty to this day. 
Also, the dates of these crimes point to another point supporting capitol punishment. With the conclusive DNA testing and forensic analysis that can be accomplished with todays technology, it makes it highly unlikely that an innocent person could ever be sentenced to death in the first place. Even if the person is falsely found guilty, they are given ample appeals to establish their innocence. If the evidence of their innocence truely exists, or evidence is found to be lacking to prove their guilt, the conviction will be overturned. And yes, after all of this, it is still possible for an innocent person to be put to death. It is also possible for an innocent person to be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, but nobody is making the argument to stop sending people to prison.",15,16,topic_stance_votes_1

33,When should we execute?,death penalty,attack,"Toxey, you do not understand something very important about our most fundamental laws...
The law states that you are innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
What your ""hint"" suggests is that there is a reasonable doubt about the innocence of a person charged with a capital offense. (or any other offense).
Regardless of the offense, your obligation as a juror is to return a judgement of ""Innocent"", NOT he might be innocent, so let's just lock him up for the rest of his life!
Of course, you could disregard the law, as many jurors do, but you have no definitive say, as a juror, as to the judge's determination for the sentence that will be passed when yuo find someone guilty. The judge may or may not feel the death penaly is warranted.
(It's fascinating how on a site with so many deeply religious Christians, that the death penaly appears to be accepted to exact revenge.)
Personally, I've a big problem with the death penalty, namely that it has been applied to entirely innocent people. I've got a real problem supporting the death penalty as it is permitted to be applied in the U.S., when innocent people have been killed, because 1 innocent person killed by the State, is justification for either abolishing the D.P., or using it, only for cases in which the facts involve mass murder, and their is no question in any rational person's mind (before the trial), that the person chaged was responsible for mass murder.

I clump that in with ""I hope they target me"". It is a bunch of XXXX by people who have never been targeted, or never been in a situation where their life was in serious jepardy say.
Now, if you are caught, you are going to die. There is absolutly nothing to stop you from laying waste to everybody in your path in order to secure your escape. Whetehr you kill one person or 50, it doesn't matter now.
You have just escalated a simple robbery into a killing spree because you want to be ""hard on crime"". 
For many people, just the thought of 50 yrs behind bars is enough to make it worth killing to escape (rememeber those bank robbers in LA who had the big shootout with the cops using illegal machine guns??).
Reasonable penalties for crimes is a good thing. We have gone nutty on punishment in America. Criminals know when they go out to commit a crime what the likely penalty will be if caught, and you can bet your life that it figures into their actions when confronted with possible capture. 
I heard somebody saying the other day how ""disgusting"" it is that a local guy was ""only"" sentenced to 10 years in prison for commiting a rape. Rape is a heinous crime. If you think that 10 yrs in prison can properly be refered to as ""only"", I would highly suggest that you go down and see if your local sheriff will let you spend a weekend in the county jail.
I spent a weekend in the county jail once (didn't pay a traffic ticket when I was 17.....got pulled over and arrested when I was 23 and didn't have money for bail). I would rather kill a dozen cops and 4 nuns than spend 10 years in jail. A weekend was a LONG time to spend in jail. TEN YEARS would be one HELL of a long time to spend there.
I have a guy who works for me that is an ex-felon. He has some pretty hellacious stories regarding what goes on inside a federal prison. For those of you who think that a federal prison is a country club, you can live secure in the knowledge that if you ever end up in one, you will be taken care of, because somebody will likely make you their bitch the first week and protect you!
I have seen a lot of people convert from ""hard on crime"" types to ""sensible punisment types"". This is becasue our county sheriff is a pretty OK guy, and if there is room in the jail, and you pay for your own meals, he will lock you up for a couple of days so you can get an idea of what jail is like. And this is just a COUNTY jail. We are not talking a federal prison. I have gotten about a dozen people to take my ""try it before you shoot off your mouth"" challenge, and every single one of them changed their tune by the end of their little adventure.

Your attempt at reason is laughable. Let me get this straight.. we need less harsh punishments so that they don't shoot-up everybody because they're 'facing 50 years' in prison? LOL! What's your solution? Less time in prison for serious crimes? Or do you mean that we should keep secret potential sentences so that the 'reasonable' criminal doesn't run amok because the mean ol' justice system has a lengthy sentence waiting for him at the conclusion of his crime?

What we need are harsher sentences including the death penalty.

I think things through on my own, do my own research, and support whoevers views are closest to mine. Second, you need to work on debating based on logic, not emotional outbursts. What are you, about 15 yrs old?
What I am saying is that treatment has proven itself over jail for drug abusers, and prison study programs, job training, etc have been shown to have a lot more efect on the number of repeat offenders than longer prison sentences. This would imply that longer prison sentences don't do a whole lot of good when it comes to stopping crime.
You are right, I didn't mention the victim even once. This is because I was discussing punishment, not victims. I don't recall seeing a whole lot of talk about victims in this thread, as victims are not generally put to death or inprisoned. If you want to discuss victims, start another thread that is more appropriate.
It is easy to sit and yell ""lock them up and throw away the key!"" People need to think a little harder about what this kind of thing means. 
And, unless you have a logical argument to counter it, I still contend that severe prison terms escalate crime. You do not have to do anything terribly severe to earn 20 yrs in prison.

This a problem with the legal system not the punishment system. It revolves around legal interpretation of the term ""reasonable doubt"".
This is an outdated opinion and there is no supporting evidence to prove it. Which death row are you refering too? Ohio's? Colorados? Be specific and provide proof. According to this 59 of the executed inmates in Colorado were caucasian as compared to 12 people of Hispanic origin, 6 of African-American origin and 1 of Japanese origin. 
In Ohio, there is a closer results to your assertion with 104 people of African-American origin compared to 97 caucasians. 
Maryland supports your claim with 12 African-American inmates and only 4 Caucasian inmates.
Missouri: 32 Caucasians and 24 African-Americans.
North Carolina: 110 African-Americans, 67 Caucasians and 12 Other.
Kentucky: 27 Caucasians, 8 African-Americans and one prisoner of Hispanic decent.
I won't be bothered to find more, but the point is that you can either accept that the demographic as a whole yields an equal representation of Caucasians and Others OR skew your results by focusing on single state statistics. This doesn't even bring into bear global death penalty demographics for countries outside the US.
Agreed, the death penalty should only be introduced when there is either confession or irrefutable evidence.
Parole? Cost effectiveness?
Some evidence to support this would be nice. I doubt that this is true. If you look at the financial requirements to pay for a prisoner to spend a life time in prison, compared to the financial requirements to kill them, I would wager that it would be cheaper to kill them.
If you assume (as you do below) that prisoners convicted of life sentence still have rights as citizens than what you are suggesting is slave labour, which is illegal. Furthermore, what remains to be seen is whether the financial output of prisoner labour equals or exceeds the financial input required to keep them alive and in the capacity to do physical labour.

About costs
The cost in executing someone does not lie in the execution process, it lies in the legal process. I might be way off track, but I recall prisoners on death row are allowed many appeals (to minimize the risk of executing innocents) and this is where a death sentance starts to cost money. Alot of money...",45,46,topic_stance_votes_1

Perhaps, but what is the alternative? If we want to minimize the innocents that are being sentanced to death, we would need more appeals and we would need a more intense and effective legal process. How can we reduce the costs without allowing ourself to sentance more innocent people to death? Are you willing to make that trade-off? Where do we draw the line, afterall we could forego any trial by jury and just go with the police report. That would be very cost-efficient, but it would collide with our interests in legal justice.",47,48,topic_stance_votes_1
48,When should we execute?,death penalty,support,"The point is, when a crime is committed that warrants the death penalty and there is irrefutable evidence to suggest that the personal being held responsible is guilty, than they should be sentenced to death.
I do not agree with the idea that the death penalty should be effected in a case where there is contention. However, the fundamental flaw in the legal system is that a law is never interpreted how the writer intended. It is only interpreted how the first judge interprets it. I think this is the problem with a legal system based on precendent. Often times, appeals are an attempt to escape punishment through legal loopholes, not questions of guilt. This is what I wish to see done away with.
I am a firm believer in the idea that a human being gives up there right to live if the commit murder (by murder, I mean malicious intent).",48,49,topic_stance_votes_1
49,When should we execute?,death penalty,attack,"No, no, no, my friend. You have this all wrong. Yes, the appeal price does add to the total cost of things. But, on average, the original case costs $2.2 more for capital punishments as opposed to life sentences. This, in itself, is enough to already make the death sentence cost more than a life case. Oh, and appeals are payed by the suspect, thus those aren't even included. But, the case itself is payed for the government, thus you are getting ripped off if they are killed.

It is just too bad that we are as humane as we are...I say, bring back the ""Old Sparkey"" so they have something to think about during their endless appeals...I don't know, if it was me having to contemplate facing ""Old Sparkey"" - I would want it over with.
