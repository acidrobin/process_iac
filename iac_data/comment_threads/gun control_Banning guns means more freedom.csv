0,Banning guns means more freedom,gun control,support,"""Freedom, as those versed in even rudimentary political science know, comes in two variants, freedom 'from,' and freedom 'to.' Both of these are crucial in American society. We all want freedoms 'to' do things that benefit us, and we want freedoms from things that harm us."" 
Do you want to have more freedom by giving up your guns? We could have freedom from gun violence and freedom from high taxes that are caused by thousands of gun injuries each year. 
""The cost of firearm injuries in the US in 1990 was an estimated $20.4 billion. This includes $1.4 billion for direct expenditures for health care and related goods, $1.6 billion in lost productivity resulting from injury-related disability, and $17.4 billion in lost productivity from premature death. (Max and Rice, 1993)....There you have it: costs of up to $20 billion, most of which is borne by the taxpayer, which limits our rights and freedoms. Hundreds of thousands of injuries, limiting the freedoms of those shot, and tens of thousands of deaths, completely halting those freedoms.  
""Rights come from one of two places. Either they are granted by God, or they are formed in agreement among people. Since God, although an important part of American society, has no official place in American government, our system of rights is based on an implicit social contract, one in which the general goal is to maximize freedom. Only when the American public comes to its senses and realizes that guns cost more than they are worth, will we all agree to limit one freedom, to provide us with another.
""This is also known as the 'workability' argument, or by some, the 'I refuse to submit' argument. How can we possibly get people to 'give up their guns'? Well, as I indicated above, we can't, unless they are willing to. This is why I advocate explaining the costs of guns as much as possible, and fighting the gun lobby at every turn. Only when we convince gun owners that their guns are dangerous to the freedoms of others can we hope to succeed. If nobody buys the argument, and everybody wants guns, then all I can (and will) do is continue to attempt to persuade otherwise. But I believe that when looking at the problem honestly and evaluating the tremendous costs of guns to our freedoms, and their relatively minimal returns on such, we as a society will decide to maximize our freedoms by giving up the guns.""

A suppositional error based on what?
""The cost of firearm injuries in the US in 1990 was an estimated $20.4 billion.

Hundreds of thousands of injuries, limiting the freedoms of those shot, and tens of thousands of deaths, completely halting those freedoms.  
Let's see now. We can, in my opinion, automatically discount many of these cost. The bulk of deaths from firearms is in the criminal world, so lost productivity is somewhat of a misnomer, however, that's common with you GGs, isn't it? That 17.4 billion, mostly from criminal activity, would of course not be a savings to the taxpayer, anyway, so, in effect, this becomes a another red herring, designed to snooker the American Public.
Another fallcious thought process, as it deals not at all with the savings in human life and injury from the benevolent uses of a firearm each year. GGs like to , or, at least, used to like to make the comment, 'if gun control saves just one life?"" Well the question is, what if gun control takes one life? 
Only a minimum return in the eyes of advowed gun grabbers.

2,Banning guns means more freedom,gun control,attack,"Those versed in even rudimentary political science also recognise that ""Freedom"" is a subjective term. I understand why she chose to focus on ""freedom"" instead of ""rights"", since ""rights"" is a well documented, non-subjective term with a legal definition. 
""freedom"" is just a by-product of the existance of rights.
""
Wow, I didn't know that anybody wtill quoted the junk science in ""Shooting in the Dark: Estimating the Cost of Firearm Injuries"" (the max and rice article being quoted here). Here is how they came up with their numbers. They took the number of firearm deaths and injuries per year, and calculated their cost in lost time and wages using the average income data for AMerica. BAsically, they assumed that all those people are middle class. Oddly enough, in the same report, they cite a source which shows that over 80% of the medical costs of gunshot victims are born by the taxpayer. Why is the government paying hospital bills for the middle calss? They are not. THe fact is, over 80% of deaths due to guns is criminals killing each other. MOst shootings in this country are career criminals shooting it out. So, lets look at this another way. 
According to the DOJ, career criminals cost us on average $753,000 per year, per criminal. Take the 13000 people who were killed the year that report was written, multiply by .8 and you get 10,400. Multiply THAT by $753,000, and you get 7,831,200,000. That is what we saved that year by doing away with those people. That doesn;t even include the 100,000 who were shot and only injured, and it desn't include the benifits for years to come (we save over 7 billion EVERY year thereafter becasue those same career criminals are gone).
Our rights are pre-existing. They are endowed by our creator, or whatever you want to call it. The government does not have the power to grant, nor to limit rights. It as been argued (and there are several supreme court cses that seem to agree) that the rights in the bill of rights, since they pre-date the government, are not even open to ammendment. Limiting one freedom in order to secure another is fine. Limiting a right to obtain a percieved freedom is not acceptable.
Who was it that said ""he who would trade liberty for security deserves neither"" (paraphrase)?
IF you want to explain the costs, you need better data. You also need to factor in that over a million times a year, guns prevent crimes. 
No, pro gunners like rights, you can have all the freedoms you want. We just want our rights, which will preserve your freedoms, as well as our own. WE can actually document, using real numbers and approved methds of research, our side of the arument. It is a shame that the anti gunners are so far out in la la land that they have to resort to junk methodology and creative numebrs in an attempt to make their point.

It seems logical to assume that of the 17.4 billion, 13.9 billion is actually a gain, since 80% of those ""productivity losses"" are actually gains to the rest of siociety, so you end up with a net gain of 10.4 billion per year.

7,Banning guns means more freedom,gun control,attack,"""Guns in the United States - Easy Access to Deadly Weapons
There are approximately 192 million privately owned firearms in the U.S. - 65 million of which are handguns.[1]
Currently, an estimated 39% of households have a gun, while 24% have a handgun.[2]
In 1998 alone, licensed firearms dealers sold an estimated 4.4 million guns, 1.7 million of which were handguns.[3] Additionally, it is estimated that 1 to 3 million guns change hands in the secondary market each year, and many of these sales are not regulated.[4]
Gun Deaths and Injury - The United States Leads the World in Firearm Violence
In 1998, 30,708 people in the United States died from firearm-related deaths - 12,102 (39%) of those were murdered; 17,424 (57%) were suicides; 866 (3%) were accidents; and in 316 (1%) the intent was unknown.[5] In comparison, 33,651 Americans were killed in the Korean War and 58,193 Americans were killed in the Vietnam War.[6]
For every firearm fatality in the United States, there are two non-fatal firearm injuries.[7]
In 1996, handguns were used to murder 2 people in New Zealand, 15 in Japan, 30 in Great Britain, 106 in Canada and 9,390 in the United States.[8]
In 1999, there were only 154 justifiable homicides by private citizens in the United States.[9]
Gun Violence - Young Lives Cut Short
In 1998, more than 10 children and teenagers, ages 19 and under, were killed with guns everyday.[10]
In 1998, gunshot wounds were the second leading cause of injury death for men and women 10-24 years of age - second only to motor vehicle crashes.[11]
In 1998, firearm homicide was the leading cause of death for black males ages 15-34.[12]
From 1993 through 1997, an average of 1,409 children and teenagers took their own lives with guns each year.[13]
Each year during 1993 through 1997, an average of 1,621 murderers who had not reached their 18th birthdays took someone's life with a gun.[14]
Guns in the Home - A Greater Risk to Family and Friends
For every time a gun is used in a home in a legally-justifiable shooting [note that every self-defense is legally justifiable] there are 22 criminal, unintentional, and suicide-related shootings.[15]
The presence of a gun in the home triples the risk of homicide in the home.[16]
The presence of a gun in the home increases the risk of suicide fivefold.[17]
The Economic Costs of Gun Violence - All Americans Pay a High Price
A study of all direct and indirect costs of gun violence including medical, lost wages, and security costs estimates that gun violence costs the nation $100 billion a year.[18]
The average total cost of one gun crime can be as high as $1.79 million, including medical treatment and the prosecution and imprisonment of the shooter.[19]
At least 80 percent of the economic costs of treating firearm injuries are paid for by taxpayer dollars.[20,21]""

In addition, you have to subtract out the economic gains that come from the target-shooting and hunting industries that service about 100 million Americans.

The big difference btwn the DOJ numbers and the FBI numbers was that the DOJ didn't count defensive gun uses unless somebody was shot. The FBI, on the other hand, counted all instances they coud find involving somebody using a firearm defensively. They then used some method (honestly, I don't remember what it was, but I remember Reno admitting it was legitimate) to estimate the number of people who used a weapon defensively but did not report the encounter.
This was 1994, and it was the first time Reno came under serious attack for lying to the public. It was on the news for over a month (battle between the FBI and justice department over crime statistics). 
Again, this was regarding 1992, when crime in America was at its peak. crime has been declining pretty steadily since then (oddly enough, gun ownership has been increaseing). Also, the FBI did not report those numbers, the DOJ did.

For example, the NCVS factors out self-defense uses against animals and by military or law enforcement officers, etc. - a factor which other surveys may not. 
""It is important to note that in some defensive gun use surveys, a respondent's action of threatening the 'perpetrator' may be construed as an aggressive or conflict-escalating action by the 'perpetrator.'

More recent data regarding this subject from the NCVS are compiled by individuals who sort through and find the people who volunteer this information without being asked.
I believe that if you check any of the contemporary studies on the subject, you will find that not only do they adjust for this, but they ask a number of followup questions in order to weed these cases out. They also adjust for the number of LE uses, defense against animals, etc....
I don't think so. I took 3 semesters of statistics, and a sampling of 5000 household is HUGE when doing statistical research. Generally 600-1600 is more the norm.

31,Banning guns means more freedom,gun control,attack,"Dude. If your looking for a criminal reason to ban guns, take guns, register guns, or control guns; forget it. Your not fooling me. Your guessing on the effects of guns and crime:
""American gun owners spent most of the 1990s telling the CDC that gun control is ineffective at best and harmful at worst. So it's gratifying that the lesson is finally sinking in."" - http://www.nationalreview.com/commen...0310220911.asp
All that you just stated is a guess especially after ""just think..."". It is not reasonable, especially without proof and with your previous history of really bad logic.",30,32,topic_stance_votes_2

You said >> Banning guns means more freedom
Terral's reply >> The first line of defense for this great country is the armed forces. The second line of defense in this country is the state militias. The third line of defense is you and me. A gun never killed anyone; people do. A murderer can kill you just as fast with his bare hands. Suppose the 200 million man Chinese army decides to rush us. How free will we be then without guns? The fact that we are armed is our greatest defense. People like you are trying to set us up for a fall. Take our guns? Yea right,

Firstly - If there existed an armed forces capable of destroying the US military, then an armed civilian population would be absolutely no barrier to them.
Secondly - There is no single nation on earth that can move 200,000,000 men.
Thirdly - How exactly do you propose China get its men to the USA? Are they going to use their secrect commie teleporting machines? There is no chance for them to cross the oceans, or deploy either north or south of the USA.",34,36,topic_stance_votes_1

An armed population, for the Japanese army, would have been next to no problem at all, in practical terms.
Just as a side note, I am very much in favour of owning guns, but with restrictions. You should prove you are mentally sound and responsible, and be required to keep them in a manner making them in-accessable to children, or other people unable to operate them safely.",37,39,topic_stance_votes_1

40,Banning guns means more freedom,gun control,attack,The first loss of freedom is not the gun itself but the loss of the right to use the gun. The American way of life was based upon the right to kill those that offend. Our Bill of Rights was intended only to limit the powers of government in regard to the people. At the time of the founding of this nation it was perfectly legal to force others into a duel or even dip them in tar and ride them out of town on a rail simply for uttering an unpopular opinion or belief. A person cursing in public or staggering drunk might be gunned down with impunity for the shooter. In Shakespeare's day it wasn't unusual for an actor having to defend himself with a sword on stage as any patron who disliked the acting was likely to attack with sword. Knights who hacked down waiters for poor service were only given trivial fines. The American tradition was actually built upon the notion that violence was acceptable and a useful social tool.,1,41,topic_stance_votes_2

They were facing the local population, which the army would have destroyed in a set battle. The same is true of the US in ‘nam. There are also problems today in Iraq. If you know of a way of pacifying an armed population, please call the pentagon, they need to know.
The reality of an invasion is that the local people know the area, all hiding spots, and are defending there home and family. The invaders are far from home, and more concerned about keeping alive.",41,42,topic_stance_votes_2

43,Banning guns means more freedom,gun control,support,"The situation in Rome was a lot differnt than the modern world. in order to have any hope of beating the Roman army, you had to be able to field a massive, organised force. It was hand to hand combat against well trained and well equiped troops.
Today, you do not need a massive, organised force. A handful of insrugents is more than capable of harassing a well armed and well trained military. A collection fo these small groups is more than capable of defeating that same military.
Even in the case of the Romans, such practices as decimation eventually led to their downfall. When Atilla marched on rome, he started with less than 2000 men. He picked up hundreds of thousands on the way through, people dissatisfied with the Roamsn policies.
We have no idea how to win Iraq. Every time we engage in policies that allow for civilian deaths, we create more insurgents. We cannot simply carpet bomb the entire place, because that would be entirely out of line with our objectives (as would the complete destruction of vietnam).",43,44,topic_stance_votes_2
44,Banning guns means more freedom,gun control,support,"Like I said, it can be easily done if you're willing to accept serious collateral damage. Take Fallujah. We could bomb it and take out Sadr in an instance, but is the cost of that worth the effort? IMO, we haven't gotten that serious about winning at all costs, nor should we. 
And Atilla's army of as many as 1/2 million men was beaten and forced into retreat by the Romans and Visigoths in 451AD. A year later, he was forced to make peace after devastating the Roman countryside...but NOT Rome itself.
He died a year later in 453AD.
Agreed. But saying that ""we can't"" is different from ""we shouldn't"". We have the ability, just not the will to do so......which is a good thing, IMO.",44,45,topic_stance_votes_2

Within 2 weeks of doing somethng like that, I seriously doubt there would be an American serviceman left alive in all of Iraq as the result of the entire indigenous population turning against the US. I also would think we could expect terrorist attacks on an unprecendented scale, most likely done by terrorists operating with some pretty seriousl international support. America would not last a year after such an act.
Attila was bribed not to sack rome. Even though his army was eventually driven back, it was still the beginning of the end for the romans. After that, they were no longer able to control their empire.
Ypu are rigth, we CAN do it, but it would almost certainly lead to our ultimate defeat. We do not have a big enough military to take any but the smallest nation if their entire population is against us.",45,46,topic_stance_votes_2
