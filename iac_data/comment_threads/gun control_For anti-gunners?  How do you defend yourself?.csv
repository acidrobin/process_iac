That cavemen had the right to trial by jury, in cases involving more than $20.(Amendment VII)
How did cavemen vote for President? (Amendment XII)
You say that the constitution is just elaborating on rights that have always existed, then why the need to write them down?
If these rights always existed, then why can some constitutionally be added, then subtracted? (Amendment XVIII - Prohibition, then Amendment XXI - repealing Prohibition).
Obviously these rights are not absolute either, in that they haven’t always existed. American rights come about by winning a war against Britain, and entering into a social compact with fellow like-minded citizens. With powers given to a central authority to protect these rights and rules.
And the constitution gives the state the right to defend itself!
“The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason, but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted.”
Furthermore, if the Constitution does not restrict people, then how do you account for it emplacing limits on the voting age? Or, who can run for US President?
Moreover, if the Constitution does not restrict people, then why are your rights to carry guns less of value than an airliner’s right to forbid you to carry your guns onto an aeroplane? Who decided that the airliner had MORE right?

So, I'm trying to investigate if there are still exceptions made in this modified case.
Therefore, if someone such as RevHellbound is trying to make a case, but there are everyday exceptions even to his qualified case, then even he can not use the 2nd Amendment right as he has been doing.

You're welcome. I am happy, comrade that I don't 'get' you're argument.
But you do infringe on other people, or you would, except that the government keeps you from taking guns to court etc.
If your rights are being infringed by the government, the majority of Americans seem to have accepted it. As it is pretty much a democracy, then it is the right of the people to waive their own rights.
If they have always existed, then you're the one who hasn't 'got it' when I used my caveman analogy. What freeman rights did they have? Please explain how the Constitution has protected rights that have ALWAYS existed - they're your words. How long ago did people have the right to a fair trial for matters over $20.00?
Again you're caught out using silly absolutes.
American law stems from English Common Law. Show me (from your extensive historical knowledge) where the right to bear arms was guaranteed by English Common Law - or was this a 'right' that they never wrote down?
Exactly, and if it's an insecure state because a lot of people are carrying a lot of guns (because they fear the state) then the state has the right to protect itself.
If it's in the best interest of the state to legislate, and you agree to this, then you've got no cause to be angry with them if they want to take guns off people!

I will let FINDLAW do it for me.... Argue with this:
NINTH AMENDMENT
The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people
""Rights Retained by the People 
Aside from contending that a bill of rights was unnecessary, the Federalists responded to those opposing ratification of the Constitution because of the lack of a declaration of fundamental rights by arguing that inasmuch as it would be impossible to list all rights it would be dangerous to list some because there would be those who would seize on the absence of the omitted rights to assert that government was unrestrained as to those. 1 Madison adverted to this argument in presenting his proposed amendments to the House of Representatives. ''It has been objected also against a bill of rights, that, by enumerating particular exceptions to the grant of power, it would disparage those rights which were not placed in that enumeration; and it might follow by implication, that those rights which were not singled out, were intended to be assigned into the hands of the General Government, and were consequently insecure. This is one of the most plausible arguments I have ever heard against the admission of a bill of rights into this system; but, I conceive, that it may be guarded against. I have attempted it, as gentlemen may see by turning to the last clause of the fourth resolution.'' 2 It is clear from its text and from Madison's statement that the Amendment states but a rule of construction, making clear that a Bill of Rights might not by implication be taken to increase the powers of the national government in areas not enumerated, and that it does not contain within itself any guarantee of a right or a proscription of an infringement. 3 Recently, however, the Amendment has been construed to be positive affirmation of the existence of rights which are not enumerated but which are nonetheless protected by other provisions. 
The Ninth Amendment had been mentioned infrequently in decisions of the Supreme Court 4 until it became the subject of some exegesis by several of the Justices in Griswold v. Connecticut. 5 There a statute prohibiting use of contraceptives was voided as an infringement of the right of marital privacy. Justice Douglas, writing the opinion of the Court, asserted that the ''specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras, formed by emanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance.'' 6 Thus, while privacy is nowhere mentioned, it is one of the values served and protected by the First Amendment, through its protection of associational rights, and by the Third, the Fourth, and the Fifth Amendments as well. The Justice recurred to the text of the Ninth Amendment, apparently to support the thought that these penumbral rights are protected by one Amendment or a complex of Amendments despite the absence of a specific reference. Justice Goldberg, concurring, devoted several pages to the Amendment. 
''The language and history of the Ninth Amendment reveal that the Framers of the Constitution believed that there are additional fundamental rights, protected from governmental infringement, which exist alongside those fundamental rights specifically mentioned in the first eight constitutional amendments. . . . To hold that a right so basic and fundamental and so deep-rooted in our society as the right of privacy in marriage may be infringed because that right is not guaranteed in so many words by the first eight amendments to the Constitution is to ignore the Ninth Amendment and to give it no effect whatsoever. Moreover, a judicial construction that this fundamental right is not protected by the Constitution because it is not mentioned in explicit terms by one of the first eight amendments or elsewhere in the Constitution would violate the Ninth Amendment. . . . Nor do I mean to state that the Ninth Amendment constitutes an independent source of right protected from infringement by either the States or the Federal Government. Rather, the Ninth Amendment shows a belief of the Constitution's authors that fundamental rights exist that are not expressly enumerated in the first eight amendments and an intent that the list of rights included there not be deemed exhaustive.'' 7 While, therefore, neither opinion sought to make of the Ninth Amendment a substantive source of constitutional guarantees, both did read it as indicating a function of the courts to interpose a veto with regard to legislative and executive efforts to abridge other fundamental rights. In this case, both opinions seemed to concur that the fundamental right claimed and upheld was derivative of several express rights and in this case, really, the Ninth Amendment added almost nothing to the argument. But if there is a claim of a fundamental right which cannot reasonably be derived from one of the provisions of the Bill of Rights, even with the Ninth Amendment, how is the Court to determine, first, that it is fundamental, and second, that it is protected from abridgment? 8 ""
Also:
""(1) The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution does not establish the right to keep and bear arms. None of the provisions of the Constitution establish any ""natural"" rights. They recognize such rights, but the repeal of such provisions would not end such rights. Such rights were considered by many of the Framers as obvious or ""self-evident"", but they were immersed in the prevailing republican thought of the day, as expressed in the writings of Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Madison, Hamilton, and others, which discussed ""natural rights"" in some detail. Others argued that at least some of the rights needed to be made explicit in the Bill of Rights to avoid having future generations with less understanding of republican theory weaken in their defense of those rights. That has turned out to have been a good idea""
Legal Theory of the Right to Keep and Bear Arms
I have done the research for you. 
Are you that lazy.... FInd it yourself... heres a taste from the above link:
""(2) The right to keep and bear arms is a natural right of individuals under the theory of democratic government. This was clearly the understanding and intent of the Framers of the U.S. Constitution and was a long-established principle of English common law at the time the Constitution was adopted, which is considered to be a part of constitutional law for purposes of interpreting the written Constitution.""
You trust government more than you trust people. I trust the people more than I trust governments. This century alone governments have been responsible for over 170 MILLION deaths. How many have ""the people"" been responsible for...

I don't know if a seat belt is a good analogy as far as I'm concerned. More like wearing a helmet and full body protection every time you walk down the street.
I don't think the state should legislate whether you can carry a gun, but I think for most people carrying a gun all the time is over-self-protective.

On gun control in general-
""Gun control in the US has always been directed primarily at minorities, especially blacks. Until fairly recently (1950s forward and even then spotty), black-on-black crime wasn't taken seriously at all; so long as no white bodies turned up, racist inner-city cops didn't care. The actual police slang term for violence in the black areas of town circa 1890 to well into the 20th century was ""just another niggertown Saturday night"" which is where the gun-banners get the term ""Saturday night special"" for low-end handguns. NOT an accident, that.
While gun control laws appeared to be written in a race-neutral fashion after the passage of the 14th Amendment of 1868, the reality was different. As Justice Buford of the Florida Supreme Court noted in a 1941 case involving a white guy *freed* despite packing without a carry permit put it: 
""I know something of the history of this legislation. The original Act of 1893 was passed when there was a great influx of negro laborers in this State drawn here for the purpose of working in turpentine and lumber camps. The same condition existed when the Act was amended in 1901 and the Act was passed for the purpose of disarming the negro laborers and to thereby reduce the unlawful homicides that were prevalent in turpentine and saw-mill camps and to give the white citizens in sparsely settled areas a better feeling of security. The statute was never intended to be applied to the white population and in practice has never been so applied."" Watson v. Stone, 4 So.2d 700, 703 (Fla. 1941) from Clayton Cramer's Racist Roots Of Gun Control: 
(Note: Buford partially lied. What happened in 1893 was that a Klan raiding party tried to hit a black township just outside of Gainsville. The ""brothas"" shot the bejeezus out of 'em with leverguns and revolvers (yea!). Guess which guns were specifically targeted for permits in Florida in 1893? Yup. Leverguns and revolvers.)
So here's what's happening today: the cities with the highest black populations also have the heaviest gun control: New York, Boston, Washington DC, Chicago, Los Angeles and similar, and until very recently (2001) Detroit. The cities with the least gun control such as Dallas, Seattle, Portland OR and similar have the lowest minority populations.""

28,For anti-gunners?  How do you defend yourself?,gun control,attack,"Effectively your argument is that; the right to carry arms is a natural right, although you've no proof of what is a 'natural right'. Nor have you shown that this right has always existed... just that the founding fathers believed that these rights always existed... but then they would because they were trying to legitimate armed rebellion. Their rationale was they were rebelling against a legitimate authority, by stating that there was some higher authority which the state itself was in conflict with - rather a simple, but novel argument - and therefore they were just rebelling to restore this over-arching authority.
Natural rights don't exist at all. How does a right 'just exist' ie. naturally?
http://www.spectacle.org/0400/natural.html
However, I don't expect you'll agree to that tract. So let's look at what you said.
Firstly the Ninth Amendment is superfluous to your argument. You are trying to state that some rights have existed 'naturally' and the Constitution only vocalises some of them. But, what of these...? What are these natural rights that are not mentioned? Do the courts enunciate what they are?
You said...
A-hem. Some freemen. It is not an absolute right. It never was. I asked you where do we find this 'natural right' to carry weapons? US laws somewhat stems from British laws; where did this right exist before it was mentioned in the Constitution? Or, did it just exist in man's hearts?
Your web-site further claims "" The right to keep and bear arms is a natural right of individuals under the theory of democratic government. This was clearly the understanding and intent of the Framers of the U.S. Constitution and was a long-established principle of English common law at the time the Constitution was adopted, which is considered to be a part of constitutional law for purposes of interpreting the written Constitution.""
http://www.constitution.org/leglrkba.htm
So, it at least is trying to say that this 'right' has existed in long-established principles in English common law! And, then, where might they be expressed? (Or are they just too suggesting it existed in the ether)
What about?
The U.K. Bill of Rights (1689)
That the subjects which are Protestants may have arms for their defence suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law. It is not a 'natural' right. It is a legislated right.
So, it's not all freemen, just some. Actually it was also in practice on propertied Protestants too! So much for being a universal, therefore natural right!
Well, if you believe that this is a 'natural right' it only applies to non-Catholics, and is conditional by the law. Hardly a 'natural right'. Further, hardly a long-established principle. One web-site suggests also the Magna Carta of 1215, but as this in principle again only was related to the rights of Churchmen and nobles, it suggests to that you don't have this as a precedent of a 'long-established principle of English law' guaranteeing the rights of all freemen.
You need too to understand that they (the English in 1688) had also ejected a legitimate government out - not over taxes, but because James II Stuart had a Catholic heir. By usurping traditional power they had to appeal to a higher authority.
Either it has and has never been set down before the American revolution, or, it has. If the later, then where is it. If the former, then what proof do you have that this 'natural right' has always existed?
Therefore as far as a 'natural right' existing, the right to bear arms doesn't seem very natural! It never applied to all freemen.
Until you can prove that this right to bear arms is 'natural'... then I must look at how the 'right' has been enacted.
How have Americans viewed this right and law?

AYMETTE v. THE STATE (1840)
""When, therefore, (the British) Parliament says that ""subjects which are Protestants may have arms for their defence, suitable to their condition, as allowed by law,"" it does not mean for private defence, but, being armed, they may as a body rise up to defend their just rights, and compel their rulers to respect the laws. This declaration of right is made in reference to the fact before complained of, that the people had been disarmed, and soldiers had been quartered among them contrary to law. The complaint was against the government. The grievances to which they were thus forced to submit were for the most part of a public character, and could have been redressed only by the people rising up for their common defence, to vindicate their rights.""
The section under consideration, in our bill of rights, was adopted in reference to these historical facts, and in this point
of view its language is most appropriate and expressive. Its words are, ""the free white men of this state have a right to keep and
bear arms for their common defence.""
and
""hey need not, for such a purpose, the use of those weapons which are usually employed in private broils, and which are efficient only in the hands of the robber and the assassin. These weapons would be useless in war. ""

At best this means you better hand in your glock!

We can't have every loony carrying guns around, if we did, gun related homicides would sky-rocket. Ooops, that's what's happening in America isn't it!
This interpretation of a 'natural right' suggests you don't need a gun for your own safety, as you seem to believe.
So, the state has always legislated and defined this right. That's what states are for - a referee or umpire to settle disputes in law. Further for the good of the people, the people have handed power over to the state. You might want to read Hobbes on this.",23,29,topic_stance_votes_1

GOA Fact Sheet
A. Myth #1: If one has a gun in the home, one is three times more likely to be killed than if there is no gun present. 
1. Dr. Edgar Suter has pointed out that studies which make such claims are flawed because they fail to consider the number of lives saved by guns. That is, such claims ignore the vast number of non-lethal defensive uses with firearms.128 
2. Criminologists have found that citizens use firearms as often as 2.5 million times every year in self-defense. In over 90% of these defensive uses, citizens merely brandish their gun or fire a warning shot to scare off the attacker.129 
* Guns used 2.5 million times a year in self-defense. Law-abiding citizens use guns to defend themselves against criminals as many as 2.5 million times every year -- or about 6,850 times a day.1 This means that each year, firearms are used more than 60 times more often to protect the lives of honest citizens than to take lives.2 
* Anti-gun Clinton researchers find an annual total of 1.5 million self-defense cases. According to the Clinton Justice Department, there are as many as 1.5 million cases of self-defense every year. The National Institute of Justice published this figure in 1997 as part of ""Guns in America"" -- a study which was authored by noted anti-gun criminologists Philip Cook and Jens Ludwig.3 
* Concealed carry laws have dropped murder and crime rates in the states that have enacted them. According to a comprehensive study which studied crime statistics in all of the counties in the United States from 1977 to 1992, states which passed concealed carry laws reduced their murder rate by 8.5%, rapes by 5%, aggravated assaults by 7% and robbery by 3%.4 
* Anti-gun journal pronounces the failure of the Brady law. One of the nation's leading anti-gun medical publications, the Journal of the American Medical Association, found that the Brady registration law has failed to reduce murder rates. In August 2000, JAMA reported that states implementing waiting periods and background checks did ""not [experience] reductions in homicide rates or overall suicide rates.""5 
* More children are killed playing football in school than they are by guns. That's right. Despite what media coverage might seem to indicate, more children die playing high school football, than they do by firearms at school. The most recent year on record shows that 18 football players died during the school year ending in June, 2000 (from hits to the head, heat stroke, etc.), as compared with 9 students by firearms.6",52,54,topic_stance_votes_2

Kleck surveyed about 5,000 people to reach his 2.5 million figure.
How do you know that the drop in crime was because of concealed carry laws? Areas that don't allow people to carry concealed weapons also have experienced drops in crime. Consider Washington DC for example.

Houston v. Moore 1820
""[The immediate issue in this case was federal and state jurisdiction to try non-compliance with militia orders. The context provides much enlightenment on the militia institution. Militia duty was conscript duty. Militiamen were governed by the rules and articles of war. The Militia Acts were the precursors of the selective service acts of the twentieth century. There was NO mention of a ""personal right"" to be armed outside of lawful authority. Houston v. Moore is provided here for further enlightenment to interested parties as Appendix W to US v. Emerson.

AYMETTE v. THE STATE (1840)
""When, therefore, (the British) Parliament says that ""subjects which are Protestants may have arms for their defence, suitable to their condition, as allowed by law,"" it does not mean for private defence, but, being armed, they may as a body rise up to defend their just rights, and compel their rulers to respect the laws. This declaration of right is made in reference to the fact before complained of, that the people had been disarmed, and soldiers had been quartered among them contrary to law. The complaint was against the government. The grievances to which they were thus forced to submit were for the most part of a public character, and could have been redressed only by the people rising up for their common defence, to vindicate their rights.""
The section under consideration, in our bill of rights, was adopted in reference to these historical facts, and in this point
of view its language is most appropriate and expressive. Its words are, ""the free white men of this state have a right to keep and
bear arms for their common defence.""
and
""hey need not, for such a purpose, the use of those weapons which are usually employed in private broils, and which are efficient only in the hands of the robber and the assassin. These weapons would be useless in war. ""

Further before you dismiss Kleck read the footnote:
1 Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz, ""Armed Resistance to Crime: The Prevalence and Nature of Self-Defense With a Gun,"" 86 The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology, Northwestern University School of Law, 1 (Fall 1995):164. 
Dr. Kleck is a professor in the school of criminology and criminal justice at Florida State University in Tallahassee. He has researched extensively and published several essays on the gun control issue. His book, Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America, has become a widely cited source in the gun control debate. In fact, this book earned Dr. Kleck the prestigious American Society of Criminology Michael J. Hindelang award for 1993. This award is given for the book published in the past two to three years that makes the most outstanding contribution to criminology. 
Even those who don't like the conclusions Dr. Kleck reaches, cannot argue with his impeccable research and methodology. In ""A Tribute to a View I Have Opposed,"" Marvin E. Wolfgang writes that, ""What troubles me is the article by Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz. The reason I am troubled is that they have provided an almost clear-cut case of methodologically sound research in support of something I have theoretically opposed for years, namely, the use of a gun in defense against a criminal perpetrator.... I have to admit my admiration for the care and caution expressed in this article and this research. Can it be true that about two million instances occur each year in which a gun was used as a defensive measure against crime? It is hard to believe. Yet, it is hard to challenge the data collected. We do not have contrary evidence."" Wolfgang, ""A Tribute to a View I Have Opposed,"" The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology, at 188. 
Hmm... lame attempt to marginalize me aside. Sept. 11th had a big impact on crime all over the nation as people became more reflective of the times.
