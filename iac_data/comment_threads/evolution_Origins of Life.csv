Many arguments are made about whether creation or evolution should be taught in our schools. I believe in creationism because I have never met an evolutionist who can explain where the very first sign of life came from.
Can something not alive give birth to life? Can something not alive change to be alive? The answer to both questions is NO!
There are many things I don't know, but two things I do know are science will never create anything from nothing and science will never create life from nonlife.
I still think that it takes more faith to believe in evolution than it does to believe in our creator",0,1,topic_stance_votes_2

12,Origins of Life,evolution,support,"What I find to be interesting is that creationists attack science and evolution on the basis that everything must have a source. Except they are clearly hypocrites when it comes to applying that bit of logic to their own beliefs. 
Also, as hunter has pointed out, creationists don't understand evolution. He links something outside of evolution as a part evolution. Using abiogenesis as a proxy attack upon evolution is a common, fradulent method of creationists. Abiogenesis could easily be wrong but that does not make evolution false. In my opinion, hunter's mind would explode if he found out God created the very first living organism which then marched forth in a evolutionary textbook fashion to modern life. 
In addition, hunter's comments show a clear sign of impatience and weakness. Merely because evolution cannot explain everything now, creation must be correct. That is weakness and impatience. The inability to wait for the answers without embracing evidenceless explantions.
I also find it amusing that people like hunter resort to faith for their beliefs. Faith is a belief in something completely without proof (dictionary). Yet evolution has moutains of proof. He rejects the things that has evidence for the idea that has absolutely none.

35,Origins of Life,evolution,attack,"Hunter, c'mon... You should know better than this by now. How many times has it been explained to you? The theory of evolution doesn't 'avoid' the creation of the universe. Rather the creation of the universe is outside of the scope of the theory of evolution. The theory is not intended to explain the creation of the universe. You'll have to look elsewhere to explore answers to that question.
What good is it? I certainly don't have the knowledge to answer that question in totality, but one area that the theory has significant practical value is in researching how bacteria and/or viruses evolve. Understanding evolutionary theory in this realm can presumably help prevent significant outbreaks of disease. (Anyone with more specific knowledge of the topic, please feel free to amend or add to the idea.) Understanding evolutionary theory can also help us understand how life has changed over the millions of years that it has existed on this planet... and how it continues to change.
You tell me, then we'll both know. Who is trying to debunk that idea? The concept of God is outside the scope of evolutionary theory. It is certainly conceivable that some metaphysical energy or a specific entity is and continues to be the driving force behind evolution. However, such an entity is outside the knowledge of the physical world in which we exist. Belief of such an entity is possible... but not knowledge.
And from where did you get this idea? Please provide your references.
You'll probably get as many different answers to such a question as there are 'evolutionists.' (Whatever it is you mean by that term.) There are over a billion Christians whose personal faith and relationship with their Savior does not conflict with the reality of evolution. Try asking one of them.

You think? Why is that? What relevance does it have to your life or mine if we understand how life began? It is an interesting question and it may give some insights that benefit humanity in the future, once we have more than hypotheses to answer the question. I do know that two viruses have been constructed from scratch in the lab. One has been tested and is indistinguishible from the original. The other is polio, and the DNA sequence is identical to the real virus. It reproduces in culture but, of course, has not been tested.
There is also the fact that self propagating molecules have been produced in the lab. Some are enclosed in lipid membranes, similar to cellular membranes. We don't know where research into abiogenesis will lead at this point, but I agree that it is an important field of research. If it yields half of the benefit to humankind that evolutionary theory has, then it will be worth the effort.
Good question! If plumbing avoids the creation of the universe and life as we know it, what good is it? If nuclear physics avoids the creation of the universe and life as we know it, what good is it? If medicine avoids the creation of the universe and life as we know it, what good is it? If archetecture avoids the creation of the universe and life as we know it, what good is it?
The answer is quite simple unless you are a simpleton. None of them have anything to do with the creation of the universe and life as we know it. By the way, the creation of the universe and life (as we know it) aren't actully the same question either.
I don't know. Who is doing that. Certainly not me. I guess the difference is that I don't try to instruct God on how He accomplished His creation. You seem to believe that you have some special knowledge. Does God talk to you?
First, how is that relevant?
Second, I think that you should look into Spinoza's idea of God, since Einstein stated that his God was the God of Spinoza. Spinoza's God was nature itself. According to Spinoza and Einstein, nature is the creator of everything.
Nice assertion. One must wonder why your God chose to create man with more than 98% similarity to chimpanzees. I look at morphology, physiology, anatomy, and DNA analysis and conclude that chimps and humans have a common ancestor. You read a book of mythology and superstition and conclude otherwise.

I will spot you the soup it still has to come alive-to spontaneously generate.
Peer reviewed evidence is you know what that is.
Evolution started to look like a theory in search of a soup-45 years later it still does.

Organic material in the early atmosphere? What are you talking about . Organic material comes from living or formerly living things -leaves , grass , people poop etc.
Are you saying there were such things in the atmosphere before they existed on the planets surface?

84,Origins of Life,evolution,attack,"Okay the concensous is there are probably hydrocarbons on Titan. What does this have to do with the spontaneous generation of life? Pre-biotic natural selection is a contradiction in terms. Dead things tend to stay dead.
Give me one example in the history of the world of matter generating the information of life.
Saturn’s giant moon, Titan, has an atmosphere
composed mainly of molecular nitrogen and up to 10 per
cent methane. Carl Sagan and Bishun Khare of Cornell
University simulated the pressure and composition of
Titan’s atmosphere and irradiated the gases with charged
particles. A dark solid was formed, which on dissolving
in water yielded amino acids and traces of nucleotide bases,
polycyclic hydrocarbons and many other compounds. It
was then assumed that from this ‘wonderful brew’ life
would have originated.17 In the text Molecular Biology
of the Cell the authors note that experimentalists are
In 1992 Han and Runnegar made a discovery which
impinged on discussions of oxygen evolution during the
Precambrian. To everyone’s surprise they reported the
spiral algal fossil Grypania within banded iron formations
(BIFs) in Michigan, USA. Algae require oxygen, so their
existence at this juncture shows banded iron formations
do not necessarily indicate global anoxic conditions.
Indeed, as early as 1980 two reports appeared on the
discovery of stromatolites in the 3.4–3.5 Ga Warrawoona
Group sediments from the Pilbara Block, Australia.6,7
Similar remains were also discovered in Zimbabwe8 and
South Africa.9
It is fair to conclude that the Earth’s early atmosphere
before 3.5 Ga could have significant quantities of oxygen.
This should discourage the sort of hypothesising on abiotic
monomer and polymer syntheses so often assumed to have
occurred in Archaean times. Robert Riding says that the
Grypania discovery
‘could spell the end of BIF-dominated models of
oxygen build-up in the early atmosphere . . . The cat
really will be put among the pigeons, however, if
[further] fossil discoveries extend the eukaryote record
back much beyond 2200 million years ago, into what
is still widely perceived to have been an essentially
anaerobic world.
SCENARIOS FOR PREBIOLOGY
A number of revised textbooks on molecular biology
came out in 1994–1995 which, while conveying the
standard arguments for origin-of-life hypotheses, are
cautious in their affirmation. Rightly so, because advances
in the field have uncovered exquisite details of intracellular
processes. These challenge superficial explanations that
their origin and subsequent refinement were fed by
randomness. After mentioning the famous simulation by
Miller and Urey of prebiotic synthesis of organic
compounds (Figure 1), Voet and Voet handle the riddle of
the formation of biological monomers with a caveat. They
write:
‘Keep in mind, however, that there are valid scientific
objections to this scenario as well as to the several
others that have been seriously entertained so that we
are far from certain as to how life arose.
The text of Molecular Cell Biology in its second
edition was well indexed on the evolution of cells,
describing the Miller experiment in detail. The third
edition has dropped the chapter on evolution of cells found
in the second edition. Similarly, Stryer’s fourth edition
of his textbook on biochemistry makes no mention of the
abiotic synthesis of organic molecules.
‘Doubt has arisen because recent investigations
indicate the earth’s atmosphere was never as reducing
as Urey and Miller presumed. I suspect that many
organic compounds generated in past studies would
have been produced even in an atmosphere containing
Simplified apparatus for abiotic synthesis of organic
compounds as performed originally by Miller and Urey. By
varying the mixture of gases, including using volcanic gases
of today, experimenters have been able to produce many
types of organic compound",84,85,topic_stance_votes_2

86,Origins of Life,evolution,support,"Actually, the Bible doesn't teach that. That line or something similar has been attributed to various people, including Mark Twain, Abraham Lincoln, Samuel Johnson, George Eliot, Groucho Marx, and Albert Einstein, and probably others. It is sometimes stated as, ""Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubt."" Other times is is seen as, ""It is better to remain silent and be thought a fool, than open one's mouth and remove all doubt."" Sometimes it is more or less garbled, as you have it.
I think that maybe since you don't seem to be familiar with the Bible or to understand what it teaches you are confused by Proverbs 17:28, "" Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding."" But that verse doesn't convey the bite of the actual quote of unknown origin, being a bit bland.
As for reading the Bible. I wouldn't recommend it. It is for the most part boring, full of archaically worded mythology, superstition, and dietary law, intermingled with stories of savagery and barbarism performed either by or on behalf of an ultimately weak, petty, and vindictive superbeing.",86,87,topic_stance_votes_1
