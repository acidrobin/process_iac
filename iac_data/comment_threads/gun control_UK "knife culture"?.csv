THE number of crimes involving knives on the streets of England and Wales has risen dramatically in the past year, with huge increases in their use during robberies, mugging and violent attacks on strangers. 
Attacks in which a knife was used during a mugging rose by 73 per cent while there was a 55 per cent increase in random attacks with knives on strangers

Which prompted me to investigate violent crime rates per capita. Guess what I found:
http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdf...1206chap78.pdf
Pg 119. Violent crime rates 2,300 per 100,000.
Now compare that to the FBI data for the US. Note: 2005 is the last year for which data is available. http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/05cius/data/table_01.html
Violent crime rate, US = 469.2 per 100,000.
Wow.
A nation of Gun nuts has 469.2 violent crimes per 100,000 while our gentle gun-banning erstwhile countrymen have 2300.
Wow.
It would appear that it is the Brits, rather than “the Gun Nuts” who “claim that when guns are banned people will just use knives instead”. Apparently they have moved beyond knives and are simply using whatever tool is available to commit violent crime. They are succeeding at a rate nearly 5 times that of the US ""gun culture"".

12,"UK ""knife culture""?",gun control,attack,"The claim that the UK is five times more violent than the US is based on a comparison between the BCS (British Crime Survey) data and FBI data. The BCS is a criminal victimization survey (people are randomly selected and interviewed about their experiences with crime) while the FBI data is based on crime reported to law enforcement. Not all crime is reported to the police so it's not surprising that the BCS numbers are higher. 
As for the knife culture of the UK, people are less likely to die from knife wounds than gun wounds. Guns make it easier to kill at a distance which makes it harder for a victim to run away. You might be able to outrun a person with a knife, but it's harder to outrun a bullet. 
""An attack committed with bare hands or a blunt instrument requires sustained effort against a victim who is actively trying to fight back or flee. These attacks often result in hospitalization followed by recovery. Using a knife decreases the victim's chances of survival, but still he/she may be able to fight or flee. A gun, however, allows the assailant to kill or wound in an instant, and to attack from a distance. Gunshot wounds are much more likely to be lethal – the reason that armies are equipped with firearms (For an overview of the lethality of firearms see Cukier and Sidel (3)). Several studies have highlighted this lethality (4, 5). A comparison of hospital admissions of wound victims in South Africa found that 6% of knife wounds were fatal, while 28% of those with firearm wounds died. In Zambia, patients with firearm wounds required longer stays in hospital, and were admitted more frequently into intensive care units (ICU), and required more X-rays than contusions (6). When firearms have replaced traditional weapons in societies with pre-existing patterns of violence, observers found a marked increase in the lethality and destructiveness of conflict.""

13,"UK ""knife culture""?",gun control,attack,"This whole statement is nothing more than a complete fallacy, brought on by the supporters of gun control to try and scare people. Watch as I destroy it with my real world knowledge.
The first statement ""As for the knife culture of the UK, people are less likely to die from knife wounds than gun wounds"" this is just completely false. A knife wound can just as easily lead to your death as a gun wound, and the lethality of each relies on a little something us in the game of target shooting refer to as ""placement"". Whether you're shot or simply stabbed, you're highly unlikely to die or bleed to death if you're hit in a nonvital area like the shoulder or the hand or the thigh, because there just plain isn't that much in the way that qualifies as a vital sector.
The way people die when shot or stabbed is when a major blood vessle is damaged, resorting in heavy blood loss in a very short amount of time, or a vital organ or the nervous system is dealt a critical XXXX. And this can be acheived easily with either a knife, gun or any other type of impliment. Some might argue a knife is even MORE deadly than a gun because once the blade enters your body it keeps following a single course and won't fragment like a bullet, allowing it to penetrate deeper.
The second statement ""Guns make it easier to kill at a distance which makes it harder for a victim to run away"" is completely illogical. While it's true guns are better for use as a distance tool than a knife, that doesn't necessarily make it any easier to kill someone. If you can't aim properly and you can't hit what you're trying to aim at then you're not doing much as all except wasting money, and ammo is getting to be very expensive these days. And anybody who hasn't practiced heavily with their guns will tell you, hitting a moving target is very, if not extremely, difficult. If somebody is jumping around and not allowing you to do a target acquisition then by the time you fire they're likely going to be somewhere else when the bullet leaves your gun.
The third statement ""You might be able to outrun a person with a knife, but it's harder to outrun a bullet"" is just plain crazy. This assumes that you're actually trying to avoid being shot by running faster than the bullet will travel. As with the second statement, guns are only dangerous if they can actually hit something, otherwise they're nothing more than an expensive noisemaker. It's not a matter of having to outrun a bullet, it's a matter of not being in the direct path of a bullet, and this is actually easier than it sounds. 
And if you run away from an attacker, you're actually gonna be more likely to be murdered if you force them to give chase to you when they have a knife. They don't want a hassle, and if you give it to them they might murder you out of anger when they had no plans to.

I have some difficulty in understanding why some people think that weapons cause crime. I have more difficulty in understanding why some people think that laws can successfully extract guns from the hands of criminals and make us safe. To inact a law that makes a crime of illegal gun ownership has no effect on criminal ownership of guns. Regardless of where they got them, they are not going to turn them in.
It is obviously better to be armed than not these days. It's been that way from centuries. It will remain that way for centuries to come. Every single person that advocates more gun control is apparently blind to this fact of life. The fighter with a suitable weapon and the sense to use it usually wins the fight.
The gun control advocates are correct about one thing...we shouldn't need weapons. That's because we should be obeying laws and not attacking, robbing, raping or otherwise infringing on the rights of others. We just shouldn't be doing those things. However, the true facts of life and the difficulty in getting through it without encountering violence dictate that weapons are required to be in the hands of law abiding citizens so they can protect themselves from being overrun by lawless criminals that maintain their right to bear arms regardless of what the would-be gun controllers say.

The simplest answer to the problems that criminals aren't going to give up their guns is here. In a place with strict gun laws from the word go (such as the UK), gun crime and homicide is way down compared with the US - see my link above. Obviously you can't make the US like the UK by dimply changing the law - you also have to make illegal ownership of a weapon a very difficult thing, and/or bring in legislation slowly so that the change filters through.
Until it can be shown that more people protect themselves by use of firearm than are injured/killed by legally obtained firearms (which, incidentally, looks like being not the case), I hold that gun control is the best way to reduce violence and fatalities.

These are completely irrelevant.

Instead, a much better measure of gun abuse is just that - to look at the percentage value of gun ownership in each state. Luckily, such a table is available here.

DC, with it's 'strictest gun laws', only denies guns to those who have broken the law or are homeless ('keeping bawdy or disorderly house' refers to a brothel, not to messiness). Compare these with laws such as the UK's, where gun permits are only for legitimate sport- or work-related activities, and 'self-defence' has not been a valid reason for gun ownership in over 50 years, and you quickly see that whether the tiny fraction of the population with a drugs conviction can get access to a gun or not is really quite irrelevant.

It's hardly surprising that it's crime rates are higher than anywhere else, because populations centres are breeding grounds for crime - high pop. density results in a massive difficulty in controlling and/or enforcing the law.
In places like London, where the pop. dens. is similarly high, tackling gun crime has had a good effect, but only if massive campaigns are launched. As I showed with my link earlier, actively removing guns does genuinely cut down on crime - but you have to make that effort.

They would guess, because the state you live in has lax gun laws.
I point you towards the recent trends in 'safe rooms'. Better yet, however, is to get out of the house.
If you have a gun, or the invaders suspect that you have a gun (see my first reply) then it is much more likely that a home invasion will turn violent.
I would say that your scenario is more ridiculous. The idea that someone would break into your house specifically for the purpose of hurting you is far-fetched in the extreme. You've been watching too much Saw/Funny Games/[other exploitation film].
A home invader does not know whether anyone has guns in the house. However, depending on the laws on guns, you will be much more or much less likely to have one in your possession. If you are a threat (more likely to have a gun), you may well scare people off, but you may well do nothing but make yourself a target. So, a situation for you:
Some men break into your house during the day. They saw an open window, assumed everyone would be out, and decided to jump in, grab some stuff and get out again. If your state has particularly/unenforced carrying/concealment laws, they may well be armed. They hear noises upstairs. Normally, that would be enough to send some people away - the mere risk of discovery. It could even be that the risk you have a gun will be just enough extra to scare them away, but a burglar alarm, or obvious CCTV camera(s) would do exactly the same - intimidation. If they don't leave they instead have to react to you. Should this be a pro-gun state they may fear that you are armed (but stay regardless, see the above sentence) and decide to try and get rid of you before you can get to them - you would then be in trouble, regardless of whether you actually have a gun or not, or if you realised that you weren't in a safe position or not. If this isn't a pro-gun state and they have decided to stay regardless of the risk of being caught, they can more or less ignore you. They take what they can grab and leave. You lose property, claim it on insurance, nothing has changed.
No, they are packing guns because the state has lax gun laws and because they fear that you might also have a gun (again, because of lax laws).",66,67,topic_stance_votes_1
67,"UK ""knife culture""?",gun control,attack,"Obviously not lax enough for a criminal to get one, but lax enough for normal people to get one. Now stop dodging my question and please answer.
Lax gun laws will prevent even small criminals from getting their hands on them. No state has so lax of gun laws that criminals can get their hands on a carry licence. And even if they did, what kind of criminal would go through all that trouble when they can just conceal it illegally, which is what nearly all criminals do. Surprisingly, CCW holders account for nearly zero percent of gun crime. Most gun crime is committed with illegal guns anyway.
That said, lets stop using the ""lax law"" argument.
How many people do you think can really afford a safe room?
Criminals aren't stupid. They will not enter a house if they suspect someone inside has a gun unless they're trying to commit suicide.
Even so, people have a right to defend themselves, not matter how small the chance of attack is. Would you tell this to the victims of a violent home invasion?
Then why were you suggesting above that they do?
Chances are, the burglar is coming after you. Solo room clearing is suicide, and chances are you are highly trained with your weapon, and he is not. If you do it right, the odds of you getting shot are slim.
Again, criminals would usually not go through the trouble of aquiring legal firearms. And, if they are armed, chances are they are not going to be just ""stealing some stuff"".

Source on the bold? Besides, you miss my point. 'Lax laws' means that it is possible to carry a concealed weapon legally. This means that there is less likely to be enforcement against illegal weapons being carried in this manner.
I'm in full agreement that adding laws on their own will not change anything. But enforcing those laws will have an effect. You're focusing on the 'law', and ignoring the 'enforcement', which is ignoring the larger half of my argument.
This is provably false - the are burglaries and home invasions carried out in states where gun control is minimal. The threat of gun ownership is not sucessfull in these cases.
Then why are all weapons not legal? After all, all of them can be used for 'defence'.
Mace, tazers, stun guns... I have nothing against defencive weaponry such as these, which are hard to use in an offensive manner.
You're confusing 'know' with 'suspect'. To clarify, criminals do not 'know' if the owner of a house has a gun. They may 'suspect', however, depending on the gun laws of the state.
Whoever said 'solo'? The only one you know to be alone in these situations is you, unless you happen to be having an NRA meeting at the time.
Why not? If you were to go into a house where there was a risk of being caught, you would want some manner of protection/intimidation against potential homeowners/dogs, regardless of whether the homeowner may be armed or not.

There is no such thing as lax laws like that. What you are proposing is anarchy. Lax laws means that criminals are not allowed to carry, however responsible citizens are. If the Brady bunch had their way, over 1,199,287 more people would be dead by the beginning of this year. Roughly one person would die every minute if guns were banned.
http://www.pulpless.com/gunclock/noframedex.html
You said ""lax laws"", but you are talking about ""no laws"".
Of course, but I highly doubt there is nearly as much. Reasonable gun control laws will not magically bring all burglaries to a halt.
See above.
Because not all of them are practical. You can't defend yourself with an M249 SAW, but you can with a Handgun. An RPG won't stop a home invasion, but a shotgun will. Obviously I'm not for legalizing these weapons.
A nuclear bomb could be used for defense, but his is not legal for obvious reasons.
For these two work, the criminal has to be awfully close to you. I would rather make sure They didn't come that close.
If they 'suspect', then they will stay out of the house. They would rather go to a house with no guns then most likely be shot in a house with one.
Burglars aren't highly trained special ops teams. They're street thugs. They don't know how to clear rooms or even shoot straight for that manner. If you have a gun, you are highly trained because the laws usually require it. Chances are you will take them out before they set foot in your bedroom.

Not at all. Your question was the following: ""If someone had a gun concealed and on them, do you think they are more or less likely to die in a violent attack?"", not ""are you more or less likely to die if you defend yourself"".
The rationale is, as I also stated, that a state which allows CCW will not spend as much time seeking out illegal CCW-ers. This means that if someone goes out with the intention of violently assaulting someone, they are more likely to carry a firearm as opposed to a slightly more excusable (in the eyes of the law) weapon such as a knife. The question then becomes: If you were attacked with a gun rather than a knife, are you more or less likely to survive? The answer should be obvious, regardless of whether you happened to be CCW or not.
To repeat the question with a twist: would you rather be attacked by a gun when you also were carrying, or attacked with a knife when you were unarmed? Personally, I'd rather the knife - the alternative is to go through life with one hand constantly resting on your gun and the safety off.
I deny this. If you can buy a gun legally and not have to worry about being arrested for unlawful possession, or (I would guess) pay quite so much, would you not take that option? I would say that common sense dictates that the only people with illegal guns are people who would not be allowed to buy legal ones.
You assume several things. Firstly, that criminals are born criminal - that it is impossible for a 'responsible citizen' to commit a crime. Secondly, you assume that there will be as much enforcement against criminal CCW in places where legal CCW is more widespread - that there is no correlation between legal and illegal CCW.
To analogise this: in the UK it is illegal to drive your car without basic insurance. However, many people drive legally. As a result, there are very few checks by police to see if a specific driver on a specific day is legal - instead, you have to do something to catch the eye of the police beforehand.
If less people drove legally, then there would be more checks for insurance and illegal driving would reduce equally.
Hmm... I doubt this very much. Sources are here, here, here and here.
Really not the case. See above.
...so current gun control laws are not reasonable?
Anyway, that is not what I claimed. I claimed that gun control will reduce the number of burglars who are carrying guns - which will reduce fatalities and/or injuries in a burglary.
By the 2nd amendment, if the American people choose to call any weapon 'arms', then it is their 'right' to bear that weapon. See John McCain's opinion on assault rifles and armour-piercing rounds.
Not so with a tazer... 15 feet of protection for $300, which is more than you need in most houses, especially if you are defending yourself rather than seeking out an invader.
Like I said in my last post, provably false. (Potential) criminals don't put round questionnaires to see if a house is armed or not, so the only clue they will have is the laws of the state they are in. Those clearly don't stop home invasions.
'Highly trained'? As far as I can tell, in the US only 6 states require training for gun licence. They are:
8 hour training class in Arizona (for CCW only)
'Training course' in Arkansas (for CCW only)
'State Approved Firearms Training' in Michigan (for CCW only)
15 hours & proficiency test in New Mexico (again, for CCW only)
State approved training course in North Carolina (CCW only again)
12 hours of handgun training plus tests in Ohio (CCW, the wiki was unexplicit about other licences)
Somehow, I don't think that this counts as 'highly trained'. And on what basis do you state that criminals will be incompetent gun users?
Pfft. I disagree with this massively - for example, of the 32 cases where a gun was used in a home invasion (study is here), only 6 people were shot and no-one died.
So you've changed from ""if they are armed, chances are they are not going to be just ""stealing some stuff""."" to ""if there's someone in your house, shoot them!"".

My question was not about the laws, it was about whether you were carrying a gun. Stop dancing around the question. I'm talking about, regardless of what the law was, someone is coming at you with a knife, would you be more likely to survive with a gun or less likely? This question has pretty much become a circus, with you trying to convince me that ccw states will not pursue illegal carriers, and that if you have a gun, all the criminals will have a gun.
Hands down, attacked by a gun when I had a gun.
When being attacked by a knife, and being unarmed, chances are you are not going to survive. However, when a dumb street thug is coming at you with a gun, and you have one too, chances are you are going to have much better aim.
This is under the assumption that legal guns are used to commit crimes, which is not the case.
I do assume that criminals are born criminal, or at least its how they're raised. It is not impossible for a responsible citizen to commit a crime, however it is unlikely.
Illegal CCW is not enforced now anyway. Its called CCW for a reason. Concealed. As in, no one can see it. Therefore it is very easy to get away with. This leaves criminals packing. The question is, do you want citizens to be able to defend themselves against these criminals?
""Three victims (1.5%) employed a firearm in self-protection. All three escaped injury,""
In case you didn't know, I am AGAINST felons being able to buy weapons.
I didn't say that.
This is wrong. Even if gun control will reduce the number of burglars carrying guns, they will carry a knife, a sword, a taser, a bat, something. And the victim will not be able to defend themselves, because all of these weapons require strength, which criminals usually have, while guns require skill, which criminals don't have. Therefore, a victim is more likely to survive an attack from someone with a gun (that didn't take them by surprise) when they're armed, rather than someone being attacked with a knife and no way to defend themselves.
The constitution, like the bible, is not infallible. However, its principles should be followed.
Do I look like I support John McCain?
What if you miss?
This seems ridiculous to me.
How many criminals or potential criminals do you know? Have you ever seen a gangster shoot a gun? Its laughable.
And, every gun owner I know or have ever talked to, goes to the range regularly. Very few people buy a gun and let it sit in their closets.
So, just let them clean you out? Take everything that is valuable while you sit in the corner? Thats the plan?
Over 20% of people got shot? I would really rather no one be shot, except the burglar.
If someone breaks into your house are you going to take the chance. And please do not misquote me. I did not say anywhere ""if there's someone in your house, shoot them!"". I also rest my case that if someone is in your house with a gun, you have a right to either retreat or shoot. You should not be making that decision for someone, because everyone has different circumstances. Sometimes the burglar is after your stuff, and sometimes they're after you. Even though being hurt in a home invasion is rare, you are essentially screwing over those people. What will you tell their families?",81,84,topic_stance_votes_2
84,"UK ""knife culture""?",gun control,attack,"I would say a gunshot wound or knife wound to the abdomen are equally deadly... your point about violent attacks is moot. If an attacker wants to kill you, they'll find a way. You're on the whim of the attacker... 
So... you do believe a person is innocent until proven guilty. So why can't I INNOCENTLY carry a weapon and proven guilty if I commit a crime?
3 out of your 4 sources you quoted are SURVEYS. Very subjective. I care about what is proven. And ""shooter"" pointed out that any self-defense with a firearm resulted in victims UNHARMED.
32 years of gun control in Washington DC, crime has not been reduced. Go figure.
Again.. ""shooter"" puts a good point.. what if you miss? I can also get a shotgun, load it with rubber pellets and not kill a person. Would that satify your ""non-violent"" stop-the-killing feeling? I actually have a 12-gauge with rubber bullets.. ready to go. emoticonXEmbarrassed 
Gang members are MORE well-trained than the local police because they spend more time at the range. There's an FBI report on this.... look for it. If you want good gun control, allow an officer to follow a known gang member to the local firing range and arrest his/her XXX. 
And most gun owners I know of do not shelve their guns for a rainy day.
A part of the CCW education tells you can you will be charged with a crime when you shoot a person... See below for the difference between self-defense and manslaughter or assault.
Don't mistaken paranoia as a proactive approach to controlling one's destiny. Do you really believe all gun-owners have a gun within arms reach from anywhere in the house? Then you are being very stereotypical. You watch too many violent movies to get that type of impression.
There is very fine line between SELF-DEFENSE and MANSLAUGHTER/ASSAULT. Self-defense is the use of deadly force to prevent imminent personal injury or death (NOT protection of property). Legally, you CANNOT shoot a person just for stealing stuff from your house; it's considered manslaughter or assault and you would be charged with it. Its up to you to prove that you shot for self-defense and prove imminent danger. If I was a statistician who wanted more gun control, I would put manslaughter cases as a violent gun crime to exaggerate the numbers. Numbers are amazing things.... :)",81,85,topic_stance_votes_2
