Good for the Spainards! Personally, I think U.S. conservatives have gotten too complacent these days--we need to protest like this more often. We've gotten to where we lay down too easily and let ourselves get run over too easily by immoralism.

My friend would never impose on his personal morality on another, regardless of how he felt about a matter, he remembers what it was like to live under the foot of somebody else's narrow perception of what is or is not acceptable. His parents had to teach him his language in secret, give him a Spanish name and he remembers his grandfather being beaten for not towing the line. Spain consists of three main cultures and langauages and two thirds were oppressed by Franco's regime. That is why they won't oppose this.

I don't have to give you any reason at all, logical or not.

Spain's Senate rejects gay marriage law
Wed Jun 22, 2005 9:18 PM BST 
MADRID (Reuters) - The upper house of Spain's parliament voted against a government proposal to legalise gay marriage on Wednesday, but the legislation remains likely to be made law despite outcry from Catholics.
The Senate defeated the bill when legislators from a Catalan Christian Democrat party joined the centre-right opposition Popular Party in opposing it.
The bill will return to the lower house of parliament next week, where it is expected to comfortably win final approval.
Hundreds of thousands of Spaniards, including bishops and nuns, took to the streets of Madrid on Saturday in a protest against the legislation, which would give gay couples the same legal rights as heterosexual ones.
Catholic bishops have strongly condemned the proposal as a threat to family values and the fabric of Spanish society.
