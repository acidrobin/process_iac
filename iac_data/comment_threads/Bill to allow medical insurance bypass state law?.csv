0,Bill to allow medical insurance bypass state law?,unknown,support,"Anyone been following the S.1955 bill that's going through Congress right now? It seems to be a bill aiming to provide more affordable health insurance opportunities to small business owners, which is a laudable goal, to be sure. Unfortunately, it seems to want to do this by giving the insurance companies a freebie ot bypass state regulations on insurance coverages. What are your thoughts on this?
Personally, I think that the entire thing needs to be scrapped and they need to go back to the drawing board on it. As it stands, this bill is a giveaway to the insurance industry at the expense of employees of small businesses, who will wind up with inferior insurance coverage that doesn't cover basic things like diabetes remedies.
