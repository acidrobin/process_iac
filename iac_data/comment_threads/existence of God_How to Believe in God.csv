Six Easy Steps
1. First, you must want to believe in God.
2. Next, understand that believing in God in the absence of evidence is especially noble.
3. Then, realize that the human ability to believe in God in the absence of evidence might itself constitute evidence for the existence of God.
4. Now consider any need for further evidence (both in yourself and in others) to be a form of temptation, spiritually unhealthy, or a corruption of the intellect.
5. Refer to steps 2-4 as acts of “faith.”
6. Return to 2.",0,1,topic_stance_votes_1
1,How to Believe in God,existence of God,attack,"Its even simpler than that, put it on..... pretend!
with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires; to be made new in the attitude of your minds; and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness
""But now you must rid yourselves of all such things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips. Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self with its practices and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator.""
""clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them 
all together in perfect unity""
""put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no plans to satisfy the fleshly desires.""
""For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ""
""put on the new man, the one created according to God's likeness in righteousness and purity of the truth""
However we should not ""put on Christ"" as a means to be a mask to to bad things.
""You know we never used flattery, nor did we put on a mask to cover up greed--God is our witness. ""
The whole world is a stage and all the people merely players.... How we act is what we become, therefore act as a Christian....
""everyone who hears these words of Mine and doesn't act on them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. ""
""Did we not act in the same spirit and follow the same course? ""
""act according to his good purpose""
""Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom""
"" by his power he may fulfill every good purpose of yours and every act prompted by your faith.""
if we act as gangstars, we will become Gangsters, if we act like drug dealers, we will become drug dealers, if we act as athiests, we will become athiests, if we act as Christians we will become Christians, act like Christ and you will become like Christ. When we are inclined to do what is wrong, pretend you are like Christ able to step away from the temptaion and as you walk away from the temptation you find you have ACTED like Christ. When we experience the grace of Christ in our lives, we believe he is the way, the truth and the life.....
""As for God, His way is blameless; The word of the LORD is tried; He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him.""....
and our heart is opened to the possibility of a supreeme being and then we begin to precieve the presence of the lord in many things that reaffirm our minds in our belief of his existance.... ""Seek and ye shall find, knock and it shall be opened up to you.""",1,2,topic_stance_votes_2

After all, it's attacking your own faith (Catholicism) harshly...and winning.
Basically, think of all the anti-Christian attacks you hear of...95%+ of those attacks are due to this movement. (It's a paganistic belief system that wraps itself in the guise of fundamentalist charismatic beliefs and could easily masquerade as Pentecostalism. Nearly all mega-churches in the world as well as the majority of 'christian TV' is WofF...TBN for example.)
Joel Olsteen, T.D. Jakes, Bakers, Paul and Jan Crouch...the list is endless.
Walk into a book store and chances are, most 'Christian books' are by a WofF.
They are the 'gnostics' Paul warned about...renewed.
They are the ultimate con game made legal.

Funny thing about Him in those descriptions...
One immutable thing about Him is that He cannot lie...
And seeing as most biblical contradictions lead to a lie...this God dissapears in a puff of logic.
Now, if the Christian bible is wrong about God and God is actually something else...how do we know it?
How do we seperate a real God from something we simply made up with our expansive immaginations?

God DID exist.

'But of course.' He replied
And with that...*poof* He was gone.
That explains why He doesn't do anything. No miracles, no prayers answer, nothing...He's gone.
And, for those fools who doubt this, I refer you to the book of Job.

39,How to Believe in God,existence of God,support,"It's these reasons that the Health/Wealth prosperity cults have gained in popularity. Where statements are taken out of context from the bible and applied to todays Christianity. It's why Joel Olsteens book, Your Best Life NOW and other such works are so popular.
Kingdom Now theology is quite popular and many according to current polls believe a follower is supposed to live in abundance (meaning financial things...no longer spiritual). 
The Word of Faith movement (coupled with versions of Pentecostalism that accounts for about 500 million followers the world over) would be the epitomy of this scam that can't possiblly work.
Many believers also blindly defend their 'mand ob gawd's' prosperity citing that he's to get a 'double portion of honor' and have little problems when that pimp in pastors clothing lives in multi-million dollar homeS while driving several high end vehicles and being cheuffered about by armor-bearer body guards.
They miss the fact that they don't practice what they preach. Sow a seed and harvest a blessing later. That's what they extolle their followers to do. In fact, these vultures live off of their followers seed. (seed nearly always being financial).
Just recently another scandal broke out with Oral Roberts leadership in regards to these abuses.
But, if you have only an average (or less) intellect and no biblical knowledge, you could easily be duped into following these perversions of piety. They practice the most finely tuned of psychological manipulation techniques gleaned from skilled market research.
