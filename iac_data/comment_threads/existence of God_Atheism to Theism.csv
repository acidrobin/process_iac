0,Atheism to Theism,existence of God,support,"Yes... the 6,000 year old debate... here we go again :) 
Atheism is the most logical default position one could take.
The lack of belief or knowledge is most usually the first position taken by one on a subject before they are to aquire knowledge or investigate the matter.
So how does the theist move from this default position to his position of belief?
How have you, presuming you to be a theist, come to the conclusion that God exists?
1. Please first define what you mean by God so we avoid any bad assumptions or confusion.
2. Please exclude all evidence and reason relating to the word ""feeling"".
Ex. ""I feel there is a God deep within my heart""
- Feelings are personal to the individual and cannot be used as evidence within a conversation unless I (the atheist) have the same feeling; which I assure you, I do not.",0,1,topic_stance_votes_1

1. God is defined as a supernatural invisible being that my parents and the bible taught me about. all the things that my parents said he did, and what the bible said he did, are the things he did, and he deserves the credit for ultimately everything that ever was done since the beginning of the world.
2. not really a question...
coming to theism was natural for me. as far as i remember i was a theist. i wasnt born that way, but i became one at a very early age. no real dramatic story about it. i grew up in a christian home
coming to the conclusion that God exist was as easy as all the othr beliefs that i adopted. i was taught so, and i ws taught to look around at the world and find the evidence that God exist, such as order, intelligent design and unexpected good fortune. even chaos and bad fortune helped strengthen my case that God exists, since these things are of the devil.
as a side note, i think the definition of atheist as ""without a belief in God"" is conveniently ambigious and i disagree with that definition. someone with no belief about or in God i would define as an agnostic. an agnostic is someone that doesnt know whether they believe in God. because your atheist definition overlaps this, it makes it less useful and more difficult to work with. thats why i avoid using that definition",1,19,topic_stance_votes_2

Because as Ive said before: the lack of belief is the default position. So I would like to see the argument that convinces the theist there is a God.

An argument I might come up with, as I believe I can argue a theist position, would be, ""If there is no God and the Bible is false, how do you explain the universe's origin? How can you explain logically, with evidence, that there is no chance the universe was created by an all-powerful being?
""And when I say God, I am referring to the Christian one; He (or well, It) is omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent, Christ is his son who died for our sins. I believe in God because the Big Bang Theory doesn't completely hold up under scrutiny and it leaves no explanation for the origin of what we call life.

32,Atheism to Theism,existence of God,attack,"That's not a logical argument itself, you have said. Occam's Razor by itself takes the argument out of its own misery. That is a huge assumption and by all means unncessary. Nor it is the simplest assumption as well. Science and natural occurances are far more simple then a all power being who just exists. Logically we have a problem with the idea of such a being. Logic dictates everything must have a origin. The universe, you and I, and everything around us. Yet how can a diety have no origin and be explained with logic? It cannot, and therefore exists outside of logic if it exists. Under such circumstances, a belief in a diety cannot be logically reasoned. Hence, why I believe faithless may be looking for someone who does not exist.
The most likely answer is one we have not come up with, and before someone jumps on my back about that, look at history and how completely ridiculous claims were made that were later proven by very simple science. It is ultimately patience that will allow for the real answers to present themselves, not leaping to proofless, illogical conclusions of dieties.

37,Atheism to Theism,existence of God,attack,"I think you're starting from a false premise: that human minds emerged as some kind of blank slate, on which people later inscribed belief in god for some 'logical' reason.
More likely, in my view, is that when modern human brains emerged they incorporated a strong tendency to 'believe' as part of their operating system: specifically, to believe that effects have causes, for it was the construction of cause-and-effect chains that enabled early human technology. Once you have a hard-wired predisposition to seek causes for effects, it is a small step to invoke supernatural causes for effects whose physical cause you cannot see. To project anthropomorphic form and motivation on these invisible causes is hardly surprising either.
Our need to see a cause for anything that happens is still very strong. It's what makes some of the findings of, say, quantum physics so counter-intuitive. It's what drives conspiracy theorists.

Its called a debate. Yes I have come to the table prepared. I am familiar with theist arguments and I would like to debate them.
Johnhanks,
No, I do not believe the human mind to be a clean slate.
But most belief from God arises from indoctrination by parents and society on the commonly accepted belief of God.
But in a logical procedure to arrive at a conclusion about the existance of such a diety one would start at the agnostic / atheist position. 
unkerpaulie,
Order does not constitute design. 
The natural adaptation and functions within life forms are not examples of design, but rather order. And order does not require a designer.
Order is only the natural course of events and the natural course of events do not lead to the inference of a design.
A kidney has a function and it completes it. This did not happen over night or in a day. It took millions upon millions of years for such a complex system of life to develop.

I hope your kidding...
If you are... stop wasting my time.
But assuming your not:
If you have already made the presupposition that there is a God to be found then of course all surrouding natural ""evidence"" would be evident of his existance.
Because most ""good"" and ""bad"" in Christianity and other theistic religions is designated as God's will you are using circular reasoning.
Good and bad presuppose the existance of a God to designate such good and bad. Thus such ""obvious"" good and bad no matter in how much ""abundance"" it is, does not qualify as evidence.

Searcher = Agnostic
Agnostic = Atheist
(Please see definition in prior post of what I mean by atheist)
An atheist simply lacks theistic belief.
All agnostics therefore are atheists... but not in the typical sense.
Untrue.
Faith is belief not resting on logic or material evidence. (See dictionary)
The lack of belief in God is not faith.
In the case of denying a god's existance. It would depend on which God you are referring to.
In my own case: I deny the existance of God but that is not based on faith.
I have reasons that I deny the possibility of the existance of the modern Christian God. But those reasons are not for this thread.
What?
