Need oxygen? Cells know how to spend and save
Researchers at Johns Hopkins have discovered how cells fine-tune their oxygen use to make do with whatever amount is available at the moment.
Too little oxygen threatens life by compromising mitochondria that power it, so when oxygen is scarce, cells appear to adjust by replacing one protein with an energy-efficient substitute that ""is specialized to keep the motor running smoothly even as it begins to run out of gas,"" says Gregg Semenza, M.D., Ph.D., a professor of pediatrics and director of the vascular biology program in the Institute for Cell Engineering at Hopkins. ""This is one way that cells maintain energy production under less than ideal conditions."" A report on the work is in the April 6 issue of Cell. 
""Cells require a constant supply of oxygen,"" Semenza says, ""so it's vital for them to quickly react to slight changes in oxygen levels."" The protein-swap is how they do it. 
In the mitochondria, the tiny powerhouses found in every cell, energy is produced by passing electrons through a series of relay stations called cytochromes until they eventually join with oxygen to form water. This final step is directed by the protein cytochrome coxidase, or COX for short. If electrons react with oxygen before reaching COX, they generate ""free radicals"" that can damage or destroy cells. The mitochondria are designed to produce energy without excess free radical production at normal oxygen levels. 
Semenza's team noticed that one particular component of the COX protein complex, COX4, comes in two different forms, COX4-1 and COX4-2. Under normal oxygen conditions, the cells' mitochondria contain mostly COX4-1. The researchers suspected that COX 4-2 might be the active protein under stressful, low-oxygen conditions, which the researchers refer to as hypoxia. 
To test the idea, the team compared the growth of human cells in normal oxygen conditions (what's generally present in normal room air) compared to cells grown in hypoxia. In low oxygen, liver, uterus, lung and colon cells all made COX4-2. The researchers then exposed mice to hypoxia for a few weeks and found that they too showed increased levels of COX4-2. 
In 1992, Semenza's team had discovered a protein which they called HIF-1 (for hypoxia-inducible factor 1) that cells make in response to hypoxia. HIF-1 turns on genes that help cells survive when oxygen is low, such as during a heart attack or stroke. The researchers set out to figure out if the sensor protein HIF-1 triggers the COX-swapping. 
By examining the gene control regions of COX4, they found that the HIF-1 sensor switched on COX4-2 activity when oxygen is low. And they learned that because COX4-1 already is in the mitochondria, the swap for COX4-2 occurs when the sensor turns on yet another gene that produces an enzyme to specifically chew up COX4-1. Engineering human cells to lack this enzyme and subjecting them to low oxygen, the scientists found the cells unable to rid themselves of COX4-1. 
""It's remarkable that the one-celled yeast also swap COX subunits in response to hypoxia, but because they lack HIF-1, they accomplish the swap in a completely different way,"" says Semenza. ""This suggests that adapting mitochondria to changes in oxygen levels may be a major challenge for most organisms on Earth.""

12,"More on cells as intelligent, dynamic, autopoietic systems",evolution,attack,"Well, a pretty complex sort of machine, not at all like the kind (so far) intelligently designed by humans. And even if we do in the future invent machines that mimic life, that's all they'd be: mimics.
Life as such need be no more intelligent than the brightest cabbage, or the microbe with the highest IQ. There's nothing necessarily ""illogical"" about an ""intelligent design"" hypothesis, per se (though I explain my problems with it below); there's just no evidence for it, and from a minimalist Occam's razor perspective, no need for it. It's a speculation at best, based on what is really a faulty analogy between human and man-made complex systems. There really is no good analogy between an organism and Paley's famous watch. 
There's a good analogy to evolution in biology, though, and it's development. If one doesn't need an external intelligence to grow a human being from a union of sperm and egg, if that happens spontaneously by naturalistic self-organising chemical processes, then there really isn't theoretical, conceptual problem with the evolution of the biosphere as a self-organising system that I can see.
It evolved, so far as we can tell, from simpler systems through a process of duplication and modification of DNA sequences. Highly complex systems can be generated by extremely simple rules, and we are only just beginning to understand them. It's a good and still unanswered question exactly how the DNA information storage system evolved, but appeals to an intelligent designer don't really solve the problem, because then we're stuck with the problem of who designed the designer? If, after all, the designer of a system must be more complex than the system, then the designer him/her/itself must logically have had a more complex designer, and so on ad infinitum. And if a designer doesn't have to be more complex that the system it designs, then what's the conceptual problem with evolution?
So basically, to me the notion of intelligent design as applied to the natural world simply makes no conceptual sense whatever.",9,13,topic_stance_votes_1
13,"More on cells as intelligent, dynamic, autopoietic systems",evolution,attack,"please notice you misread my question. Here it is again:
SS: The intelligence had to come from somewhere. Where did the information in the DNA code come from?
your answer:
I asked where the information residing in the DNA came from. The physical structure of DNA is not the same as the information contained within. (Just like the physical brain is not the same as the information floating around in your mind.)I'm asking where the information came from to begin with. ""Information"" does not appear by evolution. Information requires an an intelligent sender; someone/something to ""inform."" Now where did this information originate?....and there's a whole heck of a lot of it crammed into one tiny genetic code.",13,14,topic_stance_votes_2
14,"More on cells as intelligent, dynamic, autopoietic systems",evolution,attack,"and as has been pointed out by you, if (as you insist) a designer was needed, since somthing that complex requires a designer, who designed the designer? And who designed the designer? And who designed the designer? And who designed the designer? And who designed the designer? And who etc. etc...",14,15,topic_stance_votes_1
15,"More on cells as intelligent, dynamic, autopoietic systems",evolution,attack,"Well, the ""information"" contained in DNA is just a base sequence. No-one knows how the DNA-protein system evolved yet, but we do understand quite well how the informational content of an established genome can increase and change in naturalistic ways, no intelligence necessary.
To cut a long story short, there are several mechanisms, but an important one is gene duplication, followed by sequence modification of one of the copies with the assumption of new function. The reason we know this is because there are many proteins with different functions that nevertheless resemble each other, and also there are many non-functional pseudogenes that are a duplication which then lost functionality altogether, but is still cluttering up the genome.
So no. Information doesn't need an intelligent sender or even interpreter. It can arise naturalistically, and in a self-organising system, no inteligent interpretation of it is needed. No-one controls development, for example -- it runs itself without any intelligence involved at all.",14,16,topic_stance_votes_1
16,"More on cells as intelligent, dynamic, autopoietic systems",evolution,support,"This is a load of garbage. Rocks contain information about how old they are.

This is one of those ""ill-informed"" comments that I prefer to simply ignore. But since it has been inserted into my thread, I'll make a brief response.

21,"More on cells as intelligent, dynamic, autopoietic systems",evolution,attack,"If you want to define information as data requiring an intelligent sender, then DNA apparently does not contain information.
Shifting definitions does not make an argument, and it's dishonest and cowardly to make an argument of this nature.
We're all aware of this argument, because it's a staple in the creationist book of apologetics, ""Change definitions early and often, and never state them openly, by confusing the audiences' minds you can win their souls to God, PRAISE THE LORD HALLALEUJAH!"", that doesn't mean we're going to buy it.

Nonsense. By this definition anything that exists is a dynamic communicator, by the simple fact of its own existence. Ridiculous.",23,24,topic_stance_votes_2
24,"More on cells as intelligent, dynamic, autopoietic systems",evolution,attack,"What is information? Information is anything that causes a specific change in a receiver or transducer. Thus random sequences -- i.e. truly stochastic -- cannot contain information (except by compete accident). Information is only informative in the presence of an appropriate transducer, otherwise it is indistinguishable from random noise. Not even regularity need be interpreted as information, necessarily.
Well, probably that's not the best definition of information, but it is at least a practical one. Take a genomic DNA sequence. While it is true that it contains information about the sequence of the encoded proteins, if you don't have the translational key, the information has no value, and in fact can't be readily distinguished from random noise, except for repetitive sequences. If you can't distinguish something from random noise, is it really information?
Biologically speaking, the informational content of a genome is far more than just the DNA sequence. It's also epigenetic, namely in the bootstrapping program that tells the genome which genes to express, where and in which order. It's also stored in the structures of the amino acids which determine protein conformation. I don't believe there is a simple way to treat information storage in a biological organism.",24,25,topic_stance_votes_1
25,"More on cells as intelligent, dynamic, autopoietic systems",evolution,attack,"You are incorrectly assuming that just because something contains information that it is a communicator. This is a distortion of what 'information' is. 
Your misunderstanding of the concept of 'information' doesn't make something 'rediculous'.",24,26,topic_stance_votes_1
26,"More on cells as intelligent, dynamic, autopoietic systems",evolution,attack,"I don't think what constitutes information about any phenomenon is necessarily communicated to an observer or ""receiver"". The facts about any physical object, process, etc., exist independently of human observation and/or reception. Such facts can remain ""incommunicado"" indefinitely. This is obvious, so I assume you must have a concept of information that necessarily includes the notion of a ""sender""? Perhaps you should explain your concept more thoroughly before rejecting my ideas as ""ridiculous"". 
We have lots of information about, for example, the causes of cancer. No ""dynamic communicator"" has sent this data to the biologists investigating the problem. Objective information about this disease (or group of diseases) has been collected and interpreted by patient scientific inquiry. There are good reasons to suppose that our information about the causes of cancer is incomplete.

""To make a case for or against a trend in the evolution of complexity in biological evolution, complexity needs to be both rigorously defined and measurable.
Surely thats not the source of your problems. Its intuitively obvious that until you can measure complexity you cannot even begin to discuss the issue. 
[INDENT]A recent information-theoretic (but intuitively evident) definition identifies genomic complexity with the amount of information a sequence stores about its environment.
And thats pretty clear (the paper of course expands the concept considerably) Adami is going to propose a measurement of complexity based on what information a replicator binds into its instruction set through evolution. I hope thats clear to you.
We investigate the evolution of genomic complexity in populations of digital organisms and monitor in detail the evolutionary transitions that increase complexity.
OK there Adami tells you what he is going to do in order to probe the problem in a theoretical way. The paper again expands this greatly and to understand it you have to do some reading. But its relatively simple when you dig down a bit.
We show that, because natural selection forces genomes to behave as a natural ""Maxwell Demon,"" within a fixed environment, genomic complexity is forced to increase. ""
And finally Adami states his basic conclusion as to the significance of his findings. Again the paper contains more extended argument and logic on this issue.

Good guess; no, it's not. Still, you only need to define complexity in objective, non-relative terms, in order to discuss it.

About as clear as mud. None of this defines ""complexity"". ""A recent information-theoretic definition"" of what, pray tell? ""Complexity""?
