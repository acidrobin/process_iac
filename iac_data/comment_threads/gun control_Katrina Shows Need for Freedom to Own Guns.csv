I'd hate to have lived in New Orleans in the few days after the hurricane went through with no firearm(s). I've read a number of stories in the news where thugs left people alone when they saw they were armed.

I personally am astounded at the overreaction of the government in response to a handfull of shootings in NO. Sending in the army in full force, confiscating guns and talking about an 'insurgency' just because of a couple of crackpots have been firing their guns.

5,Katrina Shows Need for Freedom to Own Guns,gun control,support,"Well, if they've re-established control in New Orleans(and it seems they have), then taking a gun away from someone carrying it on the street would be what the police normally do in any city. If they were taking it away from peoples' homes, and not letting them keep them, that would be over and above what they normally do. (I'm very pro-2nd Amendment, so don't get me wrong here. I'm just pointing out that taking guns away from people happens in every city every day)

6,Katrina Shows Need for Freedom to Own Guns,gun control,attack,"Unfortunatly, that is just not reality. Criminals have always had guns, and will always have guns. Plans to make guns more difficult to obtain have historically resulted in innocent civilians dying at the hands of criminals, becuase they could not obtain weapons with which to protect themselves. 
Drugs have been illegal for years, with some pretty draconian laws to boot. Do users seem to be having any difficulty finding drugs where you live? They certianly don't here. You can't help but open the paper and see hundreds of pounds of drugs seized weekly, along with commentary form the local law enforcement warning us that this is just a tiny fraction of what is out there.
Same deal, only guns woudl be easier, since you can't sniff them out with dogs, meaning every freight container would have to be manually checked, and the user does not use them up...resulting in the need for constant imports to replinish supply.",5,7,topic_stance_votes_2

Cops had to do sweeps of the convention center and disarm people.

10,Katrina Shows Need for Freedom to Own Guns,gun control,attack,"If they had been protecting their homes or themselves, no problem. But this was not the case. The problem was that there were armed people throughout the city who took the opportunity to shoot at anything that moved, probably simply because they could do so with relative impunity from punishment, since there were no police patrolling. These ""crackpots"" as you call them were shooting at rescue helicopters, rescue workers in boats and on foot, their own citizens who were trying to get out, the few police who were left, and even the people trying to plug the giant hole that flooded the city. There is a huge difference between that kind of lawless violence and someone protecting their life or property. You call it an overreaction, I think the US acted slowly and with restraint.

Personally, I am still buying. That have been an EXCELLENT investment to date (anybody who doubts it, check the current value of the M-60 I paid $1200 for several years ago). I have also started collecting some otehr interesting doodads, like gardner guns, and have extended my gatling gun collection (gatling guns are NOT nfa weapons and are wholly uncontrolled) by 1 belt fed .308. the original gatling guns fired about 650 rounds per minute.

Could be a bad hair day for Gonzales trips confiscation.

37,Katrina Shows Need for Freedom to Own Guns,gun control,attack,"My graduation thesis was about the historical development of the state's monopoly over physical force. I'm not going to sum it up, but while the monopoly was established by the rulers to protect their interests, it has eventually also become the basis for the state's duty to maintain peace and order and ensure the safety of its citizens. 
In this context, I am very worried by the US developments. While the effects of gun control on crime are somewhat unclear (I believe the US is already so saturated with firearms that the gun control laws may indeed lead to an increase in crime - contrary to the normal effects), it is very clear from the same statistics that increased police presence is the best crime prevention measure, and the police is apparently being downsized.
I'd love to have a firearm, probably a sniper rifle, with which I'd shoot at targets half a mile away. I can do the same with a replica and a sniping scope. I'd immediately borrow a full auto something, just to get the feeling of shooting a full magazine at some target (ruined house wall would sound fun). keep it at home, no. Shoot bullets, yes. Kill anyone, no thanks.
The problem is, I don't want to have to rely on my own firearms to be safe. The principle demands everyone carry a several pound hunk of metal around at all times, a dangerous several pound hunk of metal filled with explosives, that is, and sleeping with one eye open, just in case. In the military, you set up a camp and then set guards. Civilians do the same by keeping a police force.",37,38,topic_stance_votes_1
38,Katrina Shows Need for Freedom to Own Guns,gun control,attack,"I disagree with that premise. Military establishes a defined parameter with guards positioned around that parameter, deterring any danger element from entering the safe zone in a proactive manner. Civilian police are reactive, generally being positioned in the center of a defined area with patrols to service incidents in an investigative manner after occurrence. 
In populated areas 'safe' neighborhoods are normally abbreviated military parameters using constructed walls, controlled access and often private, armed security to deter intrusion. Again, civilian police are reactive to incidents in those circumstances. 
In example, I offer that television has produced episodes consisting of 911 calls from private citizens for police assistance that captured entire sequences of successful home intrusions completed while victims were on the line (until disabled) with arrival of reactive police after the fact. 
In the US a few pounds of metal filled with explosives in one's possession can easily make the difference between successful defense against an attempted crime and victim status.",38,39,topic_stance_votes_2

Along with glue guns, tasers, bolas, net launchers, flesh hooks, IR goggles, lie detectors, truth serums, helicopters, tanks, attack dogs,... Why powered armour first?

40,Katrina Shows Need for Freedom to Own Guns,gun control,support,"I agree wtih you entirely here, george. The only way the military secures a base is by complete and total acess control, and the fact that EVERYBODY in the base is armed and willing to use their weapoins should the perimeter jobs fail to do their job adequately. 
There is no thing as complete access contor in the civilian world. The primary purpose fo our police force is to show up in the aftermath of an event and clean up and do some investigation (nationally, we catch almost 1 in 5 cirminals). While the capture may keep the individual in question from commiting another crime, that does not do a whole lot for you if you are the victim of the original crime.

I'd much rather buy myself a full set of body armour.
I'd also like to point out one other weapon society has (one that I consider the best weapon against terrorism): its ability to absorb damage simply due to its great size.
