1,Mexico to legalize drugs,marijuana legalization,support,"Why bother chasing casual user's and wasting money on containing them if they are going to do it anyway. I think its a good idea, if someone is intent on doing something then a law wont stop them.",1,2,topic_stance_votes_1
2,Mexico to legalize drugs,marijuana legalization,support,Good for them.,2,3,topic_stance_votes_1
3,Mexico to legalize drugs,marijuana legalization,support,I'm sure some posters are reviewing bible passages to cut/paste rebuttals. Way too much common sense involved for the US to ever adopt similar legislation.,1,4,topic_stance_votes_1
4,Mexico to legalize drugs,marijuana legalization,support,"My english teacher mentioned it to us today. He was all for it, didn't it get rejected?",4,5,topic_stance_votes_1
5,Mexico to legalize drugs,marijuana legalization,support,"While I agree with the law, I don't agree with your reason. By your logic we should just dump all laws as someone is always willing to break them.
The reason to me is the great number of people who do it. The society itself has changed. The laws should be changed to reflect that. 
Up here in VT, something like 55% of all residents admit to smoking marijuana on a regular basis. It still illegal, but people don't report marijuana usage and cops don't arrest people for it unless they a near a school or have enough to charge them with intent to distribute.",2,6,topic_stance_votes_1
6,Mexico to legalize drugs,marijuana legalization,attack,"Although thats a bad line of reasoning. I theif might steal no matter what the law says but this doesn't mean we should have no law. 
As for the drugs....If it ever happened in the US, I hope people wouldn't get mad at the ""drug"" companies like they do the current tobacco companies. Seems like the same people that are like ""legalize drugs"" are holding a sign up supporting a lawsuit against Phillip Morris.
Either way, the idea is stupid and I would probably only support marijuana being legalized if most other countries did it...why? So we don't have a bunch of drug addicts coming here just for the weed.",2,7,topic_stance_votes_2
7,Mexico to legalize drugs,marijuana legalization,support,"I think the reason for the law would be that there's no reeason to have the ban in the first place (ok, no GOOD reason).",6,8,topic_stance_votes_1
8,Mexico to legalize drugs,marijuana legalization,attack,"Canada, Mexico and most Caribbean Islands other than Cuba have substantial marijuana growing operations for internal consumption and export to the largest market, the US. None of our immediate neighbors would be coming to the US just to smoke pot.",7,9,topic_stance_votes_1
9,Mexico to legalize drugs,marijuana legalization,attack,"I find it odd that you support marijuana being legalized....I thought you wanted a more productive US, and I don't think you meant an increase in Frito Lay sales.",9,10,topic_stance_votes_2
10,Mexico to legalize drugs,marijuana legalization,attack,Ok...I'll bite. What does legalization of Marijuana have to do with our country becoming more or less productive?,10,11,topic_stance_votes_1
11,Mexico to legalize drugs,marijuana legalization,attack,It was a joke...people that smoke weed are regarded as lazy or mellow,11,12,topic_stance_votes_2
12,Mexico to legalize drugs,marijuana legalization,attack,"Marijuana has nothing to do with productivity. I want to cease the senseless, vast enforcement expenditures and derive tax revenue from production and sales.",10,13,topic_stance_votes_1
13,Mexico to legalize drugs,marijuana legalization,support,"With legalization under the current pecking order, which federal agency would control policy? A new one?",13,14,topic_stance_votes_1
14,Mexico to legalize drugs,marijuana legalization,attack,"good grief it was a joke....a bunch of stifs here.
Anyway, the law is still dumb because the goal is to ""find the suppliers"" since it is illegal to sell. Now you just have more sellers since it is legal...great job",13,15,topic_stance_votes_2
15,Mexico to legalize drugs,marijuana legalization,support,It's only legal to have small amounts. Less time arresting people with small amounts means more time going after the dealers.,15,16,topic_stance_votes_2
16,Mexico to legalize drugs,marijuana legalization,support,and more of them since you can have a small amount of drugs on you (which is all a user needs),16,17,topic_stance_votes_2
17,Mexico to legalize drugs,marijuana legalization,attack,More of who?,17,18,topic_stance_votes_1
18,Mexico to legalize drugs,marijuana legalization,attack,drug suppliers. Increase demand creates supply ;) Their goal wasn't what they say it is.,18,19,topic_stance_votes_2
19,Mexico to legalize drugs,marijuana legalization,attack,That's probably because drugs kill less people than tobacco. Weed (a VERY common drug of course) hasn't killed ANYONE...,19,20,topic_stance_votes_1
20,Mexico to legalize drugs,marijuana legalization,attack,"If Mexico legalizes drug use, the U.S. could trade it's dope heads for hard working Mexicans who could pay taxes and make the U.S. more capable of sending aid to Mexico. Seems like a fair trade to me. lol",20,21,topic_stance_votes_2
21,Mexico to legalize drugs,marijuana legalization,support,"While I do agree in the case of this ""something"" that there should be no law against it, I cannot agree with the logic behind your approval of the change in law. Just because someone is intent on breaking certain laws is not cause to repeal those laws. It is the fact that certain things are relatively harmless to others that causes me to favor repealing prohibitive laws against those things.",2,22,topic_stance_votes_1
22,Mexico to legalize drugs,marijuana legalization,support,The problem with the tobacco companies is that they knew and lied about the negative affects of smoking.,20,23,topic_stance_votes_1
23,Mexico to legalize drugs,marijuana legalization,attack,I would choose freedom over productivity any day.,10,24,topic_stance_votes_1
24,Mexico to legalize drugs,marijuana legalization,attack,"Well, there are already hardworking capable mexicans coming here, the only problem is that the potheads aren't leaving.",21,25,topic_stance_votes_1
25,Mexico to legalize drugs,marijuana legalization,support,"Its not only that people break the law, its that there will be no change in usage when its legal. Therefore making the law useless.",22,26,topic_stance_votes_1
26,Mexico to legalize drugs,marijuana legalization,support,"Oh, I'm betting the usage will go up, if only temporarily when it's legalized. I know several people who would be smoking now if it wasn't illegal. 
Employers would likely counter this with more testing of employees and applicants.
Users would probably smoke more often and in more places than they now do.
I would become a chain-smoker! LOL",26,27,topic_stance_votes_1
