0,Roe to be challenged? I Hope So.,abortion,support,"In the next six weeks, South Dakota lawmakers will decide whether to make abortion a crime.
A bill that would ban abortion in the state will be introduced within the next two days.
The bill will be called the Woman's Health and Life Protection Act. It will ban abortion, but won't prosecute a doctor who performs one to save a woman's life.
And the lawmaker who's introducing the bill says he thinks now is the right time to try and over-turn Roe vs Wade.
Rep. Roger Hunt says, ""Abortion should be banned.""
Those four words will likely lead to many others in the South Dakota House and Senate as lawmakers will decide whether to criminalize abortion in the state. The bill's supporters are using findings from a controversial abortion task force report recently given to the legislature.
Hunt says, ""DNA testing now can establish the unborn child has a separate and distinct personality from the mother. We know a lot more about post-abortion harm to the mother.""
The legislature debated a similar bill two years ago, but Governor Mike Rounds vetoed it because of concerns over some technicalities.
Hunt says, ""We have made those corrections to the bill.""
Sunday, Hunt and other anti-abortion advocates held an event promoting their legislation. They say now is the time to pass it, because other states are considering similar bills and because with new Chief Justice John Roberts, and possibly Samuel Alito, the US Supreme Court is changing.
Hunt says, ""Two very solid, we feel, pro-life candidates. Again you never know but based on their testimony to the senate we feel they're good candidates.""
Hunt says he thinks enough other lawmakers support the bill for it to pass, but he still thinks the decision will be a close one.
He says, ""I learned a long time ago the only time you really count the votes is when you're taking the votes.""
Hunt will also introduce two other bills this week. One is meant to ensure doctors explain the risks of an abortion to a woman is writing. The other deals with sex education and says school districts need to include principles in their curriculums dealing with abstinence and personal responsibilities.

So according to one of the people who conducted the study don't go using their results as a tool for arguing against abortion.
One woman I know had an abortion a short time after she was married. I also know she has regrets that she had the procedure. I considered what she had to say about her experience and thought about the 14 year old son she now has. From what she told me, I could plainly see she would never have had her son if she had not had her abortion as her circumstances would have changed beyond recognition. Perhaps she gets depressed about the child she never had because of her abortion. However, her son is a fantastic boy whom she loves very much.

Marijuana, for example. You may not think marijuana is harmful to your health, but if you smoke it, you break the law. And if you break the law, you can be punished under that law. Even if you don't think the ""people of the country"" can tell you what is best for your life or your health, they still legitimately do so in many areas.
Interesting quote. It can't be acted out in many areas though. Murder for instance. Or speeding. Jaywalking either. Running stop signs. Beating children. No matter how happy these acts may make someone, they can be punished if they perform them, even if the state is wholly unconnected with that individual. We have a society that governs itself by laws. Until we do not, I'm sorry to say that you will be prevented from doing some things that you may deem would make you happy.

Yes, we have fully grasped why we lost. We lost because some judges determined that abortion ought to be a Constitutional right. Since they couldn’t find it in the Constitution, they put it there themselves.
I understand the Supreme Court has said this. They also said this. But, 58 years later, the Supreme Court said this. We therefore learn that, yes, sometimes the Supreme Court can be wrong. What a shock. We learn that, yes, Supreme Court justices are not infallible. What a shock. In fact, the Supreme Court said here that everything in Roe was wrong except for the central holding. So to summarize, the Supreme Court has been wrong in the past, and thus, can be wrong today.
If you're going to critique my claim, at least critique a claim that I actually made. I said ""the right to an abortion is not in the Constitution."" I did not say ""Abortion is unconstitutional."" To continue critiquing that claim is not to argue with me, but with a straw-man instead.

I am quite familiar with the mechanics of the Constitution, which is why I correctly claim that 1) the right to abortion is not in the Constitution. 2) Judges should not engage in social engineering from the bench. 3) Judges should not say that something is in the Constitution, when it in fact is not.

This guy will undoubtedly keep his job. You must not be too familiar with how the individual states actually feel about this issue. It so happens that South Dakota is overwhelmingly in favor of abortion restrictions.
I tend to think this is a correct observation.
I tend to think this is incorrect. The reason that mostly consevatives would propose such legislation is because, for the most part, it is conservatives that desire such legislation. It isn't because they can't mind their own business (no government does), it isn't because they want to control peoples lives (every government does to a degree), nor is it because they are heartless (they obviously care very deeply about the issue).
That is in fact what is taking place in South Dakota. The people of South Dakota, through their elected representatives, are formulating the State's policy position toward abortion. This is what conservatives mean by ""let the States decide."" That means, ""let the States decide in accordance with their own constitutional requirements."" That is what we call federalism.
Conservatives are not afraid to take the issue of abortion to the voters. This in fact is what they desire, which is why they advocate the reversal of the wrongly decided Roe v. Wade case.

""In an attempt to claim that there is no medical need for marijuana, he then proceeded to include in the record the package insert from Marinol, a high-priced cannabinoid based drug that was speedily approved by the government (with the encouragement of the pharmaceutical industry) for use in easing many of the same symptoms that marijuana helps. He just conveniently failed to mention that Marinol is generally less effective, has worse side effects, greater dosage control issues, and is more expensive than marijuana.""
Legalization of marijuana is also a State's Rights issue, is it not?
If you're for States Rights, you should be against the DEA, or at least against its denial of medical marijuana (or any marijuana for that matter). The feds can regulate interstate commerce, but they can't regulate a plant grown in one state (in one house) and smoked in that same state (or same house). That's the State's job.

Yes! We need more Republicans in favor of impeaching Bush over warrantless searches. I recently learned that Clinton too authorized warrantless searches, but with court approval. Wow! The courts actually approved circumvention of the constitution, which states in unambiguous terms that there shall be no warrantless searches by anyone. Clinton should have been impeached and convicted based on that alone, but he wasn't. Which means, that likely Bush won't either. Sigh.

This is some of the complication I was refering to.
As with most surgical procedures, the most common surgical abortion methods carry the risk of potentially serious complications. These risks include: a perforated uterus, perforated bowel or bladder, septic shock, sterility, and death.
I mentioned the possibility of it being life threatening. Though death from an abortion is highly unlikely, it is possible.

Women should have the right to abortion if they meet certain circumstances, like if they were raped...they might die if they had it...They should also have the right if it doesn't pass the time they(the fetus) starts to display brain activity.
You should also be aware, if a woman has many abortions it will render her sexual organs pretty much useless.

The thing is all these late term babies can survive outside the womb. Premature babies at six months with technology can survive outside the womb. A human baby's fate is in the hand of the mother solely, there is something so wrong here. 
Even in the event a woman's health is at risk in a late term, medical science is such where the baby can be extracted unharmed, death does not have to occur, partial birth is yet another last minute gruesome ""choice"" for the mother, but no ""choice"" for the baby.
In the event of deformity of the child, well, we simply live in a shallow society. I don't know what people call deformity. Some countries think female gender is a deformity and will abort, and do. A missing limb? Deafness? Blindness? Is that a deformity to kill? To hate? When we walk around and see a person ""different"", no arm or no leg, blind or deaf, do we hate them so much we think ""why didn't their mother abort them""! 
We've grown up in a society where imperfection is cause for the death penalty.
I can't help but think of a movie I saw where an entire family had disabilities, where the parents had their own children but also adopted like 12 others with severe disabilities. I know we all are different, but how can some people see the beauty of life while others see life as insignificant.
If partial birth abortion is going to continue, at least FOR HUMANE REASONS, pull the baby out COMPLETELY, don't play that political game where the baby's whole body/trunk is out and the head is almost out and ""our law"" allow doctors to violently kill it, my goodness if we hate so much, let's give the baby a little respect if you can call it that, pull the baby out and put the baby to sleep with medicine at least DON'T shove a syringe in the head and collapse it...SICK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
