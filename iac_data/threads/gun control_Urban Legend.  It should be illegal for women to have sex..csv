This is an extract of an National Public Radio (NPR) interview between a female broadcaster and US Army Lieutenant General Reinwald about sponsoring a Boy Scout Troop on his military installation.
Interviewer: ""So, LTG Reinwald, what are you going to do with these young boys on their adventure holiday?""
LTG Reinwald: ""We're going to teach them climbing, canoeing, archery, and shooting.""
Interviewer: ""Shooting! That's a bit irresponsible, isn't it?""
LTG Reinwald: ""I don't see why, they'll be properly supervised on the range.""
Interviewer: ""Don't you admit that this is a terribly dangerous activity to be teaching children?""
LTG Reinwald: ""I don't see how, we will be teaching them proper range discipline before they even touch a firearm.""
Interviewer: ""But you're equipping them to become violent killers.""
LTG Reinwald: ""Well, you're equipped to be a prostitute, but you're not one, are you?""

Hitler didn't attack Switzerland because a lot of the Nazi's money was kept in Swiss banks. Switzerland helped Nazi Germany invest and manage its money.

You bigger problems to worry about getting killed over than by another gun. The energy you put into gun violence is better served by saving people who will drown in pools and die in car accidents.

""Bob had told us that he’d been aboard the USS Constellation -- he remembered the year as 1960 -- when he had been part of joint maneuvers conducted with what were by then called the Japanese Defense Forces. Over dinner and drinks, with Japanese and American naval officers talking shop, many of the World War II veterans, the question had come up, why didn’t the Japanese invade what they must have recognized as the wide open West Coast of the United States at the beginning of that war?""-Massad Ayoob",1,23,topic_stance_votes_2
23,Urban Legend.  It should be illegal for women to have sex.,gun control,support,"First of all, everything I mentioned IS correct. Crime in Austraila and GB is increasing, in Switzerland it is mandatory for all males serving to be armed and have arms in their homes. Kelvin stole my thunder on the other debate concerning cars and pools. No, of course I wasnt referring to drinking water. The reality is is that more kids die in swimming pool accidents (and car accidents and bike accidents) than die via handguns. Unfortunately, Handgun Control, Inc. likes to pump up those numbers by including 20 yr. old gangbangers as ""kids."" My point is that the confiscationists justify their positions by telling us that doing it their way will save lives. If saving lives is all that matters, then why not ban cars? After all how many people die in car accidents each year ( I would think it would be in the tens of thousands, at least). You may have to walk a little further, but at least you know you won't die in a car accident. But then again, saving lives is NOT their intent and I just want one honest gun control proponent to admit it.

28,Urban Legend.  It should be illegal for women to have sex.,gun control,support,"VOR, you need to keep reading further on that link you sent me. That 14% figure is due to the Swiss army being reduced from 625K to 400K. If the 625K figure is used, the percentage of households with full auto weapons jumps to 22%. Also, this figure is only for FULL AUTO weapons. What about semi-auto or single shot weapons? My guess is that this percentage is higher when these are included. Also, your link mentions that ammo must be registered if bought at a store, but not if bought at a range and the overwhelming majority of ammo is bought at private ranges and the rule that the ammo must be used at the range is not inforced. Therefore essentially military ammo can be bought and posessed outside of military service. Finally it mentions that Swiss ""gun control"" is not the reason for the low crime rates and, granted, it also mentions that this system is not proof that more guns means less crime. However, I would think that the latter has more to do with deterring crime.
Also, concerning what I said about the Nazis not invading, from this same website,
""In World War II, Hitler wanted the Swiss gold reserves and needed free communications and transit through Switzerland to supply Axis forces in the Mediterranean. But when military planners looked at Switzerland's well-armed citizenry, mountainous terrain, and civil defense fortifications, Switzerland lost its appeal as an invasion target.""
Also,
""The experience of Swiss history has made national independence and power virtually synonymous with an armed citizenry.""
And a few more tidbits...
""In a nation of six million people, there are at least two million guns, including 600,00 fully automatic assault rifles, half a million pistols, and numerous machine guns. Virtually every home has a gun"" (Now that answers the questions about the inclusion of the non-full auto weapons, so 33% of households have guns)
""Thus, Handgun Control's assertion that all Swiss guns are registered is just plain wrong, and its claim that ""Switzerland and Israel strictly control handgun availability"" is more than a little inaccurate. ""
""Yet the only individuals who are ""restricted"" from buying handguns are children, the insane and ex-criminals.""

Now with respect to Ms. Brady. Her father had been shot in the head, obviously she is going to react emotionally. I, like others, am still waiting for her to explain why law abiding citizens should not be allowed to have guns. Also, lets not overlook the fact that she bought her son a shotgun for his birthday.

29,Urban Legend.  It should be illegal for women to have sex.,gun control,attack,"You're dodging the issue. I was addressing your claim that weapons ownership is mandatory.

The fact that American Rifleman is affiliated with a group that you hate doesn't necessarily make the content untrue. If every time a website that refutes what you say is quoted and is immediately dismissed as somehow ""right wing"" or ""pro-NRA"" or whatever, then this debate is pointless. Also, this euphemism keeps coming up, ""reasonable and sensible gun-control laws."" What exactly are ""reasonable and sensible gun contol laws?"" I see the label, but I never see whats inside. Can you give me an example of one of these laws that doesn't inhibit the law abiding citizen? Or even just one of these laws at all? Registration?--won't stop criminals. Licensing?--won't stop criminals. Trigger locks?--criminals don't use 'em. I don't think that Eric Harris or Dylan Klebold would have stopped to think: ""Gee, I can't slaughter all these people, my gun is registered!"" Also can you tell me what is wrong with the ""Eddie Eagle"" program? This is targeted at kids with the message: If you see a gun, don't touch, leave the area and go tell an adult! To me, that seems sensible, but I doubt that Ms. Brady would be willing to back it (in fact, I know she doesn't and to my knowledge, none of the confiscationists do). Why not? Because this program is affiliated with a group that she hates, the NRA. If she is truly concerned about safety, why wouldn't she be willing to work with the NRA? It seems that gun safety to her and other groups (i.e. Americans for Gun Safety) means no guns in the hands of private citizens, period.

The intent of my gun is whatever I intend to do with it, be it target shooting, hunting, putting a trigger lock on it and throwing away the key and keeping it for show, or self defense or defense of my family. I seriously hope that someone out there is not going to engage in an argument that I do not have a right to self defense! Yes, I could kill in self defense or defense of family but if that means that me or one of my loved ones could otherwise die then why is that wrong? Most often all that has to be done is someone brandishing a weapon to deter a crime and again, why is that wrong? If a gun is misused (by violating someone else's rights) by a criminal then they will be dealt with according to the law.

Amendment 1 mentions ""the people""
Amendment 2 mentions ""the people""
Amendment 4 mentions ""the people""
Amendment 9 mentions ""the people""
Amendment 10 mentions ""the people""
Now, I have never heard even the most staunch supporter of the ""collective"" theory of the second amendment ever challenge the meaning of the phrase ""the people"" in amendments 1,4,9 and 10. Clearly, it refers to the individual. The phrase ""the people"" in the second amendment suddenly refers to the ""collective?"" I don't think that this is what the founders had in mind. The problem with anything ""collective"" (such as collective property in the Soviet Union) is that it belong to everyone at once in theory, but only to the government in practice. Thus it is not a genuine right. The second amendment was written to protect the citizenry against the tyranny of government. Those who support the notion that the second amendment refers to the national guard don't seem to realize that the national guard can be federalized and become an arm of the U.S. government. What good would that do against a tyrannical government? With regard to the militia, United States Code (USC) Title 10-Armed forces:
a)""The militia of the United States consists of all able bodied males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in section 313 of title 32 under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become, citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are commissioned officers of the National Guard""
b)""The classes of the militia are -- (1) the organized militia, which consists of the National Guard and the Naval Militia; and (2) the unorganized militia, which consists of the members of the militia who are not members of the National Guard or Naval Militia.""
Regarding the ""unorganized militia"" the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Presser v. Illinois that, ""It is undoubtedly true that all citizens capable of bearing arms constitute the reserved military force or reserve militia of the United States as well as of the States.""
""And that the said constitution be never construed to authorize congress...to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping and bearing their own arms..."" -- Samuel Adams, delegate, First and Second Continental Congress.
""A militia, when properly formed, are in fact the people themselves... and include all men capable of bearing arms."" --Richard Henry Lee, Senator, First Congress
""I ask, Sir, what is the militia, it is the whole people, except for a few public officials."" -- George Mason, delegate, Constitutional Convention
The collective theorists like to point to U.S. v. Miller but even this doesn't offer any support for the ""collective right"" nor does it mention the national guard. Even constitutional legal scholar Lawrence Tribe (not exactly a conservative in anyones book) admits this. Also, regarding U.S. v. Emerson, the Fifth Circuit concluded: ""we reject the collective rights and sophisticated collective rights models for interpreting the Second Amendment. We hold, consistent with Miller, that it protects the right of individuals, including those not actually a member of any militia or engaged in active military service or training, to privately possess and bear their own firearms, such as the pistol involved here, that are suitable as personal, individual weapons and are not of the general kind or type excluded by Miller.""",1,48,topic_stance_votes_2

Nor did I mention US v. Miller, although no that you bring it up, Miller provides the precedent of banning specific types of handguns (in that case, sawed-off shotguns).

It should be illegal for women to have sex.,gun control,support,"With regard to the phrase ""well regulated militia"", it refers more to the readiness and ability than government authority to dictate what kind of arms the citizenry can possess. You are correct to point out that the citizen militia is to serve as a ""back up army"" for the defense of the country. Incidentally, I don't know why the govt would want to strictly limit the type of arms the citizenry can possess if we're being invaded. The ""back up army"" scenario isn't the entire story though. Yes, we would take up arms against a foreign invader that threatened our lives and liberty. But why should it be restricted to a foreign threat? The most inalienable of all rights is that of self preservation and preservation of liberty. We fought the War of Independence because of the tyranny of the crown (just read the Declaration of Independence). Speaking of the Declaration of Independence, I quote: ""But when a long Train of Abuses and Usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object, evinces a Design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their Right, it is their Duty, to throw off such Government and to provide new Guards for their future Security."" If the govt would usurp the rights of the people then of course we have the right to take up arms against it!
You are also correct about Emerson that basically outlaws sawed off shotguns. Do I agree with this? No. Do I think it sets a bad precedent? Yes. This advances the agenda of those that wish to institute an incremental gun ban.

First of all, you mean Miller, not Emerson. Second, we know just how much traction the gun control movement had in the late 1930s. I mean, it practically was the largest lobbying group in the country right? Hardly. This case wasn't activist in the slightest, it took the words ""well-regulated militia,"" observed that no well-regulated militia uses nor would ever need to use a sawed off shotgun. Hence, the govt. has the power to regulate it. Conservatives have an extremely annoying tendancy to label any court decision they dislike ""activist"" but half the time it isn't the case. Had the court ruled the other way, they would have created a right to gun ownership irrespective of the express limitations the constitution puts on it. The ""creation of new rights"" is the most common refrain of conservatives yelling about activism. A reversed decision is far more activist than the current one.
Why is it not a right? Why wasn't that ""God given""? What objective standard are you using to say what rights God gave us, and what are regulatable privilidges? I say driving is my God given right, and gun ownership is a priviledge.",1,54,topic_stance_votes_1

Proving my point, this is saying, ""this is what I think it is and therefore thats what it means. What the founders meant be damned...""
The Constitution is not a living document, it is to be interpreted as it was written.
The ninth amendment states: ""The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. ""
Hamilton was against the Bill of Rights on the grounds that the government could infringe on peoples' rights because they weren't specifically enumerated in the Bill of Rights. Madison put it in there to basically placate Hamilton. Plainly the ninth states that just because a certain right may not be enumerated, doesn't mean it doesn't exist. In other words if there was no second, I still retain the right to keep and bear arms even though it is not specifically enumerated. This is also why I believe the ""war on drugs"" is unconstitutional and also why I think prostitution should be legal. But thats another subject....
Rights are not created, they are inalienable (they are ""endowed by their creator...""). The Bill of Rights doesn't grant ""rights"" to government, only people. What I mentioned about the liberals refers only to government powers not granted by the constitution. The decisions that I label ""activist"" are those decisions where the court is granting powers to the government that I believe do not exist. Incidentally, the general welfare clause is another good example of where liberals (and many conservatives, quite frankly) are misinterpreting the constitution. 
I believe in a strict interpretation of the Constitution, this makes me neither a liberal or conservative. The SN was inspired by VOR who kept signing his posts with quotes from Karl Marx.
accepted.
If you're willing to accept this, doesn't that in a way contradict the gun control theory of ""well regulated militia?"" In other words the founders knew the importance of the citizenry militia against encroachments of the goverment, but then gave the government the power to make the encroachments easier by disarming the citizenry?

Well-regulated = Well-regulated. Communitative Property of mathamatics and logic (a=a, or if a=b, then b=a). It has nothing to do with what I or the founders thought.
I don't buy that. I buy the living document stance more. E.G., the government can create an Air Force, despite the fact that the founders never envisioned that, because the constitution adopts to modern circumstances.
Fair enough. Hence, the right to an abortion, and the right to privacy, and any number of so called activist decisions. I am merely pointing out the hypocrisy of labeling decisions activists b/c they create rights not found in the constitution, yet saying even rights not enumerated in the constitution still exist and need to be protected.
Great. You believe that ""liberal court created right A"" doesn't exist. I believe an unlimited right to bear arms doesn't exist. And of course the reverse is true, I believe liberal court right A does exist and you believe the unlimited right to bear arms exists. Who's to say what is activist and what isn't? Who's to say which is a right given by God and what isn't? Where's the objective standard for determination?
Generally that is considered a conservative posiion.
Because A BALANCE needed to be struck! It doesn't go entirely in either direction. We need to balance the right to revolt against an unjust govt. with the problems created when everyone owns assualt rifles and bazookas and we have no registration. Either extreme presents a problem.

If I misuse the gun, with or without proper training, I could be in some serious trouble.
Cute, but original intent does matter. They wrote it and they wrote it for a reason. If it didn't matter, the constitution would be meaningless.
No, the Air Force is part of the national defense. National defense is one of those powers originally delegated to the federal government by the people.
correct. In fact, I've never understood those (primarily conservatives) who like to point out, ""there is no right to privacy in the constitution."" They have not figured out that the constitution limits government, not people. They should read the fourth and the ninth. Hell, they should read the whole thing for once.
Nobody will deny that there are times that the constitution might need to be changed ""to adopt modern circumstances"" but it has to be done via the amendment process that the founders took the time to outline. Not only is this the legal way but the democratic way. It cannot be done by judicial fiat.
Again, the decisions I'm referring to as ""activist"" are those that are granting powers to the government that are not enumerated. Thats why I mentioned that any decision that DENIES the right to keep and bear arms is ""activist"" because thats equivalent to granting the government a power that is not enumerated. The Bill of Rights doesn't grant rights to government, only limits it, and grants rights to the people.
what problems are those? The same problems we have now when people misuse firearms? It doesn't matter if its a bazooka or a single shot .22, if it is misused in a crime then the perp is dealt with harshly. Law abiding citizens are not going to misuse their firearms and those with criminal records are already banned from owning guns.
I can't find anything in the Act that even remotely comes close to a federal registration database. If I am called in service to the country (which is what the Act was written for) and if my commanding officer wants to check my weapon and even wants to make note of what I have (which they can do) then fine. But, even this is only done at the state level. If I have not been called in service to the country then nobody is going to come to my door asking to check my weapons.

However, your utopia cannot exist because of the human tendancy to seek power. Marx thought that if everyone became equal, there would be no problems, and everyone could live together in perfect harmony. However, when everyone tried to live together, there was a group who tried to rise up and gain more power. In the end, people began to realize that Marx's ideas would not work because there would be an elite few who would attempt to screw everyone else over.
Gun control would produce the same results. The people would be the law-abiding citizens, and that elite few would be the criminals. The criminals, realizing that the rest of the people have no guns, would then attain guns through illegal means.
