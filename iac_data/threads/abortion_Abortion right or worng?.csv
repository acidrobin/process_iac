0,Abortion right or worng?,abortion,support,"Personally i don't believe in abortion. It's morally wrong and i think it's good that it's illegal. In my area girls under the age of 16 who fall preganant must have their parents permission before they can abort their baby which i think is a good thing.
Nowadays too many teenagers are getting drunk and having unprotected sex which leads to pregnancy and because they can't be bothered to look after the baby that get abortions. It was their fault in the first place for having unprotected sex so i don't feel sorry for them and they should either keep the baby and deal with the fact that it's their responsibility now or give the baby up for adoption, if they feel they are old enough to have sex then they are old enough to loo after a baby.
Some people don't realise this but it is an actual living thing that you are killing when you have an abortion, how could anyone kill their own child, because they are selfish or just aren't ready for kids, well if you're not ready for kids than you should have used protection.
Now i can fully sympathise with rape victims who end up preganant, it's understandable if they don't want to have a baby by the man who raped them. But it's these silly women who get themselves pregnant then don't want the baby.

2,Abortion right or worng?,abortion,attack,"I generally really hate it when responders slice and dice others' quotes and address each little fragment. It can lead to taking a phrase out of context of a larger thought, or even nit-picking and really isn't good debate.
I am going to pick some nits here, however, because I think this person says a lot of things without thinking. I am sure she is well-meaning, and the fact that she is posting something means she is trying to communicate, but my take on this is a repeat of others' ideas that she hasn't really thought about. Now that is pretty frigging presumptuous of me, but here it is. 
You don't believe it exists?
What do you base this moral judgement upon? Really, really think about it.
We make things illegal because we think doing so will make a better society than if they were legal. This is unrelated to whether we judge them as moral or not. What are the consequences of making abortion illegal?
First, do you know that for sure?
Are there some circumstances where requiring parental permission could make matters worse?
DO you know this or have been told? If they are alcohol abusers and couldn't be bothered to look after babies, do you think they would make good mothers? What about fetal alcohol syndrome.
That is not a very compassionate stance.
Keeping the baby seems to be a bad option if they are, as you judge, irresponsible. Wouldn't abortion be another option?
I don't know of anyone who doesn't consider an embryo or fetus living.
A fetus is a distinctly different thing than a child.
Well they didn't. That's a nice proclamation, but it's a little late. Perhaps you would fight for better sex education?
Is it murder or isn't it? Is it morally wrong or not?
Women don't get themselves pregnant. Maybe it's you who needs the sex education.

3,Abortion right or worng?,abortion,attack,"I think often abortion is wrong but I do not agree with criminalizing it. Primarily the reasons that are used to justify criminilzation are hugely fallacious and secondarily because it won't do a thing that is positive. A woman who is determined to end her pregancy - will. Criminalization will simply make it extremely dangerous. I am responsible, have even had my tubes tied, but if I were to become pregnant and that pregnancy were the result of rape or a threat to my health or livlihood I would end it - and I will not be checking the law books first. Every woman has her line in the sand - abortion will go on regardless of its legal standing. There are a miriad of reasons seek abortion - comdemning those reasons does nothing (i.e. calling them selfish) - addressing them could help. The reasons are valid.
I am torn on this one. Should a parent be able to make a life altering choice like that for their daughter? At the very least they should not be allowed to stop her from selecting adoption. And I do believe measures need to be in place where a girl can go to a judge to get premission for one if she is in an abusive home. My sister in law worked at a domestic violence shelter - she had 13 year old in there, pregnant by her own father, with the mother's consent. A judge immediately emancipated her so she could get an abortion and she was then placed into foster care.
There are so many things to address in here. Let me start by saying that I am a 36 year old mom - so I know what I am talking about when it comes to parenting. Secondly I strongly advocate encouraging personal responsibility in people and in our teens. I think strong, in your face, reality check sex education is needed. They need to talk to teenage moms in the ghetto. They need to talk to people who are living and dieing with AIDS. They need to see just how much it costs to have a baby and then to raise it. We need to stop teaching girls that men are the end all be all meaning of life for them - (""when you get married...."", ""when are you gonna get married?"", or the two I hear ""why don't you remarry?"", ""why couldn't you keep your husband?"") - this MANATTHECENTEROFTHEUNIVERSE idea we push on girls will lead to sex. We have to get rid of the nagative stigma that comes with being a single female.
These things said.
Much of what you say in your last paragragh is so dead wrong.
1 - It is not just teens who seek abortion.
2 - Looking after a baby is a REALLY BIG DEAL. Its expensive. Its hard. It requires a LOT of responsibility. Most teens do not have it. It is absurd to assume that a pregnancy will suddenly mean you get touched by the responsibility magic wand. Teens are generally a bad choice for parents. I do think that if the girl is healthy enough to maintain a pregnancy, has access to adequate health care and the baby will be born into or given to an environement that can adequately support it, that she should be encouraged to have the baby. And that she can stay in school. My neice had a classmate expelled for getting pregnant (Catholic school). That enfuriated me. 
Under absolutely no circumstances should pregnancy be used as a punitive measure - as your stance seems to suggest. It is absolutely abhorrant - and what a legacy for the child ""hi I am here because my mother needed to be punished for having sex.""
Actually I think most people DO realize this.
Agreed - birth control should be used, readily and easily available to anyone who wants it no questions asked.
However, you are trivializing the lives and reasons women choose abortion. 
Not being ready for kids - what does that mean, why aren't they ready? And the reasons go beyond this - 
Money - pregnant women and babies do not live off of air - this reason ties to things like jobs/careers/education. It is not selfish to need to support oneself - and in many cases they may have others they are supporting as well.
Health - not just whether the pregnancy will kill the woman - but lots of health reasons. Will a pregnancy cause her damage? Is she undergoing treatments/medications for a life threatening disease? Is she a vulnerable adult? (Primarily the learning disable or severely mentally ill - i.e., it is not a good idea to take a severely dillusional schizophrenic off her meds if it means she will try to fly off bridges.). Is she a severe addict?
Home life - is she in an abusive situation? I had friend who got pregnant by a man who would have killed her if he found out. I had another a friend who was thrown out of her house at 16 for being pregnant.
This is just the tip of the iceburg. Pregnancy is a complicated and disruptive even when planned. Do not trivialize this - try to meet it in the middle and your will stand a better chance at reducing abortion than condemning people will.

4,Abortion right or worng?,abortion,attack,"thelmoose, your post was a little nit picky for saying you don't like it when people doing it...I think you went a little overboard but you did make some good points for he/she to think about and I will address those.
This is not exactly true. We can make laws based on moral judgments...in fact, claiming something is ""better for society"" is a moral judgment. Even so, a standard for ""what is best for society"" involves looking at morals and determining how you want to better society. I guess many laws come down to moral claims at the very end.
This is a good point...it wasn't compassionate at all. Playing the blame game is not gonna help the situation.
While true I am not sure that this matters. A child is distinctly different from a teenager who is distinctly different from an adult.
I agree...you can't take the stance of saying compassion will sometimes override a life. If a couple breaks up and the girl is sad you don't say ""well.. I have so much compassion for the girl that this justifies me killing the guy"". It is inconsistent and takes the focus off preserving a life and makes the focus a punishment (or something) against a woman.",3,5,topic_stance_votes_1
5,Abortion right or worng?,abortion,support,"Firstly, i don't know why you're all trying to read in between the lines. I am in my late teens. I am not trying to be compasionate and although i'm not perfect, i can easily decide whether i get pregnant or not. The reason why i say this is because a lot of my friends have got themselves pregnant, yes they GOT themselves pregnant because although it takes two to tango it doesn't take too much effort to go to the chemist. Protection is made so easy these days for young ones, it's practically handed out on a plate and it's very private (parents need not know). But they are so nieve and lazy that they don't bother, they'd rather bury their head in the sand. Honestly, i live next to a city which has the highest teen pregancys in Britain and do you want to know the reason for high sexual activity? Boredom! Yes they're that bored they just go out get drunk and have sex. In Scotland we do get sex education (we even have electricity!), which is very good and it put me off but it still doesn't stop a lot of others who viewed the videos as old fashioned and silly.
As regards my knowledge of childcare i am currently studying it at college and have looked after many children since i was the age of 11. My mother has manic depression and therfore it was me who practically raised my little brother who has ADD and learning difficulties and he was born when i was 11. Not only my Mum heavily relies on me but so do many of my Mothers single parent friends. So please don't undermine me.
Also, i know that teens aren't the only ones that are irrisponsible (unwanted pregnancy) but the only excuse for unwanted pregnancy in my books is if the couple decided not to use drugs as protection and the condom splits/slips. Or, if they get pregnant on the pill which is very rare.
The only thing i do have compassion for are pregnant rape victims. As i simply stated in my other post i still don't condone abortion, i simply understand them wanting to have an abortion.
Ps, No offense to anyone, this isn't directed at anyone but being a mother doesnt automaticaly make you a good mother.

No offense, but I am in my early teens and understand the situation more than you.
They're just kids. They're not as responsible and smart as adults are, and you can't hold people responsible for everything. Is it my fault if I get mugged and murdered because I left my home? Is it your fault if you get hit by a car because you decided to go for a walk? Everything has a consequence, but you can't hold everyone responsible for each individual consequence.
OK? How can you blame the children for this? It may seem easy for you to not have sex, but it is not for others. You just don't know their circumstances, and if you did I would think you'd have much more compassion for them.
I agree completely with that statement. We need huge reform in our sex-education programs around the world. BTW, didn't you just say you were from the UK in your last post?

Yes, I am being hard on some young mothers (still good friends with them though), I simply don't sympathize with laid back mothers who couldn't be bothered having protected sex, not bursting at them or anything.

But you're saying that because it's the guys responsibility too (a guy of whom she'll probably never see again after casual sex) that after sex the woman should just moan and winge that it's his fault too and not do anything about it? How stupid is that??? She can easily get the ""morning after pill"" up to three days after having unprotected sex. There's just no excuse...apart from when the normal pill or the morning after pill doesn't work as you said (which for the morning after pill is something like 25% chance after the 1st day, and then lowers to 50% chance after the 3 or 4th day, so the later you put off taking the morning after pill after sex the more risk there is of becoming pregnant. And for the normal daily pill there's up to 5% chance of getting pregnant, depending on which form of pill and any interfering medication etc). But...if the pill doesn't work I believe the woman would have to have a good argument for terminating the pregnancy. There are stronger versons of these drugs though, e.g the rod, injection etc. These other variaties are more or less 100% protection.

You need to revisit the law books. Abortion is legal - and even if it weren't it has/would happen.
I can't see how someone can generalize and stereotype a miriad of life experiences like that.
Although it would be swell if everyone handled their sex lives responsibly, sex doesn't require responsibility - just hormones. Pregnancy and raising kids, however, do require responsibility. And you can't hold a 14 accountable like an adult. Legally they are not one. They can't even have a job yet - and one thing I have noticed about this kid of mine is that he is expensive.

No, it's a foetus and a life. You also don't know the reasons people have abortions, and can't possibly understand why they felt that the best decision to make would be to abort their pregnancy. Whatever the reasons, it's a woman's decision on what she does with her body, and pregnancy isn't something anyone should be forced into. 
I never had sex at a party. You are pretty much generalising anyone who has an abortion as someone who has unprotected sex with someone they have just met -- that's obviously not the case for everyone. I, for one, fell pregnant to my boyfriend and father of my 16-month old daughter, who I live with, while also on the pill. I made the decision to abort the pregnancy because we have just taken on a lot of financial committments and if I had another child I wouldn't be afford to care for my daughter in the way I can just now. I can still sleep at night because I did what was best for my family. 
Abortion isn't an easy decision, or an easy thing to go through. And saying that someone wasn't responsible enough to have sex is hardly an excuse to punish them by allowing them to give birth to a child, which takes far more responsibility. Pregnancy should never be seen as a punishment, and forcing a baby onto someone who doesn't want to love and care for that child isn't any more humane for that baby than an abortion which takes place before the foetus is mentally developed.

No, I would not allow a woman to abort a perfectly healthy fetus that is two days from being born. As I have consistently stated in this forum, the criteria which is critically important for me is the mental existence of the fetus - i.e. once it gains some level of mental existence (the first possibility of that being around the beginning of the third trimester), then it gains rights. After that, it is a matter of balance of rights - ex. the woman can abort the mentally existing fetus if it is risking her life since I allow for killing others when necessary for self defense. I would generally outlaw third trimester abortions except for risks to the mother's life, major risks to her health, and possibly for rape or incest. I am also open to mercy killing of severely deformed fetuses (as I am open to mercy killing of those who are under great unrelievable suffering and who do not wish to continue living). Before a fetus gains mental existence, it is just a body with ""nobody home"" so I would allow for uncontested abortion in that first and second trimester. Also, by that point, the woman would have had quite a lot of time to decide on whether or not to get the abortion. At some point, it simply becomes too late.",121,124,topic_stance_votes_2

So, since you would have abortion outlawed, that gives women no choice in their pregnancy - you are forcing them to carry the pregnancy to term. Women who have sex are not CHOOSING to be pregnant and have a child. Pregnancy might just be an unwanted consequence of sex - just like being mugged might be an unwanted consequence of a well-dressed man walking in a bad neighborhood after dark. These women are not choosing to become pregnant, just like the mugging victim is not choosing to be mugged. You would leave the women with no choice as to their pregnancy so you are forcing them to stay pregnant.
As to your previous comment that I would force women in the third trimester to carry their pregnancies to term, the situation is quite different.

Question: If I force women to carry their pregnancies to term, how do I force them? What forces am I exerting on them?
Answer: You wish to have abortion (or nearly all abortions) outlawed. Therefore, you wish to force them through law to carry their pregnancies to term. In your scenario, they never have a choice about their pregnancy so they are being forced. Laws and their execution are the only means by which our society can force any of its individuals to do anything. For example, people are forced by law to pay taxes. Yes, they can try to circumvent that, but if they do and they are caught then they are punished - including physicallly forcing them into prisons on occasion. Forcing a woman to carry a pregnancy to term by introducing laws outlawing abortion is no different - it is force through laws and their execution. 
Question / Statement:Secondly you too support forcing women, by law, to keep their pregnancies and not abort them - thereby forcing them to carry their pregnancies to term. 
Answer:  I force this to happen in the third trimester for reasons other than the few exceptions I gave - risk to mother's life, health, rape, incest, major birth deformation. However, by the third trimester, she would have had six months to decide whether or not to keep the pregnancy. There is a world of difference between that and what you suggest, which gives her NO choice EVER in her pregnancy about whether or not to keep it. I DO give her choice, it just has a time limit. You give her NO choice. That is a BIG difference.

Is it a double standard to say that it is ok to use force to, say, stop a rape from happening vs not ok to use force to make someone your slave? Sometimes the use of force is justified and sometimes it isn't. We obviously disagree about the use of force (through law) in abortion.

164,Abortion right or worng?,abortion,attack,"So, let us present our reasons. It will make for a far more interesting discussion.
I think you are wrong in forcing a woman to keep her pregnancy in the first and second trimester since I, and pretty much all others on the pro-choice side, place a lot of value in a person's right to their own body and forcing a pregnancy to term is a violation of that right of the mother to her own body. If it were only a question of the woman's right to her body and no other rights of any other person existed regarding her pregnancy, then the issue would be clear cut for her entire pregnancy. However, the question on both sides of the debate is ""When does the FETUS acquire rights?"". Though people on the pro-choice side differ in their views (ex. some say that the fetus does not acquire rights until birth), apparently most would severely restrict third trimester abortions - suggesting that most pro-choice advocates start taking the fetus's rights into account at that point (third trimester). I myself find mental existence to be the critical development (be it even a rudimentary sense of self, rudimentary thoughts or emotions, or a sense of registered pain - as apposed to mere reflex action). Science tells us that this cannot develop until around the start of the third trimester, when sufficient connections develop in the cerebral cortex of the brain. Before the fetus develops a rudimentary mental existence, it is just a body with ""nobody home"" which, in my view, does not get rights. I did not exist as a person until I started to do so mentally. If I had been aborted prior to that time, nobody would have been hurt. The same goes for any fetus. After that mental existence starts, then there is a balance of the rights of the fetus to life vs the rights of the mother to her own body (or any other rights that come in, such as her right to self-protection if that fetus's life is risking hers). In general then, I would leave abortion completely free in the first and second trimesters and restrict it to a few exceptions in the third trimester (including risk to mother's life, severe risk to her health, mercy killing and possibly rape, incest).
So, what is your justification for forcing a woman to continue her pregnancy in all trimesters?

For me, mental existence is critically important since it is critical to the existence of a person with rights. ""Genocide"" of mere bodies without minds is irrelevant to me - so that the term ""Genocide"", in my view, cannot be used if you are only talking about bodies with ""nobody home"".

People in comas, temporary or otherwise, do continue to have some level of higher brain waves so, at least at a rudimentary level, they continue to mentally exist. I think that, as long as they mentally exist, they have rights.
Do you view some level of mental existence as important? If not, then what criteria do you use to define a person with rights - i.e. what characteristics are important for those rights to exist? With newly fertilized zygotes, the only characteristics I can think of is that it has a full set of human DNA in a separate growing body. Since you think that abortion of zygotes is wrong, do you think that there is more to a zygote than human DNA and the start of a growth process?

As I have mentioned in other threads, I give rights to people - where I define people as mentally existing humans. I have enough sympathy toward animals that I support anti-animal cruelty laws, but I would not give animals the same rights as humans.
Also, where brainwaves are concerned, the scientific understanding is that we cannot have our mental processes if the brain has not developed enough to show those brainwaves - the two go hand in hand (brain waves and mental processes). If the brain waves are disorganized, then I suppose that they might not indicate mental processes so, in setting the standard at that sufficient development of the brain, I am giving the benefit of the doubt to lean closer to the pro-life side. I'm not sure when science can claim with certainty that there are mental processes, but that would most likely be later in pregnancy if not at or after birth. My stance gives rights to the fetus at the earliest point that my moral stance allows - when it has a real chance of having mental existence.

---on edit---
Here is a link to the ""Universal Declaration of Human Rights"" of the United Nations - as close as one gets to a world concensus on human rights. There, it states in Article 1: ""All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood."" Notice that, in that statement of human rights, they are equal AT BIRTH. There is clearly no extrapolation to pre-birth equality.
Also, from Article 25: ""All children, whether born in or out of wedlock, shall enjoy the same social protection."" Again, the defining point of human rights is birth.
http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html
Also, here is a link from a Catholic News site (certainly not pro-choice biased) that states that Amnesty International is neutral on the issue of abortion: ""The British section of Amnesty International has endorsed a policy in support of legalizing abortion which could change the human rights group's global neutral policy on abortion."" From http://www.catholicnews.com/data/sto...ns/0701703.htm . So, even if you did find a quote from Peter Benenson expressing pro-life views (which you have yet to do), it would not matter since it is Amnesty International that has some world clout about human rights. Few people care what Peter Benenson's view on the topic is - he certainly does not speak for the world.

199,Abortion right or worng?,abortion,attack,"As I said before, once the unborn develops enough so that it CAN have mental existence, I give it rights. I do not give it rights BEFORE it can have mental existence. Therefore, it gets no rights in the first and second trimester and I would allow unrestricted abortions then. Yes, if left to grow, an embryo will most likely develop mental existence but that is in its future, not in its present - meaning that it has the POTENTIAL to have that mental existence but does not have it NOW. It is its current state which I judge in determining if it has rights - not its future state. After all, a pre-fertilized egg also has the potential to become a full person if a few things happen (including fertilization). I judge the living entity in question by what it is *at that moment*.
If you do not understand that point, I will put it another way. There are three states of knowledge about the fetus's mental existence:
1) Prior to roughly the beginning of the third trimester, it CANNOT have mental existence (as supported by evidence of neurologists). Therefore, I do not give it rights.
2) At some point, there is concrete evidence of mental existence - perhaps once it first gains consciousness. It clearly has rights for me at that stage.
3) There is a period of time from around the beginning of the third trimester to the point where we definitely know it has mental existence. During this time, we just don't know either way if it has mental existence. One can either err on the side of caution (as I do) and say that, since it CAN have mental existence during this time, give the fetus rights. This runs the smallest risk (indeed zero risk) of unjustly aborting a fetus that might actually have mental existence at that moment. Otherwise, one can err on the side of certainty and not grant the fetus rights until mental existence is proven. That runs a fairly big risk of unjustly aborting a fetus that might have mental existence at that moment - which is why I prefer to err on the side of caution instead.
Look, as I have, at various ways in which people use the term ""those as yet unborn"". When I googled that term, it usually referred to future generations. Either way, this is not an important point since I have already showed that Amnesty International is neutral on the subject of abortion (or even currently leaning toward supporting abortion rights). Where your quote is concerned, few people care what Peter Benenson said. He is only known because of founding the organization Amnesty International that does have world clout.
I also refered to the UN Declaration of Human Rights (the most relevant to our arguement) and how it does not outline fetal rights as being included. I noticed that you ignored that.
You also have still not given a reference to the Human Rights Act which you mentioned. As I said, I tried Googling it but found nothing with regard to a general US Human Rights Act. So, which one do you mean? Supply a link if you want to use that as an arguement.
This part of the discussion started because you claimed that human rights include the unborn. Even if Peter Benenson was clearly pro-life (which you have yet to prove with a link), it is of little importance compared to the fact that the UN and Amnesty International do not include the unborn in their view of human rights. These are two organizations that are well known and respected in the world where human rights are concerned and can, to some degree, be considered to voice global opinions on human rights. Barely anybody knows or really cares who Peter Benenson was - including me, since I hadn't even heard his name until you mentioned him. I doubt that most people in this forum know who he is either.

Anyway, since you have made little to no attempt to understand my posts, I will opt out of this particular part of the discussion.
If you think any large portion of people in the world recognize Peter Benenson as the authority on human rights, you are fooling yourself. Large numbers of people do recognize the UN and Amnesty International as authorities on human rights. 
Besides, you still haven't even given a link stating explicitly that Peter Benenson was a pro-life proponent. I tried to search that out myself and couldn't find any such link (ex. by Googling with the keywords Peter Benenson and abortion). It is interesting to note that even pro-life sites that I came across did not say he was pro-life, just that he was a Catholic (which may or may not mean that he was a pro-life advocate). An example is this site: http://www.lifesite.net/ldn/2006/jun/06060208.html - which is a pro-life site. You would think that a pro-life site that is arguing against Amnesty International becoming pro-choice would certainly state the fact that Peter Benenson was an advocate for pro-life if it were true - especially since they are already mentioning him as the founder of Amnesty International so they would have had every opportunity.
So, none of your arguements have been proven. No recognized world authority on human rights (of which the UN and Amnesty International are by far the most recognized and respected) support pre-birth fetuses as having the same rights as born people.
As for whether there are arguements that say that the unborn SHOULD have rights - that is what we are arguing in this abortion debate. Since recognized authorities don't agree with you, you have to present logical, rational arguements to convince people. To be honest, I don't fully agree with those recognized authorities either since I would prefer rights to be given around the beginning of the third trimester - not waiting until birth to give them. My arguement is for the criticality of mental existence and when it can first reside in a fetus.

First, world authorities do not recognize that fetuses have human rights. So, you have no support for your claim.
Second, the word ""a human"" has generally two definitions:
From the online American Heritage Dictionary:
hu·man (noun)
1. A member of the genus Homo and especially of the species H. sapiens.
2. A person: the extraordinary humans who explored Antarctica.
When people (at least most authorities in the world) speak of human rights, they appear to speak of the second definition - i.e. person, where we all obviously disagree on what person means. The great majority of times when the term ""human rights"" comes up, people are referring to governments who trod on them (ex. arresting or torturing and killing people who speak out against them, etc.). The only times I have heard ""human rights"" extrapolated to fetal rights is when pro-life proponents speak.
Besides, I asked you to go into specifics and you did not. Why? Because you seem to have no supporting arguements to justify that fetuses deserve human rights besides arguing that the ""human rights"" that people speak of refer also to zygotes, embryos and early fetuses - an unsupported claim.

So it is clear that you see the Amnesty International biased on this issue since it is leaning pro-choice.

I was talking about the US. Either way, it is not an important point to dwell on so I am just letting this drop. It is too much of a tangent.
It is not defined as genocide, so the burden of proof is yours to convince people to include it as genocide. 
Lets see if I got this right. In one sentence (out of loads of sentences), I forgot to include the word unwanted. That specific sentence referred to my denial of your claim that ""unwanted unborn"" are an ethnic group. When I questioned whether the term ""unwanted"" was important, it was only in the context of whether it was important to the question of whether it would fall under the term ethnic group. What logic, or lack thereof, did you use to extrapolate from that to claim that I think the term unwanted is unimportant to the rest of your arguement? Tsk. Tsk. Illogical.
How can one have attitudes or behaviors without mental existence - much less having non-mentally existing beings functioning in a group or organization? You can't. So that one is out. What others do you think are applicable?
Well, all you have done in this last part of your post is to restate one definition of the word ""person"" out of a choice of at least three (without justifying why you think that is the only valid definition).

You obviously underestimate the power of words. 
Anyway, I give you the benefit of the doubt, I'll put it down to your clumsiness. 
There is no requirement for mental existence, culture is recognised in the observations of differences in groups. The definition describes the behaviour that characterise the functioning of a group. There are attitudes and behaviours forwards the unwanted unborn that characterise the functioning of all the unwanted unborn. 
I'm not claiming it is the only definition, I'm saying a human is a person, like it says. There is no criteria for the definition of the word to fulfil the entire description in the list. If we did we would have to exclude most people from personhood on account of the fact that they do not play characters in plays, since it was given as an alternative definition for a person.

If there had been a mass killing of black people because they were black, then that would have been classified as genocide because of their RACE where racial groups are one of the groups described under the definition of genocide. There are subdivisions of that general racial group into various more distinct African racial groups, as well as mixed black-white, black-Asian, etc. - but the general categories of race still are relevant and are used in both legal and every day context. 
You are funny. You misrepresented my post by saying that I think the word ""unwanted"" was irrelevant to the whole arguement (not just in the context of whether (unwanted) unborn fits to the term ethnic groups) and when I challenge you on that misrepresentation, you cannot explain how you did not misrepresent my post and you say instead that it is due to my clumsiness. I am suspecting that misrepresentation of posts is the only tool you use in debate, along with avoidance of questions. You do realize that it is against the rules of this forum to deliberately misrepresent posts, don't you?
I remind you that the section of the definition of culture that you claimed applied to the unwanted unborn was ""The predominating attitudes and behaviour that characterize the functioning of a group or organization."" That suggests first that the beings in question have an attitude or behavior. Rocks, plants, and other non-mentally existing beings cannot have an attitude or behavior. Also, the second requirement of that section of the definition is the ""functioning of a group or organization"" made up of the beings in question. How, pray tell, do the unwanted unborn function in a group or organization?

""
So, by your comment, you have only shown again that you have poor reading comprehension. Pay attention when you read !
Also, the US government and other governments I have encountered, as well as most African Americans themselves refer to black (or African American, etc.) as a racial category. Perhaps you don't understand the idea (as most do) that there are many levels and sublevels of racial categories. 
Your lack of reading comprehension never fails to astound me. I will spell it out for you.
In my post #260, I said ""You are the one making the extrapolation that ethnic groups refer also to the unborn. "" where I had forgotten to include the word unwanted.
When you pointed out my lack of the use of the word unborn in that sentence, then, in post #270, I admitted to the misrepresentation, said it was not deliberate but an accident, but questioned whether it would have made any difference in the arguement of whether the unborn vs unwanted unborn are part of an ethnic group. ***NOTE: I only questioned the need for the word ""unwanted"" in the situation of the validity of using the term ethnic group - NOT in ALL situations.***
Since then, you have claimed that I thought the word ""unwanted"" was un-necessary to the entire debate. This claim is wrong and I challenge you to quote me to substantiate it. You can't, can you? That is because you have misrepresented my post #270. You have misrepresented so many of my posts that occasionally, out of sheer frustration, I make a comment.
I see that ShadowPikachu was right when claiming that you will end up challenging each and every word. I have no doubt that, if I look up the definition of behavior or attitude (which I was about to do but stopped) to show you that you are wrong, then you would twist some word within that definition...ad infinitum. This is getting too ridiculous so I am dropping this part of the discussion with the full knowledge that any other readers can see how you distort the meanings of words. If you don't see that, then frankly I just don't care anymore.
I see that, along with reading comprehension problems, you have problems comprehending English. The sentence I wrote to which you are responding was: ""Ok, so you agree that your definition of person is only one of a number of valid definitions. Right?'. When I say ""one of a number of valid definitions"", that means that yours is a valid definition and so are the others - i.e. yours is one of many valid definitions. In your response here, you wrote:
You do not see in my text where it says: “I'm not claiming it is the only definition”
If you can (which is highly doubtful), explain how you could have interpreted my sentence to mean that I still claimed that you thought your definition of person was the only valid one.
You are missing the point AGAIN. I had asked you ""Outside of that, you have made comparisons to the struggle of black people again without going into details in the comparison. For example, you could state specifically why YOU thought the discrimination against black people was wrong and how that specifically relates to abortion. '
In that question, I was asking you to make the comparison directly - i.e. to state your reasons for thinking discrimination against black people is wrong and to apply those to the abortion debate. The reason I asked this is that the reasons I have for thinking discrimination is wrong (mainly based on empathy for the suffering of those who would suffer such discrimination) is completely unrelated to abortion of early fetuses an embryos. If you have a reason that IS related, then state it and state HOW it is related. So often, when I ask you for SPECIFICS, you dodge the question.

But where is the drive to legalize abortion leading modern nations? What is the acceptance of abortion doing to our societies? Judge Robert Bork calls the U.S. Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion, an attempt by liberal secular elites to impose their values on the rest of the nation (see Bork, p. 174). He observes: ""Abortion has coarsened us"" and it reflects ""the brutalization of our culture"" (ibid., p. 182). He states: ""The systematic killing of unborn children in huge numbers is part of a general disregard for human life that has been growing for some time. Abortion… deepens and legitimates the nihilism [disregard for traditional values] that is spreading in our culture and finds killing for convenience acceptable"" (ibid, p. 192).

Medical definition
1. Having sense perception; conscious.
2. Experiencing sensation or feeling.

First off, that qualifies animals to be sentient. They experience sensation , are able to suffer and are concious.
It isn't sentience that is the issue. Or the possibility of sentience, because the beginning of our species at the very beginning were not sentient but they did have the possibility.
Unborn children, can suffer , but they can't realy acknowledge it in their mentality, their species is def sentient.
But they do n ot have mental existance, the possibility but not the current.
Animals may have mental existance, but we cannot understand or detect it if it is at the level of humans. 
They are sentient by belonging to a specy that is sentient so an unborn child can't be qualified for abortion or unqualified by that. what about the ability to survive by having the mental capacity, I mean so when it has signs of mental existance if it were not in the womb, mental existance shows the possiblity of being able to live and not rely on another to live, it would be smart enough to soon figure out how to breathe.",345,352,topic_stance_votes_2

My sister had an abortion. She's depressed, she has low confidence. She's beautiful in my eyes, and i'm sure in others as well.
Back to abortion, It's murder, it is. They say it should be the mother's choice? Is it the mothers's choice when the baby is out of her and she's been caring for it for five years, and she decides that she doesn't want it anymore and she DROWNS IT.

1.) Very very true. I completely agree. So many people have so many feelings about so many different things. So many different religions and beliefs. Therefore there will always be a counter argument that has the equal amount of inspiration, and statistics, and emotion. Which a lot of time between people causes problems, because no one's willing to actually listen. Which is why I'm loving this online debate stuff, because it doesn't quite matter if a person reads it or not, it's there and everyone (hopefully) Gets the satisfaction of it being at least acknowledged.
2.) Totally. Yes, it really does. Uhm let's see... In the circumstances that a woman has a problem with the baby inside her, and if she doesn't have an abortion it will threaten her life. Only in that case do I believe killing the baby is the only choice. Otherwise I am really, strongly against abortions. 
3.) I wish it wasn't performed. Yet the thing of the matter is now they've put it to where you can have an abortion up to 9 months. 
If we're going to keep abortions then at least I think we should make the law a little more strict. Like having parental permission, or not letting someone have an abortion if it's way into the pregnancy. My question is, why on Earth would someone wait that long to get an abortion. They’ve already gone through with the morning sickness, the pain of contractions. Why not just have the baby and give it up for adoption?
Neanderthal79:1.)""Another thing for you hardcore conservatives. You don't see many white, anti-abortion women having black fetuses transplanted into their uteruses, do you? You don't see them adopting crack babies, do you?

3.) If you use scripture to debate, you're an idiot""
1.) Maybe not, but I know quite a lot of white people who have adopted a black baby. Personally as a hardcore conservative, i don't think race is important. I think people shouldn't look at the color of our skin to identify us. I think it's sad when people do. I mean actually at the rate that white people are having children (less and less). I think in maybe within a 100-200 years the white community will no longer be white-white. I think there will be very few white people like maybe just to give an example: Less then 10% of all schools will be white. But that's just my opinion. Because there are so many interracial couples now. Which is great, and i support. It's really good for the genes, and helps prevent disabilities for the baby.
2.)I think I understand where you're coming from... If you could help me out a little more I'd love to listen. It sounds logical... But I’m not sure where you're coming from with it. Yet again I do think abortion is a crime so it just depends on your logic =0) 
3.)
I personally don't see how you'd be an idiot to relate this topic to scripture. On the means that some people have strong feelings about the bible, and they believe it's true, and the word is true. So if people go by the bible to live life ( Try to) Then they'd come across something that relates to this topic I don't see any problem with sharing it. Alot of people may disagree, but I think it's a very good piece of argument. Except the fact that not everyone is Christian. Therefore not everyone believes the bible. Yet that goes back to the whole *Counter argument thing* which is very smart.

By this, I mean I support a woman's right to control the use of her body, whether she wants to get an abortion or not. From what I've seen of Jitobear, my thoughts are close to hers. I am NOT pro-abortion, in fact I do not like how it is used in many cases, but banning it is NOT the answer. We need to look at the underlying causes of abortion, and thus the underlying causes of unwanted pregnancy, and we need to work to fix THOSE problems if we want abortion rates to fall. I support women's choice whether it is to continue or end her pregnancy.
As far as the foetus, I see it as a recognizable living organism, but NOT as a human, and NOT as a moral equal to living humans. As a pesco-lacto-vegetarian (a vegetarian who eats fish and drinks milk besides the whole vegetarian part as long as the animals used for the milk are treated ethically - I also have no moral problem with the consumption of eggs, but I just happen to not like the taste), I view the foetus on a similar moral level as that of fish (except without the desire to eat them :) ).
