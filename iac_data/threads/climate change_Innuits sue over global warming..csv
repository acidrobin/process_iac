0,Innuits sue over global warming.,climate change,support,"This article:
http://news.independent.co.uk/world/...p?story=593660
describes how the Innuit people up north are saying that the US is largely responsible for the climate change that threatens their culture's existence. They say it violates their human rights.
This reminded me of another group of people, Pacific Islanders, who, although are small in number, were a major voice at the Kyoto Conference. They showed that they are losing coastline, farmland, and livable space around the rims of their islands and that whole atolls are being submerged and are no longer habitable because of rising ocean levels. They claim that the rise in ocean levels is caused by global warming and that is caused by human CO2 emissions.
In fact, Tuvalu is also looking to sue the United States and other industrialized nations on the grounds that their pollution is contributing to the situation.

So, do these folks have a case?",0,1,topic_stance_votes_1
1,Innuits sue over global warming.,climate change,support,"I'm not familiar with the Innuit issue, but Smithsonian recently published a comprehensive article on the South Pacific situation. I don't have any scientific opinions one way or the other, but considering that our energy-aligned administration removed most emission legislation compliance requirements from our energy industry to enhance their profitability doesn't exactly qualify us for international neighbor of the year.",1,2,topic_stance_votes_1
2,Innuits sue over global warming.,climate change,support,"I agree. 
And this talk about a 'hydrogen economy' is a smoke screen.
Hydrogen will never replace fossil fuels as an energy source because hydrogen is not an energy source.
I don't know how much of this is true, but I have heard that the Clinton admin was pushing for stronger emissions regulations on cars, but these restrictions were scaled down without anyone noticing because they were convinced that 10 years from now there will be hydrogen cars buzzing all over. 
Unless hydrogen can be manufactured without fossil fuels in any significant quantity and cheaply, the 'hydrogen ecenomy' will never happen.
Just about any energy source can be used to make hydrogen, but then why wouldn't you just use that energy source? You can make hydrogen without using fossil fuels by electrolysing water. You can get the electricity from many sources, but then why bother with the hydrogen? Why not just plug a battery up to the power source and run your car on that? The only advantage hydrogen would have is charge time. It takes a lot less time to fill a tank with gas than it takes to charge most batteries. But would that time saving be worth all the energy you need to expend to split water and then to compress the hydrogen (it takes a lot of energy to do this)?
Anyway, went of on a tangent there.",2,3,topic_stance_votes_1
