""Marine species are under threat from rising levels of acidity in the oceans, says the UK's Royal Society. 
Unless carbon dioxide emissions are cut, there could be irreversible damage to ecosystems, it warns. 
It is further evidence of the need to take action at next week's G8 summit, says working group chair, John Raven. 
""Failure to do so may mean that there is no place in the oceans of the future for many of the species and ecosystems that we know today,"" he said.""

Clearly this John Raven just wants a bigger budget and so he's made up yet more stuff about the problems of CO2 pollution emoticonXRolleyes",0,1,topic_stance_votes_2

3,More ' intentionally deceitful fear mongering',climate change,attack,"You'll have to ask gnojek that. It appears he thinks that any pronouncement by a scientist suggesting CO2 production is a problem is a conspiracy theory by scientists to get bigger budgets:
""As scientists we will tell you that there is a major problem that can only be solved through science , which can only be done with money. We're scientists and we really like grant money to do research. Wouldn't it be great if we had a global initiative to fund this research indefinitely, or until the global warming problem is solved...""
It's the YEC movement all over again: there's no proof, the evidence could be interpreted either way, it's a scientific conspiracy theory, the Devil is behind it: it's un-Christian to cut back on fossil fuel burning etc emoticonXClown",2,4,topic_stance_votes_2

Global warming is old news too: it doesn't seem to have reached the more remote parts of the world though, like North America for example.",3,5,topic_stance_votes_2
