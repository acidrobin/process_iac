1,Gun free Zones,gun control,attack,"Simply naming an area a gun free zone does not make it a gun free zone. If it is truely to be a gun free zone, the law must be enforced.

3,Gun free Zones,gun control,attack,It appears the safety Nazis feel gun free zones should be ran like prisons. Maybe the safety Nazis should take a field trip to their states prison system and ask the guards if guns or any other weapons ever make it into the prisons.

9,Gun free Zones,gun control,support,I think that JustAnotherGuy realizes that gun free zones work on a small level when there is a sufficient amount of effort put into upholding these laws. I'm sure you also know that the laws necessary to create these gun free zones will intrude on your right to privacy and lessen the amount of freedoms you have. So the long and short of the matter is that gun free zones can work on a small level and should be used in specific cases but to try and get them to work on larger levels would be very difficult.,9,10,topic_stance_votes_1

35,Gun free Zones,gun control,attack,"Yes, it is illegal. For the most part, the ""gun free zones"" is a propoganda campaign so EVERYBODY knows that you can't carry guns in schools and airports. Otherwise you end up with people going ""well, I didn't know I couldn't take my .44 to school.....""
Currently, there are 36 states that allow concealed carry, and there is popular concealed carry legislation pending in 6 others. For all the anti gunners propoganda and doctored numbers, crime has decreased in ever state that has allowed concealed carry without exception.
The reasons we have so many armed criminals in America is a subect for much debate. We could put up an entire forum JUST dedicated to this. It is sometimes difficult for people from other countries to understand why Americans are overwhelmingly pro-gun. There actaully is a reason that many of us feelw e need to be armed to the teeth. As Tastyfish pointed out, british gangs are lightweights compared to the guys we have running around.

While I will admit that this is kind of an odd paradox (like the guy who is getting ready to shoot up a school is going to stop because he doesn't want to commit a class 3 non person felony by taking a gun into a gun free zone), at least the intent of these laws was not specifically to chisel away at our rigts. I can honestly sy I think te folks that instituted this honestly believed they were protecting kids.

Mississippi has a gun slinger law that allows any non-felon to carry a gun. That doesn't mean they can carry one into the courthouse. In the old West, almost everyone ""slung iron"", but there were places that they had to check their guns at the door.
In some places, you can carry a concealed weapon, in others, you cannot.
In Kennesaw, Georgia, the law says every home must have a gun inside. (The crime rate is well below average there.)
Establishment of gun-free-zones is not in conflict with our right to bear arms. There are places where the presence of guns is detrimental to the safety of people due to the emotional instability of other people who may have a gun within reach.
Legally owned guns should be ""checked at the door"" or left at home when a person enters a designated gun-free-zone. Law abiding people will have no problem with this. It is the criminals who will object.

In essance it is a place where it is illegal to carry guns, right?
By using your logic, violence free zones (places where violence is illegal) would be pointless as it:
1: would not prevent individuals from comitting violence. Not even in prison-like conditions can you prevent 100% of the violence (as evidently, people are violent in prisons as well)
2: Violent free zones are zones where law abiding citizens ar forbidden to use violence because law abiding citizens obey the law about violent free zones. Violent free zones are zones where criminals will use violence because criminals will not obey the laws about violent free zones.

Making a gun free zone does nothing to prevent guns from entering it. Enforcing a gun free zone by means of security does. 
I agree with armed law enforcement in schools to provide protection. Teachers...that is a little different...I think there would need to be a mass concensus of teachers willing to carry, and then extensive training would be required.

WASHINGTON, D.C. (Oct. 29, '98) -- The nation was horrified when 16-year-old Luke Woodham walked into his Pearl, Mississippi, High School with a .30-30 hunting rifle, shot to death his ex- girlfriend and her close friend, then shot and wounded seven other students. 
Then the nation learned Woodham had stabbed his mother to death earlier that morning. 
Then the nation learned that the local prosecutor had charged six more students with having conspired in the killings as part of a Satanic plot. 
What most of the nation never learned was that Assistant Principal Joel Myrick, using his own gun, stopped the killer as he tried to flee the school. 
The news media virtually ignored the fact that an armed citizen had possibly prevented more bloodshed -- using a gun possessed in violation of the Federal Gun-Free School Act, which prohibits firearms within 1,000 feet of a school. 
To find out what happened I talked to the school's principal, Roy Balantine. 
Mr. Balantine said when he heard the shots he ran into the hall and ""saw a kid with a gun,"" then immediately called 911. Mr. Myrick, he said, was in his office on the opposite side of a ""commons"" that the school surrounds. 
Myrick also had run into the hall and seen a student with a rifle; he shoved several students into his office and locked the door, then ran toward the shooting. 
He saw Woodham shoot and wound one of the students -- and Woodham saw him, so Myrick jumped back out of the line of sight. 
That's when, Mr. Woodham told me, ""Mr. Myrick remembered that he had been out to visit his parents over the weekend, and that he remembered that he had forgotten to take his gun out of his pickup. 
""So Mr. Myrick ran across the commons and out the back door and got the gun, and loaded it, then came around the side of the building."" 
At that point, Mr. Balantine said, he saw the student pull out of the school parking lot and pull up behind a car that was stopped at a stop sign. As Myrick ran toward the car, Woodham pulled around the stopped car, but spun out and off the road. 
Before he could get the car going again, Myrick was there with the .45 pointed in Woodham's face, demanding ""Why did you do that?"" 
That's when Woodham ""instantly became a coward,"" Myrick had told one local reporter. 
Woodham must have feared that Myrick would shoot him for he stammered, so Mr. Balantine told me, ""Oh, Mr. Myrick; I'm the one who gave you the discount on the pizza last week."" 
Myrick got Woodham out of the car, made him lie on the ground, pulled his coat over his head and kept one foot on his back until police arrived. 
Woodham's rifle was in the car, and he still had 30 rounds. 
""With all that ammunition, we don't know what he might have done,"" Mr. Balantine told me. ""We don't know if he would've gone to the junior high or the pizza parlor where he worked, or what. There's reason to believe he might not've been through killing."" 
""I'm just thankful that Mr. Myrick had the presence of mind to remember his gun and bring it all to a stop."" 
Amen, Mr. Balantine. Police and local reporters are convinced that Woodham was a member of a satanic cult that had been ritually sacrificing animals and planning killings before fleeing to Mexico. 
But predictably, there's a bit of a flap in Mississippi about the ""terrible fact"" that this vice principal had a gun at 
school, and that he was violating the gun-free school law (which the Supreme Court struck down but Congress reinstated last year). 
Under Mississippi law he could legally have a gun in his car. 
I'm thankful he had it, and asked Mr. Balantine to thank him for me and those of us who admire his courage -- and for setting a clear example of a gun being used to save lives. 
Further, I told him, if the U.S. Attorney or anyone else wants to give Mr. Myrick any legal troubles, to give me a call and I'd be delighted to start a defense fund.",57,59,topic_stance_votes_2

I gather, and please inform me if I'm wrong, an 'average thug' is what normally we would call a bully or a bully and his band of co-bullies. These kinds of people are about extortion, intimidation, and coercion. 
The rash of school shootings in the nineties were about fear, hate, being bullied, rejection, feelings of inadequacies, ect. The handful, and statistically the stats are almost insignificent, of instances of school shootings were the result of a system that encourages peer pressure, ridicule of students, and an attempt at payback of the offending person or persons. Remember the incident when the assistant school principal ran to his car, parked away from the school zone, retrieved his pistol, went back and held the perp at bay until the cops could arrive? Another incident is the case at Columbine. The security guard, to the best of my knowlege was armed, but ran when the murderers started shooting.

School shootings like in Littleton couldn´t have been prevented in a gun-free school. Those kids were out to kill as much people as possible. But they hadn´t been able to enter the school cafeteria and classrooms because their guns would have been detected at the entrance.
So a shooting would certainly had started but maybe it would have cost less lives.

I don;t think crime in our schools is nearly as big a problem as a lot of people make it out to be. Yes, there is some drug dealing that goes on there. Big deal. Stataistically, most of the school shootings fall into the lyttleton category, somebody decides to kill a bunch of people. A school is a pretty good choice if you want ot kill a bunch of people, because there is not likely to be much resistance.

Why? How? The armed guard turned tail and ran, leaving the school, kids, and teachers, to the perps mercy.

That's okay. We all are woefully lacking, at times, to express ourselves correctly. No Problem. BTW, we agree.
99.99 % of the time, they would be teaching. It would probably never be necessary to ever do otherwise, but this asks a question. If your child was in a school such as Columbine when the **** hit the fan, would you have been glad there was a teacher or teachers present, armed, but not to the knowlege of the perps, that were willing to place themselves in danger to protect your kid/s? To me, it's a no brainer, but hey, that's just me.
The chances are your fears are groundless. Kids use to be able to take firearms to school and never killed anyone by doing stupid things. They can't even take a pocketknife to school any longer. Someone will bitch and raise hell about it.
Is this truly a fear, or are you attempting to transfer what you may do, in like circumstances, to others. I have two grandsons I would trust implicitly to take firearms to school. They both have been taught and know what a firearm is capable of. I worry much more about them driving.

Thx for bothering about still replying.
It´s not about feeling better. It´s also not meant as an excuse but rather as an explanation for my (maybe stubborn) attitude I show sometimes. I´ll try to change that but as what we are discussing here is also a big cultural thing, we probably won´t get much common agreements.
What shouldn´t be an obstacle to further discussions.
Thanks.
I was exaggerating. But to stick to this one could argue that trashmen also don´t get taught about proper shooting.
It is the cultural difference again, I think. Imo the police should be the ones that use force, teachers not.
Difference is again that I believe that a school should be weapon-free per se. But I admit that I cannot really back this up with a safety argument. Not after some of you serious posters told me that violence doesn´t seem to be such an issue in the US (although I still think that situations at big high schools in big cities like LA or Chicago might be different). 
I think when you teach them about proper gun care, you are looking after their driving skills as well. ;)
I also think that they are the positive example. How many kids really get a decent lesson or more about gun use?
But it is the difference in cultures again.
I think I can sum it up: We got a situation that isn´t too much of a problem (school violence). To prevent any from happening, you say that everything is fine the way it is, you just don´t have a real proof due to the lack of violence(now THAT sounds weird). Same goes for me, but due to my background I think that we should also take this situation as a chance to change people´s mentality. And were better to start than in school?

No, I don't have problems with cultural differences. I guess what truly amazes me, though, is the over reaction by do gooders in general to situations that are reallt extreme anomalies, and have this mistaken idea they can save the world by outlawing this, that, or the other. It somewhat amazes me as well, that when the Brits take a dump, the Canadians and Aussies think they must too. It seems more aki to the world empire syndrome, the Brits use to have.
Pardon my questioning this statement, but I see little comparison between trashmen, who are charged with keeping the trash cans safe, and teachers, charged with keeping their students safe.
Uh huh. Brings to mind the old saying, 'where are the cops when you need them the most?'
There is a certain amount of violence in all schools, to a degree, and I admit that, but it doesn't take the form of a vendetta killing, so much, as at Columbine. But, in my opinion, this is the very reason some teachers should be armed. The anomalies will arise and transpire and the cops damned sure can't be everywhere at once.
Maybe in the abstract, but not in dealing with reality. A pistol or rifle round deals with so much energy measured usually by velocity and foot pounds of energy. A kid, especially a kid that hunts or possibly target shoots, or even just 'plinks' at tin cans, can see a certain amount of damage that a bullet can do. Very few will ever equate that with a much more deadly force of a 3000 pound projectile traveling at a high rate of speed and generating a hell of a lot more energy.
Then possibly it's time to start doing this in the very schools we are talking about with training beginning at a very young age and graduating into actual firearm competitions by middle school and high school.
There is violence, but really not the type that generates national media coverage as the anomalies of school shootings do. The Pols then don't think they have to APPEAR to be doing something positive, trying to generate votes or publicity for bigger and better political positions.

Cultural difference, I raised up with the above seperation of work.
True.
See above about my thoughts on armed teachers.
And I really don´t know if teachers who had to shoot in school can attend their job again equally well (although this probably goes for attacked teachers as well).
As we got rising numbers of youths being killed in car accidents I understand your concern.
But kids see pictures of accidents every day and so should be able to realize about the risk. News about killed kids in traffic proof me wrong in this but don´t news about gun incidents do so as well?
If guns are allowed at schools it should be the schools duty to teach the kids about the do´s and dont´s with guns.
I don´t think that they needed to do shooting practice but teaching gun safety shouldn´t take too much time.
But as I am generally opposed to guns, you´ll understand that it is hard for me to stand in for such a school subject (because it would be a redundant subject in my society). ;)

You would think so, but my experience says it's not so. traffic accidents are usually treated by the media in a locale, but unless a massive one, very seldom mentioned on national TV, whereas a school shooting like Columbine is news for days or weeks. The fallout from Columbine is still making waves.
Absolutely. That nasty old NRA has a program they usually will present to the lowest grades free of charge, but the GGs are so afraid of proslytizing, on the part of the NRA, they, in many instances, kill the program before it gets started.

But does everday gun crime make good headlines? I think that most of the crime issues are covered by the Media with equal attention as traffic accidents; means: the more dead, the higher the quote, thus more cameras and reporters (dirty vampires...).
The Columbine fallout isn´t much of a surprise too me because it was just too much of it. A few dead get forgotten quite fast but a massacre like this, and such a Media hype as it happened, will be remembered for many years if not decades. And if not abused in either way this doesn´t have to be bad.
Maybe they should simply create a new office or install a new part in an existing one to calm people down.

I shot a lot during my military service (where the real fun with guns begins) and it really is fun and it certainly gives you an immense feeling of power (the last can be good and bad).

Schools had an official partner throughout the country and old prejudices between the NRA and anti-gunners would be needless.
