0,Federal Drug Priorities,marijuana legalization,support,"Our local sheriff relayed some of the wisdom he and others received after a regional meeting with whatever the DEA is now calling themselves. While he and others tried to explain that meth usage had become epidemic and the resulting crime and civil disturbances are consuming the majority of their field resources, they were told that federal wisdom doesn't see it that way. 
Heroin is still seen as the major drug threat to America's moral structure. Even though several participants pointed out that the addiction rate per-capita and resulting crime was infinitesimal when compared to cocaine or meth, smack is still #1. 
Ready for this? Marijuana is #2 on the federal drug threat list. Our county and most others in rural areas receive more federal law enforcement grant funds to fight pot than any other drug or public safety issue. They're encouraged to go after growers 'with all available resources due to the major threat marijuana usage presents to our society'. 
I thought our foreign policy was straight out of the dark ages, but this one really makes me wonder who or what is steering the ship.",0,1,topic_stance_votes_1

2,Federal Drug Priorities,marijuana legalization,support,"The county directly west of mine is one of the biggest producers of meth in the country (something to be proud of). the Sheriff there told me one time ""We can't get a grant to help take down the meth labs. When we applied for money to buy a $300,000.00 helicopter with thermal imaging equipment to find pot growers, we had the check in 2 weeks.""
It does make you wonder what kind of retarded monkey is running things.",2,3,topic_stance_votes_1

4,Federal Drug Priorities,marijuana legalization,support,"That could certainly explain a lot of our erratic, short-term political goals. 
I've always felt that cocaine, with its mind-boggling profit factors and volume, was never declared #1 during the crack era because the money was so big payoffs had infiltrated law enforcement and legislative areas in such high positions of power that it was downplayed as a problem of Columbia and Peru. So we send troops to Columbia for fulfilling political agendas, pack our prisons with addicts and low level dealers and chase pot growers while cocaine management, other than a couple of high-profile cartels who threatened our puppet in Columbia, remained virtually untouched.",4,5,topic_stance_votes_1
5,Federal Drug Priorities,marijuana legalization,support,Well speed is homegrown and the profits stay within the US. Then there is the productivity benifits of having a jacked up population that never sleeps and can do manual tedious labor for days on end,5,6,topic_stance_votes_1
6,Federal Drug Priorities,marijuana legalization,support,"Here they often spend that tedious time sorting through property belonging to other people, generally with attitudes that present violence as a greeting. I'm sure that if the government ever recognizes speed as a problem they'll eventually lay the blame on Mexico, Canada or another out-of-favor government. The US has always disliked accepting responsibility for our own actions, especially drug consumption.",6,7,topic_stance_votes_1
