0,Death Nail,evolution,support,"It has been shown that animals change biologically without the need for RM + NS. You evolutionists obviously do not disagree with this. My contention is if plasticity can change the size, color, shape of animals (ie finches, peppered moths, tadpoles, etc) then this could give the ILLUSION of evolution in the fossil record. Do you evolutionists understand this concept? Do you understand how if a peppered moth has morphological abilities then it might give the ILLUSION that ""selection"" made these creatures ""evolve""? Same with the beaks of Darwin's/Grant's finches. I wrote a huge post on how animals emerge pre-adapted, and continue to adapt throughout their lifetimes. Do you not see how this could give the ILLUSION of evolution? -- you've already attributed both the peppered moths and finches as examples of evolution -- yet each case is most certainly an example of either plasticity or the ""throwing of switches"" during development.
And see here's where the evolutionary magic fairy dust comes in; all you guys have to do is NOT TEST ANYHING!!! Don't test to see if animals emerge with correct traits. Don't test to see how future generations may emerge with new colors, shapes and sizes to match their new environment. That way it's easy to say -- ""Oh well, that's not evolution because furture generations will not change"" or ""Oh animals cannot pass on acquired traits."" Both of these are intellectually dishonest statements....the first one is simply untested and ignored, the second is a strawman.
Indeed, evolutionary scientists simply do not test future offspring upon environmental changes -- that way they can continue the dishonest myth that their way is the only way..........but it's not the only way.
Yet then many evolutionists will say ""oh well....plasticity has evolved over millions of years""
Well heck, has Lamarckism evolved too? This logic is humorous because with one stroke of the pen (keyboard) you have unfalsified your theory. In otherwords you have the following explanation of evolution......yet if that doesn't work out for you, you can always wave your hand and attribute it to ""evolution"":
Evolution is a strange mechanism.
When we say ""animals adapt to their environment"" what we really mean is:
an animal produces offspring or ""replicates""
the replicates are close to the original, but not exact copies
some of these copies survive and replicate again, others die before they can replicate which copies replicate and which die before they can do so is influenced by the environment inexact copies whose differences make them less well adapted to the environment have a higher probability of dying, those better adapted get a higher chance of surviving to replication age.
Individual animals do not adapt to their environment
http://robert.cailliau.free.fr/ByLet...Evolution.html
By the way -- I still have not gotten a decent explanation of how plasticity happens if there is no intelligence in the genome to decipher external conditions. Morphological change begins with a conscious awareness of external conditions...which translates to a physical change. This falsifies your theory in my eyes. ---- You cannot tell me that a morphological change in response to a predator happens simply because of a ""chemical reaction."" Every creature has brain -- and they all use it differently.
---------------------
http://www.fiu.edu/~donnelly/termpaperex1.pdf#search='plasticity%20body%20struc ture'
1) in the presence of a predator, eggs can hatch at later times:
..... Flatworms (Phagocotus gracilis) were used as
predators or predator chemical cues upon salamander larvae (Ambystoma texanum and Ambystoma barbouri). The presence of the flatworms and their cues induced the eggs to delay their hatching time. This resulted in larger, and more advanced hatchlings. This finding supports the earlier field observations that the flatworm preyed heavily on smaller, less developed hatchlings. This shift in hatch time is adaptive and supports greater hatchling survival (Sih and Moore 1993).
Any evolutionists care to explain this phenomenon? How can this near-miracle happen without intelligence? 
2) specific morphological changes happens due to predators: 
In 1997 McCollum and Leimberger examined the morphological changes that
arose in the gray treefrog (Hyla chrysoscelis) in response to the presence of a predatory dragonfly (Aesha umbrosa). The larvae that were reared in the presence of the predator differed in shape and in color than those that were reared in predator free environments. The treatments exposed tadpoles to tail damage and to chemical cues of the dragonfly feeding on conspecifics. The tadpoles responded plastically by altering their color and tail shape. The tail was extended, presumably increasing swimming speed and hence survivorship. The color change was seen in the tail. The appearance of color on the tail is thought to attract predatory attacks on the tail rather than on the body.
3) specific behavior changes as a result of predators
Larval anurans have demonstrated phenotypic plasticity in response to variation in food availability (Anholt 1998). It has been argued that food availability and predation risk are intertwined. This can be demonstrated when food resources in an environment are high, search time by prey is reduced and predation success may suffer. During times of limited
food availability search time may be lengthened, thus increasing prey vulnerability to predation (Anholt and Werner 1998). In the presence of predators, search time is reduced as activity is restricted to avoid predation. 
4) Diet induces developmental changes in physical characteristics.
Depending on their diet, individuals (tadpoles) of both species develop into either a small-headed omnivore morph, which feeds mostly on detritus, or a large-headed carnivore morph, which specializes on shrimp. 
http://www.citeulike.org/user/balicea/article/454684
--------------------------------------------------------------
Thus if plasticity can instantly effect the hatch time of eggs, the size, shape, color, and physical/behavior characteristics of an animal, then about the only place I see a role for random mutations via natural selection is in the wishfully creative minds of evolutionists.
And this study is just on tadpoles. Does anyone think that this is not a world-wide, creation-wide phenomenon? Of course it is. Every creature is a product of their environment. Traits are formed from the beginning of conception -- all the way throughout life. Over time, this may give the illusion of ""evolution"" in the fossil record. 
This would explain why there are virtually no intermediate fossils. This would also explain why gradualism is not found in the fossil record. This would also explain why evolutionists cannot give us any example of random mutations that could lead to cumulative selection -- because they don't exist. S",0,1,topic_stance_votes_2
1,Death Nail,evolution,attack,"Not by any means. Evolution works on genetic change that future generations will inherit. Adaptation does no such thing. It changes an individual, but not its genes.
For example, if my parents volunteered to be part of a scientific experiment where they two additional arms fused onto their body before I was ever conceived, I would not be born with two extra arms.
On the other hand, if a genetic mutation made it advantageous to have two additional arms, and both my parents had that mutation, I would be born with both arms.
So the first one is untested, you say? Okay, it’s your loss for suggesting people can inherit non-genetic change like the fusing of extra arms on their parents’ body.
The only traits animals can pass are genetically-acquired. That is a fact. It’s tested by mere observation of the world around us. You could test it too, for all I care. Buy an aquarium and put a pet lizard in it. Chop off the lizard’s right arm. Then give him a wife and chop off her right arm, too. Once they’ve had eggs and the eggs hatch, count the number of arms the baby lizards all have. Logic and observed scientific fact tells us that they will have four limbs—right arm included.
Excellent quote mine. The salamanders were larger because—gasp!—they stayed in the egg longer! Did the larger salamander offspring inherit the size change? NO.
Rofl… What were they supposed to do if they stayed in the egg longer with more time to feed off of it? Shrink?
Did the tadpoles pass on their altered color and tail shape? NO. Evolution worked to make it so that the tadpoles could adapt their tail color and shape whenever the need arose. Without the genes to adapt like that, they wouldn’t be able to adapt.
… That’s pure animal behavior. That’s no more logical than saying since I saw a car on the street and moved out of the way that evolution is wrong.
No inherited change, as usual. The ability to change is the only thing inherited here, as usual.
Evolution explains the examples’ abilities to adapt. Without it, you’re in the hole.
Fossils show inherited change. Adaptation does not.
In that case, your idea is already falsified, because there are too many intermediate fossils to count.

6,Death Nail,evolution,attack,"Codswallop. Nothing of the sort has been shown. It has been asserted without evidence.
Sadly for you, the example of the peppered moth, Biston betularia, is an example of a single point mutation on a single gene that has caused the change. In other words, f. carbonaria is the result of a dominant allele, while f. typica is the corresponding recessive. Additionally, there are three other point mutations to the same gene that are known that produce an intermediate form (f. insularia or f. medionigra). These alleles show incomplete dominance.
Similar mutations to the same gene in other species of moth have been observed to cause similar changes in those species. The gene has, or course, been identified and sequenced, and breeding research has shown that it always holds true: a f. carbonaria always produces f. carbonaria offspring, while f. typica does so only if both mates are f.typica.
Since the color changes to the population of moths (first white to black, and then black back to white) have been demonstrated to have been caused by a change in the allele frequency in a population over time, this is an example of evolution. It isn't a ""preadaption"" that is induced by environment, or plasticity or the ""throwing of switches"". It is genetic. Research has shown it to be genetic, and no amount of raving babble will change that.

8,Death Nail,evolution,attack,"Many evolutionists admit that animals only change when the environment changes -- yet this is precisely when plasticity kicks in. However, you evolutionists still claim that it takes thousands/millions of years for animals to ""adapt"" to their environment....What kind of nonsense thinking is this since you obviously are so in love with plasticity?? -- which can quickly alter shape, color, size, structure, and behaviors of animals? And why is it that animals who don't often change their environments are the very same animals who havent ""evolved"" in millions of years...ie...crocodiles, sharks, bats, etc?
And don't get confused: heredity -- or lack of it -- has nothing to do with this. We are talking only about FOSSILS that are dug up out of the ground and physical, biolgical change. 
So my question is this: if animals only evolve when they experience a change in their environment, and if a change in environment activates an adaptive response (plasticity) in all animals of a population, then what kind of logic makes you believe that it takes thousands/millions of years for populations of animals to ""adapt?"" If every creature in the population changes its phenotype at the same time in response to an evironmental cue (diet, temperature, predators, etc), this could give the illusion of evolution -- or change -- in the fossil record.

9,Death Nail,evolution,attack,"No. You won’t find a single biologist anywhere who says something so ridiculous.
No. Adaptation occurs over a single lifetime.

13,Death Nail,evolution,support,"I'm sorry I missed that one. Would you mind explaining how biological systems can manufacture new proteins and organic molecules without changes in thier DNA/RNA. I missed the class where they talked about spontaneous individual adaptation. 
I mean, isn't it great to know that animals instantly adapt! That's why there are never any albino specimens, you never get lambs born with 5 legs, you never get conjoined (sp?) twins, or any other form of genetic screw-up... Hold on a sec though....
Plasticity allows animals to strech within the limits of their genome. That's why it's called plasticity. It implies streching around a central hard-coded point. If animals could instantly adapt to their surroundings (whatever they were) I imagine we'd be talking about fluidity. I also imagine we'd look like orgainic forms of the T-1000 (in our natural state).
As a palaeontologist, I suggest you look at the fossil record for yourself, and then decide how complete it is, and whether you can see gradual evolution within it. You may or may not be aware that evolutionary lineages can be traced through the fossil record, not as a straight line, but more as a branching tree (analogy of Gould), and some of these seem to show slow modification over millenia. The horse is a good example of this, and whales also (though that's recently come under scruitany (sp?)).
As for PE v. Gradualism, well it seems to me that punctuated gradualism is a reasonable suggestion, where animals evolve slowly most of the time, but react rapidly at instances of environmnetal stress. Indeed Gould and Eldrege seem to have suggested that (at least that's how I've always discussed it, and no one has shot me yet). PE does not suggest no evolution occurs during the equilibrium period, it just suggests spikes at times of crisis.
Name them....
Who said that? I seem to recall stating that evolutionary change can occur in a few generations.
Find out something before you post it. I suggest you look at the evolutionary lineage of the crocodile and the aligator (sp?). There's been more in their history than you know. 
Sharks have changed as their environment has changed. You're probably thinking that I'm nuts, and no shark has ever left the ocean. Well that's rubbish for bull sharks swim up the Amazon today, but it's more the fact that the ocean is not a constant environment. Temperature, salinities, oxygen concentrations and overall size of the water body have all changed in the history of the planet. If sharks were all supremely adapted to their environment and as perfect as they could be, there wouldn't be more than one species of shark. Ever heard of Charcarodon (Charcarinus?) megalodon? A 60 foot shark alive until the start of the last ice age. It ate whales, yet it has gone exinct and whales haven't. If animals could adapt instantly, the cold temperatures would not have bothered it, and Jaws would be a documentary rather than a horror. The animal would have survived as long as its food source, yet it hasn't. 
Bats are an area I don't know that much about. I know that there are many different types of bat, and that they all hunt in different ways (all of which they are ancestorally(sp?) adapted for). I have a link, pm me if you want it (I don't want to let a troll loose on a friend of mine).
Animals are constantly evolving, but some gene alterations mean little in the long run and most of the others are not changes on the visual level. How can we tell by sight if one shark has a 1/1000th improvement in its electrical detection apperatus? If it grew another fin we'd notice, but not minor changes in internal systems, unless we examined the animal closely, and we can hardly cut up every shark in the see to get the range of genetic diversity within a species....
Also you are playing on a major difference between biology and palaeontology. Palaeontologists can only erect morpho-species (that is to say species groups based on morphological data, size and shape of bones, specific constructions of bones, and other osteological features) and though we try our best, it's not possible to get the same level of detail as is possible with modern biological sampling. You can hardly stick a needle in a bit of rock and extract DNA. Therefore palaeospecies are (mostly) well grounded on morphological data, but we have to be careful constructing evolutionary lineages due to the difference between a modern genetic species and a fossil morpho-species (except where there is clear stratigraphic succession such as with the horse and the whale). Saying the fossil record does not support gradualism is like looking through an arrow slit from the outside and claiming to have seen the whole castle. In Lagerstatten (sites of exceptional or abundant preservation) some gradualistic changes can be observed particularly in insects (See Solnhofen).
Your claims seem to boil down to the idea that animals can instantly change when stressed. You seem to claim that multiple individuals, indeed whole species can do this. Experiment time. Take a population of mice, and put them in an area where the walls are closing in. See if they suddenly become super strong, or if they modify thier brain size to create some sort of brake out of natural materials. This seems a logical extention of your theory. Remember death of any mice means that your theory has failed. Repeat it with birthing mice and see if the new-borns suddenly adapt to the situation. I'd lay a reasonable amount of money that you'd end up with mouse pate. (Please don't really do this, mice deserve better than to be sacrificed to unscientific stupidity)",12,14,topic_stance_votes_1

20,Death Nail,evolution,attack,"Strawman...ridiculous.
true...and that's all there is to ""evolution"" and you cannot prove otherwise. The point is that if an animal is able to morph the color, shape, size of his body, it could be misinterpreted in the fossil record by religiously-blinded atheists.
Then if animals' fossils are more along the lines of a ""bush"" then how do you get gradualism out of that? Eldredge seems to indicate that stasis is a phenomenon caused by a lack of environmental changes. Thus animals change only when the environment changes. He gave Ice ages as an example. But sometimes (usually, actually) environments change quickly (ie..migration to new and different climates, new predators, diets etc.) Thus, if plasticity can have the same effect as adaptation, why do animals need to wait thousands of years for that silly process to unfold?
You seem to be admitting that the environment spurs rapid ""evolution"" -- as I just indicated.
how? What mechanism? Have a neodarwin website to back that up? I thought you said you believed in gradualism....? You can't have it both ways.
Maybe so....I've heard differently.....Link?
give me an example of an air-tight fossil sequence that points to gradual changes over time. (don't bother with the horse...Eldredge has already shot that down....do you have his book, The Myths of Evolution?...maybe we can go through it together.)
I don't claim that animals have super powers. All I claim is that they have morphological abilities -- obviously these are restricted by certain degrees. I suggest many animals can grow, shrink, change colors, change physiological features such as jaws, teeth, limb length, etc. in order to stay alive and adjust to external conditions. I don't believe this is disputed anywhere. And if this is indeed true, then it could give the illusion of ""evolution"" in the fossil record. The fact is you don't have many air-tight intermediate fossils -- when there should be billions of them -- so to claim gradualism is quite silly at this point.
by the way...hang around and debate me for a while -- It's difficult finding people on the web who are knowledgeable like yourself.
Another thing is this....I know very little about the fossil record. My main contention is with the mechanism of random mutations and natural selection -- of which even atheist evolutionists are trying to do something about because it is so lacking in the ability to bring about quick variations -- which obviously happen. But I'll be glad to talk about it all with you. I'm always up for learning new things. S

22,Death Nail,evolution,attack,"Strawman? A strawman is a false argument, or representation of a postion erected to be demolished to make one's argumenty appear stronger. (Correct me if I'm wrong). All I did there is point out a serious flaw in your idea. You claim that phenotypic plasticity (the amount of morphological difference between two members of the same species) allows spontaneous major redesign in times of crisis. You have to now explain how that is possible. Changes in the body are regulated by enzymes and protiens which are coded for by DNA/RNA. You have to explain how these changes can occur without changes in the DNA/RNA as you seem to be implying.
I can prove evolution. Pandion is the one with the references, however the fruit fly speciation experiment, the domestication of dogs from wolves and so on. Any modern DNA sampling can show changes in allelle frequencies in populations over time. That is evolution in definition. 
As to your point about animals spontaneously morphing, prove it. Show me a case where an animal spontaeously changed from one size and shape to another. I mean scientifically observed (and none of this conspiracy bull**** please, it gets tired quickly), where one individual modified its teeth, jaws, body size (apart from fat deposits) or overall colour (apart from animals like chameleons (sp) which are exapted for colour changing).
A tree is a series of branches. Look along a brach and you'll see a gradual transition from trunk to twig, with branching coming off it.
Well either Eldredge was wrong, or the text you are reading from is. As I said, evolution occurs all the time, however mass-speciation (the point at which many new species appear) may be driven by environmental change (actually probably driven by mass-extinctions freeing up ecological niches, which are themselves caused by some environmental reason)
Here comes rapid evolution, and adapting to a rapidly changing environment is in itself a mechanism of natural selection.
You have a hang up on thousands of years! You seem to think that evolutionary change must take millenia to act. Evolutionary change has been observed in a few days (maybe even hours). Pandion has the reference on the IC bacteria with the evolution of the digestion mechanism. There is no need for animals to 'wait' for evolution to occur. Evolution works on generations and populations not within individuals. See the Giraffe/Acacia Arms Race (Red Queen Hypothesis).
I seem to admitting that because I am! The environment drives the mechanism of natural selection and therefore of course has a big impact on evolution. I do not however accept your hypothesis of individual plasticity. Provide some proof, and then I'll consider it.
Sigh. (Pandion please post the references once, or provide a link to where you last posted them. I don't have them and I can't find them... Thanks :) )
As to the gradualism thing, you seem to be making a false dichotomy. Gould and Eldredge did not say that evolution stops during 'stasis', they merely said that speciation events concentrate around points of environmental crisis or stress.
From whom I wonder....
Try looking for Dakosaurus, Mesozoic crocodilliforms and so on. Ever heard of this thing?  Sarcosuchus That link has a simplified evolutionary lineage on it as well.
I don't have it, and Pandion assures me that it doesn't exist. I'll take his word for it, as the rest of his information has been accurate.
Simply I can't give you an air tight sequence. We weren't there to observe it, and therefore we can't guarantee 100% accuracy. I can suggest the evolution of the whale and the evolution of the horse (read Bully for Brontosaurus by Gould to see what I mean). That doesn't mean that the ToE comes crashing down. It just means that scientific rigour forbids us from taking anything for certain without definate proof, and we don't have definate proof, only very strong evidence.
They can change them, but not in individual animals, only over the course of generations.... You've kinda taken a product of evolution and claimed it can all occur without any time at all, which doesn't happen. For example, if we put you or me in the Congo, we wouldn't suddenly turn into hairy ape like creatures able to swing through the trees in the manner of a gibbon, or be able to eat plants like a gorilla. I do know some people who look like chimps, but they are here in Portsmouth, and don't spend there time picking each others hair and eating termites....
Having held a conclusive transitional fossil I dispute the claim there aren't any (Simple GotG argument). That fossil was Archaeopteryx, which is so transitional, people who deny the existance transitionals keep switching it between dinosaurs and birds. There are more transitionals, however pointing them out merely leads to the claim that there are more gaps....
That link you provided actually shot your own argument in the foot. The evolution of that dual colour (also seen in lizards) required a 10 generation turn-over before becoming marked. That was 10 generations of selective breeding. So it wasn't a individual change. The individuals at the end had the ability to perform that change, but that was due to exaptation based on genetic change over the generational turnover. It was an interesting article...
Well for a start stop assuming that all 'evolutionists' are atheists. You never learn anything with pre-concieved opinions, and it just gets annoying. I would suggest that Pandion is the one to talk to about genetic mutation. I'm a palaeontologist not a gene worker.

The motives and intentions of God are far too vast for simple mortals like us to concieve. Should we argue over the apparent randomness of the number pi? It is entirely possible that all evolved species are part of a great plan that merely seems random, but is in fact guided, almost like Smith's guiding hand of capitalism. However, such arguements are designed for theology, and evolution is about science.
Who is to say which of us is taken in by captive and hollow philosophy? You argue that the last 100 years of scientific inquiry into how animals devloped is wrong, and that your version, which cannot be verified or falsified due to its holy nature, is in fact correct. No doubt you can quote me any number of bible verses that can be interpreted to mean that dinosaurs existed in biblical times, or that the world was created in seven 24 hour days, but these words are not absolute and can be interpreted in many different ways. This fact is self evident because there are so many different denominations of Christianity that interpret the scripture differently. By what right do you claim that I am the one taken in by hollow philosophy? My philosophy is backed by the scientific method and constant reexamination. Your philosophy cannot ever be questioned, because you know it in your heart it is truth and others should know this naturally as well. It must feel good to be so sure of yourself.
The main thrust of Colossians 2:8 is that philosophy from man is inferior to philosophy from Christ. Until you can show to me that Christ claimed the world was created in its exact form with all animals made exactly as they needed to be, then your philosophy is no less worldy than mine. From my experiences, Christ was far more interested in protecting the innocent and making sure people did what was right. It's possible the quote escapes me, but I'm pretty sure Jesus didn't rant about creation.
How very magnaminous of you to offer this opportunity to me. Unfortunatly, from where I'm sitting, the burden of proof is yours. In science, a theory must be able to explain natural phenomena and make accurate predictions about the world. As we develop, theories are continuously refined to better fit the data presented to us. This is why Newtonian physics are still taught. They are technically correct, they just have to be further refined in special circumstances, when relativity comes to play. Explain to me why the theory of evolution, which is still the best theory that both explains biological phenomena and makes predictions for future developments, should be overturned?

Now for this little story - fictional, but it helps make the point.
Two women (friends) are part of a group at a bus stop waiting for a bus. As the bus pulls up, the crowd surges forward and one of the women loses her balance, and is hit by the bus. Injured seriously, but not life threatening. As the ambulance is called by cell phone, her friend calls the injured womans husband at work to let him know what's going on. ""Don't come here, the ambulance will be here and gone by the time you would get here - I'll call you as soon as we get to the hospital - not sure which hospital yet."" The anxious husband hangs up the phone and waits - a full 45 minutes goes by before the police show up at his job in person! ""We're sorry sir, but we regret to inform you that your wife has just been killed in a car accident."" (husband) ""But they said her injuries weren't that serious - that the bus wasn't moving all that fast."" (police) ""Sorry sir, the injuries were quite serious - she held on a short time, but didn't make it. There was no bus involved."" 
No bus involved?? What would you expect the husband to think? Why can't these stupid people get their stories straight? 
As it turns out, both stories were exactly right. While waiting for the ambulance at the bus stop, someone in a car offers to take the woman to the hospital before the ambulance gets there. On the way to the hospital, that car wrecks and the woman is killed. Without that information, how could anyone not immediately think that one story had to be wrong?

I didn't put any doctrine in, it's already in there. Many, many Bible verses, and the overall Christian religion, support it.
Salvation and doing what is right can be very complex - it can involve God's plans - events - foreknowledge - control, etc. It would be nice if science would stick with current, hands on scientific things rather than coming to anti creation conclusions that it has no business coming to. 
I agree - most he does not want us to know about. But SOME he does. We have an instruction book.
Then why is science so eager to involve itself with theology? Why does science constantly proclaim non guidance as fact?
You misrepresent my position. I trust that most scientific inquiry is correct. It's wrong when it comes to an anti Biblical conclusion that it doesn't have enough evidence for. 
I agree - God didn't make us all identical robots, and I believe it's part of his plan for different people to worship differently. (I visited a Baptist church recently and it about drove me NUTS emoticonXWow - Luthurans are ice cold compared to that.)

You and atheists on this board seem to get along well. Your sig looks to me like it mocks God.
Each generation, maybe somewhat subconsiously, thinks it knows it all. Some notable person (sometime around the year 1900) proclaimed that ""everything that can be invented has been invented."" Science today thinks it now knows enough to proclaim what's wrong with the Bible. The Piltdown man hoax lasted for about 40 years. Other scientific hoaxes have stayed around for long periods of time. Where's the guarantee that no scientific hoax is having theories built upon it today? There's far more money in science today than ever before.

How about Christ mentioning the flood? Matthew 24:38. Jesus directly referenced the flood. Today's science proclaims that it did not happen. As a theistic evolutionist, please give me a detailed explanation of that.
I've already referenced where he said something about creation. (in an earlier post) How many times would he have to say it before theistic evolutionists would believe it?
Accurate predictions, yes. In 1912, man was smart enough to build the Titanic, and stupid enough to let it sink. In almost 100 years, I don't see man as having improved himself enough to start declaring what's true and what's false about the Bible - what happened long before recorded history.
I never said it should be overturned. It should be kept to it's proper limits. It's references to ""no flood"" and ""non guidance"" should not be established to the same extent as the Thanksgiving day holiday, for example.

Since when did disproving literal creation disprove the bible? The bible is a book of morals and values, not a accurate historical timeline. Besides, if the other Christians sects had managed to gain power instead of the RCC, we'd have a very different view of the bible. There would be no discussion on genesis as there would be no genesis in the bible if Marcion Christians won. 
There was no global flood. There's no evidence whatsover of a flood of such size. While there are cultural stories abound of floods, very few have the same era, the same scope and the same place, much less the same method of how the waters came, for what reasons and what happened afterward. There is evidence of a large flood in the mediterian and the caspian, but that's heresy in literal creationism. How is stating something that is proven overstepping its bounds? Man and monkey share a common ancestor. Life is guided, by mutuations and enviromental pressures. What's your point?

45,Death Nail,evolution,attack,"I was thinking about that post. As far as I can tell, you're main arguement can be summed by this quote
There are two problems that are represented by this quote. First, you mix up science and religion. It has to do with your insistance on me telling you how one can be a 'theistic evolutionist.' The term implies that the two relationships are somehow connected, but in fact they describe a person just as the term theistic capitalist does. The first term describes a person as having religious beliefs, the second term refers to a secular concept that person believes in. Evolution does not counter the important points of religion. The two of us arguing over how to interpret those lines in Genesis shows that the bible can be interpreted in many different ways and not all of them have to be a literal interpretation. The theory of evolution describes how animals were created. It makes no moral judgements at all. That is left to men.
Your second problem lies with how you interpret science.
This statement runs counter to how science works. There has to be evidence to support a flood event, not a lack of evidence denying it. According to science, the bible is not a reliable source of data. You need observable phenomena, eyewitness testimony is not enough.
When I suggested you may wish to overturn science, you replied.
I'm not exactly sure how highly you grade the Thanksgiving holiday, but I'm more intrigued about your statement that science should be kept to its proper limits. This would likely be the same sort of arguement Galileo was given as to why people should ignore the truth staring at them through a telescope. Historically, religion has resisted many attempts to redefine how the world works, and invariably they have had to adapt to science.

There is a political conflict between them. If there wasn't, this forum wouldn't exist, constant court battles about separation of church and state wouldn't exist, talkorigins wouldn't have dozens of pages devoted to the critisism of creation, etc. Surely you agree with that. 
And many are using that secular concept to try to disprove religious beliefs - a secular concept politically conflicts with religious beliefs. Atheism had been around since the beginning of the establishment of the U.S. government, but only recently has become notably politically active. That's because until only recently, it hasn't been associated with any kind of education. It's been a, ""Duh, if I don't see it I don't believe it"" mentality. I believe it was Richard Dawkins who said something like ""evolution enables one to be an intellectually fullfilled atheist."" What atheist doesn't want to be intellectually fullfilled? How many subjects to they have to run to for it? ONE? Science? Religion has always been about education - history, archeology, etc. Each belief system involves knowledge, and they conflict.
That zinger is made by atheism and theistic evolution all the time on these forums, and I've shown it to be so wrong many times. ""Evolution's"" attempts to counter religion is so widespread, I can show it with a different example everytime I see it. Richard Dawkins (a scientist / rabid atheist) wrote a book called ""The Blind Watchmaker"", where he attempts to use science to promote atheism. How about this one from talkorigins;
http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA001.html
Are you going to say that doesn't counter an important point of religion? Is atheism, and theistic evolution in perfect harmony on that statement, like they seem to be on everything else? Is there anything that atheists and theistic evolutionist disagree on, politically?
Do theistic evolutionists get upset if school children are taught the above proclamation? It's secular, so the ACLU doesn't. You see, when church and state are separated, atheism and state are combined. Government cannot be completely neutral when it comes to some political decisions.
There is a difference between the disagreements in interpreting some details that are left out of the Bible such as the age of the earth, and proclaming that something clearly described in the Bible such as the worldwide flood, DID NOT HAPPEN. Suppose science decides to study the Red Sea to see if it was parted like the Bible describes, and determines it was not parted. Suppose science studies to see if Soddom and Gomorrah were actually destroyed as the Bible describes, and determines that they weren't. Would theistic evolution be comfortable with these determinations? Maybe if those cites weren't destroyed, maybe there was no immorality going on there? Maybe ""if it feels good, do it"" isn't such a bad philosophy after all? How does theistic evolution draw such a hard, distinguishing line between Biblical history, and behavior standards? Since they've not bothered to establish a church denomination, it makes me wonder how much they love the Lord their God with all their heart, with all their soul, and with all their might.
Something that happened thousands of years ago cannot be ovserved by science. Science has taken it upon itself to be the superior form of knowledge - to throw out written history, and demand only scientific proof for anything it wants. There has to be legitimate doubt about written history for any entity to demand proof, more than just a desire to prove atheism.
I think science is limited by two things, in it's ravenous appetite to re-write history;
1) Science can't directly observe the past. It's conclusions are no better than the imperfect humans worldviews who reach them. 
2) The main one - those who represent science have no way of knowing that they have all the information that exists. It goes back to my previous point about each generation thinking it knows it all - you didn't address it.
Could it be similar to the argument made by atheists 80 or so years ago, about the truth staring at them in the bones of Piltdown man? Why is TODAY'S generation the one that finally knows it all? 
Historically, atheism has resisted new evidence since Darwin, of just how mathematically improbable naturalistic evolution is, and they refuse to adapt - to consider other testable, repeatable, secular subjects like math, or the new paths of science that the subject of I.D. can bring. 
You don't see any conflict? You don't see science involving itself with it? 
Here's some more scientific wisdom from talkorigins;
As a theistic evolutionist, surely you know that the book of Ecclesiastes has a purpose - to investigate life as a whole and teach that in the final analysis life is meaningless without the proper respect and reverence for God.

59,Death Nail,evolution,attack,"Collin and electrolyte dealt with a lot of your arguements, so I won't go over every point you made.
I think that there is political conflict over evolution just as there is political conflict for an amendment to burn the American Flag. There have been several attempts to get this, but there really isn't any major surge of flag burning to justify an alteration to the consitution (in my opinion, of course)
There are lots of political conflicts based on non issues. The fact people fight about something doesn't prove that there is an actual conflict.
I would like to think everyone would prefer to be intellectually fulfilled. Claiming a atheist only listens to science is misleading. There are plenty of liberal arts majors who are also atheists. Also, history and archeology are more scientific than theistic these days. The reason for this is that theism looks for certainty while science looks for the best solution at the time. In thre realm of history and archeology or any of the sciences, certainty is impossible.
Oh, maybe you could argue that atheists don't feel that God is the source of morality. The concept that evolution is the process by which moral values were placed in our physical forms does not invalidate God's involvement. We live comfortably with the knowledge that God is not physically effecting miracles on a daily basis. Things seem to play out in a naturalistic way without any outside control. Why do you still insist that God was more directly involved in an earlier time?
No government can be neutral about anything, but we do the best we can. You are creating a false dilemma for me, arguing that religion must be involved in government else atheists will place their agenda into government instead. Try living in a country where church and state are not seperated. Want to know a few good examples? Saudi Arabia, Iran, Palistine, Lebanon.
And here, once again you remind us of the crux of your arguement's weakness. What if Sodom and Gomorrah were never destroyed? What if they never existed and were an amalgam of older legends that became intersperced into Jewish theism. Does this concept somehow invalidate the point of the story? The majority of the morals I learned as a child were first introduced me through Aesop. The fact that animals don't talk doesn't make the moral lessons any less valid.
This was addressed before, but I'd like to point out that this is false. Astronomy observes things that happened millions of years ago. Fossil records give us clues as to what happened in the past. They aren't always impeccable, but neither is a chemical reaction on a bench.
1. addressed above
2. Science have a perfect way of knowing: you never have all the information that exists. Each generation thinks it knows it all because we are usually an arrogant race. One branch of humanity that is an exception, however, is scientists. Scientists have seen how previous theorys were later refined or rejected and are quite accepting of the fact what we now know to be true will eventually be further refined. I had one professor who was wondering what physics breakthrough would show the problems of relativity.
Yes, Ecclesiastes shows that reverence for God is important in life, but I didn't see that denied in the quote you showed me. The quote says that humans are animals. Can you deny this? We have 99% of the same genetic material as chimpanzees. We have 70% of the same DNA as yeast. How does our relations to animals make our accomplishments any less amazing?",50,60,topic_stance_votes_1
60,Death Nail,evolution,attack,"If you, as a theistic evolutionist think they ""dealt"" with them, we really are getting somewhere.
As I said once before, I'm having a discussion with you. I do remember asking you if militant atheists answering questions for you bothered you, so I guess I now have my answer. The fact remains that for you and I to have a fair discussion as theists, I cannot be completely sidetracked by atheist comments that I have no idea if you find relevent. So as I said, if they make a point that you find relevent, you need to copy/paste it, or of course, rephrase it to me any way you wish. But I will address something they said, each of them saying it in a slightly differnt way;
On these two, both of them declared that I've not succeeded in in this debate with you. But it isn't over; obviously it's far from over if you stay with me - we've barely touched actual theism yet. Yet electrolyte and collin came to a conclusion long before all evidence was in. Could it be that evolutionist scientists similarly tend to be too hasty in coming to a conclusion concerning evolution, even before all evidence has been examined? Now you may say that qualified evolution scientists are far more mature and knowledgeable than electrolyte and collin, and of course you'd have a very valid point. But since you trust those two to answer questions for you, would you make that claim? 
The conflict over the flag is one, comfined issue - no comparison. The political conflict over evolution can penetrate just about all of politics, from what freedoms we do and do not have, how moral we are, how we determine medical procedures, the definition of marriage, - countless other things. 
It doesn't? So a ""fight"" and a ""conflict"" are two completely different things? They both involve two opposing forces, so word games aren't going to help you here. Based on what you say about this, we have much more ground to cover on it.
Why shouldn't history and archeology be applied equally to science and theism? They can both be applied in a secular way to what the Bible says. Theism looks for certainty in exactly the same way methodological, naturalistic scientists look for it in evolution.
Impossible to different degrees. A hands-on finding of an archeological artifact that corresponds to a Biblical event is much more certain than naturalistic proclamations of an event on earth that happened billions of years ago. 
And theistic evolutionists do? Why then, when a political conflict arises that divides Christians and Atheists, are theistic evolutionists almost always silent, or support the atheist point of view? I would think that theistic evolution would tend to be a 50/50 split, between Judeo Christianity and Atheism. Yet from their political positions, (and your almost complete lack of addressing theism in this discussion) indicates a split closer to 99/1. This ratio, combined with tricky atheists who pretend to be theists who are actually everything but, makes it quite clear to anyone with an open mind just how dangerous theistic evolution can be, especially when compared to many warnings in the Bible about how we should ""protect the innocent and make sure people do what is right."" I'm sure there may be a few theistic evolutionists with little knowledge of the Bible who are sincere, and they have that right of course, but when they constantly side with atheism politically, others have a right to call them on it. 
Things SEEM that way yes, to those who know nothing about the Bible. Read Psalm 111 sometime, and notice that it's not dated for any certain time period. 
Because the Bible says so, Methodist. 
Hitler, Stalin, Lenin, Mao, Ho Chi Min, Tito, Napoleon, Breshnev, they all did the best they could - they were all non religious. 
Should we not learn from history - do the names above not indicate that perfection doesn't always occur when religion is absent?
Atheists often compare the Muslim and Judeo Christian religions with each other, in order to downgrade Christianity. I see that theistic evolutionists can do the same thing. Our discussion is becoming fruitful. 
If Sodom and Gomorrah were never destroyed, we'd probably have a lot more thiestic evolutionists among us, who don't fear God, and who politically side with atheists. If the Sodom and Gomorrah story was an amalgam, it would soften, and weaken the point of the story. Reality makes a far stronger point than make believe. If 9/11 never happened, and Hollywood made up that story for a movie, it wouldn't get near the ratings and attention as would an attempt to realistically portray in a movie what actually happened. 
An observation of light, millions of lightyears away, is comparable to the observation of bilogical details on this planet? 
Nothing is impeccable in methodological, naturalistic evolution. 
Not addressed above, by you or the atheists, and it's increasingly hard to tell who's who. No details on how the observation of light far away tells us what happened on earth concerning living things.
So scientists are on a level above other humans - they are above arrogance? 
What we now KNOW, that God is not necessary for life to exist? The basic, unchanging faith of atheism?
And there can't possibly be a single professor alive who isn't wondering if an empirical evidence breakthrough will show design in nature? 
Other parts of the Bible say that man is more important than animals, and that man is to take dominion over animals. The above atheist scientist who quoted Ecclesiastes left those things out, because Atheism often politically conflicts with those things. (environmentalism is one example) Is theistic evolution in alliance with atheists on that subject too?

Miller is an excellent speaker. He's persuasive, he's clear, he knows his science well, and he was an impressive participant in the conflict at Dover…and he was on the correct side. Here's the problem: he's wrong now.
What he does is an insightful and lucid analysis of the problems with creationism, and then tries to wrap it up by identifying the source of the problem. Unfortunately, he places the blame in the laps of atheists, which is simply absurd. We've got fundamentalists straining to insert religious nonsense in the school curricula, and Miller's response is turn around and put the fault on those godless secular people who have antagonized good Christian folk, giving them perfectly reasonable cause to fear for their immortal souls. How dare we? It's only understandable that Kansans would object to godless interpretations of science!",66,67,topic_stance_votes_1
67,Death Nail,evolution,attack,"I apologize for being away, but several RL issues required my attention. I've got some area to cover, obviously
This stems from the main issue between us. I would have not trouble having a militant atheist explain that the planets orbit around the sun. This is because that is an issue of science that observation can confirm. In this same sense, addressing questions of evolution itself, can be addressed by atheists because evolution is a science. I wouldn't wish an atheist to explain the proper way to live in my stead, as that is an issue of morality that is inexoribly linked to religion, and we would likely disagree in many different ways.
If we wish to have a theistic discussion, let us discuss theology. Arguing that the bible is in some way a document of scientific merit, as you have several times previous mixes these issues.
Collin and electrolyte's tone aside, they do get their facts straight. When discussing details about evolution and the evidence that supports it, they hand out facts, even if they have little patience with people who don't read the evidence they provided. All that aside, to argue that they are immature cheapens the debate all around, if you feel they are acting petty, simply strive to rise above them and cary the discussion forward.
I still don't see how this is true. If we suddenly discovered tomorrow that we were in fact more closely related to potatos than to apes, would this in any way shift what it is that makes us human? I believe that our moral beliefs originate with God, but am unconcerned with the process he used to infuse us with them. 
There is a definite difference between a fight and a conflict. I've had fights with people over how much milk I could drink before I would throw up. There is no pressing conflict of ideology over the critical mass of milk a stomach can take. People can fight about petty things, but a true conflict is something significant. The real question is which one is this thread based around?
Science is not so arrogant to assume it can ever achieve certainty. Evolution is not certain, just as atomic theory is not certain. Both, however, are backed up by a great wealth of experimental evidence that can not easily be overturned
Theism looks for certainty where it can be achieved, in philosophy of ethics and morality. In these areas, principles can be achieved without empricism. Archeology and history do not have this convienance.
This statement is a blip, the odds of some archaeologist finding an artifact versus proclamations is moot. What matters is what has been found.
And what issues do you speak of that split Christianity and atheists? I can think of a few, but unless you addressed them individually we can't really discuss the reasons behind any given ratio. From a general point of view, I believe that the reason many theistic evolutionists side with the same side an atheist would side with, is such issues stem from instances where theists begin to intrude on issues of secular nature.
You really missed the point of my arguements here. Evolution does not deny the guiding hand of God, it simply observes his methods. When everything seems to play out naturally, it is because that is how God wishes it to work. In this way, science and religion are seperate yet compliment each other. I still cannot see why the two must conflict.
This is guilt by association. So there were some atheistic leaders in the world (though, as previously mentioned by those dirty atheists, not all of the ones you listed were atheists.) This misses my point that governments strive to be neutral but always fall short by some degree. I'll save some space by not listing all the heavily religious leaders known for their atrocities.
This is a seperate issue. Leaders can be atheists, governments can be secular. Governments fail when religion is absent from the people. The USSR prohibited religious holidays, which ultimately undermined their people. To have a religious government is the same as having an atheist government, except the former would infringe on one religion fewer. A goverment need not be atheistic, it just must be free.
Again you missed the point, but on this I am partly to blame as I did mention only muslim nations. The nations I listed were all ones where there is an official Religion. In Saudi Arabia you must be a Muslim to be a citizen. Notice I did not mention Turkey or Jordan. These are Islamic societies that do not enforce their religion and have much freer societies. Shall America become the newest nation where religion dominates government?
Your point on Sodom and Gomorrah is interesting. Do you mean to say we need to 'fear' God in the sense that he'll bring down his wrath when we sin? In Sunday school, I was always told that fearing God meant something different in the old days and implied belief.
On the point of 9/11, well I won't get too much into it suffice to say that 9/11 may shed some valuable light on Sodom and Gomorrah. Already, many people disagree as to what actually happened. Some say that America was responsible, some argue it was a Jewish conspiracy, some state it was Al-Quieda but disagree on who is to blame. The recent show Path to 9/11 is poignent in how it has begun to redefine what actually happened, as many scenes directly contradict the 9/11 report. Over time, the true story becomes fogged in mystery. Imagine how Sodom and Gomorrah has changed since it was finally written down in the form we see it now.
to be brutally honest the observation of light is far more accurate and scientific, but biologists would disagree with me. We know more about the Andromedae galaxy than we do about our own minds, but given time, we learn more and more.
Exactly, and it never will be. Any claim of an impeccable theory is laughed at, why do you think so many of the people on this board seem condescending?
Light from Andromeda can't tell us about Earth, but that wasn't the point. The point was to demonstrate that observations from millions of years ago are possible.
No human is above arrogance and there are many examples of scientists who were extreme examples of arrogance. There are also countless examples of scientists clinging onto older notions. However, when push comes to shove, the majority of scientists will acknowledge new data and adjust their worldviews to it. No sufficient data has arrived to discount evolution, however. 
Now this is a theistic question on which I would agree with you, God is necessary for existance. However, if you mean that life requires a glowing hand decending from the sky to mold it out of dirt, then you and I have a disagreement.
I'm sure every professor has wondered about this. This actually is related to my sig, which you are so offended by. I'll bring it up again in a moment, when you mentioned it. 
There are some people who are a little crazy and would argue that the life of the three ring snail is more important than humans, but these are few and far between. I for one fully believe we are above animals in many ways. However, I don't see how environmentalism works here. The problem with our damage to the environment is not that the Earth will die. The Earth will always bounce back and adapt, we just might be left on the wayside during the adaptation.
Now is a great time to get on about the quote in my sig that you have felt mocks God. First, I recommend you read the Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy as it is a funny book from which this quote originated. The quote is actually more about the arrogance of man than mocking God.
The book discusses the Babel Fish described as such:
The Babel Fish is small, yellow and leech-like, and probably the oddest thing in the Universe. It feeds on brainwave energy not from its carrier, but from those around it. It absorbs all unconscious mental frequencies from this brainwave energy to nourish itself with. It then excretes into the mind of its carrier a telepathic matrix formed by combining the conscious thought frequencies with nerve signals picked up from the speech centres of the brain which has supplied them. The practical upshot of all this is that if you stick a Babel fish in your ear you can instantly understand anything said to you in any form of language. The speech patterns you actually hear decode the brainwave matrix which has been fed into your mind by your Babel fish. 
The Babel fish, by effectively removing all barriers to communication between different races and cultures, has caused more and bloodier wars than anything else in the history of creation.
The book then expounds that the supreme uncertainty of such a useful creature ever evolving naturally proved the non-existance of God. It is at this point my sig begins, listing the basic theory. 
On another level, I think it speaks leaps and bounds that you are so affected by the sig, which is all in good fun and I imagine that God has quite the sense of humor.

Posting a picture is also no proof. After all, ""Collectrolyte"" could just post pictures of random people, or a picture of ""himself"" holding a sign and a random friend holding signs.
Of course, marc has a special gift for believing things despite evidence, so even if either one of us did provide sufficient proof, he'd simply ignore it, just like he does all the other evidence we present.",71,72,topic_stance_votes_1

But as a theist, you should understand that atheists use evolution as a weapon against religion - it's the only weapon they have. Being wary of false teaching is part of Christianity, as I pointed out in post #33 with the Col. 2:8 scripture. Doesn't it make sense that one of the few things worse than being taken in by false teaching would be to become a false teacher? I wonder if anyone ever asked Kenneth Miller that. Do you have his book - Finding Darwin's God?
Yet you're okay with the way they proclaim that the knowledge of science overrides the historical accounts of Genesis? This undermines the basic way of reading the Bible, as described by Jesus and the Apostles in the New Testament.
Let me get a theistic discussion started then, by stating that science, and the Bible, aren't on the same one dimensional realm as many theistic evolutionists seem to think they are. God is multidimensional - he has self existance, omnipresence, omniscience, omnipotence, perfection, infinity, incomprehensibility. Science, (the scientists who represent it) have none of those things. They have not the tiniest fraction of the ability to supersede what his word, the Bible says. That's what a Christian creationist believes, and an atheist doesn't believe it. What does a theistic evolutionist believe? Something in the middle? Something in the middle doesn't just cause the meaning of the Bible to be partly lost, it causes it to be compeltely lost, because Christianity isn't just about ""being good"", it's about the severity of a thing called sin, and the price paid for it's forgivness. 
One dimensional, human facts. As I posted earlier, theistic evolution seems to be a 99 to 1 ratio. Why do theistic evolutionists seem so enthralled by science, and so disinterested in some BASICS of the New Testament?
And you think it is my fault, not theirs, that the debate is cheapened? 
It has to do with that thing called sin. Atheism wants to destroy the concept of original sin, originating with the first man, Adam. Theistic evolution seems to be in agreement with this, and it goes back to what I said above - it undermines the basic way of reading and understanding the Bible.
Are you unconcerned about the origins of sin, the severity of sin, the price paid for it's forgiveness?
This thread has gone off topic somewhat, but what you and I are discussing isn't petty, since it concerns false teachings, and leading people astray. The Bible speaks of Satan, the great deceiver. Do you think there is absolutely no chance that theistic evolution could possibly be one of his tools of deception? 
That's a nice statement, but I don't see evidence of it. Certainty is proclaimed by science all the time, in theoretical matters. 
Again, it must constantly be pointed out that the word evolution has several meanings. In this case, does it mean ""change over time"", or does it mean, ""no Adam, no flood""?
Atheists would probably tell you that they can look for it too, within themselves, and their lives experiences. (Christian) theists look for it in the Bible, and if their own feelings differ with an overall interpretation of the Bible, they realize the problem is with themselves, and not the Bible. 
How it's interpreted, and how it's reported. 
In the U.S., it's largely the same issues that split the Republican and Democratic partys. In a small government, it wouldn't matter much. Our government is no longer small, however. Seemingly small disagreements can involve big money, for either side.
Like when George Washington proclaimed the Thanksgiving day holiday? Why aren't theistic evolutionists concerned when atheists begin to intrude on U.S. traditions, like their beloved ""separation of church & state""? 
In many ways they don't conflict. But in many ways they do - because atheists need evolution as a weapon, as I said above. 
The government that did the best job of not falling short just may have been the early U.S., before it separated church & state about 60 years ago. 
It is a separate issue, but the U.S. government has grown by leaps and bounds in a striking relation to the time we decided to separate church & state. 
It's not moving in that direction, despite what atheists say. 
It means different things to different denominations, but it largely means a recognition that we need a savior. If man decended from apes, if Adam didn't exist, if the entire Old Testament were fairy tales, do we really have all that much to fear? If the Old Testament is fairy tales, wouldn't we wonder if the New Testament was fairy tales too?
Conflicts will always be going on in the world. While militant Muslims conflict with Americans, how Americans conflict with each other (Christians vs. Atheists) has a bearing on it. Political opinions in the U.S. are countless and endless, yet it just about always boils down to two positions - Democrat vs. Republican. In WW2, many different countries and ideologies were involved, but they separated themselves into two groups, Allied powers vs. Axis powers. The religious conflict in the U.S. today is mainly between Christians and Atheists. Which side is theistic evolution leaning towards? 
""Finally written down""? Don't theistic evolutionists recognize scripture's authority, origins, or preservation at all??
Because they laugh at the Bible as if it's on the same realm of scientific theories. 
One dimentional stuff. 
So we disagree about the first man, and original sin? In that case, our two different attempts to discover who God actually is take off in different directions immediately. 
Here's how environmentalism works - if there is no God, either man or random processes can change the earths climate, cleanliness, etc. and therefore only man can take action to make it better - leaders, appointed, anointed men. No faith in God = more faith in men. No faith in God = bigger, more intrusive government. 
That's all very nice, but how many people who read your sig are going to know that? At first glance, it appears to mock God, for instance when God says ""I hadn't thought of that"". First glances can portray a ""hollow and deceptive philosophy"". What atheist, (or false teacher) doesn't take delight in God ""not thinking"" of something?
