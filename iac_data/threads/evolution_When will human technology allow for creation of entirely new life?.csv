0,When will human technology allow for creation of entirely new life?,evolution,support,"I know this is a bit off topic, but human technology - ranging from genetic manipulation to artificial intelligence - is slowly approaching the point where it is conceivable that within this century humans could be capable of creating an entirely new life form. 
I'm not talking only clones or hybrids - which have already been achieved at various levels - but engineering a new living being from scratch by synthesizing DNA in the full ""design"" that one would desire. Outside of biological designs of this sort, the question also arises whether artificial intelligence could ever advance to the point that one would create a sentient electro-mechanical ""living"" being - where the question would also arise as to what constitutes ""life"". Any such technology is still quite far away but it does bring up interesting moral issues of humans dangerously ""playing God"". Already moral questions of human - animal hybrids or human clones have started to become relevant since the technology seems to be just around the corner. 
If anybody is interested in these issues, this forums seems as good a a place as any to discuss them. What are your thoughts - either on the morality behind human manipulation / creation of life or on the potential technology behind it?",0,1,topic_stance_votes_1
1,When will human technology allow for creation of entirely new life?,evolution,attack,"If you mean starting from scratch with absolutely no genetic material at all as part of the formula or equation, then I don't believe man will ever accomplish that.

2,When will human technology allow for creation of entirely new life?,evolution,attack,"Well, man might someday gain the capability of fully synthasizing a molecule as complex as DNA from scratch. Of course, he would use the knowledge gained from studying how various DNA codes affect natural biological characteristics in order to properly design that DNA to achieve the desired characteristics. It might be even more difficult to then take that synthesized DNA and put it in an egg and artificial womb that has no natural (as opposed to artificial) biological parts, but even that might be achievable someday through chemical construction. All this means is that humanity might someday be able to copy the methods of nature to create a new being - perhaps even use creativity to create beings of very different natural functions than we see in our world.
It is all interesting to think about and could well be achievable within this century. We already are capable of a large degree of genetic manipulation through cloning and hybridization. One would think that it will only be a matter of time before more complex technologies get developed.
The other question, of course, is - If we could someday create new life using our technology, should we? That would bring up a whole host of issues, including:
- Would we know what we were doing well enough not to cause great harm?
- How would the beings we create be treated?",2,3,topic_stance_votes_1
3,When will human technology allow for creation of entirely new life?,evolution,attack,"Here is a strand of DNA: To think that Man can design, structure and then create such a thing that when fertilized and planted will actually grow into an independent life form with equal and functioning parts is a real stretch for me to even conceive as probable, much less possible.

 There are approximately 60 trillion cells in the human body. Each of these cells carry material called chromosomes. Along those chromosomes are about 100,000 genes. The gene is what carries our heredity.
It determines everything from our eye and hair color to our risk for diseases like heart disease and diabetes. Inside each gene is Deoxyribonucleic Acid - DNA - whose purpose is to carry out a single function.
""DNA is a polymer,a molecule, made up of a large number of atoms, arranged in repeating units called nucleotides."" ( Criminalistics, Saferstein, Richard, 2001) Nucleotides are then strung together to form thew DNA strand.
There are four bases attached to the backbone of the DNA strand: adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine. The DNA strand can go on forever containing millions of bases.
Double Helix 
There are actually two DNA strands called a double Helix. They resemble two wires twisted around each other.
The two strands are connected by the four bases, adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine ( A,C,G,T).
The pairing of the bases has to go in a certain pattern. Although there can be different sequences, A must attach to T and G must attach to C:
A........T
G........C
C........G
A........T
T........A
C........G
This is called base pairing. Although this is the way the bases must be paired together, there is no limit on how the bases are sequenced on the strand. So there are limitless possibilities of sequencing.
Each strand of DNA has the same information. It's how the bases are sequenced that determines our unique genetic heredity, including any predisposition to certain diseases.
All the human chromosomes contain about three billion base pairs. This is referred to as the genetic code. An individualized code that is as unique to each of us as our fingerprints, except in the case of identical twins.
The complexity of sequencing more than 3 billion pairs of chromosomes in order to create a viable creature in the mammal family is so far beyond mans capabilities today, and will always be in my humble opinion.",3,4,topic_stance_votes_2

We have moved from the discovery of DNA to deciphering the construction of the human (and others') genome in only sixty years, yet you seek only to belittle mankinds achievement in order to boost your invisible friend. Your opinion is indeed humble as it denies man's future progress in deference to ""Goddidit!"".

6,When will human technology allow for creation of entirely new life?,evolution,attack,"Talk about sanctimonious, you call this a refutation of what I have said? I posted a basic description of the complexity of what DNA is and you contribute nothing but insults and assumptions that this is all beyond my comprehension because I'm a christian no doubt. If I believe in a personal God I must be stupid right pf? 
And by posting what science has discovered about the complexity of what makes up life, I believe I have convincingly shown how far Man is from duplicating that process from scratch and creating any working animal with all of its parts in order. What I am saying so you can comprehend it pf is that discovering and even cataloging the molecular structure, the proteins and atomic make up of the chromosomes, the genes and the cell structure of DNA doesn't in any way mean we can then create it from scratch and organize it so it becomes a living being of any type. I believe that is a more complex process than we could ever accomplish in the century as was suggested in the OP. 
And by extension, ever because as I said above, creating life from non life falls under the heading of Gods realm of creating something from nothing. We are good at taking raw materials and building them into something new and different, but taking non living matter and creating viable life from it as described in the OP will always be beyond Mans capabilities in my opinion. The Lord will return before we ever could gain such knowledge if such knowledge was even possible to gain. You may not like hearing that opinion, but there it is anyway.
Here again is a breakdown of the complexity of what is the genetic code.

However, engineered organisms with wholly new functions and features aren't nearly as improbable. Genetically engineered organisms with minor modifications are already agriculturally, industrially and medically important; examples with more extensive modifications should be coming soon.

No one is insulting you or making assumptions about your ignorance of this topic; you did that quite nicely yourself. Phrases like ""the molecular structure, the proteins and atomic make up of the chromosomes, the genes and the cell structure of DNA"" are gibberish and indicate you unfamiliarity with genetics.

11,When will human technology allow for creation of entirely new life?,evolution,attack,"Thanks for the link Demon38, finally someone is interested in actually discussing the issue rather than attacking both my intelligence and my right to participate in a discussion about a science I don't have a degree in. How many molecular biologists do we have on this forum after all? And was the OP directed only at them? I also notice that all of those who condemn and insult me for giving my opinion as gibberish offered absolutely nothing to the debate at all, only insults.
As to your link though, I read the whole article and need some clarification as to what kind of life it believes we are close to creating. I ask this because the OP is pretty clear about suggesting the creation of synthetic artificial life within the century in the full design that one would desire. That is what I was speaking to not ever happening in the post above. The rest of the part you quoted was not about the end result being a functional new animal of any design, or of an intended design by its human makers. I maintain that will never successfuly happen, and your article doesn't imply that will ever happen either. If I'm wrong, please correct me. 
Remember, Another opinion wasn't speaking about Designing a new organism from scratch, but a functioning new animal from scratch with all parts where they should be, based totally on human design.
Please correct me if I'm wrong but this article doesn't imply what the OP is suggesting at all is it? Isn't this article clearly suggesting that ""…it'll be a huge achievement if you can keep them [artificial cells] alive for an hour in a lab. So I stand by my belief that to be able to structure DNA artificially to grow into a working animal is not something that Man will succeed at accomplishing.

15,When will human technology allow for creation of entirely new life?,evolution,attack,"Just to clarify the intention of my opening post, it was meant to imply that, within this century, we might be capable of designing life from scratch - not just hybridization (essentially cutting and pasting of existing pieces of naturally made DNA) or cloning. However, this does not mean that it need be a complex life form such as a mammal or even, for that matter, a multi-celled organism. 
We would have to start from the very simple life forms - such as a microbe - and progress from there. Since carbon based biological lifeforms are what we are most familiar with, any new life form we create would essentially copy the methods of nature and use the knowledge of metabolisms and general organic functions that we already see in nature - just custom picked for our own design purposes. Demon38's excellent article does suggest that we are quite close to creating that first very simple life-form. The fact that it would not last long in the lab is a secondary issue - creating life is one thing, keeping it alive is another further step. 
Synthetic biology is a field that combines science and engineering in order to design and build (""synthesize"") novel biological functions and systems. From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_biology :
The references relating to synthesizing DNA of microbe-level complexity do suggest that we are already at the begining of being able to custom design DNA for very simple organisms. At the impressive speed at which genetic science has progressed over the last decades and, given the amount of effort put into the general field, I have little doubt that genetic technology will continue to make great strides to produce even more complex organisms and fully viable synthetic life within the following decades. It will be an interesting process to watch but one which we also need to discuss with respect to issues of safety, social implications, etc.
Even at the level of the very simple synthetic organisms addressed by the field of synthetic biology, some of the concerns include (from the same web page):
As this general field progresses farther, even more ethical issues will come into play to discuss. Either way, it is a fasciniating field to discover, follow and discuss.",12,16,topic_stance_votes_1
16,When will human technology allow for creation of entirely new life?,evolution,support,"I'm not clear on the hybridization point. Clearly designing life utterly from scratch is well beyond our current means. Any life we create in the near future would be as similar to existing life as any given cell is to any other; things like structure, metabolic pathways, etc would all be pretty much the same. Given that, the simplest method for creating ""new"" life would be to take the genome of an existing organism, a bacteria for example, get rid of the genes we don't want, add the genes we do, and then synthesize it. I'm not talking about cutting and pasting genes into an existing strand of DNA, but rather using the information from an existing strand to design a new strand, and making that from scratch. Would that count as hybridization to you?",16,17,topic_stance_votes_1

18,When will human technology allow for creation of entirely new life?,evolution,support,"By hybridization, I mean combining naturally-made portions of DNA as opposed to synthesizing the DNA from scratch - without using natural DNA to make it. Basically, it is harder to make a DNA molecule from scratch without using pre-existing self-replicating natural DNA molecules as building blocks.
If, as you mention, you would make a new strand of DNA from scratch without using natural DNA to physically make it , then I would not call that hybridization. However, just because you don't use natural DNA to make the synthetic DNA doesn't mean you wouldn't use the same types of designs that nature uses in existing DNA. I would think that using design knowledge gained from studying existing DNA would be necessary for the first range of life-forms. As an analogy, if you put together a car from various parts of other cars, then you have not made a car from scratch. You would have to make all the car parts separately anew to say that you have created an entirely new car. However, you are obviously going to learn how to design a car by looking at existing cars so, from that point of view, you are using information from the other cars - just not any physical parts from them. Of course, car parts do not self replicate so this is not a perfect analogy. 
The bottom line is that it is more impressive if you make new DNA from scratch without using any existing DNA than if you only cut and paste self-replicated pieces of existing DNA. It is just harder to claim that one created new life from scratch if one used existing life to make it. That is why I don't view hybridization as highly as I would synthesizing DNA molecules from scratch - which the wikipedia site seemed to refer to as do novo DNA synthesis.",17,19,topic_stance_votes_1

When we can bypass that step, and create life without having to use any components that were once living, that will be impressive!
As for the ethical concerns, I'm not too worried. In my life time I don't see us being likely to move beyond the single cell stage. We wouldn't be able to create life of a ""high enough order"" that I would worry about its rights or anything like that.

Being a physicist, not a biologist, I don't have a good feel for all of the other cell components that would be necessary to make a functioning, surviving, replicating cell, but it seems that the process to develop such parts are under way.
I'm afraid that I am not as optimistic as you seem to be. As I quoted in a previous post, there is a lot of potential damage that can be done if harmful pathogens are either accidentally or purposely created. That already is a large risk for us to take and, unlike the other main technological risk of nuclear weapons, such pathogens could well be easier and cheaper to make and, since they are replicating, their destructive power could be harder to control.

60,When will human technology allow for creation of entirely new life?,evolution,support,"I'm not completely sure if existing pathogens would be more dangerous than new ones. After all, we have evolved with the existing pathogens and are sufficiently imune to the great majority of them. The ones that are very lethal often, such as Ebola, tend to kill off the small group that gets exposed before they can spread the virus. Evolution would leave us completely unprepared for any completely new pathogen - a pathogen that is lethal but at a rate that also allows it to spread widely from a small sample. 
I agree that once the technology is developed or nearly developed, it is hard to control it completely. However, I bemoan the fact that there isn't more public discussion on the safety and societal issues surounding these new technologies - discussion that can spur government action at properly controlling the emergence or use of the genetic technology. Granted, many people who are unwilling or unable to educate themselves on the issues of genetic technology might take an all or nothing approach in wanting to ban it completely - so I would admit that pushing it into public debate might have its pitfalls. However, this is such an important advance in technology that having practically no public debates also seems dangerous. I was glad to hear that there are some people who try to push some of these issues into debate. For example, Stuart Newman tried to patent a human chimp hybrid in order to get the patent office to think about and address these issues. From http://www.wesleyjsmith.com/blog/200...ee-hybrid.html :

Our best bet, I think, would be to take an existing pathogen and ""enhance"" it, either through direct genetic manipulation or through simple breeding. We can do this, and in fact have. In the name of ""defensive research"" both the U.S. and Russia have developed all sorts of super bugs; it will be decades before we could grow anything from scratch that could compete for lethality, or so I would guess.
Therein lies the rub. This is a complicated, scientific issue. Before you can have an intelligent opinion on the subject you need to educate yourself, and a distressingly small percentage of the populous is willing to do that. I'm all for public debate, but debate among the ignorant is pointless. It might benefit the scientific community to fund some educational endeavors.

62,When will human technology allow for creation of entirely new life?,evolution,support,"You make a good point that it may not be all that easy to make a virulent harmful pathogen from scratch since the process of infection may be complicated enought that it would take a while for us to understand it well enough to create an entirely new style of virus. Meanwhile, as you say, the military has developed a wide range of super-bugs. Hopefully, it has developed anti-viral drugs to combat the created pathogens so that, were some to be let loose, our ENTIRE species would not be decimated. These are the topics of occasional movies over recent years. I only hope that no group - terrorist or otherwise - gets it into their head to develop an uncontrollable virus. 
These are some of the reasons why I am always wary of the development of novel potentially vastly harmful technologies - it could be too easy to lose control of them. I am always impressed by the creativity behind new technologies but one cannot bound forward in scientific progress without occasionally stepping back and looking at the potential risks. After all, we are a far from perfect species, often very illogical, who are in some ways too ""young"" to possess some of these technologies. Very serious thought needs to be given as to how to control these technologies to absolutely reduce the risk of inadvertent (or purposeful) harm. 
My major concern is that, without public debate, real societal or safety issues may be cast asside by the power of the industries supporting the new technologies. Public debate does have its pitfalls but it also does highlight the points of potential danger and concern that might otherwise be overlooked in the rush toward technological development and profit. In the ideal world, I would love to have the public debate to clarify potential concerns about these technologies, and then have government panels of unbiased experts determine the paths of government involvement necessary to alleviate those concerns.

At the low end people were worried about armies of clones, or clones grown just for their organs, or people acheiving immortatlity by leaving their estates to their clones. With a little education people found out how silly those concerns were and said ""sure, why not?"" With a bit more education you find out how many attempts it takes to make a viable clone, and how the failures often gave rise to birth defects, gigantism, or other problems. The birth defect issue was real and important, but you didn't hear about it much because most people were arguing about ""organ banks"" instead. 
I agree with your concerns, but I don't see any solution. Business will most likely do whatever makes them money, scientists will generally (though not always) do the research without worrying too much about how it can be misused, and the public (and by extenstion politicians) often can't be bothered to fully understand the issues involved. Public debate is quite likely to center around easy to grasp misconceptions rather than complicated realities. Your panel of unbiased experts sounds like a good plan, but even if they could be found in the end all they could do is advise the politicians, who would just as likely listen to the polls and lobbyists instead of the pros.
