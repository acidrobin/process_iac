0,Do abortion proponents favor choice?,abortion,support,"Often abortion supporters convey their message as one of championing the cause of freedom of choice and resistance of the oppression of others values on women. Perhaps this should be posted as a poll but I wonder if this support for ""choice"" remains consistent.
Do those who support the choice of abortion also support the choice to bear children? Do they abhor the imposition of the one child rule on the women of China for example? The woman's choice is restricted and the ideals of the government are imposed upon her. Do those here who support the freedom of choice of abortion denounce China's policies and support the freedom of choice of bearing children?
There are also some areas in India where a person running for an elected office cannot have more than two children (there are obvious implications of this policy on what the makeup of the ruling government will be and how it will institute policy). Do those supporting the choice of abortion denounce this policy as a restriction of choice?
Or do environmental and population concerns outweigh and assume more importance than the freedom of choice in the above examples?",0,1,topic_stance_votes_1
1,Do abortion proponents favor choice?,abortion,attack,"I cannot speak for all pro-choice people, but as for myself, I can say I gladly support a woman's right to her decisions regarding her own offspring and reproductive health. I would not presume to know enough about her situation to add an opinion to that choice, but I will protect her ability to make it to the best of my ability. I am overjoyed when someone I love has a child, and enjoy that child as much as possible when I have a chance. I have a few relatives who have been blessed through means of adoption, and the same goes for them. I also know women who have chosen abortion, and my heart goes out to them.
I think a woman should be free to become a mother if she wants to, but I also think that that decision should be weighed against practical standards. I think its grossly irresponsible for a woman who already has seven children, and is living strictly by the financial aid the government provides, to have another child. (saw this situation firsthand) I also think that if you can't afford to keep your own stomach full, that maybe adding another mouth to the bargain isn't wise. But if you make a ton of money, and your private affairs are in order, I'm not so sure you should feel entitled to having children. I don't think anyone should tell you not to, but I don't think you're naturally entitled to offspring.
In china they have dramatic overpopulation, same goes for India. They have such a problem that it is unfathomable for the typical american to comprehend.
US- pop. 280,562,489 pop. density 79.6 per sq. mile
China - pop. 1,286,975,468- pop density- 347 per sq. mile
India- pop. 1,049,700,118 pop density- 827! per sq. mile.
okay, so (if we were evenly spaced) that gives each American 352 feet in which to breathe. In China, that number is reduced to a mere 80 feet, and in India, one person gets a whole 33 feet all to himself. 
When you think about it that way, would you really want to share your thirty feet with a baby? Even if you did, would it be right to infringe on your neighbor's thirty feet?
I do not like the idea of the government having too much say in these personal issues... that being said, I don't think it is such a hard thing to ask someone to limit themselves to two children. Certainly in the two most populated countries in the world, they re not in danger of dying out. Sure, some woman might decide its her right to have ten kids, but I think that just might be morally wrong, when we're talking about how many inches to each kid.
I think that environmental and political concerns should certainly take part in these decisions, though I will not go so far as to assign their importance. Yes, there should be freedom of choice, but should your choices infringe on another's? If we're talking in thirty feetses, sure as heck, i want you to stay out of mine! 
But there are always other circumstances. Should a wealthy landowner deeded with several acres be entitled to have as many kids as his land will support? maybe. Should a wealthy woman with tons of money be able to have as many kids as her pocket will allow? maybe
But on the other hand, should a poor woman without two red cents to rub together be required to abort her very loved and wanted child? probably not.",1,2,topic_stance_votes_2

I'm not sure that reproductive health is a good term to use too closely in relation to abortion. There are actually negative physical and emotional/psychological consequences that accompany abortion.
I agree that we should try to be good stewards of the resources around us.
I will not turn this into another debate that often comes up with this issue. But for the sake of clarification can you tell me if you believe it possible that the rights of the being's inside the mother are being infringed upon? That is, when do you deem it worthy of protection? (I won't debate this, I'm just curious as to your view).",2,3,topic_stance_votes_1
3,Do abortion proponents favor choice?,abortion,attack,"Um- there are negative physical/psychological results to carrying pregancies to full term, too. Actually, carrying a child to term is more dangerous than having an abortion. But the point is, that by protecting a woman's right to have an abortion, we are protecting her reproductive health by providing safe, sanitary, procedures. By keeping abortion legal, we are also helping to protect her psychological health, by providing better access to counseling etc.
Actually, I am of the opinion that the fetus has no natural rights of its own. Any rights we grant to a person as a citizen or national are granted at the moment of birth. By granting equal rights to a 3week old fetus that you do to a 20 year old man, you are endangering the rights of the woman who carries that child. Yes, I believe that in most circumstances, the child should be carried to term, but there are exceptions to every rule, and I'm not quite ready to forsake the lives and health of women to protect unborn children.

6,Do abortion proponents favor choice?,abortion,attack,"negative results of pregnancy? Let's see, how about pre-eclampsia, placenta previa, and uncontrollable hemorraging? these are just some of the life-theatening conditions that can and do result from pregnancy. There are also the less dangerous side effects of pregnancy, such as vitamin deficiency, and then of course mental disorders that may result.
In some cases, an abortion is performed in order to save the mother's life. or is her life of no consequence other than as a vessel for a child?
I think we are all aware that abortion is a terrible thing. No-one is denying that. And contrary to what some people might think, there is nothing anyone could say to make (most) women undergoing an abortion feel any worse about it. Just like any traumatic situation, sometimes you might just need to talk to someone about it, make sure your head is in the right place. 
And yes, some abortion clinics do provide counseling, but as far as i know, all of them provide referrals to other organizations that do. Contrary to what some people might think, the employees at these clinics, for the most part, are caring, compassionate people.
That's a tough question. Yes, I think that in a perfect world this would be true, but as we all know, our world is not perfect. I would prefer that a woman never be faced with a circumstance in which abortion would seem an option than have her not have the option. 
I think I would say that rather than just a simple right to life, that beings have a right to a certain quality of life, that life itself is not enough. As I have said, abortion is never a good thing, but in some cases it might prevent what would be a life of suffering. These are terrible choices to make, but I do not find myself presumptious enough to assume that a child would rather be horribly deformed and retarded than not be at all. Unfortunately, we can't look into the future and ask the kid himself, we have to trust the people involed to make the right decision. 
And what exactly am i granting to the suit-wearing politicians in washington by giving them the right to revoke her ability to make these decisions for herself? I don't think dictatorship is the right word, since she is not asking for the power over anyone but herself, and her child. Would you call a man dying of inoperable cancer who decides to end his chemotherapy a dictator? Or a parent who decides to remove their child from life-support?
Would you rather it be a democracy? That everytime a woman is faed with this predicament, we put it to a vote? How about an oligarchy- where her situation is put in front of some committee who decides her fate?
Yes to both. You see, I am aware that life is complicated and difficult. I am aware that each situation we encounter has it's own aggregates, its own properties. I am not willing to make a drastic- cut in stone- decision regarding something that is so complex.",5,7,topic_stance_votes_2
7,Do abortion proponents favor choice?,abortion,attack,"Yes, I would stay out of it, unless I knew the woman, and she spoke up and asked me for an opinion, or advice. And even in the case of the woman being my best friend, and knowing all the different aspects to the situation, I still would not feel comfortable weighing in. Just like if it was me in the situation, I know that ultimately, it would be my decision, and I would have a right to that decision.
I have no idea where you got this. I have said before, that this decision should be left to the mother, the father (if he is even around) and her doctors. perhaps she would like to talk to a spiritual advisor, or her friends/family. Let me rephrase, the only people who should have a say, aer those the woman wants to include in her decision. Yes, the father should have a say, but he should not be able to force her into carrying the child. Hopefully, the two respect,love and support each other enough to reach the decision together.
And, for the record, I don't think there is some perfect recipe for a family. Children can be well raised by only their mother, or only their father. (for the record, I know a lot more single fathers than single mothers) Or even another family member. I don't think there is any such thng as the ideal family, except for the ideals each individual might have for themself.

8,Do abortion proponents favor choice?,abortion,attack,"Superbuddha,
That may be true, but those cases are extremely rare and do not warrant the blanket crusade for ""choice"" and ""reproductive freedom."" In regard to the mother simply being a vessel for a ""child,"" I do not believe that in any way. I do not subtract value from the mother as the pro-choice group does from the ""child."" It is respect for women that drives the pro-life cause, not disrespect. I do believe that a mother in the fullest sense of the word should do everything in her power to protect her child--even risking her life. That is what a mother is. That is what a mother does.
Do you think during this counseling that the abortion clinics give full disclosure to the woman of the developmental progress of the baby she is carrying? Do you think they offer her pictures of a baby her age so that she can make a fully enlightened decision? Did you hear about all of the controversy brought about by people attempting to get abortion clinics to show mothers an ultrasound prior to making a final decision on abortion?
Who will be the judge of quality of life and suffering? Who will tell you when you retire and you are no longer ""productive"" that your quality of life is nothing and your life is forfeit to make way for others? Who will determine that Christopher Reeves cannot live in his broken body because of a poor quality of life?
You are not presumptious enough to assume a child would rather be horribly deformed and retarded than not be at all. But you are willing to grant women the power to be presumptious enough to assume that a child would rather not be at all then be horribly deformed and retarded. Trusting the people involved may not be so wise. After all, it is a decision made in the midst of trauma, confusion, fear, etc. 
You are not giving them any rights. You are allowing them to do their job and legislate against inhumane and immoral actions as they do in any other arena. They would be revoking an ability to make a decision as they do in any other action that is deemed detrimental to people and society. Actually, you are allowing them to correct the wrong interpretations of the law and the overstepping of the judicial branch that Roe v. Wade created in the first place. (Although I believe the legislature has the power to do this, I believe that it would be more proper and practical for a change in abortion to occur at the grassroots level. That change will not occur by promoting ""choice"" and ""reproductive freedom"").

I do not believe a woman should become a mother until she makes a conscious decision to do so to the best of her ability. I do not think that anyone should be forced into lifelong repercussions of a simple act through the opinions of some politician.
As Mizmax said, this is not neccessary in order to make a choice. I do not need to see pictures of cat's dead baby inside her to know that unless it is removed, she will die from toxic shock. A CF patient does not need to see pictures of his lungs to know they are full of fluid, and does not need to go to school on the subject in order to decide to sign a DNR.
That is a silly idea brought about by people who think that women who have abortions are ignorant that they are carrying a child- or what that child looks like. It is not neccessary, but if a woman wants an untrasound, she can have one. Some people do not feel it neccessary to see some irrelvant visual image in order to make decisions. 
I certainly think that the family and medical professionals involved in that case is more qualified than some senator.
i am not talking about productivity- this child in question will not begin to benefit society for many years, if in fact he/she ever does.
Mr. Reeve's mind is fully cognizant- and he is fully capable of making that decision for himself. If he were not capable, the power would rest in the hands of his family, I should hope.
Yes, I am. Just like I trust my family to make this decision should I be horribly injured in some way. i trust my family to make decisions about whether or not I will go on life support, whether I will be a donor, etc. Hopefully they will remember my wishes when we discussed these matters, but in that event, the choice will be theirs. In the case of abortion, it is impossible to make this decision, similar to a person who has not discussed these matters with their family, and they are left to make the decision based upon their own criteria.
trusting some politician may not be so wise either, after all, it is a decison made in the midst of political pressure, irrelevant ""moral"" standards, and even more irrelevant religious beleifs. 
people often have to make choices in a difficult time. This may be unfortunate, but on the other hand, sometimes heartache reveals its own insight.
Humanity and morality are in the eye of the beholder, first of all, and I do not want any politician weighing in with his own standards (which very likely differ from my own)
abortion is not detrimental except maybe to the woman involved, it has no effect upon society as a whole.
Interpretation of the law is the sole power of the judicial system. It is the responsibility of the legislature to word their laws in such a way that does not allow for ""wrong interpretations"" and I'm sorry, but I will trust the Supreme Court, with their years and years invested into legal experience to make those calls, not you.
that is your opinion- you are welcome to it, no matter how much I may disagree.
Boy, ""pro-life"" advocates sure are fond of powerful words. tyranny, dictatorship, genocide, murder, morality....
people use these words like a copywriter, trying to inspire people to buy their line. I'm sorry, but I do own a dictionary, and a fairly good grasp of vocabulary, and the subtle connotations attached to using powerful words. Unfortunately, you don't get to redefine words as you like. Tyranny is actually better equated with the revocation of choice.
Even if the mother dies instead? Even if that child is destined to a life of suffering? Even if the mother is destined for a life of poverty, distress, and substance abuse? Even if medical technology has no way to save that child from suffering? Even if it will die much more painfully and much more aware very soon anyway? Even if your goverment has decided otherwise? Do you somehow think that you are better equipped with making a decision for me? Do you have enough faith in the system to ensure that that child does not endure undue hardhips?

What good is she to her child though if she is dead? In almost any emergency situation involving an adult and a child if the adult does not protect themselves first both will die.

I think that is debatable. I think it has a detrimental effect on the child involved. It also very strongly affects society--it promotes a view that lessens the value of life. This can permeate into society in many different forms. It also decreases the number of births. Almost all countries in the west are suffering due to that. We are aging and no one will be here to care for us.
Well, I'm not a lawyer so I would have to yield. But there are many lawyers and judges out there that can and do argue the position I presented using their many years of legal experience.

Sure. emoticonXRolleyes You just want them to make an ""informed"" decision. It doesn't matter what the information is, or whether it's accurate or necessary, so long as it might convince them not to have an abortion.
How do you know that not having the baby isn't the only solution to their problems? How to you propose the ensure that every pregnant woman has access to support? You can't. So don't lie to people. Sometimes people have no other option but to terminate the pregnancy, and kill the fetus. Unless you're offering to support each pregnant woman personally, you have no place telling women what their options are.
It wasn't an analogy, it was an example of a situation where, despite how selfish it might seem to you or other uninformed outsiders, the mother needs to care for herself first or else there will be noone to care for the child. This is not an analogy for abortion, this is a basic reality of child-rearing. People have a wierd concept of motherhood that you are supposed to give absolutely everything you have to the effort, no matter what, and if you don't you're a ""bad mother"". If you take care of yourself at all, you're a ""bad mother"". The truth is, if you don't take care of yourself first you will be a much worse mother, because you will be unable to care for anyone else, including your child.
Spare me. In the future I suggest that for the sake of debate you try to use assertions that you can back up, not fallacious arguments like that. 
As I said before, I don't think China and India have as serious a population problem as rich countries. I don't believe in government restrictions on birth in the sense of state-imposed laws. However, in the case of India is that a law or a social convention? I think that people of concience in the G8 nations should limit their reproduction to at most one child. There are so many unwanted children around already who have no homes.

Birth control should be used, but sometimes it fails- or the woman fails to follow directions. i don't think a woman should be sentenced to becoming a mother if she makes one mistake. Sentencing a woman to spending the rest of her life attached to a child she does not want is cruel, both to her and in many cases, to the child. And of course there are those troublesome cases of rape and incest- should a woman be sentenced to a punishment for the crime she was a victim to?
You may be the most calm and composed person under pressure, and you may not be swayed by what people who understand sexuality call ""the heat of the moment"" but not all people are like that. Having sex is something that takes, under the best circumstances, a few hours at the most, and it should not be punishable with a minimum sentence of 18 years. I'm very happy for you that you never do something you regret later, that you always fully consider every possible outcome of every possible situation, but not all of us are so lucky.
No, politicians do not cause pregnancy. But they are trying to control every other aspect of a sexual relationship, down to the legal definition of said relationship.

yes, seeing a visual image of a fetus a woman has decided to terminate is irrelevant to the procedure, and to the decision itself. Showing this picture to the woman would be similar to showing pictures of every single person who died to the pilot who participated in a bombing mission. Or better yet, showing them to the commanding officer, or to the president himself. At some point someone decided that these people had to die in order to achive whatever goal they wanted. Should they be tortured with the images of the unfortunate victims of their decisons? Decisions that were made ideally with their own best interests in mind?
it promotes a view, that in your opinion lessens the value of life. My opinion, on the otherhand, is that it may promote the value of life in deeper ways.
I do not think that we are suffering at all. There is a very healthy birthrate in this country. 
This next bit is officially the worst argument I have ever heard againt abortion.
If you are so upset about abortion because you think that the fetuses in question might grow up to wipe your drool, that sounds mighty self-involved. It is up to each person who decides that they do want to be a parent to instill in their children the kind of values that will make those kids care about the elderly. It is also (i believe) the responsibility of the government to make sure you have a dry chin, not to a 16 year old girl with enough on her mind.
So you are saying that is is okay to use rhetoric on this forum? and that you are doing so? thanks for justifying my opinion.
I don't think you should be able to determine what experiences a total stranger should have.
[quote]Do you think that the mother is revoking her child's choice?No- I don't. She is revoking his life. terminating it. She is preventing any choice to ever be made by that fetus. That fetus, by the way, will not be capable of any life-or-death decisions for many years to come anyway. 
Until you can prevent it with certainty, the mother gets to try. Of course, no mother can predict anything with any certainty.

of course we do... the key is try and prevent as much distress as possible
Funny how someone can sit comfortably in their chair in front of their nifty computer and pass judgement on someone else. Yes, she needs to get off drugs- but that's not the point, should a woman who is not capable or willing to do so before she got pregnant be forced to endure the shame and pain of delivering a addicted child with numerous health problems? A child that the sytem will automatically take and then have off no hope or help to? Should my tax dollars be taken to care for this poor sick child that has no chance of a ""normal life""?

No, I would rather see a world of good mothers but also a world where women realized that abortion won't be their ticket to happiness.
I'm not sure how the philosophy of the world got so twisted as to declare motherhood a ""sentence"" as if it was a crime. Sentencing the mother? What is the child sentenced to? Where is the fault of the child in rape and incest?
No punishment, just responsibility. Parents should be very active in talking to their children about sex and its results.
That may be another topic. But a politician's legislation on abortion has nothing to do with a sexual relationship. It has to do with protecting a child.
I did not state it as an argument against abortion. I stated it as an effect of abortion. Yeah, that's my real motive. I want someone to wipe my drool. That's why I spent all this time here. Watch out with those powerful words like drool.

For someone who does not want to be a mother, I'm sure it does seem that way. A woman who was raped should not have to be a mother if she was doing everything in her power not to be one. 
But the fact is, not all parents take such an active role, and I shouldn't have to point out that even the best parents see their kids do things they don't like, or don't support.

hmmmm. seems to me that if my own mother had not had seven kids, she might not have been considered poor. Its just simple math... less people means more to go around. You may think that more people means more people are paying taxes, that your twilight years will be more comfortable, but see, poor people don't pay much taxes. If my mom had had fewer dependants, she would have had to pay more taxes, therefore, more money from her income ends up buying you brunch specials at the senior center.
You obviously have never considered what a girl goes through when she gives birth to a drug-addicted child... I can assure you, she gets no parades.
, 
I'm saying that the medical professionals who are so overjoyed to deal with these cases on a regular basis, might not be too happy to deal with it at all. They may treat the woman with courtesy, but they won't be giving her any homeade baby blankets. And for the record, a drug addicted mother will never be responsible for her child. You and I as taxpayers will be. If drugs are detected during delivery- and they do test for them- that mother will have a long hard stuggle- also at our expense- to ever gain custody of her child. If she does not pursue custody, it is extremely likely that that sick child will never be adopted, and will spend their life in our wonderful federal and state establishments. Before any such child can be adopted, they have to sever all of the mother's rights, which is another costly court procedure.

If a person is not ready to get clean- they're not going to, not matter how much they might want or need to. Addicts will place their addiction far above any other concerns, including pregnancy. Why does the world need more of these tragic cases? Sure, there might just be a miracle... but they call it a miracle because it is so unlikely to happen. I'm sorry, but the idea of a life of agony in the hopes of a miracle seems kinda tragic to me. There are enough children who will land in the NICU, why not prevent more?
