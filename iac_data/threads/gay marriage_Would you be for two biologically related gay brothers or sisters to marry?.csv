And if you are FOR gay marriage between two biologically unrelated gay men/women and would be FOR a ban on marriage between two biologically related gay men/women,such as brothers/sister, aunts/nieces, etc... who are you to say anything about someone who wants a ban on gay marriage, like the proposed Constitutional Amendment.
BTW, if you have no problem with gay marriage between two biologically related gay people, then you are sick. 
As well, I hear all the time that what someone does in the privacy of their own homes is their business. Would you agree in the case of two biologically related gay men/women, such as two biologically related gay brothers/sisters who are at the age of consent?
I hope not.
Lets see how many who say that it is discriminatory to ban gay marriage as with the proposed Cons. Amend. will show themselves to be hypocrites by not being for gay marriage with two biologically related gay men/women such as brothers/sisters who are at age of consent....
Lets see how many are sick enough to be FOR marriage between two biologically related gay men/women, such as brothers/sisters, who are at age of consent.

3,Would you be for two biologically related gay brothers or sisters to marry?,gay marriage,attack,"Ya know, it is really funny how you use the bible as your weapon against gay marriage, but yet you are forgetting about the very beginning as the bible tells it.
""Adam and Eve"" were the only two homosapians on earth in the beginning, right? Are you with me so far? ""Adam And Eve's"" were instructed to go forth and multiply the earth. Who do you think Adam and Eve's sons multiplied with? Wouldn't it have to be their sisters? Or do you feel your ancestors multiplied with the dinosaurs? 
How about the story of Noah's ark? Noah's grandchildren had no one but the own cousins to breed with. 
The way I see it, you might want to be thanking your Creator that incest and poligamy existed in the old ""traditional"" days or your butt may not be here to breed your hate in the name of God.
As far as gay marriage leading to poligamy being legalized...that is the ""traditional way"" back in the old testiment. Many men had more than one wife. 
So if you want to use your bible as a weapon against gay marriage, and if you fear this all leading to incestial marriage or poligamy, what is going to be your weapon against stopping that? You won't be able to use your bible as your weapon because incest and poligamy stories far out number your arguments against them.
I would say you better get to finding a new weapon if this is your fear. 
Tell me, how does it feel to fear the future so much? Your insides must be tormented and in a dis-ease on a constant basis beings you are not able to force your beliefs and ""morals"" on everyone. Did you know that dis-ease causes disease? 
Just to clarify my position a little better...who people fall in love with and marry, is not my business. (or yours, contrary to what you might think.)
Love is never wrong...God is love. Only people's false concept of what love really is, is the problem we face in this world.

8,Would you be for two biologically related gay brothers or sisters to marry?,gay marriage,attack,"I will indeed.
I approve of any sexual act between adults providing it is will the full consent of all involved parties, and has no adverse affect on others. Quite what people do to each other behind close doors is their own business.
I further support the rights of people (note I said people, not two people) in a consenting, loving relationship to have the support of the government in providing full marital (or whatever you want to call it) support.
Marriage is no longer about God, it is about creating a stable and supportive relationship between people.
There, I think that shows my exact stance on the matter.
And like I say, in every other instance God explicitly spells out his disapproval of human actions (yes including homosexuality). He does not here, therefore it is implied he approves. In the context of the chapter it is seen that the daughters did the right thing in allowing their lineage to be preserved. Further, as angel points out, why would he have made only two original humans, therefore creating the necessity for incest from the outset?

Cousins are 25% related by genetics. Based on your statement, would I be right in assuming you would not consider sex with someone that was related by 24% genetics as incest?
I am trying to get a handle on what you consider incest and why you consider incest a sin. Is it the act of having sex with someone that is too closely genetically related or is it the acceptance of the act. In other words if someone married an adopted sibling that they did not know was their sibling, would having sex with that person be incest before they found out or after they found out or both.

40,Would you be for two biologically related gay brothers or sisters to marry?,gay marriage,attack,"Saying that homosexuality is abnormal is a subjective argument. Saying that it is a mental disorder that can be cured is a fallicy. Look at the DSMIV, there is no listing of homosexuality as a mental disorder. And comparing it to depression, alcoholism, and pedophilia is a rediculous connection. 
Depression is a mental disorder, one that often has underlying physiological origins..ie...imbalances of neurotransmitters. This can hardly be helped by the individual, and often can be treated and controlled, but not cured. 
Alcoholism is a disease, one that has strong genetic links. The addiction associated with alcoholism is both psychological and physiological. Alcoholism has also been associated with imbalances of neurotransmitters. Again, alcoholics cannot be cured, they can only be treated. You will never find a cured alcoholic, only a recovering one. Ask anyone who is a member of AA if they are an alcoholic or a former alcoholic. 
Pedophilia is a criminal act, unlike the rest of the list. Saying that pedophilia is a mental disorder is technically correct. It is listed in the DSMIV under the category of Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders. It is important to note however that most pedophiles are often diagnosed with other disorders, such as personality disorders...etc. Again, you will find few that would agree that this can be cured, only controlled through medication or behavior modification therapy. 
Homosexuality is a lifestyle, not an abnormal disorder or mental disease that can be cured. Where is your objection to homosexuality based, in your views, observations, and knowledge of human psychology or in your religious views? Saying that homosexuality is not human nature could not be farther from the truth...what do you think human nature is? Do you think gay people are ""recruited and brainwashed"" into the homosexual lifestyle? All of the things you listed are human nature. Human nature does not only include that which is considered good and morally acceptable by society, or the church. Human nature is behavior observed in humans. Being black is not human nature...it is genetic. Having 2 black parents makes you black. And being Jewish is not human nature...it is a religious affiliation that is learned. If being Jewish was human nature, people would be born with Jewish tendencies and ideals. Would you say that you were born Orthodox or raised Orthodox? If you were born and raised in a completely neutral religious environment where religion is not taught and information is not available on religion, would you still be Orthodox?

A person with a gay identical twin is at least 10 times more likely to be gay than a person without one. 
There is about a 2% chance that a firstborn male will grow up gay. That chance grows to at least 6% for males with four or more older brothers. 
Gay men and lesbians are more likely to be left-handed. 
Gay men have smaller hypothalamuses than straight men. 
A man is more likely to be gay if there are gay men on his mother's side of the family. 
Lesbians' inner ears tend to react to sounds more like men's inner ears than like straight women's. 
Gay men have more testosterone and larger genitalia than straight men."" 
--and this from Behavior Genetics:
Multivariate structural equation modeling techniques have been applied to examine the causes of individual differences in responses to several items concerning sexual orientation. To minimize potential ascertainment and response biases, the study sample involved a large (N = 4901) community-based cohort of Australian twins aged 18–52 who answered an anonymous questionnaire on sexual behavior and attitudes. The statistical power of the analysis was increased by the availability of multiple measures of sexual orientation (behaviors, attitudes and feelings), providing stronger evidence for the existence of additive genetic influences on this phenotype than in a previous analysis (Bailey et al., 2000). Estimates of the heritability of homosexuality in this sample ranged between 50 and 60% in females but were significantly lower (heritability of approximately 30%) in males.

it is beyond me that people take my point to mean that I am against gays, or that I think homosexuality is wrong, or anything like that. people make choices, and it is up to them to live with their choices. no matter what choice anyone makes, the consequences of that choice is theirs to bear, whether you consider them 'good' or 'bad' to me is really a question of perception, which is also based on choice
the statement ""people are not born gay"" does not condemn people for being gay. it simply brings to light a common misconception that society has been spreading for the past few years. and the statement itself, being a factual statement, is always open for verificatin to see whether it is true or not. it is not an opinion statement, and if it can be proven that people are born gay, then I would gladly retract it

Q: If a person with female outward appearance that has XY chromosomes, has sex with another female, is she/he a homosexual? 
I think the person is a male, possibly a transvestite or a man that took a sex-change operation. the outward appearance would be female, but the genetic composition would be the same as before. and no, technically that person is not a homosexual (although they would fall under the biblical category of ""sexual pervert"")
Q: How do you think the gender of a person should be determined?
The traditional way: see if they got testicles. if that fails, then the chromosomes, if possible.
Of course it can be argued that if someone is born with a peculiar gender, and they dont have sex with someone of their gender then they are really not homosexual. probably if all else fails use the chromosome method. there's no ambiguity in that",55,56,topic_stance_votes_2

But I don’t believe I have ever talked to another male that has said they could be attracted to a male if they tried except for a homosexual.
Then you are very uninformed. About one of every two thousand children in America are born with some kind of indefinite sexual characteristics. There is a point in fetal development when the sex organs of the child are determined by a shot of testosterone. If a child gets that hormone, they develop an external sex organ or penis, if not then they develop an internal sex organ or a clitoris. This is regardless of whether they have the XY male chromosome or the XX female chromosome. Of course if every thing goes according to plan, the fetus with the XY chromosome will get the shot of testosterone. However is a child with XY chromosomes does not get the shot of testosterone, then they develop female sex organs even though they have the male XY chromosomes. And the amount of testosterone can vary greatly, causing mixed sexual organs or underdeveloped sex organs.
I don’t understand how that was responsive to my question. But let me ask it a different way. What gender do you think a child should have when they have both sex organs.
Again you are uninformed. A person can have XO, XXY, XX/XY and other combinations. So there is a lot of guesswork. 
So with that information which you can look up for yourself if you don’t believe me, I will ask the question again.
If someone that has female sexual organs but XY chromosomes and doesn’t know that, has sex with a male, then they are homosexuals?

I truly think the original post is confusing in the way it is posed...My points:
1)We cannot really compare homosexuality and incest - unless someone can prove me wrong (and I am willing to hear arguments here), incest is a matter of choice and behavior which most people consider to be immoral. Homosexuality is not a matter of choice and behavior. People do not choose to be gay.
2)It think it is misleading and faulty to try and mix issues of personal morality and the Constitution. The argument against the ban on gay marriages is over breaches of the Constitution. This isn't about personal views. It is about legal rights that are not being extened to all of the citizens of the United States that are afforded by the Consitution. The Consitution does not force you, or me, to approve of anything - only to respect the rights of those who are protected under it. The real question, then, is what right does anyone have to deny Constituational rights based on a sense of personal morality and NOT the reverse as stated at the end of the original post.
3)If the Constitution protects those who engage in incest, and if those who do engage in incest are being denied any rights afforded them by the Constitution by unconstituational laws, then I would have to say that I support a shift for those rights to be extended. Does this mean that I personally approve of incest? No it does not. 
We live an a country that respects a variety of people while allowing use to hold to our own personal views and beliefs. What is this thing with the human will to power to try and make everyone think the same way?

Promoted? Interesting alignment there. As if gays are trying to broaden the scope of their lifestyle in numbers? None of the gay people I know are out to change heteros into gays (and none think that is somehow possible to begin with). People don't buy into a gay lifestyle or get talked into it.
