================================================== ========
Let's hear it for Costco!! (This is just mind boggling!) Make sure you 
read all the way past the list of the drugs. The woman that signed 
below is a Budget Analyst out of federal 
Washington, DC offices. 
Did you ever wonder how much it costs a drug company for the active 
ingredient in prescription medications? Some people think it must cost 
a lot, since many drugs sell for more than $2.00 per tablet. We did a 
search of offshore chemical synthesizers that supply the active 
ingredients found in drugs approved by the FDA. As we have revealed in 
past issues of Life Extension, a significant percentage of drugs sold 
in the United 
States contain active ingredients made in other countries. In our 
independent investigation of how much profit drug companies really 
make, 
we obtained the actual price of active ingredients used in some of the 
most popular drugs sold in America. 
The data below speaks for itself.

Since the cost of prescription drugs is so outrageous, I thought 
everyone should know about this. Please read the following and pass it 
on. 
It pays to shop around. This helps to solve the mystery as to why they 
can afford to put a Walgreen's on every corner. On Monday night, 
Steve Wilson, an investigative reporter for Channel 7 News in Detroit, 
did a story on generic drug price gouging by pharmacies. He found in 
his investigation, that some of these generic drugs were marked up as 
much as 3,000% or more. Yes, that's not a typo.....three thousand 
percent! So often, we blame the drug companies for the high cost of 
drugs, and usually rightfully so. But in this case, the fault clearly 
lies with the pharmacies themselves. For example, if you had to buy a 
prescription drug, and bought the name brand, you might pay $100 for 
100 pills. 
The pharmacist might tell you that if you get the generic equivalent, 
they would only cost $80, making you think you are ""saving"" $20. What 
the pharmacist is not telling you is that those 100 generic pills may 
have only cost him $10! 
At the end of the report, one of the anchors asked Mr. Wilson whether 
or not there were any pharmacies that did not adhere to this practice, 
and he said that Costco consistently charged little over their cost 
for the generic drugs. 
I went to the Costco site, where you can look up any drug, and get its 
online price. It says that the in-store prices are consistent with the 
online prices. I was appalled. Just to give you one example from my own 
experience, I had to use the drug, Compazine, which helps prevent 
nausea in chemo patients. 
I used the generic equivalent, which cost $54.99 for 
60 pills at CVS. I checked the price at Costco, and I could have bought 
100 pills for $19.89. For 145 of my pain pills, I paid $72.57. I could 
have got 150 at Costco for $28.08. 
I would like to mention, that although Costco is a ""membership"" type 
store, you do NOT have to be a member to buy prescriptions there, as it 
is a federally regulated substance. You just tell them at the door that 
you wish to use the pharmacy, and they will let you in. (this is true) 
I went there this past Thursday and asked them. I am asking each of 
you to please help me by copying this letter, and passing it into your 
own e-mail, and send it to everyone you know with an e-mail address.

1,If you think the illegal drugs are expensive...,marijuana legalization,support,"How nice of her not to mention the billions of dollars it costs to develop the drugs...
Or does she think that the pharmaceutical companies copy the recipies out of the the big dope cookbook?
It's about as stupid as saying that Windows XP is too expensive since cd's only cost a dollar a piece.",1,2,topic_stance_votes_2
2,If you think the illegal drugs are expensive...,marijuana legalization,support,"But isn't the point with generic drugs that someone else paid the development costs. The article appears to be about pharmacies marking up low cost generic drugs, rather than complaining about brand-name drugs that are priced high at wholesale level.",2,3,topic_stance_votes_2
3,If you think the illegal drugs are expensive...,marijuana legalization,support,"No offense to Jim, as I have a lot of respect for him, but this post sounded less like an informative article, but an advertisement for Costco. People have many misconceptions about the cost of drugs. Most people have little idea if where the real costs come from. Here is a general idea, at least from the US point of view.
1. Active ingredient (as shown in Jim's post)
2. Inactive ingredients (fillers, binders, and other materials needed to contain and deliver the active ingredient)
3. Cost of deveploment of the drug, which generally involves years of research, testing, and analysis even before FDA approval is given.
4. Marketing (TV, radio, magazine, etc...not to mention the drug reps, who wine and dine doctors and other health care workers to the tune of BILLIONS a year just to have the doctors use their product)
5. Cost of production (workers who actually make the drugs, who happen to be payed well because it is a dangerous job, and all other workers associated with the drug company, ie janitors, paramedics / EMTS, firefighters (many drug manufacturing plants have their own fire depts), office staff, etc).
6. Cost to ship the drug to your town and pharmacy.
7. Cost added by the pharmacy, including the charge for the pharmacist (who makes a lot of money).
These are only a few of the more obvious costs associated with the cost of the pills that one can get at the pharmacy.",3,4,topic_stance_votes_2

A lot of people are eligible for this type of program, they just have to find out about it. By the way, the drug was called Sensipar and is used to treat elevated parathyroid horomone levels. This is a brand new drug, not a generic, and I was able to get it completely free of charge.",5,6,topic_stance_votes_2
