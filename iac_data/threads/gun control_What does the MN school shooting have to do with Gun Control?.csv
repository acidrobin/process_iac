1,What does the MN school shooting have to do with Gun Control?,gun control,support,"It's a handy platform for those who have already decided where they stand on the issue to cross swords over the corpses of innocent kids.
Those who support gun control will agitate for more restrictions on availability of guns.
Those who interpret the second ammendment as an obligation will argue that more guns will solve the problem.
Those who see it as an issue in itself,with the firearms as a secondary factor will be ignored or belittled by the other two groups.
What makes a kid so angry that he becomes withdrawn and Gothic,has violent fantasies,and finally snaps?Why does nobody see the warning signals and do something about it,and what happens in the unreported cases where the kid can't lay hands on a loaded gun at the critical moment?Do they seethe internally until they get the opportunity, do they throw themselves into a fist-fight, or do they melt away into the basement with a length of rope and hang themselves?
Serial killings like this should throw up questions, and responsible people should be looking for the best answers.Unfortunately,for every person who genuinely gives a damn, there's a dozen or more who see it as an opportunity to promote existing solutions that have been tried and not solved the problem.",1,2,topic_stance_votes_2

9,What does the MN school shooting have to do with Gun Control?,gun control,support,"Well said. The truth of the matter is society's desire to hang blame on obvious contributing circumstances rather than attributing anything to developments leading up to and cumulating in that circumstance. Take away guns, knifes, etc. and something will be used, perhaps a deadly spray poison with components and mixing instructions available on the Internet.

14,What does the MN school shooting have to do with Gun Control?,gun control,support,"We grew up with my father's guns and ammo in the same place. Common sense, derived by parental direction from an early age, made us very aware of the purpose of guns and their potential danger. I can't imagine a kid from my era who would have dreamed of 'borrowing', using or playing with firearms unless receiving specific permission from a parent.
How would that recognition and acceptance of established parameters at such early ages be reconciled with todays society? There are two primary contemporary considerations, adolescent children who 'find' guns in a household, injuring/killing themselves or a playmate, and teens who take guns with the intent to damage/kill other teens. 
While the first could be eliminated by closer parental supervision or just locking up guns, admitting failure of ability to instill values, what of those teens with demons stalking their minds who would find a weapon even if household guns were not available? What's the root of that problem?",13,15,topic_stance_votes_2
15,What does the MN school shooting have to do with Gun Control?,gun control,support,"Ditto that here, George.
Where I live, it is not at all unusual during deer season to see high school kids driving around with high powered rifles in hanging in the rear window of their pickup. suring bird season, a shotgun takes that place. I assume that they have ammo in there somewhere (guns are so much more effective with matching ammo). It is not even unusual to see pickups parked in the local high school parking lot with a weapon in the rack (yes, we know, gun free school zones....we just have more common sense than to enforce such foolish laws). 
We have yet to have a massacre at one of our local high schools. Is this because I live in a farming community, where family values are more than just a political buzzword, and you are free do dicipline your children, within reason, without having to fear that SRS will show up, arrest you, and take them away? I don't know.
I know we must be doing something right, because despite the fact that we have one of the highest rates of gun ownership per capita of any state in the union, we also have an extremely low rate of violent crime. Despite the fact that 12 yrs seems to be the preferred age around here for giving your son his first rifle, we have yet to host a school shooting.",15,16,topic_stance_votes_2

18,What does the MN school shooting have to do with Gun Control?,gun control,support,"My wife grew up in an anti-gun liberal house, so my concession to her was the separation of guns and ammo. When I was growing up, I kept my own ammo and guns in my bedroom from age 10 or 11 on up. My father taught me how to shoot at age 7 or 8 and we would occasionally make a trip to the local rifle range before I was old enough to legally hunt with a juvenile permit.
In NJ, at age 14,IIRC, you could get an adult hunting license and hunt by yourself. I used to come home from school, grab my gun and walk to the swamp to hunt ducks. When I was done, I stopped at our local grocery store, gun in hand, and picked up some snacks for the long walk back home.
Try that today in NJ. emoticonXWow",15,19,topic_stance_votes_2
19,What does the MN school shooting have to do with Gun Control?,gun control,support,Sorry to get to this late. What does it mean? It means that more has to be done to help the teens in trouble.

I did nothing wrong nor did millions of other gun owners in this matter. We bear 0% of the responsibility. We bear 0% of the guilt. We are not the problem. There is no such thing as shared responsibility or guilt in this matter. There is no legal or political doctrine that makes me or millions of other gun owners bear any responsibility in this matter. Yet the anti-gunners DO blame me and gun onwers. Some how they have connected some legal and political dots that do blame me and other gun owners. Legal and political dots that I would like to point out our democracy does not handle. There are political and legal systems that do make shared guilt and responsibility possible. It is not ours.

29,What does the MN school shooting have to do with Gun Control?,gun control,support,"I don't know about other states, but in Oregon one has to be 21 years of age to buy a sidearm or long arm. They must be over 18 to own a sidearm, but a parent may purchase a weapon for them. There are no age restrictions on long arm ownership. That provides legal ownership or possession of a long arm at post-birth age. The age for a hunting license here is 14. Some states have it as low as 11 years of age. Michigan is also a hunting oriented state and I'd think laws would be similar. 
Because a grandfather didn't lock his weapons away from his grandson, IMO the kid was just a looneytoon who would have secured whatever he felt he needed regardless of what that took.

In my state, I think 18 is the age to OWN a gun.[ 21 for a pistol - and you need the course & a permit] But to learn to shoot? If the parent is a hunter, most of the families I know take the kids out at 12-14. I know a kid cannot own a gun until later, but they can go out on a hunt with a licensed hunter. One friend took his son down south for some kind of deer we don't have here. Another went to Alaska for bear. Another is teaching his 12 year old how to handle a gun properly for whitetail, come next season.
