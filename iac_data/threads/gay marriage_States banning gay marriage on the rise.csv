Even California is working on it.
The number of states that have laws that ban it is 33. (Maybe more now; that number was from early 2004)
I think gay 'rights' lobbyists would do well to start realizing that marriage really matters a lot to the majority of people in this country, and to realize that they are treading on an institution that is traditionally and fundamentally opposite-sex by nature and definition. The number of states not allowing gay marriage is on the rise dramatically, since gay activists began pushing things so strongly in the last few years.

1,States banning gay marriage on the rise,gay marriage,attack,"No, that's a myth. The less gay rights activists push for complete equality, the less they are going to get. People do justify banning civil unions as well as marriage because ""gays deserve it for pushing so hard toward marriage"". Of course, that logic is horrible, for people do not deserve to be punished because they've asked for equal rights. But regardless, if gay rights activists asked for only civil unions, then people would feel just as obligated to suggest a compromise between civil unions and no unions, then they would feel obligated in banning that too, because gay people shouldn't have been pushing for civil unions.

Michele Bachmann, R-Stillwater. Battle is an African American who grew up in segregated Mississippi. He also led a committee that chose the street that runs in front of the Capitol to be renamed after King. Battle is convinced that if Martin Luther King were alive today, he would support a ban on gay marriage.
""Because he was 100 percent family. He knew that family was the thing that makes this country a great country,"" says Battle. ""And then because of slavery, we as black folks were separated so much on purpose to keep us from growing into a family.""

51,States banning gay marriage on the rise,gay marriage,attack,"If the concept of 'harm' is to decide whether or not gay people should be allowed to redefine the institution of marriage, then gay rights groups have little to stand on. The most that can be said is that one group has less benefits than the other. (Of course that requires the premise that both are legitimate groups when it comes to marriage.) Even if we do take the premise that both groups qualify as legitimate criteria for marriage, we can only go so far as to say that one of those groups is getting less benefits than the other--hardly as example of ""harm."" Civil rights themselves were not decided upon by the concept of harm, but rather equality. ""Harm"" is an issue that comes into play with criminal issues. To accuse the govt. of harming someone requires evidence and proof. Ultimately it was not the issue of 'harm' that brought about civil rights for blacks. It was rather that enough people in the country realized it was the right thing to do. Amendments don't pass in a vacuum or by the judiciary, and an amendment was what guaranteed equality to black people. Regardless of what one's view is of what the founding fathers of our country intended, we can assume based on history that simply claiming ""I'm being harmed"" is not going to be enough to change the law of the land to allow same-sex marriage. Not only must that harm be proven with evidence, true legal acceptance can only happen with enough people changing their minds about it. Further complicating the issue is that for many Americans, the concept of ""legal marriage"" is tied to marriage itself to the point changing the legal criteria too much requires changing the definition of the institution of marriage. Gay rights people, you have quite a task ahead, convincing America to redefine the institution of marriage.",51,52,topic_stance_votes_2
52,States banning gay marriage on the rise,gay marriage,attack,"Remember, Jyoshu, that it does not matter whether or not gay people are being harmed. It is enough to show that legalizing same-sex marriage is not harmful to indicate that it should be allowed. In a free society, the government does not deny rights or benefits to its people without a good reason; it does not deny those rights and benefits unless they are harmful. It is not the place of government to interfere in the lives of its people, to promote one lifestyle over another. The mere fact that same-sex marriage is not harmful is enough to make it morally evil to deny it.
That being said, it is even more justification to legalize same-sex marriage in that it is helpful. Same-sex couples and their children would be helped dramatically. The spread of STD's would be curbed. Equality and freedom would be promoted. So not only is same-sex marriage not harmful, it is beneficial.
Furthermore, same-sex couples can be considered harmed without same-sex marriage. This is because benefiting one group of people is no different from punishing another. Each benefit of opposite-sex marriage is paid for through tax money; it isn't just the tax money of opposite-sex couples who pay for this, it is the tax money of same-sex couples too. We are forcing same-sex couples to pay for the marriages of opposite-sex couples, and no one is paying for theirs. This is indeed a harm. Discouraging freedom and denying equality are also harms in themselves.
Beyond this, denying same-sex marriage provides no benefits.
So overall, I state that denying same-sex marriage brings benefits, but it brings harm to same-sex couples, freedom, and equality. Allowing same-sex marriage benefits same-sex couples and harms no one. This is why the choice on this issue is so overwhelmingly clear in my mind.
Regarding slavery, people did eventually realize it is the right thing to do, but why did they realize it? Was it because the Bible stated that slavery is wrong? Certainly the Bible does not state that. It was because they realized that slavery is harmful to the slaves.",52,53,topic_stance_votes_1

Many more people felt interracial marriage was ""immoral"" at the time of Loving v.

54,States banning gay marriage on the rise,gay marriage,attack,"Then why are you arguing for same-sex marriage on the basis of being ""harmed"" by the govt.?
Ah, there's the catch now, isn't it: ""a good reason."" And I suspect you will never be convinced there is any good reason to deny it, because you've made up your mind beforehand.
We've been over this before, but the govt. denies benefits to people all the time regardless of whether or not those who receive them or don't receive them are harmful. Affirmative action, disability, medicare, and social security are ALL examples of this. For me anyway, this is not an issue of whether you should have couples' benefits--if you need them then you should have them. But not by recognizing gay unions as marriage, any more than recognizing a 25 year old as criteria to receive social security, or a healthy non-disabled person criteria for disability. Can you say that 25 year-olds are harmful to society? No, so why deny them money they might need (in some cases they might need it MORE than senior citizens!) You see, the govt. rarely EVER uses the issue of harm to determine this sort of thing. It's easy to throw out the word 'harm' as if our constitution always requires that to be the determining factor, but it's just not the case. Sure, if you need couples' benefits, let's find a way to make that happen. But let's not redefine marriage to do it.
And if the people decide it's wrong to not redefine the institution of marriage, so be it. (I won't agree with them, but as an American I'd still be here and pay my taxes.) But at least I'd know that the people did indeed do this, as they did in cases of civil rights.",53,55,topic_stance_votes_2

58,States banning gay marriage on the rise,gay marriage,attack,"I argue both because both are valid points that add to my cause. Not everyone agrees that we should allow anything that isn't harmful; not everyone believes in freedom.
A good reason is one that is logically sound. Even your later arguments about social security say, ""Well, we do it with social security, so why can't we do it with same-sex marriage"". That is a logical fallacy for there is no reason to believe that we distribute social security equally, but more importantly, we obviously do it with social security for a reason, and that reason simply does not apply to same-sex marriage. I've made up my mind because I've heard the arguments.
You're right. Every time I post this, I agree that the government is denying people benefits, but I never said it was wrong to deny people benefits in every case; I said it is wrong to deny people benefits if no harm comes from doing so. So let us examine why it is wrong for the government to allow everyone to everyone to get the benefits you mentioned. The government believes that blacks, the eldery, the disabled, and the poor all experience additional suffering and hardship in life. They are at a lower ability to succeed, and because of this, they need additional help. To compensate the hardships of these people, the government takes benefits from everyone else and gives them to the people who really need them. The suffering of people in this case is a harm; it's the greatest harm. The ideas of freedom and equality exist for the sole purpose of promoting the happiness of the people.
So what would happen if we gave everyone those rights? If we gave everyone medicare, taxes would increase, and everyone would have to pay additional money to fund medicare. This would negate the benefit intended to offset the hardships of being poor. What if we allowed everyone to park in the handicap spot? Again, anyone could park anywhere, and we would have negated the benefit intended to help handicap people. When we implement a benefit for some people, we do so to offset the hardship experienced by those people. Allowing more people to have those benefits recreates the harm that they were originally intented to protect against.
But opposite-sex couples do not experience any harm or hardship or suffering greater than same-sex couples. Because of this, the claim cannot be made that these benefits are intended to offset the hardship of opposite-sex couples. They experience no additional hardship. Denying same-sex marriage perpetuates a system in which two groups of equal need recieve different benefits for the sole purpose of imposing the majority's religious values upon the minority. Both groups deserve exactly the same benefits.
See, I think you understand the point I've made above to some extent because you are agreeing that same-sex couples deserve the same benefits as opposite-sex couples. I think you understand that two groups with the same needs should have the same benefits to compensate those needs or we are not equal.
I would love to get 25 year olds benefits, but they simply don't have the same hardships and the same needs of a different group, so denying them benefits does not prevent a harm. In the case of marriage, both groups have precisely the same needs. I would say that even though Congress never specifically states the reason they pass a bill in terms of harms and benefits, the reason for most of our laws cannot be understood except in light of harms and benefits. And those laws which are morally good are those which exist to discourage harm or increase benefits.
But the people didn't usually just decide to grant equal civil rights in the past, in most cases. They did most directly in the case of women's sufferage. This is no surprise; women comprise half of our population. But smaller groups have less influence, and only the minority supported freeing the slaves when they were emancipated. Lincoln hadn't even had intentions of doing so except that he had to as part of the war effort. Segregation was struck down by the Supreme Court. In these fundamental cases, the people never decided to allow freedom or equality, they only learned it many years after it was forced upon them, and some are still learning it today.",55,59,topic_stance_votes_1

62,States banning gay marriage on the rise,gay marriage,attack,"On this, I have to disagree. In my opinion (and I think history bears it out), every case where a group obtained civil rights it was because a large part of the nation changed it's view and felt it was the right thing to do. In the case of women's suffrage, you are correct that this happened, and it happened pretty quickly. In the case of black people, it happened as well, but over a long period of time as people eventually realized that slavery was wrong, the abolition movement came about, the Emancipation Proclamation, the civil war that freed them, the further civil rights movement of the 20th century, the 14th amendment and the end of segregation. This was a process, but it came about by peoples' views changing throughout the nation. Rest assured, if segregation had come up 50 years earlier before the supreme court, they wouldn't have even heard the case.

Not in Kansas, but most likely in California or New England.
