One requires an ultrasound prior to abortion.
Another protects pharmacists if they refuse to fill prescriptions for drugs that end pregnancies.
The third allows prosecutors to charge people with causing the death of a fetus, REGARDLESS OF THE STAGE OF PREGNANCY.

6,Three cheers from the anti crowd!,abortion,support,"The second one I don't know where I stand on, I can understand the reasoning as I'm pretty sure that there isn't a set list of drugs a pharmacy must carry, if there were (basic antibiotics, contraception, asthma medication and possibly anti nausea stuff - stuff that is needed everyday and urgently) I would assume that the government would be providing them. Makes sense from a NHS point of view, but without nationalised health care it does seem a bit odd.
The first I think is there for the 'ooh look at the baby!' aspect, tagged on as one of those 'good idea at the time' amendments. Unless of course it was standard practise for everyone with a means to alerted the parent if something has gone wrong with development, the rare cases where a heart or brain doesn't form and the death of the baby is unpreventable. Or as a way of ensuring that the fetus hasn' reached a certain stage of development - though then it would make sense just to have it over the period of weeks that this stage would fall under.
The third is probably to stop people getting abortions, and to clear up the occasionaly wierdness that happens when an injury causes a miscarriage but the other was going to abort - same sort of thing as having it still being illegal to shoot people as they comit suicide.",6,7,topic_stance_votes_2
