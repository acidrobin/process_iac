Evangelical Leaders Join Global Warming Initiative
 Among signers of the statement, which will be released in Washington on Wednesday, are the presidents of 39 evangelical colleges, leaders of aid groups and churches, like the Salvation Army, and pastors of megachurches, including Rick Warren, author of the best seller ""The Purpose-Driven Life.""
""For most of us, until recently this has not been treated as a pressing issue or major priority,"" the statement said. ""Indeed, many of us have required considerable convincing before becoming persuaded that climate change is a real problem and that it ought to matter to us as Christians. But now we have seen and heard enough.""
The statement calls for federal legislation that would require reductions in carbon dioxide emissions through ""cost-effective, market-based mechanisms"" â€” a phrase lifted from a Senate resolution last year and one that could appeal to evangelicals, who tend to be pro-business. The statement, to be announced in Washington, is only the first stage of an ""Evangelical Climate Initiative"" including television and radio spots in states with influential legislators, informational campaigns in churches, and educational events at Christian colleges.
