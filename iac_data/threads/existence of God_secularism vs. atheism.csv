Here is part of the Humanist manifesto 2, concerning religion;
http://www.jcn.com/manifestos.html
Are the sentences I highlighted above not basic, strong core beliefs of both secularists and atheists? I see nothing anywhere in the above paragraphs that would distinguish a secularist from an atheist. Is there anything in the above paragraphs that would constitute an unreconcilable difference between the two?
Also from dictionary.com;
What are the differences between the ways a secularist and an atheist would see and interpret the world?",0,1,topic_stance_votes_2
1,secularism vs. atheism,existence of God,attack,"Secular is 'non-theistic'. In other words, it does not consider if there is a god or not. It just is not a matter for consideration.
Atheist is the lack of belief in any deity.",1,2,topic_stance_votes_1
2,secularism vs. atheism,existence of God,support,"Based on the definitions you gave, they're quite different. Atheism is a matter of personal belief, secularism is a matter of public policy.

3,secularism vs. atheism,existence of God,attack,"Mathematics is indifferent to theistic matters. Does that mean that mathematics is atheistic?
Quite obviously, no. Just as one can believe that two plus two equals four and that a deity exists, one can believe that two plus two equals four and that no deity exists. Therefore, math is secular (and not atheistic).
Keep in mind that there are a couple different ""flavors"" of atheism: strong and week. Strong atheism is the assertion that no god exists. (""I believe there is no god."") Weak atheism is the lack of belief in a god. (""I do not believe in any god."")
Also keep in mind that some Deists consider themselves humanists, as in mentioned in the manifesto.
Instead of answering the question, I'll ask a ""counter-question"" to try to illustrate the irrelevance of your question:
What are the differences between the ways that a secular mathematician, an atheistic mathematician, and a theistic mathematician would see and interpret numbers and math? If they all believe that 2+2=4, that the sum of the squares of the measures of the lengths of the two legs of any right triangle is equal to the square of the measure of the length of the hypotenuse, that the derivative of the natural log of x is the reciprocal of x, etc., does that mean that secularism, atheism, and theism are all the same?

4,secularism vs. atheism,existence of God,support,"They are different terms and apply to different things. Secularism is not a worldview in itself, it is a policy of how to apply religious and other worldview in real life.
Secularism does not exclude people with a religious worldview. One may imagine a devout christian that firmly believes in his faith, but is also convinced that faith must come from within and that forcing someone to behave in accordance with a religion simply encourages false faith, and would logically conclude that his faith should not be forced upon people (usually with the subclause of ""Let them burn in hell afterwards"", or something else along those lines).",4,5,topic_stance_votes_1

The Humanist Manifesto outlines it in a broad sense. It's main point seems to be that humans are the highest form of intelligence, concerning earth and all life on it. If atheists declare there is no god, and secularists don't give any thought to a god, what differences would there be on how knowledge is filtered, decisions are made, values are established, and priorities are set? 
Math is much more black & white than science is. In some science, the same evidence can lead to different conclusions. The worldview, the beginning presuppositions of the person studying the evidence, is often what determines the conclusion. 
A devoutly religious person would disagree with all the statements in the Humanist Manifesto that I highlighted. Would they believe that public policy should be based on things that they don't believe? 
A hypothetical - If a public policy was a vote on abortion, and the ""devoutly religious"" person voted no, and the atheist voted yes, would the secularist, or humanist, be a non vote, a neutral position?

17,secularism vs. atheism,existence of God,attack,"Symbiote already pointed out the important fact that atheism is the lack of a belief in mythology dieties like the christian ""God"". It has nothing to do with ""forcing"".
However, aside from that, your reasoning is still suspect.
Marc, first, you are ""forced"" every day to do things that coincide with reality, and it's only ethical that you SHOULD be. You are forced to pay enormous penalities if you violate certain laws, up to even being killed as a result. You are forced to go on green, and stop on red. Forced to drive the right way on the street. Forced to pay debt, etc. Laws and the associated penalities are generally formed by, and enforced by, secular government, employing non-theistic reasoning. Nonsense like religion simply has no place in a reasonable government (let freee people worship whatever they like, but it's NOT ethical to put it into government).
For instance, regarding your claim that atheism claims man is the highest form of intelligence. That's incorrect, again, atheism is ""without belief in mythological, nonsencial dieties and the like"".
HOWEVER, any sane person acknowledges the simple fact that there is NO EVIDENCE of ANY life in the universe that is more intelligent than human beings. If you have some, please share (with CNN and the scientific community). If not, then your claims are simply of no consequence...just like saying a red headed demon just told me to type this. There's no evidence for it, it's either : A lie. A delusion. A joke. Take your pick. If some bobble-headed alien shows up one day and runs circles around our intellect, great, we have a new winner, and we proceed with the new alien as the most intelligent...that is if we are reasonable. The unreasonable might still suggest that their fantasy diety is still #1. Fat lotta good that does anyone (it's meaningless).
-Mach",14,18,topic_stance_votes_1
18,secularism vs. atheism,existence of God,support,"Atheism is ""without belief in god"", by it's root words. NOT-theistic, simply the opposite of religious...NOT religious. Religious <-> not-Religious.
Saying ""there is no god"" simply isn't something a reasonable person, with a little time to think it through, would claim.
Secular seems to apply towards language, a body of rules, etc., and means, without religion. Every single person in a secular government may be theistic personally. Since rules or a government isn't a thinking person, it wouldn't make sense to call them atheistic or agnostic, which deals with belief or lack of.
Agnostics are necessarily atheists ,that is, if they do NOT belief in [any diety], then they are atheists by definition. If there reason is that we cannot know, or that they don't know, then they can grab another coin..with agnostic on it.
-Mach",17,19,topic_stance_votes_1
19,secularism vs. atheism,existence of God,attack,"Yes. I know of no one who agrees with all government policies, or all of the premesis that they're based on. But we do all agree (or at least almost all) that we need some method for forming those policies. Compromises must be made. A religious secularist could believe, for example, that if we allow religious beliefs to dictate policy than it's just a matter of time before general religious freedom is compromised for all but those who follow the religion of the ruling party. Rather than risk that they would think it an acceptable compromise to have some policies that they don't agree with, as long as they don't actively compromise their faith. 
It's not clear to me at all. They might think that the heart of the issue is whether a fetus is a person, and so be fine with 1st trimester abortions, but not 2nd or 3rd. Or they may decide that viability is the issue, and so be fine with abortions late into the 2nd trimester. Or they may think that the potential for life is enough to warrant protection, and so oppose all abortions. It's a complex enough issue that even if you remove ""God says"" from the debate, the answer isn't obvious.
The point here is that while a secularist believes that ""God says"" is inadeuqate justification for forming policy, it doesn't mean that those who say ""God says"" are necessarily wrong. The religious person says ""God commands that you do not steal."" The atheist and the secularist agree with the not stealing, just for different reasons.",13,20,topic_stance_votes_1

The material world is much like God for me. Belief in both is not proved by sense-data but is a way of making sense of it and imposing some level of order.

Why are their quotes in your post that quote things I didn't say? Not that I disagree with them but it looks like you forgot to edit the user part of the quote a couple of times :)",30,31,topic_stance_votes_1
31,secularism vs. atheism,existence of God,support,"It's only because the rabble rousers love to argue. Perhaps my language was strong, while it's common usage to say ""god does or does not exist"", I think push come to shove, the debate always ends up doing something similar to this:
1. Scientific investigation beings with observation of reality.
2. One cannot form a meaningful statement of existence without referring to some observation..i.e evidence.
So, in the god case, what was your definition of god? A supernatural being? Yes, by definition, supernatural beings cannot exist, saying there is no evidence for one, is like saying there is no evidence for something that cannot have evidence to support it is just talking in circles.
Accepting logical definitions of dieties with regards to reality, opens up discussion of proof, evidence, and all sorts of other things that simply are not reasonable, since before any of that can happen, we have to arrive at a definition that is consistent with reality. Such as, how can you prove there is no xyz? You can't, but you don't need to, we don't know what xyz is in this case.
Theists have a belief in one or more deites. We need the opposite, that's a-theist.
Have no belief in one or more dieties. And that makes sense, atheists may differ in why they don't have such a belief, but the root definitoin and important language is ""no belief"". You may be agnostic on the why, or scientific, or illogical, any of which could still qualify as an atheist outlook. Saying more than that just weakens the argument unecessarily.
-Mach",21,32,topic_stance_votes_1
32,secularism vs. atheism,existence of God,support,"No, just the claim, and it's not that significant to label it unreasonable, I withdraw the word.
The claim is either circular, or illogical, I'll illustrate as best I can.
The simple answer is:
doG, I do not understand your claim, you use a word I don't know the definition of... ""God"".
The most likely conclusions after that is addressed will be:
1. God is defined as something for which by definition, there can be no evidence, and does not ""exist"". That makes it circular (there is no evidence for this thing which cannot have evidence).
2. The definition of god includes some illogical qualities that make the claim ""god does not exist"", unreasonable (illogical, insert any descriptive here).
You know how much energy is spent in debates about ""can god exist, does god exist, where is the evidence, even that there is evidence in the bible and gulp, eye-witnesses, I feel him every day, he is love"", etc, etc.
Each of these is unecessary when we don't use the word god without first defining it. For example, if someone were to define the qualities of god such that they were identicial to what we describe as ""nature"", then that person would just be using the term god as a synonym for nature..uncessary, we have a good word for that...nature. Or they say he's love...OK, we have a word for that too. OK, he's completely undectable and outside the universe...OK, we have a word for that, it's nothing, or silence (that is, no claim at all).
It's also why some get so bent with proving there is no god. How can one go prove that something doesn't exist? They don't need to, it's unreasonable.
What is reasonable are the basic tenants of science:
Knowledge is derived from observation of reality.
That's really all there is to it. If there is no observation of [god] (insert anything for god), then discussion of it's existence or not is circular or meaningless.
It's the same reason we cannot reasonably say things like this:
It's possible that there may be a god.
How on earth(doh) can someone claim to know if something is or is not possible in reality? We derive our knowledge FROM reality, not the other way around.
Pick it apart, I'd like to be corrected if it's entirely off-track.

In reality, no one, including christians, can ""point to a higher intelligence"". But this is just common knowledge, it has nothing to do with secularism, atheism, or christianity, it's just reality.

From where I come from the definition of science is this:
The body of knoweldge that pertains to reality.
The primary method for obtaining this knowledge is through the scientific method (observation, test hypothesis, debate, etc.)
When you suggest evidence isn't required, you are suggesting that we believe things on FAITH, which is religion, which is make-beleive, that's why it requires no evidence.
For example, if you agree that some knowledge can be obtained without evidence, I'll tell you a purple monkey named bingo is sitting on my shoulder talking to me. I have no evidence for it, it contradicts what is known in science, yet by your (bad) standard we could call that ""knowledge""? I'd call it lying, or delusion, since that's what it is.

You don't get it. Tradition, irrelevant. Bush being an as*clown, irrelevant. Bush lying to you and the american people, irrelvant. Atheism is a term that means ""non-theist"", or plainly ""without belief in any diety"". Your love of unethical, evil people, is irrelevant to this.
This still looks as if you aren't comprehending the simple fact that ""atheism"" is a label for certain people who lack certain beliefs. Whether some or all of them participate in the political system in a free democratic society, is still, you guessed it, irrelevant.
The fact that the earth revolves around the sun doesn't require you or anyone else to know about it. In fact, it was decarled as heresay to state that, contrary to the theological position of the time that the earth was the center of the universe.

Very few, most of them 'pretend' theists. I've heard that there are a few atheists who financially support Christian music radio. But those are both examples that are so minuscule that they have no bearing on societal trends.
It came first - it was the inspiration for documents that do. If atheists and secularists claim that some rights are unalienable, they can't be AS unalienable as rights that came from a higher source. It shows how atheists and secularists would interpret the constitution in a similar way, differing from Deism and Judeo Christianity.
You only wish it belonged in another thread, because it so clearly shows how atheists and secularists wouldviews would harmonize, yet differ so starkly from the religion that is prominent in the U.S. 
I don't think that assertion needs support - it's obvious to just about anyone who doesn't have a tightly closed mind.
No there's not - atheists and secularists aren't the only ones permitted to present evolutionary theory.
""ANYBODY"" is an emotional, strong word. It's my position that it would grant fewer rights than the U.S. constitution intends to grant. World history and current events pretty well prove it.
Yes there is. Atheists and secularists both seem to embrace FREETHOUGHT. How would one think more freely than the other? Would an atheist think less freely than a secularist? If so why? Would a ""strong"" atheist think less freely than a ""weak"" atheist? Wouldn't there be a bigger difference in the worldview of a strong atheist vs a weak atheist, as opposed to the difference between an average, middle of the road atheist and a secularist? (I guess there couldn't be a ""strong"" or ""weak"" secularist - there couldn't be variations in intensity for drawing a blank)

Closer. Atheists by definition lack belief in gods and godesses. That is all.
Secularist is wanting religion to be seperate from government. (you know, like part of the foundation of America)
Bush supports religion IN government, he is anti-secularist, and anti-atheist.
Bush senior was even quoted as saying :
