0,"I tingle in anticipation of the ""proof""",evolution,support,"I'm just tingling in anticipation! Today is the day. It's Tuesday and HeavenBound has promised to post the ""proof"" that radiocarbon dating is not reliable. I'm sure that this will turn the science of archaeology on its ear, especially Biblical archaeology that has placed a lot of credence in the dating of finds in Near East. As stated in the Library of Congress Exhitit on the Dead Sea Scrolls, ""Within a fairly short time after their discovery, historical, paleographic, and linguistic evidence, as well as carbon-14 dating, established that the scrolls and the Qumran ruin dated from the third century B.C.E. to 68 C.E."" Radiocarbon dating has recently been used to verify that the dates of the Hitite civilization as per the Bible are correct, and not some 200 years later as previously believed. Just think, HeavenBound's ""proof"" will make nonsense of so much Biblical scholarship that it will be a disaster for all western religions.
But I look forward to the ""proof."" This is a paradigm shifting revelation that will also upset most of science. This ""proof"" will upset nuclear physics by showing that the technology is based on error (will it cause the closing of all nuclear reactors?). It will upset geology and paleontology by showing that all dates are unreliable. It will also upset astrophysics by showing that the detection of radioactive elements in heavenly bodies that are light years away (eg., cobalt-56 and cobalt-57 in SN1987A at 170,000 light years) are wrong. In effect, the dating of the universe, the earth, and human civilization will be thrown into termoil. A whole new era of science is about to dawn and I look forward to it.
So let us all hope that HeavenBound was not just trolling. She wouldn't actually promise something and then not deliver, would she? Sometimes it seems that she in just a bit incoherent. For example, here are some of her remarks from other threads.
Well! I guess that just showed you guys. It seems that HeavenBound thinks that having a closed mind is a bad thing. And yet,
What? How is that an example of an open mind. It seems that a closed mind is a virtue only in a non-religionist. Isn't the above statement the equivalent of a declaration of a closed mind?
Now I'm confused. In the same breath HeavenBound tells us that she accepts and rejects the science of evolutionary biology. I wonder if giving evolutionary biology a fair chance is like giving gravity a fair chance, or the heliocentric theory, or maybe the germ theory of disease? Did she give all of those a ""fair chance"" too? How about nuclear physics? And yet, as I mentioned above, HeavenBound has rejected most of science apparently, because she is going to offer ""proof"" that falsifies cosmology, astronomy, astrophysics, nuclear physics (or, as our President says, ""nucular physics""), anthropology, paleontology, geology, and biology.
So it seems that HeavenBound is a theistic evolutionist, believing that evolution is just God's method of creation. Her opinions seem contradictory to me.
If we are talking about ideas that work by means of logic, why does HeavenBound think that it is wrong to use logic? Why is it better to address logical topics with ideas based on mythology, spiritualism, and superstition? I haven't ever seen a peer reviewed paper that described how verification for a hypothesis was sought in the Bible, but it seems that HeavenBound finds that idea logical.
Actually, you haven't understood much of what has been discussed here, have you. Scientists are quite sure that evolution is 100% absolute. It is quite simple. Evolution has been observed. There is no question whatsoever. Changes in populations of organisms that meet the definition of biological evolution have been observed and are observed all the time. Strains of drosophila used for genetic studies have speciated several times so that many of them are no longer able to interbreed. This is in spite of the fact that they are all derived from a single population. The original strain was domesticated in California. Recent experiments have shown that the laboratory strains can't interbreed with the original population any more either. That is evolution. There is no doubt. The DNA of Drosophila has been sequenced and studied and differences that prevent interfertility have been identified. That is evolution. That is 100% sure. What isn't sure is whether the theories that explain these facts are correct. For most of the fundamental theories we are about 99% sure. Some of the newer work is less secure. New theories on the frontiers of knowledge are still being tested and amended.
But of course, it is evolutionists who have closed minds and not religionists.
Where appropriate, I do. Unfortunately for you, there is no room in science for ""POOF, GODDIDIT!"" as an explanation of the causes for observed natural events. Recourse to a miracle is giving up on learning. It is a declaration that we can't learn by the application of a logical method of study, the scientific method, to natural events that are observed in the natural universe. It is a declaration that mythology, spiritualism, and superstition is more reliable than logic. It is a declaration that a closed mind is the best way to learn.
Oh, yeah. HeavenBound. This post is mocking. I thought I would tell you that since you seem to have a great deal of determining when you are being mocked and when someone is trying to educate you. It seems that you respond to mocking better than you respond to education, since you haven't bothered to educate yourself about science to this point.
Looking forward to the evidence. Don't disappoint. And remember, anything from AIG, ICR, and Mr. Hovind isn't proof unless you can explain and verify any assertions. In other words, you will need to be able to show why your ""proof"" is a better explanation for the data than science - Occam's razor you know.",0,1,topic_stance_votes_1

She entered the board with a major case of snide (yes HeavenBound, I know that snide is an adjective, and I know that I used it as a noun, but coining a new usage in this case seemed appropriate) and then accused me of mocking her. I never did so intentionally. The specific quote that she claimed was mocking was when I called here a dupe. It wasn't mocking, it was a statement of observation based on many years of debating with closed minded creationists. Most are dupes. Most are scientifically illiterate. Most are only semi-literate.
In fact, as most of you are aware, polls by Gallup and others have shown that creationists tend to be less educated, less affluent, female, southern, and rural. They are gullable and believe what anyone who claims to be a christian and a ""creation scientists"" tells them.
My bet is that HeavenBound will present unsupported assertions about radiometric dating. She has already made the claim that it is based on assumption. It certainly is. It is based on the assumption that the laws and forces of nature that we see in effect in the universe today are the same forces of nature that have always been in effect in the universe.

You know, HeavenBound. What you have pulled here isn't unusual. Over the many years that I have been debating creationists I have seen it many times. Claims of proof followed by I can't find it.
Surely you can give us the main points. Surely you can offer the ""proof"" in your own words.
As I explained, if you wish to discredit radiocarbon dating from an article about archaeology, then you will throw all western religions into crisis. If you discredit radiocarbon dates that have supported the Biblical chronology (once you get past the mythology), then you have destroyed most of the scientific support for the historical portions of the Bible.
I'm really interested in your ""proof."" It is a paradigm shifting discovery for most of science and all of western religion. If you are correct, then neither religion nor science is.
Please look again. What an exciting prospect for science! Everything we know is wrong and we must start again! Of course, any science based on incorrect understanding of nuclear theory (such as radiocarbon dating) should be terminated immediately. All nuclear power plants should be shut down immediatley (even though our ability to produce electrical power without them is less than our need). Aren't brown-outs and shifting power grids preferable to the dangers posed by incorrect nuclear theory? So what if your heating unit wont fire in the winter. So what if your AC unit wont operate in the summer. So what if you are reduced to reading (and maybe educating yourself) because you have no radio and no TV. So what if you have to go to bed at sunset. So what if most of the Navy has to drydock the major ships (all major ships are nuclear, you know). Our Navy would be reduced to minor vessels. So what?
For science, the prospect is exciting. A wide open field of research in any direction. A Nobel Prize for whoever can offer ""proof"" of the error of nuclear theory and its application to radiometric dating.
How could you lose such an article!? Shame on you. Your article seems to be unknown and I feel that it should be recognized and rewarded. The Nobel Prize in only the first step - research grants will surely follow.
Please look again. It would be mocking to say that you never has such ""proof"" in the first place. Probably you did have something that you didn't understand. You were duped by some ""creation scientist"" that you believed because he told you that he was a christian.
It's kinda like being lead on by a women who tells you ""yes, yes, yes"" all the way to the critical moment, and then says ""no, no, no."" Somehow I feel violated. ""Wait until we get back to my apartment (on Tuesday)."" But then it's ""Wait until I feel better.""

Similar claims by other creationists generally lead to the same type of responses.

I accept evolution--I am now of the ""theistic evolution"" view. Please consider that evolution and faith in God as creator don't have to be juxataposed to each other. I understand your thoughts as to why you believe the way you do because I used to as well. But I have come to realize that a christian doesn't have to compromise belief at all to note and accept scientific reality. God is no less God if Genesis 1 took place in 6 literal days or over eons. There is even Biblical basis for the timelessness of what God does: one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.--2 Peter 3:8 Maybe all the matter and energy in the universe was created at a point and has expanded and contracted ever since.

The one thing we can believe that science will never be able to disprove is that there is a Creator and that He created and creates all things (ultimately through the physical laws and natural processes that he put in place and maintains).

52,"I tingle in anticipation of the ""proof""",evolution,support,"Just look around. Not too long ago antibiotics were very effective against bacterial infections. Now, almost every strain of bacteria is immune to at least one antibiotic, and there are some strains that are immune to all antibiotics but one. It is a race to develop new antibiotics before the killer bacteria become endemic.
Every year requires the development of a new vaccine that targets the particular strain of flu that will be prevelant that year. Evolutionary scientists try to predict which strain will be the most prevelant the following year in order to product enough vaccine. Some years they have missed and the available vaccine has been less than effective against the most prevalent virus. The problem is that the flu virus evolves so rapidly.
Right now we are witnessing the evolution of a brand new killer strain in the far east. Bird flu has again been making the jump to humans, and recently there have been cases that were passed from human to human. Twice in the last century similar avian flu strains have made the jump directly from birds to humans.
SARS is another virus that evolved in order to jump from the animal host (civit) to humans.
And, of course, there is HIV that probably evolved from a strain of Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) that was passed to a human either from bush meat or from a bite by an animal.
And that's just a couple of examples of bacteria and virus. Drosophila (fruit fly) was domesticated from a wild population in California. All laboratory strains have been bread from this initial domestication. And yet, there are several known lines of domesticated flies that can no longer interbreed. Attempts to breed domesticated strains with the original population have failed. The domesticated strains of Drosophila have speciated several times.
And then there are ring species. Ring species live in a favorable environment that encircles a region that is not favorable. One is the herring gull-lesser black-backed gull. These two species of gull share the same range and do not interbreed. And yet they are the two separate ends of a continuous population the encircles the pole in the norther himisphere.
Another example is a salamender in which the population encircles California's central valley. Where the two extreme ends of the population meet at the southern end, they are unable to interbreed. There is a warbler that encircles the Tibetan plateau. Same thing. The two ends of the population are separate species.
The first black morph of the peppered moth was observed in 1848. By 1900, 98% of the moths in industrialized areas were black. After about 1950, the black morphs became rarer and rarer until they are only 1 or 2% of the population today.
And of course, whale fossils have been found with hind legs. Whales today don't have hind legs but they did in the past.
So we have observed the process of evolution again and again.
Yes, the word theorized exists but you don't seem to know what it means. A scientific theory is an explanation for the observed facts. We have observed evolution and the theories explain the mechanisms that caused the evolution. Theories have been tested.
Why don't you give us an example of a theory of evolution that is based on a theory of evolution.",52,53,topic_stance_votes_1
