1,Pop quiz for Atheists,existence of God,attack,"1. Jesus was:
E: a man who probably existed, perhaps even with good ideas about living. Stories about Jesus were embellished with ideas stolen or adapted from other religious and cultural stories.
2. The resurrection story of Jesus is:
E: Complete bunk with no reliable supporting evidence.
Essay:
I cite:
a) Rejected Gospels. People got to say whatever the hell they wanted about this ""Jesus"" fellow, if he existed. The events used to explain the circumstances of his birth are not merely nonsensical but contradictory to both the geography and the law/customs of the region. Jesus disappears for 30 years with nary a wonder of where the alleged son of God went.
b) The Bible. Despite offers of large cash rewards for anybody who can write a coherent timeline of the events surrounding the Resurrection without contradiction and without omission of information, nobody has been able to do this. The rising of the saints who were ""seen throughout the town"" surely should have been story fodder for years upon years, decades upon decades, centuries upon centuries, yet it seems from the rest of the evidence that the people saw the zombie saints and thought nothing of it.
Bonus Question:
We don't know. We credit Homer for the silly reason that a blind guy telling epic stories makes for good imagery. The stories were likely oral traditions passed along and embellished repeatedly.

A.
#1 is above.
The Jesus myth came out of Hellenistic Judaism already heavily imbued with the ideas of the suffering servant (Isaiah 53) and the son of God subject to a shameful death (Wisdom of Solomon “Let us condemn him with a shameful death”). Paul refers to the “archons”, the evil heavenly rulers of the age, as those who crucified Jesus (1 Cor 2:8) and extols the justice of the Romans (Ro. 13:1-3). The earliest layers of Q material do not refer to a death or resurrection (Kloppenborg). No earthly Jesus, no crucifixion, no death. It is all myth, man.

And yet this is taken to be fact unanimously in our history books. Funny how easy this book gets a pass. If we think it's Homer then for this book, that's good enough. But not so with the Bible. There can be absolutely no kernel of uncertainty, which in ancient texts, ambiguity is unavoidable.
In regards to who wrote these books, the best evidence we have leads to Homer. Therefore, we decide it is almost certainly Homer who is the author. This is undisputed.
However, in regards to the Bible, skeptics overturn the use of Occam's Razor and require more than adequate proof of the Bible's claims. Even though the Bible is the most heavily documented writing of its day, still skeptics require more in order to believe the Gospels are actually true.

18,Pop quiz for Atheists,existence of God,attack,"The documents contained in the bible are historical artifacts. They reflect the beliefs and values of the people who wrote them. When we read Paul we might not believe everything he says but overall we can believe that he preached a gospel that Jesus was born, crucified, died, and risen. We can discern his message from the 7 or so letters we know of his. 
We can generally believe that he met people named Peter, James, and John who were ""reputed to be pillars"" and ""seemed to be important."" We know that he claimed his knowledge of Jesus came through revelation and scripture and claimed that other apostles had similar sources of knowledge. I think we can trust Paul's claims on these things. Do we need to believe he really had revelations? I don't know. Maybe in his own way he did. I think we need to lean toward Paul believing in the truth of his claims.
I would think the court would think very dimly of the hearsay claim that 500 anonymous people had a revelation of the Risen Christ.",14,19,topic_stance_votes_1
19,Pop quiz for Atheists,existence of God,attack,"It doesn't matter if it's 'earth shattering' or not. By admitting that we hold different standards for the Bible proves my entire point: hypocrisy on the part of skeptics.
More proof to prove my point, thanks!
It does not matter what the document contains! The same procedure should be done for every document. What the writing says is irrelevant to its authenticity! You wrongly use Occam's Razor as well. If the document is well preserved, has many copies, has copies relatively close to the original, etc, then the most likely assumption we can make is that the document itself is a valid source. Then and only then, should we examine the contents within and determine if they happened. We can do this through archaeological evidences and from other writings as well that agree with that one. Much of which we in fact do not have for many of Caesar's expeditions, but yet again, we accept them as fact in our history books.
But, it is funny that you should mention Caesar splitting a river. While he didn't do that, he did claim to have created a massive bridge in a very short time period and then destroyed it a few days later. Sounds like a pretty audacious claim from guys without any modern equipment. Should we discount this too because it 'doesn't seem practical' as we do with the bible despite the overwhelming documentation for it?
But here you are admitting that you set different standards 'depending on what the writing claims'. Thanks again for proving my point I guess.",18,20,topic_stance_votes_2
20,Pop quiz for Atheists,existence of God,attack,"Poppycock. How the hell could these people have been able to tell the difference? Answer: they couldn't (not that there was a difference, because each one was man-made with no divine help). Instead, they chose the four that painted their Savior in the best light.
Because you don't deny the truth of its claims. If you present the Bible as a credible source, then I can use it to eviscerate your position. Suppose I tell a multi-part story where King ABC is said to never lie, yet in one part, King ABC lies his little crown off. Either King ABC lied in that story and therefore doesn't never lie, or King ABC really doesn't ever lie and in fact didn't lie in that part. You can't have it both ways, but the Bible tries to have it multiple ways all the time. Even if you and I both think that the King ABC story is fiction, we can recognize this inconsistency and have absolutely no reason to believe that the story is nonfiction.
Later you accuse me of having double standards. This is ripe considering the above.
This is not my problem. As I explained above, I just have to show inconsistency in order to reject the validity of all the claims in the Bible as being undeniable truth. And with the Bible, that's damn easy to do.
A modern court requires signed affidavits or sworn testimony. These five hundred people remain unnamed and carry on with their lives as if it never happened. How would a modern court view the hearsay of 500 witnesses and no resultant effect of the allegation?
We aren't. Not even in literature classes are we taught this.
I'll have to apologize here, SoC. I confused you with another poster who also used Christ in his handle. You didn't run from the topic because you weren't the OP of that thread. Sorry about that.
If you'd still like to approach that thread, I'll respond and provide the link, but all readers should be clear that my accusation that SoC scampered away was mistaken, and any willingness to address the arguments would be solely to SoC's credit.
Funny how you haven't had a literature or history class recently. Would you like me to contact the several history and literature/English teachers in my school and ask them if they credit Homer as the actual author of those epics?
It's not just a kernel of uncertainty. Jews and Christians alike say that Moses wrote the Pentateuch, but a reading of the Pentateuch makes it obvious that this cannot be true. Luke did not write the book of Luke, the apostle Matthew did not write the book of Matthew, and we don't even claim to know the authors of many books of the Bible. Look up the Documentary hypothesis; early scholars shuffled ""holy writings"" together like a deck of cards to get the Old Testament that everybody today knows and loves.
Nonsense. The most widely accepted idea is that these epics were oral traditions that were finally recorded in writing, possibly by a guy named Homer. Read and read.
Look, bub, if you're trying to paint nonbelievers and unfair because we accept Homer as the author of epics while rejecting Moses as the author of the Pentateuch or Matthew as the author of the book of Matthew, then you're lying: we put equal scrutiny into these questions, and -- as you can see, despite your claims to the contrary -- we don't swallow the claim that Homer wrote these epics the way we know people write books and poems today.
More importantly, there aren't (as far as I know) absurdities that make it obvious that Homer didn't write the Iliad or The Odyssey. This isn't true of the Bible: How could Moses have written that no man as humble as Moses came before or after Moses? (And wouldn't that be pretty damn un-humble for the humblest man ever to say?)
And we're back to internal contradiction coupled with anonymous authorship. Do you consider The Odyssey a representation of truth? I sure as hell don't, but that's because I hold the Bible and these stories to an equal standard, and none pass. You apparently have no problem with nonsense and absurdities in the Bible, but you have no problem believing in Scylla and Charybdis and the Sirens and Circe turning men into pigs?

Historically, the word was first used by the church of those doctrines that were accepted as the rule of faith and practice. The term came to be applied to the decisions of the Councils as rules by which to live. All these employ the word in the metaphorical sense of a rule, norm, or standard.
In the course of time, the terms canon and canonical came to be applied to the catalogue or list of sacred books distinguished and honored as belonging to God’s inspired Word. “Greek Christians by the fourth century A.D. had given the word a quasi-technical religious meaning, applying it to the Bible, especially to the Jewish books.”60
… It is important to note that religious councils at no time had any power to cause books to be inspired, rather they simply recognized that which God had inspired at the exact moment the books were written.
Jews and conservative Christians alike have recognized the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament as inspired. Evangelical Protestants have recognized the twenty-seven books of the New Testament as inspired. Roman Catholics have a total of eighty books because they recognize the Apocrypha as semicanonical.

44,Pop quiz for Atheists,existence of God,attack,"Personally, I don't see what the big deal is. In my opinion (as someone who has read a lot of the early church writings) it is clear from writings of very early people like Clement, Ignatius, Justn Martyr, etc that what we consider orthodoxy was indeed orthodoxy from the get-go, and so it is only fair that they had some sense of wanting to keep out writings that they didn't consider accurate or genuine. People sometimes bring this us as if it indicates something bad about Christianity or early Christianity, but why should they have allowed writings into the canon that they considered spurious? (Now whether the canonical writings we have are spurious too is another debate--the bottom line is that THEY--the early Christians--didn't feel at the time that the NT books in our canon were spurious for the most part.) 
Now one of the things people will sometimes say is ""well, THOSE Christians won the day, and the Gnostics/Arians didn't, so there may have been gnostic or Arian writers that got suppressed so we don't really know."" Well, you could ALWAYS make that argument about ANYTHING. We don't come to hard conclusions based on material for which we have no idea was there--a speculative basis--we come to hard conclusions based on what IS there. Sure, there's a general understanding with history the winners write the history, but that doesn't mean we go back and fill in blanks or overwrite what we accept with speculation.",44,45,topic_stance_votes_2
45,Pop quiz for Atheists,existence of God,attack,"What is ""the big deal""? Good question, personally it doesn't matter one way or the other. Had Jo left it I'd probably have wandered off, you kind of expect it from the evangelical wingnuts, but having a moderate doing the whole ""There's nothing to see here"" routine just raises more questions. It's the reaction rather than the text that's intrigueing.
What has been said appears as an attempt to dismiss the original question without actually answering the specific points. That's frustrating and serves to push things forward as it feels like censorship, - ""Don't ask awkward questions."" 
AA's answer just comes across as insanity, given the title of the thread one can assume an athiest perspective so the talk of God playing a role in which books were included and which discarded effectively comes across as, - ""The voices in my head say that this is true, so it must be.""
Getting back to the historical arguments Jerome wrote a large amount of letters responding to those who had accused him of political bias, that would conflict with Jo's denial that there were such arguments at that time.
Again that begs the question why?
The answer could be ignorance, but then why not say that they don't know.",45,46,topic_stance_votes_1
46,Pop quiz for Atheists,existence of God,attack,"I've just done a bit of hunting around, and I can't find anything to say Jerome had anything to do with the compilation of the Bible, only the translation of the Latin vulgate, which I'll gladly admit is not an accurate translation.
As for why I have argued the point, I think the truth is important, and I think it's two easy to take a blanket ""oh, it was all political so we can't trust any of it"" approach to the Bible, and this is done largely in a manner that resembles special pleading. No other historical source or collection of sources is questionned with anything like this level of intensity or scepticism.
