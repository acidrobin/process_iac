11,We need guns!,gun control,attack,"What purpose does it serve for anyone who is not in law enforcement to have or own a gun. If you are being threatened or are going to get assulted, your first thought is not going to be ""Hold on let me get my gun..."" it would be (at least for me) to get the hell out of where you are.
Also, how many times every year, does a child pick up a loaded gun and accidentally shoot themselves or someone else? Now, I understand that parents shouldn't leave the guns where the child can find them, but parents don't have 24 hour supervision on their children and if a little kid goes snooping and finds it, it's a tragedy waiting to happen.
It is the law enforcement's job to own the guns and protect the citizens of the country and not our job. I see it as pointless and of no use for the general public to own a gun(s).",11,12,topic_stance_votes_1
12,We need guns!,gun control,attack,"I think that is a pretty unrealistic view of reality as you see it. I myself, will pull out my gun to prevent being assaulted or attacked. My child will never find a loaded gun that he can shoot himself or anyone else with...as they all have locks on them, or are locked away when not on my person, and never kept loaded when not in my direct possession. Law enforcement can prevent some crime through the use of security, and sometimes through lucky timing, stop a crime already in progress, but all too often in this country, law enforcement shows up just in time to write a report about the crime that already took place, or trace an outline on the ground of the body that is already dead. The citizens of this country were granted the right to bear arms for one purpose and one purpose only, to keep the government in check. The rest is incidental, but the value is definately there.",12,13,topic_stance_votes_2

14,We need guns!,gun control,attack,"I'll see if I can find the exact number, but I beleive it is surprisingly few. (Under 1000)
Edit: I'm finding it difficult to find the number of children that die annually from self inflicted gunshot wounds. Most of the numbers I have found include ""teens"" who are more likely to be shooting each other in gangs etc. Any help?",12,15,topic_stance_votes_2
15,We need guns!,gun control,support,"2.75 per 100,000 over a ten-year period. On an annual basis, the number would be so tiny it would be a meaningless calculation. 
~And regarding the inevitable but-what-about-the-children cry, Lott points out that the number of children killed in accidental shootings is smaller than the number of children killed through bicycle accidents, drowning or fires. Children are also 14.5 times more likely to die in a car accident than through accidental shootings. We aren't, however, likely to ban bicycles, pools or cars.~

16,We need guns!,gun control,attack,"GD answered that one below, but I have a story to share for those eyes that want to hear,
One day my sister and her husband (2Nd) came over to my house years ago for a visit. I had just got back from hunting and had just finished cleaning my guns and was about to put them away. My brother in law looked at my guns laying on the table , snarled up his lip and said with a sharp tone of voice , "" I dont even like to be around those things, I have never had one of those things in my house, and never will. "" ...
About a year later, that same bro -in - law had a trajedy strike in his life. His 19 year old son was hanging out at the rural diner one friday night , where the teens sat around on their parked cars and socialized. The police report said that a drunken 19 year old male took a revolver out and was showing it off , waving it around , saying he was going to shoot so and so with it, and laughing. Time went by and the guy started shooting down in the woods recklessly. All of this time my bro - in laws son stays with this crowd. Then, somewhere along the evening, the revolver got mishandled , a .357 mag slug went thru my bro-in-laws 19 year old son's ribcage, killing him instantly.",15,17,topic_stance_votes_1

Ever hear of home invasion? Where do you run now?
Child tragedy? Thanks for the advise? I'll keep it in mind, but what I do in my home and how I raise my children is none of your business. If that is your justification to tell me what I can and can not do with my guns, I would say your a little Nazi. I never gave you authority to decide how my children are raised or how I do it in the privacy of my own home. That is not for you to decide and it is none of your business. **** off.
Police protection? Yea right. When I need police protection in my home, they will drive up in time to get the license plate number of the criminals as they drive of after having thier way with me and my family.",12,18,topic_stance_votes_2
