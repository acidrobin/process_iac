0,Marriage between a man and a woman,gay marriage,support,"I have decided that a compromise is in order about marriage. If marriage is, as the christian right has stated, about children then I have some new licensing rules that need to be implemented.
1 If marriage is limited to a man and a women they need to submit proof of fertility to get a license.
2 they must have a child within a year for the license being grated or the license must be surrendered
3 there can not be any divorce the couple must remain together for the child's welfare.
4 once the children are grown or if the child dies then the license must be surrendered.
5 only breeding age men and women will be permitted licenses.
6 proof of consumption, by video or Affidavit of 3 Witnesses must be kept on file at the court house.
7 the license must be renewed, much as a driver license is, with tests of parental fitness every 2 years. If found unfit the license is surrendered along with the children.
I could live with this my sense of equality would be sated since there would also be heterosexual excluded from marriage.",0,1,topic_stance_votes_1

3,Marriage between a man and a woman,gay marriage,attack,"ok.. lets get this straight..
1. the fertility thing. What if the 2 people just want to get married and don't care about producing and somewhere down the road want to adopt? what happens then?
2. What if they don't want to have a chilD within the first year. most average parents want to have some time alone before they bring the noise and the smells into the house that come with the baby.. Give them at least 3 years
3. What happens if they just drift away.. and they feel like they don't love each other anymore.. the parents can pay for the child.. the don't have to stay together.. it should be there decision anyways.
4. why should the license be surrendered. what if they want to adopt a child or have another one?? do we go back to step one??
5. i can understand that. but many people wont get licenses and just go ahead and produce children..
6. umm ok.. thats a gimme
7. surrender the children!!! youre crazy!! what parent in their right mind would willingly give up their child!!!",1,4,topic_stance_votes_2

5,Marriage between a man and a woman,gay marriage,attack,yes and my post was proving that,5,6,topic_stance_votes_2
6,Marriage between a man and a woman,gay marriage,support,"NO I mean every word of what I type. If they institute these rules I will back off gay claim to marriage and accept that marriage is about children.
As long as they continue to let 70 and 80 year olds get married marriage is not about children and there is no reason to exclude gay people.
I would also add one more lisencing rule

9,Marriage between a man and a woman,gay marriage,attack,As with any activity that you partake in without a license there will be legal consequenses. If you drive without a license you pay a fine and possibly go to jail.,9,10,topic_stance_votes_1
10,Marriage between a man and a woman,gay marriage,support,"Trully? Well then, you are once again allowing your anger to take control and harming the gay right's movement by lowering it to the level of the haters and bigots. Sarcasm and irony are one thing, but actually using the tools of the other side is the same as condoning their methods. In my opinion, of course.",7,11,topic_stance_votes_1

12,Marriage between a man and a woman,gay marriage,attack,"Poohbear, by your own logic gays should be able to do what they please without interference from government or the religious right. If two people should be allowed to ""do their own business"" in peace than why not gays?

14,Marriage between a man and a woman,gay marriage,support,"A bunch of wackos have some twisted ideas, but instead of rejecting those ideas would should try to apply them universally? You think this is a good plan???",14,15,topic_stance_votes_1
15,Marriage between a man and a woman,gay marriage,support,"He's making a point. And sometimes the only way to get that point across is to push for it in a serious way even if it is absurd.
Do you think any of what Matthew is proposing will ever happen? I think I can safely say that you don't. So don't sound so worried about it.",15,16,topic_stance_votes_1
