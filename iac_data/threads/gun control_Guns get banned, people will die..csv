My kung fu grandmaster gave a very good short speech today about gun control. He is an ex-cop, and he used to train the police officers in our town. He is very wise and offers an interesting insight into gun control. He told us a story today, about a police officer that was off duty and in plain clothes who was approached by a man with a large knife. The officer told the man to back down, however the man kept coming at him. The officer was forced to pull out his gun and kill him. If this was a civilian, he/she would be dead.
I gained a useful insight into what it feels like to be assulted during today's class. I was pinned down and being choked by a man 200lbs and over 1 foot larger than me. After awhile, I realized that there was almost no hope of getting out (this was training, of course. Not real.) If you are confronted with a situation like this, and are not carrying a gun or other weapon, most likely you will be injured or killed by the attacker. Even with martial arts training, our grandmaster acknowleges that in some situations, you have to just do what you can, and hope you get out alive, especially if you are a small person.
Violent crime will continue to happen no matter what, however whether it rises or falls is up to the voters and the politicians. If you think violent crime will never happen to you, put yourself in the place of the people that it has happened to, especially the dead ones. Then think twice about voting for gun control.",0,1,topic_stance_votes_2

The advantage of being confronted by a knife wielding maniac (as opposed to a gun wielding maniac) is that he/she has to come within arm's reach.

Also, you can run from somone with a knife, but turn your back on a gunman and you may not get 2 paces.
And yes, it is fair comparison (my typing is reasonable), and do you really think that it would take an hour to knife 2-3 people, or to gun down 15? Nice try at derailing the argument but it didn't work. The comparison was between the number of people who can be picked off by a gunman and those stabbed by a knifeman in similar lengths of time.
As for somone killing me, I dare say I could get 3 or 4 before anyone was able to react. Or I could just go into a school or some other place where guns aren't regularly carried. Then I could plough my way through a whole host of people before anyone got to me. And remember, running away isn't a great defense against a gun.
Scenario: Man runs into street and starts stabbing people, after the second one has gone down people realise what's going on and either run away from him (to escape - remember out of reach is out of danger) or towards him (to grab him - chances are he will only manage to stab one of them before he is incapacitated).
Alternatively: Man runs into street with gun. Bang, bang, bang, that's 3 gone already. People start running. Bang, bang, there go 2 more. Assuming someone in the area has a gun and kills him at this point, problem solved (but 5 dead already). If not, those running towards him are probably dead meat. Those running away will be next.

In response, allow me to quote at length from “Gun Control in England: The Tarnished Gold Standard,” written by historian Joyce Lee Malcolm and published in the fall 2004 issue of Journal on Firearms & Public Policy:
[Between 1997 and 2003] crimes with [banned firearms] have more than doubled.... In 2002, for the fourth consecutive year, gun crime in England and Wales rose — by 35 percent for all firearms, and by a whopping 46 percent for the banned handguns. Nearly 10,000 firearms offenses were committed....
Clearly since the ban criminals have not found it difficult to get guns and the balance has not shifted in the interest of public safety....
In the four years from 1997 to 2001 the rate of violent crime more than doubled. The UK murder rate for 2002 was the highest for a century....
A recent study of all the countries of western Europe has found that in 2001 Britain had the worst record for killings, violence and burglary, and its citizens had one of the highest risks in the industrialized world of becoming victims of crime....
And here’s the icing on the cake: “[A] United Nations study of eighteen industrialized countries, including the United States, published in 2002 ... found England and Wales at the top of the Western world’s crime league, with the worst record for ‘very serious’ offenses.” [Emphasis added]
And all this while crime in the United States, including violent crime, has been steadily falling. The “Wild West” seems to be 3,000 miles to our east.
“Nevertheless,” observed Derek Phillips, legislative advisor for the UK’s Office of Legislative Affairs, “‘tough’ legislative regulation, so evidently ineffective in achieving the purpose claimed for it, continues as a policy.” The UK’s ban on private firearms ownership has left the people there completely defenseless in the wake of rising crime. A young American turned British bobby has shown the courage to suggest that more guns might be the answer, but rather than take an honest and rational look at the evidence, the British would rather hide behind an irrational hatred for firearms and an even more irrational contempt for American sensibility on this issue. Guns in the hands of police officers — and private citizens — make everyone safer. Cowering from the criminal element and denouncing “gun drunk” Americans won’t change that simple fact.

Yeah it could take you an hour to pull off something like that. I for one don't think you have the skills necessary to shoot accurately enough to hit 15 people, especially if they're moving.
Trouble with the comparisonn is that it's highly flawed. The minute that shots begin to ring out people are going to start running and moving and make it hard to get off a clear shot and hit a target. With a knife nobody hears anything until it's too late.
And I dare say that I'd like to see you even try.
Some people are physically unable to run at all. They'll die soonest.
You're assuming that every shot will hit a person rather than missing entirely. You're also assuming that each shot will provide an instant kill, when in many cases they don't.

12,"Guns get banned, people will die.",gun control,attack,"I loved the wheelchair scenario. What if the person in the wheelchair is 20 feet away (out of arm's reach)? Do they then have a better chance if the maniac has a knife or a gun?
Maybe you're right about my gun skills, or maybe I would just pick a crowded marketplace where no aiming is necessary. Either way the gun is a far easier way of killing large numbers of people in a far more indiscriminant way than a knife.
No, the comparison is not flawed. You say that the knife is quiet, so nobody hears anything before it's too late. You think when they hear the gun shot there's still time to get out of the way? You are also still ignoring the range of an attack with a gun.
At close range (5-10 feet), I dare say I could hit my target. Do you think you could get further than that before the bullet hit home? I'd be far more willing to take my chances against a maniac with a knife.
As for me trying to scare people, all you have to do is look at how many people die from gun related incidents in the US to be scared. If you aren't scared by that then I don't think there's any hope for you.

13,"Guns get banned, people will die.",gun control,attack,"You don't think it's possible?
Neither. That 20 foot distance can be crossed in a matter of just a few seconds. If the maniac wants to kill the person in the wheelchair and the only defense they have is to try and flee then they're gonna die.
It's a very safe bet that I'm right.
A lot of good a crowded marketplace will do you if you suffer a doublefeed jam and don't know how to properly clear it and return the gun to a state of functioning.
And either way death is death and it's as simple as that. It's not like people are going to be less upset finding out that their loved ones were stabbed to death than they'd be if they were shot to death.
You're still ignoring the facts of the real world. If you can't aim properly then you can't hit your target. If you can't hit your target then the effective range is useless.
You'd think so at least.
In the North Hollywood Shootout of 1997, a wounded police officer shot by AK-47 rounds was able to make it to cover 90 yards away and wait for help.
Well then I guess there's no hope for me, because I'm not scared by the number of deaths.

18,"Guns get banned, people will die.",gun control,support,"The bible is very clear in its warning that ""those who live by the sword (a weapon) will die by the sword"". By that it teaches that the criminal who lives by violence will die by violence, and we see that result every day in the lives of violent offenders who are killed.
And remember when Peter cut the ear off of the Centurion who came to arrest Jesus? Jesus rebuked him because Jesus knew He had to die for Humanity; so He healed the guards ear, but He never told Peter to lay down his sword. Neither the bible nor Jesus ever promoted pacifism at all. In fact, he told this to his disciples. Luke 22:36: ""Then He said to them, But now, he that has a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that has no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one."" So Jesus believed in self defense, but not offensive violence. Here's a link that explains the scriptural perspective very well.

Luke 6:27-36
27""But I tell you who hear me: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, 28bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. 29If someone strikes you on one cheek, turn to him the other also. If someone takes your cloak, do not stop him from taking your tunic. 30Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back. 31Do to others as you would have them do to you. 
32""If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even 'sinners' love those who love them. 33And if you do good to those who are good to you, what credit is that to you? Even 'sinners' do that. 34And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you? Even 'sinners' lend to 'sinners,' expecting to be repaid in full. 35But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back.

Oh really mr bible scholar? His giving His life couldn't have been because He knew He was here to die for our sins, could it? Pacifism had absolutely nothing at all to do with Jesus being crucified and if you understood the Gospel, you would know that. It was all about Him sacrificing Himself for the sins of Humanity and paying the price that only He could pay to redeem us. Here, smiley, read on from Luke 22:
Luk 22:41 
And He was withdrawn from them about a stone's throw, and He knelt down and prayed,
Luk 22:42 
saying, ""Father, if it is Your will, take this cup away from Me; nevertheless not My will, but Yours, be done.""
Luk 22:43 
Then an angel appeared to Him from heaven, strengthening Him.
Luk 22:44 
And being in agony, He prayed more earnestly. Then His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground.
Jesus suffered greatly just at the thought of what was to come. See this link for the relevance of sweating blood. http://foraclearview.blogspot.com/20...-of-blood.html And He knew that He could call to 10,000 Angels and they would save him from this plight.

As to whether Jesus died because he believed he was fulfilling his destiny, I'm afraid I don't believe that (though the bible would tend to suggest it). I believe that Jesus was, in effect, a heretic and died for that reason. He was seen as a threat to the powers that be and died for that cause. He didn't fight back.

Here is documented evidence that the Banning of handguns in GB has failed miserably if cutting down on crime and violence was the goal.
[Between 1997 and 2003] crimes with [banned firearms] have more than doubled.... In 2002, for the fourth consecutive year, gun crime in England and Wales rose — by 35 percent for all firearms, and by a whopping 46 percent for the banned handguns. Nearly 10,000 firearms offenses were committed....
Clearly since the ban criminals have not found it difficult to get guns and the balance has not shifted in the interest of public safety....
In the four years from 1997 to 2001 the rate of violent crime more than doubled. The UK murder rate for 2002 was the highest for a century....
A recent study of all the countries of western Europe has found that in 2001 Britain had the worst record for killings, violence and burglary, and its citizens had one of the highest risks in the industrialized world of becoming victims of crime....

Carrying a firearm has never given me a sense of invulnerability. I am rather more conscious of the tremendous responsibility I have for my actions when I do choose to carry.

“And indeed, gentlemen, there exists a law, not written down anywhere but written in our hearts; a law which comes to us not by training or custom or reading but by derivation and absorption and adoption from nature itself; a law which has come to us not by theory but from practice, not by instruction but by natural intuition. I refer to the law which lays it down that, if our lives are endangered by plots or violence or armed robbers or enemies, any and every method of protecting ourselves is morally right. When weapons reduce them to silence, the laws no longer expect one to await their pronouncements. For people who decide to wait for these will have to wait for justice, too--and meanwhile they must suffer injustice first. Indeed, even the wisdom of the law itself, by a sort of tacit implication, permits self- defense, because it does not actually forbid men to kill; what it does, instead, is to forbid the bearing of a weapon with the intention to kill. When, therefore, an inquiry passes beyond the mere question of the weapon and starts to consider the motive, a man who has used arms in self-defense is not regarded as having carried them with homicidal aim”. Cicero, Selected Political Speeches, p. 222 (M. Grant, trans. 1975)
“If a slave, says Plato, defends himself, and kills a freeman, he ought to be treated as a parricide. This is a civil law which punishes self-defense, though dictated by nature. . . .It is unreasonable. . .to oblige a man not to attempt the defense of his own life. . . .Who does not see that self-defense is a duty superior to every precept. . . .[T]he laws of an Italian republic, where bearing fire-arms is punished as a capital crime and where it is not more fatal to make an ill use of them than to carry them, is not agreeable to the nature of things.” Montesquieu, The Spirit of Laws, pp. 59, 60, 64, and 79-80 (trans.

City gangs/drug dealers prefer handguns as they are easier to conceal and wield, these have become scarce but following American culture view such weapons as status enhancing. The result is that they often use the BB gun conversions which are prone to misfire.
The ""black market"" aquires its weapons from ostensibly legal sources, thus removing that link has a knock on effect. There aren't black market factories producing Brownings or Smith & Wessons, they ultimately come from a 'legal' source. 
Burglars usual armament is either a knife or crowbar, never a gun.

In England and Wales the figures are 1.41 deaths per hundred thousand, for a population of around 50 million. Multiplying up this equates to 705 actual deaths (with me so far?).

And again for Northern Ireland we get 6.09 in a population of 1.5 million, for a total of 91.
Add THESE figures together we get a total number of deaths for the whole of the UK, giving 908 deaths from a population of 57.5 million, which equates to a rate of 1.57 (if you're wondering why this figure is slightly different from the ealier one it is because I used approximate populations rather than the figures given, in order to clarify the calculation).

The combined population of 6,774,111 based on those two countries populations is still an accurate number based on the graph that iangb posted. 
And the numbers per capita are accurate and still higher than the USA when compared to our population of what was 272 million at the time the stats were recorded. The fact remains that according to iangb's link, the USA had a homicide rate of 5.70 per 100,000 and Great Britain, based on the same criteria had a homicide rate of 10.36 per 100,000. So to summarize, take same numbers iangbs link gives for the numbers per 100,000 based on America's population of 272 million and you'll come up with the number of homicides we had that year of 1999.

Now the population of the US is 5 times the population of the UK (near enough), so the comparable figure would be 3000 homicides in comparison with 900 in the UK. This is consistent with the rate of homicide death for the whole of the UK which I have calculated.

165,"Guns get banned, people will die.",gun control,support,"Let's use your exact example. Country A has 2.24 homicides per 100K. Country B has 6.09 homicides per 100K. Assuming that A and B are the same size (not the case in the main example, but meh...) the combined homicide rate is 8.33 PER 200,000 or 4.165 per 100,000. It's basic mathematics!
Let's go hypothetical again. Country C and Country D are equal in size, and for some unknown reason both have a homicide rate of 75,000 per 100,000. Particularly dangerous, you may think. However, by your logic, the combined homicide rate of C and D is 150,000 per 100,000. This is blatantly impossible. Instead, the combined rate of C and D remains at 75,000 per 100,000.
Finally, in a vague hope at getting this into your skull, let's look at population division. 
Country X has a population of 800,000, and homicide rates of 10 deaths per 100,000 - so total homicides in X are 80. If I take a small (and representative*) sample of X, the homicide rate for that smaller sample will still be 10 per 100,000 - the most obvious example is if I take a sample that is 1/8 the size of X, I will get a population of 100,000 with 10 homicides. With me so far?
Let's say that I split X into two equal parts, Y and Z. (Assuming Y and Z are representative*) Y and Z will both still have homicide rates of 10 per 100,000 - they will both be 400,000 in population and have 40 deaths each. When you recombine Y and Z to make X, the homicide rate stays at 10 per 100,000. If it did not, you could mess up any analysis simply by splitting up a country and then recombining it, over and over.
And no, Ireland is not a part of the UK. This is why 'Northern Ireland' and 'Ireland' are listed separately.
*If Y and Z are unrepresentative it still works as long as Y and Z make up the entirety of X, but I don't want to go into that because I suspect that it will confuse you.",165,166,topic_stance_votes_1
166,"Guns get banned, people will die.",gun control,support,"Let's put this another way to see if we can convince you.
Here's the table - tidied up a bit.
Following your logic, if you live in Scoltand you are around 2.5 times less likely to be murdered than if you live in the USA (5.70/2.24 = 2.5445).
If you live in England/Wales you are more than 4 times less likely to be murdered than if you live in the USA (5.70/1.41 = 4.04).
If you live in N.Ireland you are slightly more likely to be murdered than if you live in te USA (6.09/5.70 = 1.068).
However, if you live in one of the above (without specifying) then you are 70% more likely to be murdered than if you live in the USA (9.74/5.70 =1.708).
So the risk of living in ""one of the above countries"" is far greater than living ""a specified one of the above countries"".
Look at it another way.
If you live in Scotland your chances of being murdered are 2.24 out of 100,000. However, if you live in one of the other countries listed then your chances of being murdered are 13.82 out of 100,000 (5.70+6.09+1.41+0.62=13.82). That's more than 6 times more likely. With those stats you'd never venture out of Scotland.
And if you added in the likelyhood of being murdered in one of the other many countries of the world . . . . . . AAAAAAAAAGGGHHHHHHH!

However this does.
The US is in economic chaos right now. That accounts for a lot of the crime. The US and the UK are completely different areas with cultural differences, population differences, and social differences.
However, when gun control was enacted in Washington DC, crime did not go down at all. Its also strange that many states notorious for gun control (California, New York) are also notorious for crime.

Oh, absolutely. The fact that the UK is far safer is really only a minor piece of evidence in this argument, although it is evidence. However, if you look through this thread you will see that the pro-gun side keep trying to indicate that the UK is more dangerous. That is why we keep responding... For example (all taken from this thread)
""However, my main point still stands. Gun control didn't work out too great in the UK"" - SnP
""Your fancy states are fun to look at, but I've actually talked with people unfortunate enough to live in the UK, and their position has consistently been that the UK has become more dangerous than New York or Washington DC."" - OmegamonX
""you will see that Great Britain's murder rate numbers are much higher than the USAs. [bad maths]"" - Archangel
Because they didn't enforce it enough? Remember, I've shown that enforcement leads to reduced crime.
The problem is that DC is unique among the other states in that it is a single city with a population density of ~9,000. That's really quite hard a place to enforce laws in.
Did you even read my reply to your exact same argument a few posts back?

189,"Guns get banned, people will die.",gun control,attack,"There's also evidence that bigfoot exists, but that doesn't amount to much.
Dude, lemme try and make things understandable for you. In the places like California and New York and DC, where gun control is absolutely tight and crime is high regardless, the laws aren't going unenforced. To even get a gun, you need to get permission from the police to become a gun owner. The application process is very difficult, and it's not at all uncommon for it to be stretched out to over three years, just to find out you've been denied and need to start all over again.
Nobody in these places legally owns a gun without the police having full say it in. You can't buy a gun from anywhere in these states without the full written authority of the police, and then you have to register the with them as well.
Of course for the people in DC the laws are much worse. The ownership of handguns wasn't exactly banned per se, it was just that you couldn't own an unregistered handgun, and the registration program for handguns was terminated in 1977.
The ""lack of enforcement"" excuse doesn't fly in this case. Lack of enforcement is why criminals keep getting out two years into a ten year sentence. Lack of enforcement isn't the reason that criminals are running around with guns and using them in an illegal manner.
The population of Washington DC is about 570,000. New York City on the other hand, has a population size around 8,000,000. So don't tell me that Washington DC is so damn hard to police and enforce the laws in, it really ain't that big or that crowded.",189,190,topic_stance_votes_2

That's a bit more... substantial than Bigfoot.
Feel free to believe that the UK is more dangerous. Until you can actually give evidence that this is the case, however, everyone else remains free to justifiably believe that you are entirely incorrect.
You miss my point entirely. I'm not saying that people in DC are still selling legal guns despite the ban, I'm saying that there is insufficient activity to remove handguns from those who already illegally possess them. My link shows that when such enforcement is put into effect, there are 'significant' results.
You've made exactly the same mistake as your last source, in that you rely on 'big numbers' without actually looking at a relative comparason.
DC has a population density of ~9000 people per square mile, as stated above. From Ripskar's data (above) there were 57 murders per 10,000 people, or (to standardise) 5.7 murders per 100,000 people.
New York City has a population density of 27,147 people per square mile. However, the FBI database (via Wikipedia) tells me that there were 7.3 murders per 100,000 people. Compare that with the 5.7 in DC and you've quite nicely proved my point.
EDIT: Further investigation reveals a typo in ripskars data - the homicide rate is per 100,000, not per 10,000 - making the homicide rate in DC much larger. The data is 10 years old - more recent data from wikipedia give a rate of 35.7 per 100,000. Obviously this is still much larger than the more densely populated New York - feel free to disregard the 'smalled' text (this forum doesn't support strikethrough, alas) - I only left it there because it contains useful links.
Instead, my reply would be that it is interesting to note that NY's crime has fallen massively in recent years - murder rate was ~4 times larger in 1990, as was violent crime (and the city's population was smaller by ~1/8th). While this still doesn't quite make it comparable with DC, a crime drop of this magnitude is interesting nonetheless. The drop is ""attributed by criminologists to [changed police tactics], the end of the crack epidemic and demographic changes"" (wikipedia). The much slower rate of crime reduction in DC is merely attributed to 'gentrification' - essentially demographic changes. Doesn't this imply that the police in DC haven't been doing as much as the police in NY?",190,191,topic_stance_votes_1

Your point is flawed because you changed the number of DC murders to something much lower simply for the sake of argument. It doesn't work that way.

Furthermore, There are very few cases where unwarranted searching is allowed in the UK.
This is ironicly amusing to me.

However, the reasoning that you use: 'but there are hundreds of them!' is dire in the extreme. That 'I changed the numbers for the sake of argument' is entirely false - I changed the numbers so that they were comparable, per 100,000 each.

Alright lemme see if I can explain this to you. I've done a lot of studying on the laws regarding self-defense and protecting yourself.
