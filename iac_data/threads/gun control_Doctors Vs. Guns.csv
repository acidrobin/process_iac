1,Doctors Vs. Guns,gun control,attack,"What is the source of this? How do they define accidental gun death and accidental physicians death?
Using your logic you may indicate that we should eliminate cars, food, heating/cooling systems, chairs, stairs, houses, apartments, work, money, paper, plastic, and basically everything that we have on earth because somewhere people are going to die because of almost everything. You have to look at risk-reward.
Is there a greater risk to having doctors than there is reward? Clearly the answer is no, there is not a greater risk than reward to doctors. Is there a greater risk to having guns than there is reward? This is debatable as Japanise and US data will show you. One country has a ton of guns and a ton of gun deaths while the other has few guns and few gun deaths. There are of course other risks outside of just deaths as well as many rewards outside of just protection from death when it comes to the gun debate. Still I don't think we have a defined answer as to what amount of gun freedoms allows for the best risk-reward ratio and I find it highly unlikely that total gun freedoms allows for maximum risk-reward benefits.",1,2,topic_stance_votes_1

Your logic was that since doctors cause deaths then they should be banned if guns are, correct? Then why isn't it also consistant with your logic to believe that we should ban food since food causes deaths?
So lets clairfy here, do you believe that guns have a better risk/reward than doctors? If you HAD to ban one which would it be? I await your sidestep of the question.

No. The point is that doctors are more dangerous than guns, highlighting the stupidity of the anti-gun crowed who believe that guns should be outlawed because they are “dangerous.”
Furthermore, if we wanted to include deliberate killing, we would have to include doctors who deliberately kill. And we would have to point out that many people who are killed with guns - should be killed (violent criminals, for example).

10,Doctors Vs. Guns,gun control,attack,"The point that doctors are more dangerous than guns is absolutely rediculous. First off, I seriously doubt the validity of the study supporting the argument. And let me ask, how do you define ""accidental death caused by a doctor"". Accidental death with a gun is rather easy to define. Accidental death by doctor seems rather broad to me. How many of these ""accidental deaths"" were actually caused by a nurse who gave the wrong medication, an x-ray tech who did not hook the patient back up to oxygen for the trip downstairs, or just a sick patient that died? People die in the hospital every day, and some people seem to think that if someone dies in the hospital they must have been killed by some retarded doctor. The fact remains that sick people go to the hospital, sick people die, sick people die in the hospital. I agree that guns save lives in some situations, but they also can take lives, ie...accidental shootings of children, suicides, etc. I don't think this means the answer is to ban guns, but perhaps provide stiffer penalties to those who make the gun available to the kid who accidentally shot his brother, or the 13 y/o who put a tunnel through his head after finding dads revolver.

No. 
When someone dies in the Hospital, their care givers must fill out forms detailing the Cause of Death. If someone dies because they are sick, they didn't die because of ""medical misadventure.""

.
First of all, doctors are responsible for the care that is meted out under their supervision. Secondly, I struggle to imagine someone being killed by a session gone awry with a speech pathologist, or an x-ray teche.
Furthermore, the definition of “medical misadventure” that I posted above is only the first one I found with a search on google. I didn’t look further because I could tell it was a concept you had never heard of before. This definition: 
“Any type of medical error such as surgical or medication mistakes.“
Taken from wrongdiagnosis.com (http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/m/medi...ture/intro.htm)
Makes your entire “point” pointless, as only doctors can prescribe medication or perform surgery. 
There may be other definitions out there. I’m not a doctor, so I don’t know. 
Uh, I would guess that in some limited circumstances, organizations can be held responsible for medical misadventure. 
Look, rather than arguing the nuances of dying in a hospital, I can say any number of other things that make the same point. Try this on for size:
According to the NHTSA
http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/
37,862 people died on the nation’s highways in 2001
37,526 people died on the nation’s highways in 2000
According to the CDC,
http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/releases/02facts/final2000.htm
and 
http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/releases/03f...litytables.htm
A total of 28,840 people died from firearms in 2001 
A total of 28,663 people died from firearms in 2000. 
This data suggests that roughly 10,000 more people are killed every year by cars than by guns! Considering the fact that most of the highway deaths were accidents, and most of the guns deaths were deliberate (shooting apparent criminals), why aren’t you trying to do something about all the accidental deaths on the highways? Don’t you think we should have stricter laws about who can own a car? 
What about those 14 year old kids who take their dad’s car out for a joy-ride and end up killing someone in a stupid accident?? Or does that not bother you?

I disagree. We should look at the rate of incidence and remember that there is NOTHING we can do to bring the rate down to zero. In the end, every year somebody is going to die playing dodge ball. Someone will die in a car accident. Someone will die in a plane crash. The only way to reduce these rates to zero is to do away with cars, guns, planes and everything else. 
Life is dangerous. It can kill you.

Let’s recap (paraphrasing):
Hellhound says “Hey look, more people are *accidentally* killed by doctors than guns.”
You say “ No way! Lots of sick people who are dying anyway die in hospitals.”
I point out ”Sick people who are dying anyway do not contribute to the ‘medical misadventure’ statistic.”
You come back and say “I know more about medical forms than you!”
So I ask “If that’s the case, why do you want to throw rightfully dead people in with the ‘medical misadventure’ statistic? Don’t you know better than that?” 
You return and say that I am misrepresenting what you say?? 
I think you are getting too worked up about this. Take a deep breath, relax and accept the fact that more people die due to medical misadventure than accidents with firearms. And there are a LOT more firearms than doctors in America (just like cars). 
It does.
When I was 12, I knew how to be safe with a firearm. If a 12 year old is so stupid that he accidentally shoots one of his friends, I want him off the streets and under government supervision. Because, in few years, he’s going to be driving a car. A few years after that he’ll be voting! Better to get the stupid genes out of the pool at the first sign of trouble, rather than wait until he’s an adult and having an even bigger negative impact on society. As for his victim, well, it’s sad, but that’s life. Stupid people do stupid things with guns (and cars, and health care).

Notice that the original message inthis thread compares the rate of death by medical misadventure per doctor with the rate of death by firearm per *registerd firearm owner.* That's how the statistic (9,000 times more deadly) is arrived at. Its not a depiction of guns Vs Doctors, rather Doctors Vs registered gun owners.

It says firearm owner, not registered firearm owner. And who are registered firearm owners, define this? Anyway, where does the figure 120,000 deaths due to medical misadventure come from? I got 776 accidental gun deaths per year from the CDC web link. The same source says 2804 medical care deaths per year, approximately 4x the number of gun deaths. How do you get 9000x out of these figures?",33,34,topic_stance_votes_1
34,Doctors Vs. Guns,gun control,attack,"I do see that now, with the helpful link to the CDC. But using your logic, we should make laws that keep old people out of the hospital because they are more likly to die of medical misadventure than young people! 
And again, why are you trying to shift the argument to children, when the original post regarded all people? 
Fine, you're right. It says ""firearm owner"" not ""registerd firearm owner."" Way to pick those nits! 
That's a good question. Maybe we should fnd the person who's posting that all over the internet and ask them. 
Me too. Seems 120,000 is not accurate. 
Remember, there are the figures: 
You can bother checking the math if you want. I was only quoting the original source as saying that ""doctors are approximately 9,000 times more dangerous than gun owners"" 
You seem to want to argue that doctors are only 4 times as dangerous as guns. And I'm not going to dispute that. But the original point was a comparison between gun owners and doctors, not guns and doctors.",34,35,topic_stance_votes_2

36,Doctors Vs. Guns,gun control,attack,"No, we should work to eliminate or reduce the incidence of medical misadventure for all ages. Same as the incidence of accidental gun deaths.
I am not trying to shift the argument, I am merely posting the facts, and pointing out statistical curves defined by age. I posted for both children and all ages. I just found it interesting that the statistics showed that children were more likely to die by accidental gun death than adults. 
Good idea. I would think that if someone was going to post obscure figures that they would at least attempt to validate them first. My argument and more importantly the CDC statistics disprove these numbers without doubt. Perpetuating these misleading numbers does nothing but discredit the poster. 
But Rev is not the original source, he saw it on the internet, probably from someone else who saw it on the internet who saw internet...etc...

37,Doctors Vs. Guns,gun control,support,"And should the study be gun owners vs. doctors, or gun owners vs. doctor owners (ie. patients)? There are many more patients than doctors. Also, many of the people killed accidentally by guns are not the actual gun owners. This may seem like more nitpicking to you, but it goes to the heart of the credibility of the statistics posted. Out of the research I did trying to find the source, I did find one commonly repeated statement: That the author included abortions among the deaths caused by physician. I don't know the validity of this information either, but it could possibly explain the inflated numbers. Without true documentation however, I don't consider any of it to be valid.",37,38,topic_stance_votes_1
38,Doctors Vs. Guns,gun control,attack,"Sure. But we also need to keep weapons available to law-biding citizens who may need them. Although the occasions of accidents and misuse of firearms are horrific, the benefit outweighs the cost. 
I wouldn't be so quick to claim victory. Even you now admit that doctors are roughly 4x more dangerous than guns, which is not what you were arguing on page 1 when you said
I know that. I wasn't insinuating that he was the source. I've seen that statistic all over the net for a couple of years now. I've never seen a source for it. However, I also know that doctors are more dangerous than guns. I have verified that in a number of places before having this discussion, because it seemed so outlandish to me the first two times I heard it I, like you, refused to believe it. Only after doing a little research did I come to see it was true. Dr. Akermann's discussion was one of the things that finally convinced me. 
I doubt you'll have much luck there. You'd be better off re-doing the research yourself (we've already done most of it, we just need to know how many gun owners and doctors there are) and doing the same statistical analysis. 
It won't come out to 9000x but it will still say the same thing (doctors are more dangerous than gun owners)",37,39,topic_stance_votes_2
39,Doctors Vs. Guns,gun control,support,Now you're just being silly.,39,40,topic_stance_votes_2
40,Doctors Vs. Guns,gun control,attack,"No, not really, if you think about it.
I agree with the first part. However, is there a way to do this and at the same time decrease the amount of accidental shootings that occur...I think there is. 
My argument and the CDC numbers shot down the initial thread, however, I did not agree doctors were more dangerous than guns. I agree that there are more ""medical misadventures"" than accidental shootings per year, which as you pointed out is a mistake by a professional health care provider leading to the death of a patient. This includes nurses, doctors, PA's, technicians, respiratory therapists, and everyone else involved in direct patient care, and even some not directly involved, such as pharmacists and laboratory workers. Now if you include all of these people in the medical misadventure category, then I would wager that there are more professional health care workers than just doctors alone as the thread suggests, and therefore a higher rate of medical misadventure vs. accidental shooting is logical. And I think the other important thing to remember is, how many people have access firearms per year, vs. how many people access health care per year. If you find that these there is more access to health care by a population than access to guns, it is only logical that the number of medical misadventures is higher than accidental shootings. This is what I meant by ""doctor owners"". 
I would still say this is a false statement. Perhaps if you said the health care system is more dangerous than gun owners, maybe. But like I pointed out above, there are many more health care workers responsible for medical misadventures than just doctors. Let me try to get those numbers.",40,41,topic_stance_votes_1

Please check out the link. I hope you enjoy it, especially towards the bottom on the graph that shows numbers of death per year on commercial flights as compared to accidental shootings. What's a matter Rev? Someone proved your original statement false with proper documentation and you feel you now have to attack tham from another angle? Get over it. And also, while I am at it, here is another interesting statistic for you. 
According to the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey of 2000, done by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), there were 823.5 million visits by patients to doctors offices in the year 2000. This does not include emergency department, access to emergency medical services outside the hospital, or inpatient services. I do not yet have the stats for these, but I'm sure the number would go closer to 1.5 billion. There are how many gun owners in the US? If you look at the total number of visits to health care professionals and the extremely low incidence of ""medical misadventures"" per patient visit, you come to the conclusion that perhaps your whole argument may need to be re-tooled.

1) She was nearly killed on 2 seperate times by given the wrong chemo. On the third seperate time before receiving the chemo he asked the make sure she was not getting a particular drug. On the last minute the doctor took the chart turned his back and scratched out a line on the chart. Yes he was about to give her the wrong drug again.
2) She was almost overdosed on radiation. Her husband caught a wrong calculation to set the radiation. The calcuation had to be done by 3 seperate people 1) attending doctor 2) the nurse 3) the radiation specialist. All of them got it wrong.
3) On another occasion the doctor recommend a course or gene therapy. When 3 years ago he wrote a paper that proved the ineffectiveness of the treatment for this particular cancer.
