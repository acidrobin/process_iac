0,True communism- tried and found wanting!,communism vs capitalism,support,"Today I woke up thinking about communism and capitalism. Over time, I've heard a lot of negative comments about capitalism--that its not 'fair' and that people are hurt by having to compete and many other things. I was thinking about how the people who espouse communism deny that the USSR was 'true communism'. 
But I was thinking that there are places where 'true' communism has been practiced for thousands of years. I, of course, am referring to the tribes living in the jungle rainforests in Brazil, Africa, and S. Asia. Now, whether or not you think that one culture is 'better' or not, we can say that, in the thousands of years they've been at it, life hasn't changed much in those cultures. They have an extremely high infant mortality rate and are acceptable to minor changes in the environment (1 year drought can wipe out a whole village, etc). These villages share everything. One must share what they kill or find for food, no private property, etc.. so there's no incentive to strive to better your position, no innovation, and no 'growth' as a culture.
Now, capitalism has only been for a few hundred years and our society has literally rocketed from agrarian to the moon. IMO This is indicative of the effort people will generate when they are able to accumulate private property. 
I'd like to get some feedback from both sides on this issue, especially people who think that capitalism isn't a good system. Thanks!",0,1,topic_stance_votes_1

For a nation to be communist, a few things need to be in place:
1) Rule by the workers, essentially a democracy
2) Classless Society
3) Communal Ownership
Now, if you look at the USSR, it was run by a few men, or one man at any one point in time. The workers had virtually no say in the direction of the nation or policy. That is antithetical to Communism. Second, classes did exist. Those higher up within the military as well as those in the party were significently better off and had more rights and powers then the average citizen. The scientists in the military and research cities had much more ownership rights and were rewarded based on a capitalistic method. The more research and applied concepts they produced the more stuff they got, like fridges and cars.

10,True communism- tried and found wanting!,communism vs capitalism,support,"Debates about what the ""better"" system is are as old as the hills and frankly will (IMO) never be resolved for the simple fact that there are serious problems with both systems. For every example like the Mek, I could give you 10 examples of poor, starving trabes in Africa that are based on a capitalist system. Neither system seems to ensure prosperity or to even increase the odds of prosperity.
Part of the problem with capitalism is with our implementation of capitalism, which more closely resembles feudalism than any classic picture of capitalism. Maybe it is a fundamental weakness of capitalist systems that those who manage to acquire wealth will use that wealth to influence whatever governing power exists in order to codify unfair advantages for themselves. It has certainly happened in every capitalist society we have ever seen, so maybe it is inherent to the capitalist system. 
In all practicality the ""best"" system for now is probably some mix of the two. IMO part of what has hampered our development as a species over the last several decades has been the idea that there are essentially 2 choices when it comes to the system we live under and we MUST pick one and defend it. The day may well come that we recognize that NEITHER system is the answer to all the worlds ills.

There seems to be some disconnect here when it comes to the definition of capitalism. Capitalism does not necessarily preclude the possibility of government investment in some areas, particularly infrastructure investment. If not for government investment, we would not be much better off than some of those tribes were were discussing earlier that despite a capitalist structure are still running around in loin cloths chucking spears at their dinner.
Look at the automobile. Before Henry Ford even finished his first factory he had employed people who did nothing but travel around trying to convince state and local governments to install automobile friendly roads. Automobiles were not well suited for the wagon tracks that passed for roads in most of the country and Ford knew that if governments, starting with federal followed by state and local, could not be convinced to install the better roads that led consumers to purchase automobiles that his brain child was going to be stillborn. 
This is what a lot of the ""free market"" advocates cannot seem to get their heads wrapped around. ""The market"" does a pretty decent job of spurring innovation when it comes to short term projects. When it comes to the longer view, the ""free market"" falls flat on its face because if there is not a profit there in the immediate and foreseeable future, nobody is going to do it. I have actually seen people argue for a market supplied solution to road building and maintenance. The argument falls flat on its face in the face of logical discussion and real world experience.
We are getting into a ""free market"" type debate of late when it comes to alternative energy research and if the free marketers have their way, we are going to end up in a crisis with large numbers of Americans starving in the streets (literally). It may already be too late.
The problem is that we are coming up on peak oil. At this point the only question is which year we passed it. The problem is that Alternative energy is still not really profitable for the most part and will not be for several more years. Thus far, the government has funded over 80% of AE research that has been done, so even the relatively minimal strides we have made there are thanks to government funding. Where the real problem comes is when oil production starts to decline. Studies have shown that in order to make it through that with only minimal disruptions (and even the ""minimal disruptions"" scenario sounds pretty bad when you consider our current lifestyles) we will have needed to start a CRASH PROGRAM similar to the Manhattan project 20 years before it occurs. 
This is jsut not something that free markets do well

19,True communism- tried and found wanting!,communism vs capitalism,support,"Dae,
I hear you and have said many times that I'm not a Laissez Faire type guy. My point was that the ability to accumulate capital (personal property) is the reason that the US is the country it is today. Sure there's a place for the govt. in ANY system, including this one. However, the reason our country has done so well, for so long and the reason we're so productive as workers is the fact that we have a right to participate in the system and accumulate wealth. 
Yes, the govt. will be needed to provide certain services. Yes, it is necessary to have rules, taxes, and a govt. to provide security and facilitate trade and etc... I've never said any different. However, there's a difference between saying that and saying that everything good has come through the govt. That's not true and if it was the USSR (or Germany) would rule the world today. The private sector is what drives the govt. and the economy. Without the Private Sector, there wouldn't be any govt. or tax money or tax payers to fund all the wonderful things that the govt. does.

Political freedom has little to do with economic systems, most ordinary citizens have little control over what is produced by the economy, and what goods are available to them. A democratically controlled command economy would actually have more scope for freedom than the current plutocratic system.

The agrairian South (Actually the South East really) was the only place in the US that used slaves. The general culture of the south was poor and rural. The US spent much more ridding our country of slaver (durring the Civil war) than that economic system ever produced. 
""A democratically controlled command economy""? Yeah, right. Private Property is what gives people the incentive to be productive. Again, the proof is in the pudding. The US isn't the most populous country nor is it the biggest. It certainly isn't the oldest. But something about this young country has propelled not only us but much of the rest of the world into the modern era with a huge middle class and a robust economy that's produced more wealth, as well as technological and medical advances.

27,True communism- tried and found wanting!,communism vs capitalism,support,"LOL. Not exactly. 
The US was originally populated as part of the European imperial drive which was itself the result of the fact that Europe was starting to bump up against some pretty serious resource constraints so they were essentially forced to adopt a (very expensive) drive to increase their territory and, by proxy, their resource base.
The US was a HUGE land just chalk full of the kind of natural resources that Europe needed. Initially it was this massive resource base that allowed the US to prosper (but only with some decidedly un-capitalist measures to encourage people to emigrate here to exploit those resources). As natural resources in Europe and England dwindled, the US make an enormous amount of money exploiting and selling ours. by 1915 fully half of the worlds gold reserves (talking bullion and coins here...not gold in place) had been produced by the United States. 
What actually allowed the US to emerge as a world leader and the richest nation in the world was WWII. Prior to WWII (and prior to the depression) Americans had a reasonably good standard of living, but nothing to write home about. Most Europeans had a comparable standard of living with many countries actually surpassing the US in that regard. When WWII came along, our government instituted massive spending programs to tool up for the war. They were careful to ensure that the money they spent for wartime production would not be wasted when the war was over. They ensured that the factories, etc.. that were built could serve a dual purpose...they could be quickly converted to civilian production in a post war world.
Post WWII we had the only intact industrial infrastructure on the planet. That gave us a pretty good edge when it came to trade. We sold the rest of the world consumer goods. WE sold them industrial goods. We financed all the sales and collected interest on them for the next 20 years. If there was ever a ""golden age"" for america, that was it. Incomes shot through the roof, standard of living shot through the roof, debt hit an all time low (people did not need to borrow...they were making too much money to need that...only about 20% of people even took out mortgages for their homes). Since all that growth was the result of the production of tangible value, inflation was not even a problem. 
We made so much money in the post WWII manufacturing boom that it pretty much has allowed us to live on our national ""savings"" and rack up debt for the last 30 years, which from an industrial standpoint have been largely unproductive. That is also why we are now the worlds biggest debtor nation, our treasury secretary keeps having to get up in front of congress and warn that we are nearing insolvency, and our comptroller keeps warning us that we may well end up a third world nation within the next couple decades. 
None of this is the result of capitalism. In fact the resource exploitation that pretty much funded the country for the first half of its existence was primarily the result of socialist like policies.

31,True communism- tried and found wanting!,communism vs capitalism,support,"Do you know what pre-communist Russia was like? What the rest of the eastern block areas were like? How advanced they were compared to the west?
Well, for starters try this: my very own Slovenia was an averagely developed area of Austro-Hungary (how do you English call it, anyway?), and when it became a part of Yugoslavia, it benefited because it was suddenly the most advanced region of Yugoslavia.
The US has had a long war free period to develop in while the soviet Russia started during an exhausting war, faced another war soon after, and even before the first war was underdeveloped.
Anyway, all beside the point. The basics of communism were only barely tried. And not in russia - poor Yugoslavia took the most experimental approaches. Marx' ideas were a critique and a proposed solution to the excesses of capitalism gone rampant. WHile the methods he proposed are suspect, at least you may want to think about what it must have been like that people went for them.
One final thought I'd like to offer, my own evaluation of communism: while it did not work out as it was supposed to (for starters, it never actually got implemented), it did offer an alternative to western capitalism, and the very existence of this alternative has made capitalist systems restrain themselves, which made capitalism better.",30,32,topic_stance_votes_1
