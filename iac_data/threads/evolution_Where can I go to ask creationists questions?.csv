16,Where can I go to ask creationists questions?,evolution,support,"Not really. What happens is that you have to lurk on most creationist forums and see if one of your questions is answered. As was pointed out, asking a specific question that the creationist moderators feel shows an anti-creation attitude can get you banned.
Even if not, many of your questions are not answerable from a creationist perspective. For example, ""where did the water come from and where did it go"" never receives a rational reply. There will be lots of just-so stories about vapor canapies and fountains of the deep and the raising and lowering of continents and sea floors, and instantaneous mountain building and runaway plate tectonics and the like, but none of the answers will be satisfactory. When all is said and done, creationists will fall back on mythology and magic.
Yes, but the statement directly contradicts proponents of ""creation science"" and of ID. Their claim is that they are doing science, even though they can't show how. Scientists have claimed all along that creationists/IDers are doing philosophy and religion, but not science. That is the problem. They never offer any evidence that supports their assertions, only mythology and superstition.
But now we have Ray admitting that creationism and ID are not science and can't be included in science. They either philosophy or theology, but not science.

There isn't a question mark in your comment.
But I think you are conflating science and the age-old debate about good and evil.
The Bible defines evil two ways: Lack of perfection = sin = evil.
Or, not doing what God says = evil.
I think you probably know this (I didn't say agree).

Why do you think that every major culture that existed from that period on has what is called a ""flood myth?"" For the love of sanity, learn some anthropology and STFU.
Scientific evidence exists supporting a worldwide massive flood at or around the time defined biblically. That doesn't mean that it was a decision by a wrath-driven god to destroy the world, but it did happen.
Also, only a misinformed imbecile or a damned liar would say that no scientist can be a creationist and no creationist can be a scientist.

27,Where can I go to ask creationists questions?,evolution,attack,"Because every ancient culture has an end of the world story, and it's generally based on the most powerful natural force in the area. For the Norse it's a never ending winter. For the Arabs in the desert, it's an all encompassing fire. And for the earliest cultures, all of which started on rivers, it's a flood.
And of course your claims that enough water to cover the worlds mountatins is contained in the ice caps and aquifers, as well as your claim that there's any evidence for a world wide flood, is simply hokum. People are always showing up here making those claims, and then disappearing when pressed for a single shred of evidence. Can we expect better from you?",25,28,topic_stance_votes_1

29,Where can I go to ask creationists questions?,evolution,support,"make the most of this screen name because it probably wont be around for long...
anthropologists found the origin to the flood story. a massive flooding of the euphrates river in persia wiped out the entire area. one man named zuisudra who had packed up some of his farm animals on a little barge was saved along with his family. his survival was out of pure luck, he was a farmer and merchant that was about to sell his animals in a market across the river, and since his boat was ready just as the floods came, he managed to save himself and his animals (link)
in reality, there was no world wide flood, and no need to justify any ice caps melting or aquifers erupting. in fact, the character noah was a hebrew adaptation of the original story, in which the event was glamorously exagerrated. the fact is, you wont find any ark remnants on mount ararat, nor evidence that the entire world was under water, because that never actually happened. the parts about God forwarning noah more than a century in advance, or giving him the specifications to build the ark, or adding 2 animals of every kind, was all included by the hebrew story-tellers to and flair and moral weight to the story, not because it was true
you should take your own advice and do read up some anthropology",25,30,topic_stance_votes_2

We need a little comic relief now and then, things were gettting pretty heavy around here. :p 
Waxy",25,31,topic_stance_votes_1
31,Where can I go to ask creationists questions?,evolution,support,"Nope. Still not enough water. We're in the end of an ice age now and even if all of the ice caps melted there wouldn't be enough water to flood the tops of the mountains. Aboout 2% of the total water on earth is tied up in ice.
Sorry. Still not enough water to cover the mountains. Like I said, 2% of the total water is in ice and about 1% is in fresh water - those aquifers that you mention would hold some of that.
Let's do a little back of the envelope calculation. The earth has a diameter of about 12756 km or radius of 6378 km. That would make a volume of 1,086,781,292,543 cubic km (4/3πr^3). Now if we increase the radius by 8.85 km (approx the height of Mt. Everest) we would get a volume of 1,091,311,568,365 cubic km. So the difference between the two would be the volume of water necessary to flood the entire earth and cover all the mountains. That would be about 4,530,275,822 cubic km of water. That's more than 4.5 billion cubic km. Now I ask again, where did all of that water come from and where did it go since the total amount of water on earth is about 1.4 billion cubic km.
That's not very intelligent. I think that many civilizations arose along rivers where they built on flood plains. The concept isn't really hard for someone who has learned some anthroplolgy.
Nonsense. There is no evidence that it happened. None. A couple hundred years ago some creationist scientists went looking for the evidence of that flood and pretty soon realized that it didn't exist. But if you think otherwise, why don't you present some of that evidence. So far all we can tell about you is that you aren't very bright and you talk a lot without learning what you are talking about.
Since you are the only one who has made such a statement, where does that place you? Do you have a reading problem?
