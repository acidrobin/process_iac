Why should people be allowed to vote on my marriage? No where else and in no other civil rights aspect do we see this type of statement.

1,Why should people be allowed to vote on my marriage,gay marriage,attack,Throughout history marriage has been more than a merely personal event. It had sociological importance for society as a whole. It wasn't a religious event although religion often sanctioned it.,1,2,topic_stance_votes_2
2,Why should people be allowed to vote on my marriage,gay marriage,attack,"Because Matthew, society has to take the time to define its standards. We don't start with the assumption that anything-goes; standards are developed over time. Your question is no different than the recent couple in Germany in the news who are brother and sister wondering why they should not be allowed to marry. Marriage laws have to have limits somewhere in terms of what sort of arrangements of people suffice to be considered marriage, and this is all a part of simply determining (over time) where those limits fall.
Many rights in our society DID have to go through a people-deciding process, so you are wrong that on no other issue do we see that sort of thing happening. In fact, even with civil rights itself, it happened in the form of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It happened earlier than that with women's suffrage. Voting on civil rights is a well established precedent. Some things have become rights, some haven't. It's a process that our society goes through in defining its standards. The problem is that some in your movement seem to want to circumvent that process.",1,3,topic_stance_votes_2
3,Why should people be allowed to vote on my marriage,gay marriage,attack,"Both the examples you provide (civil rights and women's suffrage) didn't come about because those with the power decided one day to be nice. They happened because those without the power protested and challenged the legality of the discrimination. The changes were made AGAINST the will of powerful who presumed they had moral superiority on the matter. That is EXACTLY what the gay rights movement is doing. If they had to wait on anyone's leave, they would never be granted anything.
Furthmore - whether an individual deserves rights should NEVER be a voting matter. What an utterly disgusting concept.",3,4,topic_stance_votes_1
4,Why should people be allowed to vote on my marriage,gay marriage,attack,"Indeed protesting made a difference, but it didn't happen until enough people came on board. All the protesting in the world wouldn't have brought it about if the will of the people were not changing to make it happen. At the end of the day, any legislative movement needs the will of the people to be successful. It may not need a full majority in some cases, but it needs enough people on board. That's why legislation requires not only voting (by legislature), but elected officials to do so as well. There was a process our country went through on those issues as whether or not they were legitimate in terms of the law--it involved a national debate, protests, etc. Sometimes this process results in our country (the people) granting civil rights legislation, and sometimes it doesn't (depending on whether it is deemed warranted). The process (which will undoubtedly take years) is going on right now in regards to gays. Time will tell what the result will be.
Any form of legislation is a voting matter. That's the way our system works.",4,5,topic_stance_votes_2

I will echo the point that several have made here. The idea of allowing the masses to determine civil rights is stupid and wrong. If a group's civil rights need protecting, then they need protecting from the very masses that are doing the voting. Ballot measures may be a legal process, but that doesn't prevent them from being stupid and wrong, now does it? That's the point that's trying to be made here.",11,12,topic_stance_votes_1

13,Why should people be allowed to vote on my marriage,gay marriage,attack,"An interesting question to bring up at this point is this: how does something become a civil right in the first place?
And in line with Steeeeve's point, supposing 80% of the people want to do something really stupid or unjust, they really could do it. I think he chose the high percentage because he is thinking of a Constitutional amendment. I think everyone would agree that it is silly to suppose that a Constitutional amendment could somehow be unconstitutional. So, to borrow Steeeeve's example, if a Constitutional amendment was passed which required all Jewish persons to live in Florida, well, that is what will happen. That doesn't make it morally right, but the Constitution has permitted injustice in the past, so it is certainly not out of the question that it would permit injustice in the future. But to reiterate a very important point: the American People have an excellent track record when it comes to fixing flaws in their Constitution, and remedying injustices allowed by their Constitution. And the overarching point that I (and I think at least Steeeeve as well) would suggest is that judges cannot legitimately overturn laws simply because they personally think the law is unjust. They can only legitimately overturn laws that violate the Constitution.",12,14,topic_stance_votes_2
14,Why should people be allowed to vote on my marriage,gay marriage,attack,"Then by your standard the only answer for a minority, that is unjustly targeted by a majority, is insurrection and civil war.

I see the only answer is insurrection and civil war. Yes you are right about the american people but it takes pain to get there. Slavery was only ended with war.",14,15,topic_stance_votes_1
15,Why should people be allowed to vote on my marriage,gay marriage,support,"I am trying to understand why some people think they have a right to oppose someone elses marriage, gay or straight. Why do they think they have a right to vote on my life? I am trying to understand why it is off limits to vote that all black people should not be allowed to go into certain places yet acceptable to vote on marriage. Why is it unthinkable to vote on deporting all jewish people to south carolina yet acceptable to vote on marriage. Why is it unthinkable to vote that all religious activities take place at a certain time or not at all yet acceptable to vote on marriage? 
I know we all go around and around on this issue. What I do not seem to see from those in that oppose same sex marriage is any sort of empathy. Do they ask themselves would I want someone to deny me marriage? Would I want someone I do not know telling me I can't marry the person I love? Would I want someone elses religious beliefs to effect my family?
The whole subject is very personal, as has been pointed out, it is not a personal attack upon me but a way that society sets up its rules. Yet it feels like a personal attack. It is never easy to be the one not invited to the party, to be last or not picked to be on the team, or to be excluded from something just because of who you are.",15,16,topic_stance_votes_1
16,Why should people be allowed to vote on my marriage,gay marriage,attack,"Well, that's up to you. If you don't want to derail it, you don't have to. emoticonXAngel 
It seems to me that what is really happening in society with these ballot initiatives and other parts of the process is determining whether or not it is a civil right in the first place to give legal marriage to whatever group arrangement is in question. (In this case, gays couples.) That process has to take place; it is just not feasible in our society to give marriage equality to any group of any arrangement that comes along demanding it until we determine for certain that it needs to be done. If society determines that same-sex arrangements of two people should suffice to redefine marriage for it to be included, then so be it. But that process has to be there in some form, realistically.
If you are going to draw the line in terms of what can be voted on a ballot initiative or not, what authority determines that? How are you going to determine where that line is drawn? And you can't just arbitrarily say ""when civil rights are being infringed"" because that doesn't carry any legal weight--it's opinion. Just saying it's ""stupid"" and ""wrong"" may be your point being made, but it's a point that doesn't offer any solutions.",12,17,topic_stance_votes_2
17,Why should people be allowed to vote on my marriage,gay marriage,attack,"Empathy that only involves giving up disagreement towards marriage being redefined? Is that the only standard of empathy acceptable to you here?
It may be personal, but like it or not it is a very real debate in society. There is nothing wrong with having opinions on this. This is not like your examples of forbidding black people to go into a certain places; this is about redefining a social institution in order to give benefits that could be given a different way in the first place. You aren't being prevented from entering any buildings here--you can get married if you want; no police are going to keep you out or bar the door. If you want to get married, then get married! Commit yourself to someone. The only issue here in question is the benefits. That can be covered with civil unions, and in fact that's exactly the way numerous states are handling it.",16,18,topic_stance_votes_2
18,Why should people be allowed to vote on my marriage,gay marriage,attack,"First off, there are really two types of civil rights. There are the general rights guaranteed by the government, like a right to privacy or the right to a trial, and then there are civil rights concerned with ensuring that all citizens are treated equally. We are discussing the later here, right?
The rights of all citizens are, in theory, equal. In reality, some groups have those rights infringed upon. When this happens and gets recognized a law gets passed (hopefully) saying ""No, you can't deny someone such and such a right just because they belong to such and such a group"". So, discrimination occurs, gets recognized, gets redressed. That's how it happens. And the reason leaving this to ballot measures is so absurd is that if the discrimination is widespread, then naturally it won't be acknowledged, and certainly won't get redressed.
Have we had this discussion before? Can you show a case where this has actually happened, or are you just playing devil's advocate here? Specifically in the case of gay marriage, let's not drag all of US legal history into this please. :)",14,19,topic_stance_votes_1
19,Why should people be allowed to vote on my marriage,gay marriage,attack,"You really are a piece of work.
All you're saying here is that if society wants to be bigoted it should be allowed to be. Very libertarian of you, but I believe that if the power of the government can be used to fight evil and prejudice, it should. If wrong is happening, and the government can stop it, it should. You will of course claim that the government can't do anything, but history has proven that position wrong. The government has taken stands against biggotry before, and while it hasn't eradicated it, it has improved things.
Gee, now I'm supposed to offer solutions before you even get what the point is? I'm I allowed to use both hands while I type? Any other restrictions you want to add? emoticonXDonno",17,20,topic_stance_votes_1
20,Why should people be allowed to vote on my marriage,gay marriage,attack,"Well, no not really. I'm saying that it has to go through a process of determining what is bigoted and what is reasonable in the first place by determining the standards, and I think voting on ballot initiatives is part of that process. Just because someone says something is bigotry does not automatically make it so. What determines whether or not an issue on a ballot initiative is 'bigotry' is the issue being voted on (and the standards society sets on it). For example, in Germany recently, there is a lot of news about a brother and sister who are wanting legal marriage. As a result Germany is having to go through a process of determining if they should provide legal marriage for incest couples (and they are giving it serious consideration). So there is a process over which it is determined if this couple is experiencing bigotry or not. I think these ballot initiatives are part of that process here in terms of gay marriage.
If evil and wrong are indeed happening, then sure. That's what we're determining as a society, as well as the best way to fix it. Just using terms like ""wrong"" and ""evil"" may make for great rhetoric, but it doesn't determine anything here. No one is disagreeing that the govt should put a stop to evil and wrong; the issue is a.) whether or not evil and wrong are indeed taking place in the issue of gay marriage (and therefore using the issue on ballot initiatives), and b.) how to best deal with it if it IS evil and wrong (civil unions, redefining marriage, etc.) My point is that I think ballot initiatives are simply a way to help determine these things on a controversial issue in society. How would you determine what issues are valid for use on ballot initiatives? What criteria would you use? Or would you throw out the whole concept of ballot initiatives altogether regardless of the subject matter?
But I do get your point. And I wouldn't think that offering solutions would be a restriction; I would think you would want to do that. But whatever.",20,21,topic_stance_votes_2
21,Why should people be allowed to vote on my marriage,gay marriage,attack,"I'm not sure that being treated equally, in general or without qualification, is a civil right. The point I was trying to make with my question was that it is majorities that guarantee civil rights.
My statement was only general. It is Matthew's position that judges should overturn laws they (ahem, he) thinks are unjust even where there is no legal basis to do so. I do not think this is legitimate. From my past discussions with you, I think you are likely to agree with me on this.",19,22,topic_stance_votes_2

I submit that you would be a lot more successful in your endeavor if you would stop suggesting that the courts should just ignore the law and do what you want them to do.
No one is saying that the minority does not have access to the courts. But it is quite obvious that the minority is not always going to win in court. Judges overturn laws if they violate the Constitution. If the challenged law doesn't do that, then the minority should lose.
Well, the 19th Amendment was not passed because of insurrection or civil war.",15,23,topic_stance_votes_2
23,Why should people be allowed to vote on my marriage,gay marriage,support,"Matthew, in one regard I agree with you. I believe fully in the right of the individual to do what he will. It is when those individual rights come into conflict that society becomes involved. I am not harmed because one man wishes to live for all eternity with another; it is his sovereign right to make that decision. That man can even establish a legal construct to ensure that his fortune is inherited. Again, no harm to me. Where I come into the picture is when the gentlemen seek to pass a peremptory acceptance by all of society on their actions. You wish to compel me, as a member of society to say “yey, I approve this action” when I in fact do not. In so doing, you violate my own right to self determination. Once two individuals with a common claim on a right come into conflict it falls to the purview of the society to effect legislation concerning the common good. 
I should also like to question your postulation that less than full acceptance = hate. Voting for a democrat does not make one a Republicanphobe does it? Non acceptance of an individual’s philosophy does not equal hate of that philosophy. The notion that I must tolerate and pay obeisance to every action of the homosexual community in the name of tolerance is absurd. 
If a State seeks to define marriage as a union between a Man and a Woman, then so be it, provided there be an avenue for civil union. This is no different than a State establishing certification and licensing criteria for Doctors and Engineers. If you do not meet the Criteria, you cannot call yourself a Professional Engineer. This is not a violation of your civil rights any more than if you, as a couple, do not meet the State definition of marriage.",23,24,topic_stance_votes_2
24,Why should people be allowed to vote on my marriage,gay marriage,attack,"Obviously not. That's why we have specific laws, instead of a blanket ""Everyone must be treated equally"". Differences do exist, and some are reasonable to act upon. You can fire someone for being a bad worker, you can't fire someone for being Jewish. That would be a violation of civil rights.
But that isn't correct. It's the law that guarantees civil rights, not the majority. The law is in fact there to protect the civil rights of minorities from the majority. The purpose of the law isn't to codify the will of the people. Nominally it's to protect and serve the people, and sometimes that requires preventing them from doing things they want to do. You can't kill just cause you're mad, you can't take something just because you want it, and you can't oppress someone just because you don't like a group they're in.

It really is simply my response to Matthew's position, which you do not share, that the judiciary is supposed to overturn any laws that appear to be unjust, even when there is no legal basis for the action.

It seems to me a better approach is to show compassion toward AIDS victims and help them rather than play the blame game.

""This is considered inaccurate, as HIV had spread long before Dugas [the flight attendant] began his career. This rumor may have started with Randy Shilts' 1987 book And The Band Played On (and the movie based on it, in which Dugas is referred to as AIDS' Patient Zero), but neither the book nor the movie state him to have been the first to bring the virus to North America. He was called ""Patient Zero"" because at least 40 of the 248 people known to be infected by AIDS in 1983 had had sexual intercourse with him, or with someone who had sexual intercourse with him. However, four years after the publication of Shilts' article, Dr. Darrow repudiated his study, saying that its methods were flawed and claiming that Shilts had misrepresented its conclusions.""

To which, I replied:
Now, for those that think it was a vaguely worded assertion, I followed with a clarification:
And from there, the spindoctors went off on an African safari. 
Notice, nowhere did I claim that HIV can't be transmitted via hetero sex, although several posters tried to spin my statement into such a claim. I said that had Patient zero been straight, there's a possibility that Patient 1 wouldn't have existed. We know that it's more difficult to transmit sex via straight sex, so there's nothing wrong with posing the 'what if' scenario. I'm sure that gays don't like thinking that they are the reason that AIDS has reached such a level in the US, but that doesn't change the basic facts.
I, also, mentioned the other avenues that HIV spread in the US, but they trailed the spread in the gay community. 
And your assertion, in bold above, is inaccurate. Straights can't catch AIDS just as easily as gays. Transmission vaginally is less likely to result because there is less risk of blood/blood contact, for one thing and most straights aren't heavy into the Hershey Highway. The common risk areas are blood transfusions and dirty needles, which were/are(?) lower on the statistical ladder for spreading HIV.",135,138,topic_stance_votes_2

Especially in the regions where being gay is even more taboo then it is in the US. And like I said, if you look at the actual infection rates, and not just make up stuff like you seem to be doing, you see that there is no significant difference in the US between gays and straights, once you take initial infection pools into account. I'm citing real data here, do you have anything to back up your claims?

This one focuses on marriage in american-indian tribes, and how the homosexuals were actually greatly valued as healers and prophets.
Just take a look at the Old Testament to find marriages between one man and many women. Polygamy is also present in African and Islamic culture too.
And in some tribes in Nigeria, there is a culture of polyandry (one woman, many men).

That the present argument for homosexual unions has not overcome the status quo is testament to the rejection of the notion rather than the weakness of the present condition.
Presently, all those benefits may be derived through civil union, wills, estate plans, etc. Simply calling the union a marriage will not provide the panacea ye seek. If ye think heterosexual unions are bulletproof, witness the sad case of Anna Nicole Smith.

Incorrect, on a couple of fronts.

Well argued indeed. My compliments. If I may continue to respectfully disagree:
Do you realize that that makes no logical sense? I pointed out concrete examples of when the status quo was bad. Yes, those cases have been weeded out. Are you trying to state that everything bad in the status quo has already been eliminated? Because unless that's your thesis your conclusion simply doesn't follow. 
You can point to times the status quo was bad, I can point to times when the status quo was (is) good. Where is the relevance? I concede that my argument gives the impression that I was arguing “The status quo is always good, except when it’s bad, but then it is changed and becomes good again.” That was not my intent. My point was rather that the status quo requires critical mass to change. That critical mass has not yet been achieved. Pundits on both sides argue that because of X in the past, Y in the present should happen. My point was that this is irrelevant and that the point must be decided on its own merit.

The gubment is not responsible for your psychological fulfillment. Further, tax benefits doth not an argument make. The blind currently receive generous tax deductions on account of their lack of vision. This does not argue effectively for blindness. The tax incentive is a case of quid pro quo, whereby society expects to receive a benefit from that heterosexual union. This benefit is presently not ascribed to the homosexual union by society. Folks currently receive a tax credit of $1,000 per child. This doth not constitute discrimination against the single, or the childless.

Once again ye seem to read as randomly as a moth skittering about an open flame. Unfortunately, I stand by my previous diagnosis re: your thought capacity as demonstrated by your latest attempt at riposte.

May I say that ye have again mischaracterized what I have stated. For your benefit, allow me to repost:
“I gave a specific case of homosexuals display in a St. Patrick’s Day parade as hikacking of heritage. I in no way intimated that the homosexual lifestyle was hijacking heritage.”
As you missed my earlier point, let me restate it simply: The average homosexual is not a nut and not a hijacker or heritage. This is part of my earlier argument that the messenger is as important as the message. 
The nut is the individual who goes to a St. Patrick’s Day parade and insists on drawing attention to his sexuality, be that individual a homosexual or heterosexual. Note, that I do not wish to see homosexuals barred from the parade, but a recognition that the event is not about sexuality. If ye are Irish and homosexual ye are no less Irish than if ye are Irish and heterosexual. Activists who insist on carrying banners proclaiming their sexual proclivities have no part of a parade on city streets be they hetero or homo. 
This is not about discrimination, this is not about protest, this is about decorum. When ye engage in behavior in public, prepare to be judged on that behavior. That is precisely what Joe is doing, and if this is bigotry, ye are complicit in it by not decrying the actions of the fringe. Joe hears the argument that homosexuals should be free to do what they will in the privacy of their own homes, then is confronted with the image of banner carrying protestors in a public parade dedicated to Irish heritage. Joe is receiving a message, but it is not the message ye want to send.
Ye believe that your message is bulletproof, irrespective of the messenger. My point is that the message is often trumped by the messenger. 
So lets recap:
I have acknowledged:
That the actions in question are committed by the fringe
That the fringe does not reflect the actions of mainstream homosexuals
I have not argued against homosexuality. I have not attacked homosexuals. If anything, I have presented a course of action by which your goals might be realized. This does not fit with my definition of bigotry.
Again: My premise is not that homosexuality is wrong, but rather, that the arguments in favor of homosexual marriage has not reached the critical mass to effect change. I believe that through thoughtful advocacy such as that made by Kronus and Coyote, that this change may be made. I also note that others actions are slowing what some consider to be inevitable.",269,270,topic_stance_votes_2

There is no need to educate or to increase awareness and visibility when it comes to straight people. This is a problem for some, because it involves gays. Just like the holdling hands in public issue, and the gay movies, TV shows and books and pride parades and marriages. It only bothers some because the common denominator is gay. 
There are other groups, which would not be directly related to being specifically Irish, which receive recognition.
I don't agree that they are the fringe.

Let me make this easier for you. I will grant you that myself, JP, and every other opponent of gay marriage is a bigot. That means there are approximately 140 million bigots in this nation that polls have identified as opposing homosexual marriage.
Now what?
You have spent all this energy calling your opponents bigots, how much energy has been invested in persuading said bigots? Have you resigned yourself that you cannot sway your opponents with the merit of your argument?
Calling your opponent a bigot does not solve your problem. Your opponent can just as easily say “He’s a homosexual.” Now you are playing the label game. How does one side advance? You have to get out of the rhetorical trench warfare. Your opponent would like nothing more than for you to continue to refer to him as a bigot. If he is truly bigoted, he could care less what you, a homosexual (or colorful colloquialism for same) has to say about him. Harsh? Perhaps, but reality can be that way. Now if your opponent is not a bigot, but a person sitting on the fence because of vague religious or moral notions, ye have lost that person as a potential advocate through your labeling.

Let me be really clear here. By Federal law, the actual law written in the actual books, the only people who get marriage benefits are married people. No other classification qualifies. If you want to get the marriage benefits you have to be legally married, and thanks to DOMA you also need to be opposite sex. When you say these benefits can be given to gays, I have to assume that you're using some hypothetical, parallel universe meaning of ""can"". The same sort of way that robbing a bank ""can"" be legal, all you have to do is live somewhere that has totally different laws.

What you say (No other classification qualifies.) is quite true...but it can be changed. Another classification (or two) could be added to the list of those who qualify for benefits.

A legal term just got changed somewhere while you were reading this, and you didn't even notice. And including gays by changing the law is exactly what we're campaigning for. Change one law, and guarantee equal rights for gays.
Do you understand that married couples get rights and benefits that aren't granted by law? 
Companies extend benefits to spouses that they don't extend to live-in boyfriends, married people get social recognition that SO's don't, people get to ride in the ambulance with their injured spouse but not their ""partners"". Try to put aside your feelings and think about the issue with an open mind, try to realize just how important being included in marriage is, how extensively people's lives are effected by it. The fact that you're so dead set against it just lends further evidence to the fact that it's an important institution, and exclusion from it has real consequences, only some of which are legal. The only, absolutely only way to get all the rights and benefits of a married couple is to be a married couple. Anything else is simply the leavings handed down to second class citizens.
No, you really don't get this. It isn't a ""list"". There isn't a table of benefits, and a chart at the end on how to qualify. You can't just append another group on the end. The laws say that the benefits go to married people and no one else, and they say it seperately for each law. If you want to change the laws to give gays equal access to benefits you'd have to change every single relevant law, one by one. Hundreds and hundreds of them, each one a separate fight.
