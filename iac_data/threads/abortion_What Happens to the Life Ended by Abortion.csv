0,What Happens to the Life Ended by Abortion,abortion,support,"At conception a particular individual's DNA is established. This is a scientific fact. So from conception one certain individual is forming and most likely will be born if the pregnancy is allowed to proceed (the majority of pregnancies allowed to proceed result in a live, healthy baby).
Now, if the mother chooses to abort that person will not be born. You or I would not be here if we had been aborted. And why not? Because that person's life was ended while still in the womb. 
Consider that person whose life was ended by abortion. How is abortion not killing? Why does it not matter to you that a life is ended by abortion? Even if it was just a clump of cells (I can hear this one coming) in the beginning, the fact is, in the end it will most likely be a live human being and that isn't changed by it's alleged ""clump of cells in the beginning"" status.

All abortion gets lumped into three categories - rape, medical reasons and birth control - as if that is all that impacts a pregnancy.

A more accurate way of saying what you said is ""B/c stops conception (the union of the egg and sperm)."" Most all contraceptives work to stop the conception. Only a much higher power dose will cause an abortion, as in the post-coital pill (or ""morning-after pill""). It will work up to 72 hours after conception and still only prevents 85% of pregnancies.

Agreed. In fact, I'll go as far as to say everyone should practice both if they do not wish to have children. Unfortunately, this is not the case.
Nor should women be required to remain pregnant against their will and without their consent. Women's rights should not be violated in this manner, even to ensure the survival of another.
Is forced responsibility really responsible? In any case, pregnancy is not something that should be used as a punishment for irresponsible behavior. Women should not be forced to endure detrimental changes to their body, just because they, according to you, need to ""accept responsibility"". 
No. Every pregnancy should be wanted. No one should enter motherhood because she has no other choice. That is an exteremly sick view, imo.
I see now. ""They've got to learn"". You plan on punishing women for having sex by making continuing the pregnancy mandatory. ""Do the crime, do the time"", eh?
I'm sorry, but sex is not a crime and pregnancy should never, ever, ever be used merely as a punishment, a beating stick, or a learning tool. Just because a woman is irresponsible is not an excuse for violating her rights in this manner.
And by golly you're going to make them appreciate it, eh?
Perhaps they want children later. Why don't you have your testicles chopped off if you don't want children right now?
Steeeeve,
Why must the woman pay?
Is it the woman's?
Punishing the woman is? Violating her rights is the right thing to do? Do you even think before you type?
The ""kid"" doesn't care. It doesn't have the capacity to care.
So your solution is to make her scars even worse? To force her to continue a pregnancy on a cervix that is perhaps bruised by the rape? To force her to be in pain every day, to have a reminder of the rape growing inside her for 9 months? And then, at the end, giving birth to this reminder in even more pain, in even more blood?

You said violating her rights is the right thing to do. The only rights violated where the womens when she got raped.

If you have to include time-travel to make your points, don't bother.
The ""unborn"" (this term amuses me, I always think ""undead"" to refer to the living) has no rights to violate. Even if the fetus did have rights, the woman's rights do and should take precedence over them.
If you force the woman to remain pregnant against her will, you are making the fetus' rights to her body superior to hers and you are violating the rights of a thinking, feeling person who is a citizen of this country (assuming this is the US). A few weeks old embryo is none of these things. The fetus and the woman are in constant conflict in terms of the use of her bodily resources, and the woman's right to those resources are and should always be more important than the (non-existant) right of the fetus to her body.

time travel is a perfectly valid arguement and I do not see why I can't make it. The child doesn't have the ability to speak right away but one would assume in time it could and would probably want to be alive. This is however a weak arguement because it is hard to speak for someone whom you don't know. Although if you don't know what he/she would say...you should probably find out because he/she is just as much of a person as you or I.
if the unborn is a person it has rights. To say unborn is kind of like saying child or adult...it is simply a stage of life. So if the unborn has rights then they cannot be violated no matter how much of a burden it is on someone else. To say the mother shouldn't have to have the baby because she doesn't want it doesn't seem fair if one believe the unborn is a person (if one doesnt then its a different debate). If one does believe it the unborn is a person then it has the same right to live as you and I. This does not the fetus rights superior but rather equal to the mothers. The fact that she is raped is sad and the person that did it should probably rot in hell (my own opinion) but mean someone elses life should be destroyed too. I do understand your point that the mother not only had to go through a rape but now a pregnancy and sadly life is unfair like that. She was not treated fairly at all. We try to amend that by sending that guy to jail to make it as fair as possible. Killing a child is really unfair to the unborn child so what amend is there to make that fair?

lol
In your zealousness to ""speak for the unborn"" you are forgetting that by doing that you are also speaking for the woman, who is perfectly capable of speaking for herself. The arrogance in assuming you know what is best for her in a situation as personal as pregnancy is, frankly, disgusting. It is her body. No matter your pure and noble goals in ""speaking for the unborn"", that fact does not change.
It is much more than simply a stage of life. I know it helps your points to trivialize the woman's... contribution (to put it very lightly), but I will not accept that her role is unimportant. She is, and will continue to be, of paramount importance in the pregnancy relationship.
No. The gov't should not have the right to violate your or my rights, even to ensure the survival of someone else. The gov't does not have a deed to the woman's womb to hand over to another. Her right to her body and her privacy is still there, and that includes the right to terminate the life-support proess she is involved in.
In your own words: ""sadly life is unfair like that""
The woman is a person and is a citizen, uncontested. Her rights are superior to the fetus' (non-existant) rights. Always. Their rights cannot be equal, because they are both using her body. If she does not want it there, then they are in conflict, and the woman's rights should always be superior to what is growing inside her. To make the fetus' rights to her body as superior to her own is a twisted view, imo.
None have the right to live at another's expense as the fetus is doing. You do not have that right, I do not have that right, and the fetus does not have that right.
""life is unfair like that"" How nice and comforting to the woman. Yet you still want to be fair to the fetus? Which do you care more about? I think we can tell.

Your first point about 80% being done is the first trimester I believe is true (from what I read). Are you saying you only support abortions in the first trimester?
If you don't like the time travel arguement then fine. You might have misread what I wrote too. I said it is a weak arguement for me to say I can speak for someone that I don't know. The point I was making is that you are right, I shouldn't be able to speak for he or she but he/she should speak for its self. I by no means said I am speaking for the best interest of the women. The best interest of the women is selfish and irrelevant. One does not always get to do what is in their best interest. An example would be me killing the guy that I am competing for a job with. It would be in my best interest so I get the job. The point is one have to be fair to both sides, the mother and child.
you said this ""It is much more than simply a stage of life. I know it helps your points to trivialize the woman's... contribution (to put it very lightly), but I will not accept that her role is unimportant. She is, and will continue to be, of paramount importance in the pregnancy relationship.""
This does not make sense to me because no where did I try to trivialize the womens role. I just said saying unborn is like saying child or adult...you call it what it is. To call a child a child is not undermining it. I honestly don't know where you might have gotten that conclusion from.
You say the government does not have the right to violate your rights or my rights to save someone else. I am assuming (and please correct me because if I am wrong because I am assuming) that you mean the right of the mother to abort the unborn. If you believe that it is a life then it has rights and thus the government can prevent you from hurting it. It comes down to, is the unborn a life, if yes, then it has rights, guarnteed by our the Constitution (assuming US). No one person has greater rights then the other.
I believe you state next that no one has the right to live at anothers expense. I will have to say I disagree with this 100%. Me living creates an expense to many yet I still have a right to live. Just because I happen to be a burden does not mean I don't get to live. A one month old child is a burden or expense on the mother and still cannot be killed.
you say I still want to be fair to the fetus even after the women was raped...Yes I do. The opposite would imply that it is ok to be unfair to the fetus because of the wrong doing of a man to a women. That doesn't make sense to me. The fetus did nothing wrong, the man did. The man should be punished. Who do I care about? I care about the innocent. In this case, mother and child. The one punished should be the man only. Having the baby is not a punishment to the women.
I believe the problem here is that you feel the rights of the women are above the unborn child because child happen to be produced in her. This just happens to be how people are created....the women carries the baby and I understand that sometimes she may not want the baby. But my agruement is that once a life is created no one can take away his or her right to life based on not being wanted or any other reason. I don't see one life greater than another even if it relies on someone to live. For the arguement that the women didnt consent...most cases she does, she consented to sex and therefore created a life and has no right to end that life.

60,What Happens to the Life Ended by Abortion,abortion,attack,"No, I support a woman's right to choose as long as the fetus is living off of her body.
It cannot. It cannot choose, it has no concept of choice. In situations such as these, it is right for the mother to make the decision for it.
Ah, the cry of the pro-lifer. The woman is being selfish so we disregard her desires. The woman was irresponsible so we’ll make the decisions for her. The woman can’t make decisions for herself so we’ll make them all for her.
How does that analogy even apply? The other person is not living off of your bodily processes, you have a myriad of choices to be rid of him that do not involve violence against him. In the pregnancy relationship, a woman has one choice to be separated from the fetus.
You’re right, I did say that ;)
When you describe the fetus as at merely another stage of life similar to childhood and adulthood, you are trivializing the woman’s rather large role in providing complete and total bodily support during that stage. The focus should not be on the fetus, but on the woman. She is of paramount importance.
No, I mean generally. The gov’t does not have the power to force you to donate organs or blood, even to ensure the survival of another. In the same sense, you are right that the gov’t also does not have the power to force a woman to donate bodily resources to the fetus.
You’re making that idiotic statement again. It is not guaranteed rights because it is a life. You are only guaranteed rights if you are a citizen. Others are only given rights if there is a big enough outcry for them, but they are not guaranteed. Trust me, the US gov’t does not govern its foreign policy with the Constitution.
Do you practice being obtuse? None of what you describe are living at the unwilling expense of another’s bodily resources.
A one month old child can be put up for adoption, a pregnant woman does not have that option.
That’s fine, except you are being unfair to the woman. If one has to choose, one should be fair to the woman first.
And if you are unfair to the woman to be fair to the “child”? Where does that fall, oh moral one? Which is better, being unfair to the woman to be fair the fetus, or being unfair to the fetus to be fair to the woman? You seem to believe the former, but I believe the latter.
No, I believe that because they are not equals, one necessarily must have superior rights. In the pregnancy relationship, the woman is more important than the fetus.
Er, ok. This does not mean that it cannot be changed.
Oh? And why is that? No reason, not even to save the woman’s life, eh? You obviously have a low view of women, less important than a fetus. You would kill the woman to save the fetus.
That isn’t the argument. One life isn’t greater than another (for who determines the value of life?), the woman’s rights are greater than the fetus’. In a situation where one has to choose between enforcing the woman’s rights or the fetus’ rights, the woman’s rights should always take precedence because she is the most important participant in the pregnancy relationship.

She makes the decision for herself. She decides if her body is involved in the life-support function of pregnancy.
A conjoined twin is much different. They formed at the same time, and one does not ""own"" the body. In the pregnancy relationship the body is distinctly the woman's, and the fetus is living off of it.

""of or relating to a judgment, the function of judging, the administration of justice, or the judiciary ""
In order to judge a case, they have to decide what the Constitution means. In your example of the stoplight/stopsigns, they had a case they needed to judge. Since, according to the mythical constitution that they judge according states that if you run a stopsign you get a ticket, these judges decide that the intent was to stop people from running all manner of intersection signals. They needed to decide what the constitution said about that issue in general to decide a particular case.
If it is required to judge a case, then yes they do. You forget, the one power they are given is so vague (basically just go out and administer justice) that they have any power they need in order to carry out that one power. There is nothing limiting their power, so they have any power they desire (within some limits) in order to carry out their Constitutional duty.
That is the Supreme Court's function. How can you possibly say that the Supreme Court is not supposed to interprete the Constitution? You want them to ""go by what it say"" but do you realize there are scholars devoted to interprete shadings of meaning that are in what the Constitution says? Even something as simple as ""the right of every citizen to bare arms shall not be infringed"" is debated about in what each and every word means. The Courts job is to be the ultimate decider in what the Constitution means. That is why they were formed, that is what they do.",91,92,topic_stance_votes_2
92,What Happens to the Life Ended by Abortion,abortion,attack,"No, they can't do that because that is legislating from the bench...they now created a law that says you can't run a stop light and that was not the orginal law. In that case they couldn't do anythign for the person that ran the stop light. Only Congress is allowed to say you can't run a stop light if a law doesn't already exisit saying so. Remember the judges are not elected so for them to do anything more then using the laws on the books would be putting their own beliefs to become law and we are trying to not do that.
Oh and the definition is applied to all the courts because that same article in the constitution makes the Supreme Court.",92,93,topic_stance_votes_1
93,What Happens to the Life Ended by Abortion,abortion,attack,"No, it wouldn't because they created no law. They didn't rewrite what the existing law said, either. They set a precedent on how that law is applied. 
Congress can't say anything. Only judges can. Congress can make whatever law they see fit, but judges are the only ones who apply them.
Whether or not judges (any judges) are elected is immaterial to the argument. The act of sitting in judgement requires them to use their own judgement on how the law is supposed to be applied. That requires them to make an interpretation on the law, what the law means.
I don't know what you are talking about here. The only passage that refers to the creation of the Supreme Court also gives it one duty. To administer justice. With no limits specified, they have basically whatever power they feel they need to have in order to follow through on that.",93,94,topic_stance_votes_2
94,What Happens to the Life Ended by Abortion,abortion,attack,"Once again...you cant rule on a law that does not exist...if it doesnt exist you cant create it to set precedent on how the law is applied. The congress has to make the law saying you cant run a stop light. If a law doesn't say that then the court cant say you can. Judges can't create law at all....thats how we set it up.
...you say congress can't say anything? Congress makes the laws! Thats what they are there for. Courts are the ones that cant say anything. They just have the ability to look at the law and see if it applies...in the case of thet stop light...no law....person that ran it gets off.",94,95,topic_stance_votes_1
95,What Happens to the Life Ended by Abortion,abortion,attack,"They aren't ruling on a law that doesn't exist. In fact, they aren't doing anything because this entire scenario was created in our heads ;)
In our mythical scenario, they aren't creating a law. They are setting a precedent on how an existing law is applied in a similar situation, and as the original laws was intended to apply, to the judges mind.
And they still do not create laws. In our scenario, since Congress didn't make a law, judges have to rule based on how they believe the law should be applied. Of course, our specific scenario would never get to court because a police officer couldn't arrest you when there is no law broken.
I think we need a new example. We are getting bogged down and confused because SCOTUS is different than the inferior courts because SCOTUS rules based on the Constitution, not necessarily based on the laws on the books. They judge Constitutionality. Also, the case we've created would never have gone to court, as I noted above.
Congress has no say in how it's applied. Their power ends with the wording of the law. If they want it applied a certain way, they better damn well put limits and caveats in there, otherwise it will be used in any situation that lawyers and judges can twist the wording to mean.
Incorrect. Taking the case of The Supreme Court, the judges have almost complete discresion in applying the law. Lesser courts have lesser freedom to do so.
Well, in the case of the stoplight there was no law to get him to court in the first place. However, if that case were before the Supreme Court and the stopsign law was in the Constitution, the judges there would and should have every right to say ""the intent was to govern intersection traffic so we are applying that here"". This falls well with their one and only duty of ""administering justice""",95,96,topic_stance_votes_2
96,What Happens to the Life Ended by Abortion,abortion,attack,"But in setting precedent that created a new law that says you can't run stop lights because now you can't run stop lights while before there was no law. The judge also has power to find intent of the orginal law. The judge did not create it and therefore can't rule on intent. Maybe the ones making the orginal law wanted people to run stop lights...how does the judge know?
We probably should clearify our example....law in the constituition says you cant run stop signs.....no law about stop lights anywhere.....guy runs stop light and hurts person he plows into. Person takes guy to court...lets say Supreme Court for the heck of it.....the Court as this point can only rule based on laws that exist at that point. The judge can see the law about stop signs but cannot infer from that what congress would do in the case of stop lights...he is there to rule on the laws that exist not to create anything new. I will grant that this has not been the practice of the courts lately but many judges such as Scalia are ****** because of it.",96,97,topic_stance_votes_1
97,What Happens to the Life Ended by Abortion,abortion,attack,"A precedent is not law. No law is created, no law is rewritten.
I'm very glad you asked that question, steve :D The judge doesn't ""know"", but that is the reason we have judges. Each of us can look at a certain law and say ""this is what it means"" but each of us could have a different interpretation. We empower judges to be the ""standard"" interpretation that everyone goes by. Otherwise, there could be a thousand times a thousand different interpretations of a certain law or a certain passage in the Constitution. Judges exist, partly, to be an impartial and fair interpretation of the law.
You don't know how many constitutional scholars disagree about certain passages and what have you. The Supreme Court can say ""this is what it means"" and have the authority to make it stick.
The Court does not infer what Congress would do. They infer what the Constitution was meant to protect, regardless of what the law says. Congress can go hang for all they can do about it.
Honestly, without the Supreme Court having this power what is to protect us from unconstitutional laws that Congress could pass?",97,98,topic_stance_votes_2
98,What Happens to the Life Ended by Abortion,abortion,attack,"its not a ""law"" but it kinda acts like one....on further review on our example, its not a good one to saw what I am trying to say because a stop sign law really has a strong intent and is written for intersection saftey...so thats not a good example...once my left pinky finger heals I will type out another example :)

100,What Happens to the Life Ended by Abortion,abortion,attack,"Tumors don't have a unique set of DNA.
They have the same genome as the person they are growing on.
The only difference is that genes involved in apoptosis are suppressed or mutated (if one mutation creates a new genome in your eyes then maybe it is an entirely new individual to you, but i wouldn't agree since there are mutations and misreads taking place pretty often but they get repaired before they can do much damage).",4,101,topic_stance_votes_1

102,What Happens to the Life Ended by Abortion,abortion,attack,"There is generally a lot of mutations, not just one and it does technically code for something other than a person - if you cloned a tumour cell, you would get more tumour cells rather than a copy of the original organism.
Its not quite the same, but the argument that abortion is wrong because a new set of DNA and therefore a person is made at conception is absurd",101,103,topic_stance_votes_2
103,What Happens to the Life Ended by Abortion,abortion,attack,The arguement for DNA making it a person is not one of my favorites however DNA specialists have concluded that their view is life beings at conception due to DNA...this is just one aspect of the science view on abortion.,103,104,topic_stance_votes_1
104,What Happens to the Life Ended by Abortion,abortion,attack,"Well, there's a minimum of one persistent mutation in a tumor suppressing region.
Usually its in the p53 gene, which regulates apoptosis, but it could be on other genes. 
Well, anyway, I can't see how one can make the comparison of a tumor to an embryo. 
One is terminated because it threatens the life of a person and the other is terminated for other various reasons, but rarely to save a life.
I'll just say that at conception, a new individual human is formed. I really don't see how there is any question about that. An embryo is a human. The reason I sit on the fence about this issue is that it's such a rudimentary form of human that I don't think you can call it a ""person"" whatever that means. I just don't like the idea of ending the life of an embryo, especially for selfish reasons. 
I think it would be interesting if humans laid eggs.
Then, we would be debating whether it was right to scramble them, where is the line where you can scramble them or not, and is it murder to scramble your fertilized eggs. Then there would be a clear visual for everyone (humans always seem to need visual aids). Then, there would be a clear line drawn. While the egg is forming with the zygote inside, a surgery could be performed that aborted the egg formation, but once the egg is laid, I would bet there would be laws to protect it.
Just a thought. :)",103,105,topic_stance_votes_1
