0,And now for a story that you will NOT hear at most media outlets,abortion,support,"It turns out that Planned Parenthood has found itself in quite a debacle after an 18 year old college student video taped one of its counselors trying to encourage a deception in order to circumvent California law.
The 18 year old student posed as a 15 year old girl who got pregnant from her 23 year old boyfriend, an instance that is defined as statutory rape. California law requires that Planned Parenthood report such cases. However, this employee suggested that the student simply ""figure out a birth-date that works"" in order to make it appear as though she was 16 in which case there would be no statutory rape to be reported.
The story and video can be found here: http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewCulture.a...20070515b.html.
Given these facts, there is no doubt that the employee was trying to figure out a way to perpetrate a deception in order to circumvent the law. It is also true that the video taping of parties without their consent is likewise a violation of California law.
With that established, I would be interested in your comments.",0,1,topic_stance_votes_1
1,And now for a story that you will NOT hear at most media outlets,abortion,attack,"I cannot comment on the particular legal case - deception to circumvent the law vs. illegality of taping of parties without consent and the admissability of that evidence. Technically, the counselor was acting illegally and should be prosecuted for it.
However, morally, I have mixed feelings about forcing counselors (and others who are placed in a position of trust by those using their services) to inform on their clients without the client's consent. It undermines the trust that one can put in such a counselor. I would rather have young women who are underage be able to trust a counselor and, perhaps, have the counselor be required, by law, to pass on certain information about the legality or give certain advice. I just think that these girls need to know that they can trust such counselors if they go to them. That includes having it be the client's (girl's) choice whether the counselor informs the authorities about the relationship.
That being said, there may be extreme cases (as with a 40 year old using his authority to pressure a 14 year old into sex, where the 14 year old is too scared to say anything) where a counselor informing the authorities without the client's consent would be a good idea. I think there needs to be some way of defining laws or policies which could catch the outrageous cases while still allowing such young clients to be able to trust their counselors.",1,2,topic_stance_votes_2

3,And now for a story that you will NOT hear at most media outlets,abortion,support,"I would say that both parties have a case here. The clinic and worker were taped without consent which does violate CA law.

Can't really dispute the fact that the law was broken when you have seen the video. 
In the same respect, the actions of the planned parenthood clinic are deplorable. Instructing a girl claiming to be 15 years old to lie in order to circumvent parental notification and state notification laws is rediculous. Again, after seeing the video, there is really no denying what was said. 
The only question I wonder about is if the video would be admissible in a court of law due to the fact that it was illegally made.",3,4,topic_stance_votes_2
4,And now for a story that you will NOT hear at most media outlets,abortion,attack,"For the sake of clarity, I am not suggesting this was a sting operation by the authorities. I am merely ""thinking out loud"" as to how a law requiring notification can be enforced if evidence cannot be gathered without the consent of planned parenthood.
I, for one, do not know how one could expect to enforce laws requiring notification by Planned Parenthood if someone does not go to Planned Parenthood and secretly tries to see how they handle certain cases which require reporting.
What are the police or policy makers to do? Ask Planned Parenthood if they would consent to ""counsel"" this 18 year-old who will pose as a 15 year-old statutory rape victim in order to see how they will handle the scenario; to see if they will obey the law? Should they also get Planned Parenthood's consent to be taped? Do you think with such foreknowledge that these counselors will say what they normally would?
If you ask me, it is a pretty foolish thing to require consent to perform a sting operation from the party under suspicion.

Unfortunately, it is out of our hands. She has to make a decision since she is now pregnant (ignoring the problem is still a decision). That she is emotionally young does not mean she is immune to the physical changes her body will go through, nor does it mean that decisions about those physical changes must be off limits to her. 
It really is not my decision that they get pregnant :P Once they are, consistency does not excuse disallowing the very fundamental ability to make their own decisions about, arguably, the most intimate part of their lives, up to and including termination of the pregnancy.
My previous point also still holds true and the same logic applies. In general, knowing whether you have a STD is an essential part of health and in order to ensure underage girls get tested a certain amount of protection from parental oversight is needed.

According to the law and common sense she is below the age of accountability so to condone her to bypass informing her parents is to admit that the State is more responsible and a better guide than the Parents who bore her. Is that what you believe and are endorsing ? That the State have ultimate oversight over our children ? 
But they aren't even at the age of personal accountability yet. They can't legally make any adult decisions by themselves. What you are endorsing is cutting mom and dad out of the process and giving the ultimate authority to the State/strangers who have no long term personal interest in that girs emotional or personal welfare.

So what you're saying is if a 13 year young teen girl is so sexually active that she is contracting STDs, your solution is to allow her to get medical attention without her parents being informed so she can fix the problem and continue in her obviously sexually promiscuous lifestyle uninterupted by parents who could and would intervene at that point and correct their daughters very dangerous personal sexual activities.

14,And now for a story that you will NOT hear at most media outlets,abortion,attack,"Archangel, once the girl is pregnant there are two choices: continue or abort. No action on the part of the parents will shield her from the stress and dangers of the situation. No matter what decision she makes she will be faced with stress and danger. We no longer have the luxery of simply stuffing the cat back into the bag. As unfortunate as it may be, she must make some adult decisions, even if it is to continue the pregnancy. Unless, of course, you wish to suggest that parents may choose to terminate their child's pregnancy.
The State did not allow or prevent her pregnancy, nor is the State requiring her to abort or continue the pregnancy. They are providing services that are considered essential to both reproductive and general health. Whether or not the girl is emotionally mature, she is physically capable and thus there is every justification to allow access to services that maintain and treat problems with her systems that she can physically use.
Those problems do not wait until she is emotionally mature enough to handle them.
Yet parents do not own their children's bodies. They cannot require their teenage children give blood or give organs. In matters regarding as fundamental a freedom as bodily integrity, pregnancy and reproductive health parents do not and should not have ultimate authority. Your question is erroneous because it is not the State that has authority over the girl, it is the girl who has some authority over herself.
While it is the parent's responsibility to teach their children common sense, it is not part of the powers of parents to use an illness as punishment or as a tool to teach responsibility. It is morally abhorrent to use pregnancy as either of these things as well.
I'm saying that a 13 year old girl who contracted an STD should have access to treatment regardless of her parent's views. She can continue her sexually promiscuous ways regardless of whether her STD is treated; it is the State's desire and responsibility to prevent widespread illness, not to enforce moral behavior.",11,15,topic_stance_votes_2

17,And now for a story that you will NOT hear at most media outlets,abortion,attack,"So you're actually endorsing that parents have no right to know when their 13 year old daughter is dealing with an issue like pregnancy or an STD ? This is your version of adult oversight, as in none ? And as to the bolded. If a 13 year old child is going to keep a pregnancy from her parents, what OTHER possible decision can she make other than abortion ? Deciding on adoptions gonna result in them noticing, wouldn't you say ? So your endorsement of her not having to tell her parents is paramount to endorsing non consensual childhood abortions.
Note the bolded: Then obviously you endorse and support adolescent sex. If 12,13, or 14 year olds are physically capable of having sex then to heII with their emotional maturity. Who are we as their parents to expect to have the right to intervene before they reach the legal age of accountability ? Are you for real ? Or are you really a 13 year old with spellcheck ? Cuz you can't be an adult with children. Or an adult with one ioda of common sense.
When the State relieves the parents of financial and legal responsibility for the actions of their children, you just might have a point. But you dont because it's the responsibility of parents to be a part of such important matters in a minors life. No matter how well you try to trivialize their relationship, nothing, and I mean nothing should overrule that relationship. 
Who said anything about using an STD or a teen pregnancy as a punishment ? Not I. If it's an abortion they decide on, the parents will finance it. If they choose to carry and adopt out the child, the parents are needed for consent. If they decide to keep the child, the parents are needed to help raise it. Your way of endorsing secrecy only allows for one outcome. ABORTION, and there in lies the agenda and why you would support such irresponsible balderdash. 
Would you point out where I said a pregnant 13 year old should be locked in the basement without medical care ? 
Not if her parents learn about it and have an opportunity to intervene and help her reconsider the repercussions of her current lifestyle. I pity the type of parents you must have had in order for you to have such a low opinion of them. But all parents aren't insensitive oafs. Mine weren't and neither was I with my two daughters.
But I raised them with moral values and to respect their bodies. Something you seem to be completely devoid of. 
Which is precisely why children need parents to teach moral behavior and social responsibility. You see, fixing that girls one STD isn't going to stop the spread of them if she goes right back to having random sex with random boys. The cycle will just continue as before. How can you not be aware of that obvious progression ?
And all due to a declining moral center that is promoted and endorsed by people like you who see no problem with bypassing parental rights and responsibilities ? Admit it, just between you and me.

18,And now for a story that you will NOT hear at most media outlets,abortion,attack,"What is to prevent the parents from doing so when they have ultimate authority over all aspects of their teen's life? What would prevent them from having an abortion done on their pregnant daughter? I'm endorsing that girls have a right to confidential health services, Archangel. This is like objecting to patient-doctor confidentiality (which exists even for underage children) on the grounds that parents have some ""right"" to know everything when they obviously do not. We do not live in your mythical world where parents have some absolute authority over their teen's lives.
Why would the State relieve the parents of financial and legal responsibility? As I said, your question is erroneous. The State does not gain authority over the girl, the girl gains a certain amount of authority over herself. 
Archangel, your understanding of the situation is flawed. The question is not about keeping the preganancy confidential, it is about keeping services such as STD testing or abortion confidential. If the girl wants to keep the pregnancy that is her business and she can either tell or not tell her parents on her own. As you say, it will probably be hard to keep secret but that is totally up to her, not the State.
I'm sorry, nonconsensual abortions? I'm afraid I cannot see how anything I have ever said could be construed to mean that abortions should be forced upon anyone.
Sigma had said:
Whether or not the girl is emotionally mature, she is physically capable and thus there is every justification to allow access to services that maintain and treat problems with her systems that she can physically use
If a 14 year old girl contracts a STD, her lack of emotional maturity will not shield her from the negative effects of that STD, nor would it shield her from the stress and danger of pregnancy or abortion. Unless you wish to suggest that treatments should not be available to her in some misguided attempt to force the ""you made your bed now lie in it"" mentality, what you have stated here makes absolutely no sense. If the girl is physically mature, there is every justification to have these services available since her emotional maturity, or lack thereof, has no effect on whether she has problems with her physical body.
At least I'd have a spellchecker. Seriously: ""cuz""?
Archangel, if the services weren't confidential, likely the girl wouldn't come in to have those services done and the State wouldn't tell the parents anyway. In terms of cost/benefit, there are more benefits with treating illness than there are costs by keeping those services confidential.
If she does not get tested she will not know if she has a STD. If testing were not confidential she would not get tested. In either case she may indeed continue having random sex with random boys. You are right, parents are responsible for teaching moral behavior and social responsibility. Not the State. In this situation, it is the State's responsibility to attempt to control the spread of STDs as best they can. Keeping those services confidential allows boys and girls to come in without fearing repercussions at home. Then, at least, the problems can be treated. Whether they continue their irresponsible ways is not the responsibility of the State since enforcing moral behavior is not within the purview of the State.

20,And now for a story that you will NOT hear at most media outlets,abortion,attack,"This may be a tangent to the main discussion here, but I would like to say that I also am disheartened to see how much sex teenagers are having nowadays. However, it is not from moral reasons about teenage sex. I don't have many qualms about teenagers having sex who can practice sex truly responsibly. Good quality sexual education (still seemingly a fiction in this country) would be able to convince most teenagers to be responsible. 
Of course, I, as most others, am concerned about those teenagers that have sex irresponsibly, and thus risk STDs and pregnancy. However, another main concern is that I think that teenage girls, more so than in earlier decades (except, perhaps, with many groups in the sixties), are valued by their peers (especially boys) largely on their sexuality. It seems to be an expected part of their culture now. I think that girls had more of a choice in the past whether or not to engage in sex. They could be virgins through their teenage years and still be considered cool. I don't think that is the case now - which I think is sad. I think that many girls engage in sex due to social pressures which are stronger now than in the past. I think that those advocating for abstinence have to find a way to convince their teenage audience that a girl can be a virgin and still be cool. Moralizing certainly won't work since moralizing is a very un-cool thing to do.

As to access to abortion services without parentel consent thats not a life and death decision nor is the use of Plan B or similar or even birth control.

Name them please. Because even an orphan needs the signature of an adult to get surgery. The only exception I can think of would be if it was impossible to get a guardians signature in a life or death situation, which a first trimester abortion definitely isn't. 
Precisely, thanks for making my point. I marvel at how you can contradict yourself without even realizing it. You are confirming though that because none of these situations are emergencies then the permission and authority of parents over their minor children should never be bypassed.
An absolutely ridiculous statement because nobody is claiming children are chattel. What they are is innocent and in need of responsible guidance. Something they obviously wont get with your emotional, intellectual or moral ilk.

It doesn't really matter. What matters is that you are in violation of a copyright by continuing to use a trademark.
Now, on to a substantive issue.
You continually conflate ""fetus"" with ""child"", which is absurd on its face. It's not a child until it's born.
However, let's for the sake of argument follow your erroneous reasoning to its illogical conclusion.
If abortion = murder, then it is a crime. If it is a crime, then it must have a sanction at law. One of the criteria for imposition of the death penalty in those backward states that still permit such barbarity is the heinousness of the crime. Since a fetus is a most defenseless critter, then it must follow that its ""murder"" meets the criterion of being especially heinous.
Conclusion: Women who abort must be subject to execution, as well as their physicians (on the hit man theory).
Are you willing to see women and their doctors executed for the abortion of a fetus?

I tend to avoid the abortion debates as there really is no point. Most won't change their dogmatic beliefs of this subject. Religion and politics often being more easy to pursuade than this. I'm here because I'm bored and the rest of the forums were quiet on a lazy Sunday.
LOL. Actually, I'm not. Nor are the several hundred others who use 'Zardoz' as a handle. Nor am I worried. My implication on 'Do you know me' is that you're new to these forums. Had you been here and paid attention to many of the posts I've made in the past years, I'm more than comfortable with my lawyers beating the snot out of anyone who'd stand against me.
There are many exceptions to the use of 'trademarks' I happen to be one who enjoys using them. 
Actually, I haven't conflated anything as we're not really talking at this juncture about the thing in the young woman but about the young woman herself. Her rights or lack tehre of. 
As for fetus and child though, they are both steps of human development.
There are laws that punish one for terminating that unborns life except in the case of an abortion done at the choice of the woman carrying it.
If I were to go up to a pregnant woman, a hit her in the stomach causing a miscarriage, I could face charges for terminating the pregnancy that go beyond simple assault. Same thing if I killed a pregnant woman, I could face a double homicide charge in the US.
These laws do exist in the US.
I never said that abortion is murder
I have pointed out that there are laws that DO punish the taking of the fetuses life in some circumstances. 
Once again you're leaping to conclusions and jumping over many small stepping stones to get there. You also show undue bias. Recall what I said above. What's the point in debating such an issue when the opposition clings to bias without demonstraited reason? My interjections in this thread is to point out what I've done.
I don't know where you come up with this 'defenseless'. Some of them suckers are down right evil and desire to terminate the womans life.
Extreme faulty cause and effect. The woman could simply be suffering from one of many short term neurosis or psychosis...or even any number of other factors or societial pressures that impell her to believe that an abortion is the only way out of her prediciment.
Much like you drowning in quick sand and all of a sudden, I'm there with a salted up piece of rusty razor wire as a life line to toss to you rather than that soft length of hemp rope in my other hand. 
Will you call me a life saver for tossing your the wire? How about if you're not even told about the hemp rope (that I only use for people I like).
Have you stopped beatting your mother? 
You lay out only one possible path when many others could exist. 
It's one of the other reasons I typically avoid such a thread. Neither side wants to honestly work towards any common ground or solution. Arch and I pointed out very clear issues where minors aren't allowed to engage in some things. Somehow, you think the magical word 'pregnant' makes a difference. When it doesn't. A pregant 16 year old still is not considered a legal adult, Can't get a tattoo, can't drink alcohol, vote, sign for an operation nor buy many medications, enter into a legally bonding contract and could be expelled for taking an aspirine at school. Their rights to free speech are even infringed upon...or, maybe they don't exist as fully as some think they do as witnessed in the Bong Hits for Jesus controversy that happened not too long ago.
As I've said, Abortion 'rights' are one of those odd loopholes. They are at this moment being worked on by both sides with various pieces of legislation writen, passed, shot down, etc. etc. Eventually, it will be removed and we'll go back to the way it was in the 60's or it will be more clearly defined. 
In the news in the past week in New England, a woman has been charged with the deaths of ~4 children. From what I gather were fetuses.
All yes, here's one link.
Edit: apparently there's a clause that allows for self induced abortion...
I find most of those who want to abolish abortion unwilling to do anything else to actually and meaningfully help in most cases that would lead a woman to consider an abortion to begin with. 
I find many who want abortion rights no matter what.
I find many who ignore facts on both sides of the debates, more so when it doesn't suit them.

I loves em...much. Don't like paying them...but, in a cost effectiveness situation...hey, crime does pay.
I'm told by many that I should have been one too.
But...I cheat too much. 
As to the A-bombs. Did they violate any known laws and conventions of those times?
If so...was anyone in a position to do anything about it?
But...this was a time of alleged 'total war'. Civilians were viewed as fueling the machines needed to wage war. Operating munitions factories and food processing plants vital to the war effort. That they built these things inside cities in a time when percision bombings were extremely rare and hazardous...
Such has always been the case through out history. Civilian targets being the ones to bear the brunt of looting and rape to satisfy the under paid levy or warriors with their dandruf up.
If we want to carry this concept over to the current era with terrorists (enemy forces) striking at whim at citizens.
I'm perfectly willing to comply in kind.
Actually, I'd love to nominate myself as War Lord with the finger on the button.
I'm positive my theory of Out Terrorizing the Terrorists will work.
*looks sheepishly* Of course, some of those I'd be 'defending' may take umbrage against this...but, I'm willing to eliminate them too. For giving comfort and assistance to the 'enemy'. :) 
Think of it like this.
Do you bring a knife to a gun fight?
Do you strap on boxing gloves to settle a grudge while your opponent is sharpening his sword?
Me, I prefer to be there with the biggest and the mostest. Since such costs money and time, I'd seek other means to resolve differences. But, raise a fist and I'll probably empty a fire arm into you, and sue your estate and seek a crafty lawyer if I find myself unable to simply walk away from the mess.
Escalation is simply a waste of time.
The only consideration leaders have in cases of total war is to their own people an cause. If the enemy is too stubborn to know when they are out maneuvered and out fought to seek some settlement or even surrender...then who's falt is it for continuing to fight to the finish.
I'm reminded of a case where police were investigating a gang shooting.
Gang member A had his gun drawn on Gang member B. B continued to run his mouth and taunt A, daring him to shoot. He did, killing him.
So, is this a case of A murdering B or B using A to commit suicide?
In the case of legalities...
Is it really illegal to do something when those supposed to enforce the law can't or won't? It's like when I and a hundred other as zooming down the highway 15 mph over the speed limit...only to be passed up by the fuzz. Who apparently isn't on a call.
Seriously, who was going to prosecute the president and US commanders for killing a bunch of nips? Especially after other horrific things came to light on the other side. Rape of Nanking. The Holocaust.
Vaporizing thousands of women and children and what ever men left to push the enemy into surrendering early and avoid further slaughter may have been considered a small price to pay.
As for letting people mind their own business...oh how I wish this would apply to all things.
I'd much rather you mind your own business as I do as I please.
I'm sure you'd much consider the various issues as apples and oranges but, as I've been recently reminded in my own personal life...they's still all fruit.
The unborn are part of the human life cycle. Many believe that distinctions shouldn't be made when determining when something has a right to life(barring a few mitigating circumstances). 
The pro-choicers/abortionists want to determine when such subjective concepts as personhood begins. Believing such to have an important bearing on being human. Over looking conflicts to this concept an the proven slippery slope this has caused in the past. 
I mean, seriously, I doubt many anglo's had much of a problem dropping bombs on uppity and barbaric heathen Nips during WWII. 
Heck, they even incarcerated them in semi-concentration camps.
What about the Nazi's who deemed the retarded to be a burden on society and euthanized them?
A new born isn't more of a person with 'mental existance' that the unborn child it was a few moments ago.
Nor are the profoundly retarded who are still occasionly found even today.
Seems some want to draw the line at birth. Such seems to be the case now.
In philosophy (and sometimes this is translated into practice) can we move that line up or down?
Some here think 3rd term abortions never happen. (Mostly non-Americans who's laws dealing with abortion have been different to Americans and they are ignorant of this). Should we place personhood at birth? End of 2nd Trimester?
1 year old? How about a little later?
So, tell me why a woman should be allowed to terminate her human fetus?
Sounds like she might be hysterical and need a simple slapping to bring her to her senses...well, that seems to always work in the 1950's movies.
Is a born child a few hours old more valuable than it was slightly earlier while still in the womb?
Who get's to determine this value?
These discussions could easily be tied in with the philosophy thread on Are all humans created equal. Could be expanded even further.
Are minorities less equal than those in the majority? Men vs Women? Aged vs Young. Zygots vs a Fetus. 
As it stands, a womans own choice in this particular matter seems to be all that counts. Such an issue doesn't exist in any other realm from what I've ascertained.

@Chemist, 
""Still I am responding to your statement that military ops should not target civilian populations, and certainly in these instances that principle was violated.""
I didn't say they shouldn't. I said there was a difference in attitudes. 
Of the times, since targeting civilians NOW isn't Kosher for most Westerners like it was in times past.
And even now, there is that difference in mindset. Most Westerners have an aversion to such whereas other groups don't have a problem with it.
Thus, in the current era, you'll notice many Westerners prosecute the targeting of non-combatants as has been rercently done in the examples from Camp Pendelton I mentioned. And other groups not batting an eye when such happens.
And the nonchalant shrugs when military targets are annihilated by most sides...except radical pacifistic types who usually couldn't tell a helmet from a bomb to begin with. 
Another topic for discussions like this would be the use of civilian shileds by a military target. Do you simply bomb the valid military target or seek to preserve the life of the civilians (at all costs???)
My comments were to illustrate what murder is and how it doesn't apply to military on military violence even in the liberal western world. Which is what some here seem to want to apply.
Much like the oppoisition stating an unborn is equal to the born...a concept you don't believe in.
Oh, and a Human Zygote is part of human development, thus Human. Possessing unique DNA and such. That's why it's called a Human Zygot and not a Canine Zygote.
Like an infant is part of human development. It may not be a fully developed human just like an infant isn't.

As a chemist (and a biologist) I know well that a zygote differs so substantially from a human being that assignment to the category of person for a zygote is absurd. Its NOT as I have indicated an issue of potentiality its an issue of what IS at the time of abortion. And your stand is inconsistent and hypocritical unless and untli you admit an unfertilized egg into the same class as a zygote. After all that egg has the potential to become a human being does it not? Any woman who does not have sex at an appropriate time while releasing such an egg is guilty of homocide is she not? If not why not?
Well for starters a murderer is a human being and a zygote is NOT. Terminating a pregnancy is not equivalent to killing a human being since there is no being there to kill.
And baby, child, person, unborn child, are also terms which you use to make your argument. They are mere labels which are intended to confuse the actual biology of the situation. Rhetorical devices without factual content. I suggest you study biology in preference to superstitious theology.
This debate is not about ""unborn children"" in the form of zygotes or feti either.

Once more you attempt to make the potential argument - and its a failed one from the outset.

91,And now for a story that you will NOT hear at most media outlets,abortion,support,"It is perhaps true that a full scale invasion would have been costly, however it also would have been unecessary, since the Japanese already offered surrender repeatedly, under terms virtually identical to those eventually agreed upon, prior to dropping the bombs.
How costly exactly? The hell if I know, no one can be sure. But I don't think it really mattered. Isolation also would have been possible of course, but the Russians would have gone in if the US didn't get the surrender first, and they would have accepted a conditional surrender which Japan would have swiftly offered
So the options are really:
1. Drop the bomb, and accept an unconditional surrender with terms essentially the same as those already offered.
2. Accept a conditional surrender
3. Let the Russians accept a conditional surrender.
4. Mount a ""costly full scale invasion"" and then one of the top 3 options.
The reasons for demanding unconditional surrender also were not simply emotional, if you read the correspondence between US govt. leadership at the time, they express an explicit ideology of remaking the world in a specific fashion, hand in hand with Russia and to a lesser extent, Britain and China, and this ideology was very much what shaped the policy, and came to fruition in the creation of the UN. It was also for this reason that the US was willing to overlook Russia's many horrible flaws as an ally.

But, the diagram presented actually is pretty poor. It could lead one to think that sperm+egg change into zygote=fetus=infant=adult and then that adult could turn around and participate in it's OWN creation. Each Cycle is one Full Loop that connects to another forming the life cycles of Humanity. The parents are NOT the child who is NOT the partents. There are beginning points for an independant life that does not have to continue on with the chain. Thus, you could terminate your cycle at the elderly stage in your human life. 
This is pretty elementary education stuff.
If you terminate at one point, then ALL that happened to get you to that point happened 1st...before. You can back track this until you get to a stage that you can't regress back any further on. That's the starting point of your individual Cycle. And cycle is a very loose term that's being muddied by you here.

We can debate when societial values (and individual ones) would have a bearing on preserving life or ending it.

And that there must be ways for clinics to legitimately inform patients on the legal consequences of their actions. 
It's not right either to keep 15 year olds in ignorance of the law. Probably, health education classes should also address legal ramifications of sex, pregnancy, and childbirth decisions all the way around. Including the ages of partners in these more unusual scenarios.
If PP had posters up or handed out flyers or notified every under-eighteen year old who contacted them of any number of things, including the consequences of telling them the age of a partner, they would probably be well within their legal responsibilities IF a ""crime"" had even occured.

Because there are many more sub issues wrapped up in this debate than simple human life. Because I also said ""How it affects me"". Seeing as these are subjective discussions, such an issue could affect me, directly or indirectly.
There is a beginning and an end to an individual life. My individual life didn't start until the merging of two other, seperate lives as you claim.
As for the meta issue you're trying to present, way, way, way back life originated from somewhere...but, that would be a debate for the creationism forums. No?
Furthermore, you go on to discuss personhood rather than deal with the basic element of this tangent...which is individual human life and the human life development (cycle) which IS clearly defined.
As it stands, subjectively I can attest that you posses no 'personhood' by my narrow and subjective definition of that word.
Furthermore than that, the laws exist to try someone for murder if they kill that zygote carried by another woman all because she subjectively defined it as a 'person' (or whatever) thus, YOUR definition doesn't matter...as it's not a universally accepted one.
As I said, if you want to discuss such issues as personhood, we could go on to do that rather than stay hungup on this topic. But, I'd find it boring. I've been in the debates over 'personhood' before and find it more dogmatic with no real purpose to be accomplished. It's a subjective term used to justify most anything.
Also, your 'personhood' defense isn't one, as abortion rights aren't founded upon any need or use of that term. I've never seen a ruling stating 'Well, it's not a person, so the owner can kill it if they want too.' Or 'It's a person, so aborting it is wrong.'

The problem I have with them is they are subjective.
For example, you can induce an abortion in yourself and get no punishment but if I were to do the same to you, I could face a murder charge against the fetus...that's not sentient, a person...what ever.

But, then again, neithr can a new born infant nor the profoundly retarded. yet, ironically, they're treated as persons. Labled as such by most others. 
Nope, you're wrong. Again. 
Thus, you have cases where legal protection is extended to the fetus and such prior to all that happening. How can you murder something that isn't a person or a seperate identifiable human life?
What you're doing is applying your own definitions...which, are subjective and don't pan out into reality.
Back at you.
As it stands, you've not addressed questions on when your individual life starts. You seem to be confusing personhood with life.
And your individual life certainly didn't predate the sperm and the egg that went into making it.
This isn't about the reproductive cycle. 
It's about human development and the stages that individual human goes through.
I'm curious, since you think a zygote isn't human, what is it?
What about a fetus?
I'm also curious what your nationality is.
However, in order to face a murder charge, wouldn't I have to murder a person. You seem to be saying a zygote/ fetus isn't one. Law (subjectively and occasionally) says otherwise. 
I do understand consent. But, the issues is even having the power of consent to begin with.
Which goes to support my case to a degree.
Causing you an unwanted abortion isn't a simple assault or other crime. It can be considered murder with recent laws.
You, the mother can determine if your fetus is a person and give birth and have it protected by law. Or you can determine that it isn't and have an abortion.
Thus, unlike your previous mentioned statements, there is no clear cut definition for personhood or whatever you want to say and when it actually/ technically happens. 
Furthermore, there's a natural leaning by the law to consider it a 'person' for legal issues.
So, if you're pregnant, haven't made any communications to anyone on whether you wanted to keep it or not and I kill you...I could easily face a double homicide charge.
Let me remind you of your comment again;
See, that isn't the truth except in your own mind and by the desires of your cohorts. Not only have I contested it but, many other humans have and so have as well as the law.
But, maybe you want to contact Scott Peterson's lawyers and let them know your truth.
I'm also sure others would like to know that their convictions are unjustified seeing as that identifiable human life they took never happened (well, not in the manner you describe it).
See, human life begins at conception. Prior to that, it's sperm life and egg life. And, seperate is also irrelevant considering it doesn't matter what stage the life is in or what it form it takes. Life is life.
If you want to argue that you have no value/use for the fetus and don't think you should be forced to care for it against your will, fine.

You're comparing a part of a whole to a whole.
A zygote is a whole. Many have admitted it. Even comparing it to a parasite which is a whole, living entity also. 
You keep pushing value jusgements into this.
Nope, unlike many who have admitted that it's a life and alive, you try to skirt this with nonsense. Drowning out this, simple and elementry discussion with attached value judgements.
If you want to discuss values, then do so. But, as they (values) are subjective then anyone is capable of doing so. Thus, my claims that you're not human, a human being, a person, possessing personhood or any other term you wish to muddle are equally valid.
Now, when we deal with your value judgements, we can deal with many related things to the HUMAN form and what have you.
Such as legal protections for the dead, euthanasia, profoundly retarded people, infants, the 'brain dead', organ harvesting, elective surgery...
But, as it stands, you appear to be trying to attach other requirements for being 'human' that simply being 'a live'.

147,And now for a story that you will NOT hear at most media outlets,abortion,support,"We would have to agree as a society about the criteria that are important for having rights to begin with. I agree that life itself is not enough since, after all, unfertilized eggs are alive as well. Having a full set of human DNA doesn't entice me either since all of the cells in our body have that. I can understand how the start of the growth process (i.e. conception) can entice some but, to me, it is really just a step that brings a life form closer to full humanity than an unfertilized egg - the probability goes way up. That is not enough to give it rights, in my view. From my point of view, I analyze why I would not want born people killed and, mainly, it comes down to the fact that I would not want to be killed if I were in their shoes - would not want to go through the physical and mental suffering, the sense of loss and emotional turmoil, etc. Reciprocity in treatment underlies the moral systems of much of the human race. From that point of view, a very late fetus would already have fears, sense of pain, etc - just like a newborn baby. Those are some of the motivations that drive my criteria of mental existence.
As for when that mental existence starts, yes it doesn't just kick start into full function but gradually develops, where that first possibility seems to happen around the beginning of the third trimester. That first possibility cannot be determined exactly (since it probably can vary from fetus to fetus by a few weeks), but neither can birth or conception - all of which take hours to finish (unless you want to call the final snip of the umbilical cord the moment of birth).

I'm reminded of the louse...poor lice, Remove them and they die quickly too.
Much like anything though. Remove it's means to sustain itself and it dies.
Even born infants will quickly die without a host to sustain them in one manner (or with modern ingenuity, the use of formula or another animals milk) or another. They certainly can't care for themselves. Disgusting parasitical creatures :p
It's just that in this form, the parasite has detached itself from the host.
As for the interaction. Of course that's what parasites do.
Often times, they also trigger chemical reactions that could almost lead to a symbiotic relationship. I do know hormone changes are noted in the host.
Ever note how a blood sucker releases anti-coagulants into it's host?
Riiiggghhttt. 
Alive and a life are not exactly the same thing as you've stated.
A human is the sum of it's component parts. 
I won't touch that 'human being' term you keep pushing out unless it's clearly defined. Many pro-choicers/abortionists often attach connotations to it to get a different meaning.
And there you go...once again.
Tossing out relative and subjective terms like 'person'.
Can you hold the argument without resorting to terms that require value judgments?
I'm unconcerned with person / personhood / being / mental existence or what ever demarcation used to enact a value judgment.
I never said anything was a person. All I maintain is that a zygote is a stage of human development (since you don't like life 'cycle').
If you don't want to attribute these things to an inutero entity, fine. But, you're still killing something. Even if you value it no more than you do a tape worm.
Just know that many other humans do. And laws exist to support them in some circumstances. Much like they do for you.
Arbitrary laws to support peoples arbitrary desires.
Hmmm...
Didn't you previously say that human life has no beginning?
Ahh yes, you did.
You intentions seem to muddle personhood with human and waffle on when individual life begins or doesn't...hard to tell.
You also know what?
I can use your same logic and apply it to a born infant.
Before human adulthood / maturity is reached, all that exists is a lump of cells and tissue that has the potential to become a human being
Did you know that a human continues to develop until they reach maturity?
Even this concept of person isn't formed until the late 20's when personality cements into a constant. 
Did you also know that many women would attest that their fetus possessed a personality on it's own while in the womb. Each pregnancy differing from one another.
Really?
I hadn't noticed that I backed off from my stances nor waffled in commentary.
I did alter 'life cycle' to 'development' to make it easier for you to understand what's being discussed.
You haven't repudiated this but continuously skulk to the refuge of subjectiveness of validating why it's okay to terminate a human life at a certain stage in it's existence.
I'd hazard a guess as to why you won't openly admit to doing this is because the bar can be raised and lowered and standards of acceptance of that human life manipulated until it may affect you personally.
And thus the proof in my points about your side.
I never inferred 'being' (euphemism for person) as being the same as human life. 
As I've been trying to convey all along, it's (zygote / fetus) a human life. 
You are the one who imposes a milestone.
For me, from beginning to end, zygote to deathbed...it's simply a human in one form or another. 
As I said previously, I don't 'value' it at all (in any stage) except as it relates to me directly or indirectly.
Termination of this life at any stage is termination of a human life.
In the philosophy forums, you'll find that I don't champion any form of beliefs in equity between various humans as equity and value are subjective.
What you've done here, has been to attach value judgments at every opportunity to support your beliefs. 
What, praytell are they?
Would you care to define human being for me?
As asked, what separates an inutero fetus from an exutero new born?
It's parasitical nature? Additional legal protections? 
How does one become a person?
So, in the end, all that matters is who has the most support/ power to enact their value judgments upon the masses.
Thus, if I have more to support me in defining human being, person or personhood as not including whatever I want excluded, I is teh winna?
See?
As I initially stated, abortion debates are pointless. What I need is more jingoism, charisma, razzle dazzle and constant threats and promises to sway the masses.
Actually, skin cell is alive but isn't a life.
A zygote, being a human, is alive and is a life much like it is in it's adult version once development has been completed or at anytime inbetween.

While I'd agree when we get to the concept of personhood, you'll find that that's not a universal belief. Thus, we have odd laws that protect someone who really doesn't possess these capabilities simply because they are of human form. 
And, we don't have laws to protect things that don't possess the human form even if they did posses this consciousness, personhood, personality.
Human form seems to be the common denominator currently.
It's also why many support abortion in early pregnancy because they don't recognize the life there as possessing human form. 
Form = Image. 
But, there is a difference.
That's nonsensical.
It seems to be the opposite though, you and those who support abortion want to impose views of personhood onto others. Then be able to use that as the determinator for deciding who gets to live and who gets to be killed.
I'm an adoptive parent of 3 with one birth child. I'm really unconcerned with breeding. What I am concerned with is who get's to determine who will live and who will die and their reasoning for makng those decisions.
Furthermore, it's not fine by ALL. Some support my stances. Some don't.
As it stands, value judgements are being used to aritrarily determine which human lives and which dies.
In abortion, we deal with the zygote and fetus stages of that human.
In euthanasia, we deal with other forms of that human.
If you have no value placed upon them (or others), of course you not care if it lives or dies. You don't see any impact upon you life.

In addition if you were to follow the legal reasoning - instead of your own off the cuff approach you would find that the difference involved is consent of the woman in each case. If the woman assigns personhood to her fetus (by carrying it) then coercive destruction of that fetus is murder. LEZ who posts here from time to time use the concept of surrogate personhood to cover this. By killing the fetus via coercion one is killing a surrogate person. An abortionist of course kills the fetus only upon the choice of the woman - the surrogate personhood of her fetus is NOT violated thereby. I suggest you may wish to read the logic which went into the different laws governing this.
Actually its because they have concluded that the fetus is not in fact a human being or a person. And I would point out that what pro-choice folks support is not abortion so much as the right of the woman to choose whether or not to have an abortion - that tolerance of individual decisions protects women who might wish to have an abortion as well as those who would not.

Most disagreements you mention seem based less in reason and more in religion and notions of a spirit without substance. This was witnessed during the Shiavo fiasco.
An analysis of general morality would seem to be based on the notion of empathy, this notion of other minds. General morality includes creatures that can feel pain but are not conscious (as we are, at least), and would logically be stronger for creatures that are conscious as we are conscious since we can empathize with these creatures more.
We do protect them, simply not to the extent that we protect creatures that possess consciousness, personhood and personality similar to our own. When another being possesses qualities that would allow them to participate in the making of laws, this would probably change :P
Those who equate ""human form"" (only) with ""personhood"" generally seem to be laboring under the notion of ""God created man in His image"" and that these human forms have souls or spirits separate from the mind/brain/consciousness.

In pro-choice you will neither be forced to carry a fetus to term, nor will your pregnancy be forcibly terminated against your will by your fellow men.
Well thats going to depend on what the criteria are to be a WHO isn't it? Since you have apparently never faced the issue of whether or not to carry a fetus to term, perhaps your thoughts here lack a certain perspective. Did you ever consider that? The issue is not which of two human beings (the mother or the fetus) will prevail its actually of whether or not the woman has the right to decide or not. This is determined by whether or not the zygote/fetus is a person or not. Since there is no evidence that a zygote is a person (other than metaphysical speculation based in superstion rather than solid science) then the issue is undecidable as a general rule. Such issues are best left to the choice of the woman rather than to a single universal rule or law. Its subjective either way, but with pro-choice its subjective at the individual level, with pro-life its subjective and enforced society wide. There is a huge difference.
Indeed it is subjective and value judgements are applied. The issue is not that value judgements are applied but rather WHOSE value judgements. Shall we allow individuals to judge for themselves or should we force all individuals to conform to a single value determined by the majority or the central authority? Freedom is preferred by most of us.
OK, but you miss a key point. The only legal euthanasia requires consent of the individual, or a decision made by someone he/she (or the courts) designates as his/her agent. There is no question of personhood involved at all. Where problems develop is where there is no clear agent designated by the patient or by the law. 
Too many iffs there of course. But its not my choice or yours in these cases. In pregnancy the choice clearly devolves upon the woman. In euthanasia it devolves upon (in order) the individual, the designated agent, or failing an agent the courts. {Anyone without a durable power of attorney for health decisions take note - set one up as soon as possible - its an essential tool of modern life}
Most people who are involved in these types of decisions are close family members. Frankly humans are social critters and in MOST cases we do pretty well by each other. Not always but far more often than otherwise. And bear in mind we have built various mechanisms to contain and constrain abuse of one person by another. Indeed the current pro-choice enviornment is one of those mechanisms.

========================
The Ceausescu regime took more aggressive steps in the 1980s. By 1983 the birthrate had fallen to 14.3 per 1,000, the rate of annual increase in population had dipped to 3.7 per 1,000, and the number of abortions (421,386) again exceeded the number of live births (321,489). Ceausescu complained that only some 9 percent of the abortions performed had the necessary medical justification. In 1984 the legal age for marriage was lowered to fifteen years for women, and additional taxes were levied on childless individuals over twenty-five years of age. Monthly gynecological examinations for all women of childbearing age were instituted, even for pubescent girls, to identify pregnancies in the earliest stages and to monitor pregnant women to ensure that their pregnancies came to term. Miscarriages were to be investigated and illegal abortions prosecuted, resulting in prison terms of one year for the women concerned and up to five years for doctors and other medical personnel performing the procedure. Doctors and nurses involved in gynecology came under increasing pressure, especially after 1985, when ""demographic command units"" were set up to ensure that all women were gynecologically examined at their place of work. These units not only monitored pregnancies and ensured deliveries but also investigated childless women and couples, asked detailed questions about their sex lives and the general health of their reproductive systems, and recommended treatment for infertility.
Furthermore, by 1985 a woman had to have had five children, with all five still under her care, or be more than forty-five years old to qualify for an abortion. Even when an abortion was legally justified, after 1985 a party representative had to be present to authorize and supervise the procedure. Other steps to increase material incentives to have children included raising taxes for childless individuals, increasing monthly allowances to families with children by 27 percent, and giving bonuses for the birth of the second and third child.
Although government expenditures on material incentives rose by 470 percent between 1967 and 1983, the birthrate actually decreased during that time by 40 percent. After 1983, despite the extreme measures taken by the regime to combat the decline, there was only a slight increase, from 14.3 to 15.5 per 1,000 in 1984 and 16 per 1,000 in 1985. After more than two decades of draconian anti- abortion regulation and expenditures for material incentives that by 1985 equalled half the amount budgeted for defense, Romanian birthrates were only a fraction higher than those rates in countries permitting abortion on demand.

Review what I said about my values on other human life.
Want to comment on the bioethical debate a few years back over the Small Pox virus genocide?
IIRC, there was a minor controversy on whether a harmful lil' critter should have it's last remaining colony's of life exterminated. After all, on one hand, it's harmful to human life. Doesn't exist in any known environment other than the laboratory. Isn't really worth much and definatly isn't comparable to humans.
But, on the other, it was life and exterminating such could pose further ethical questions later...maybe a slippery slope for those pesky Romany peoples. Darn Gypsies. What are they useful for?
As for the Romanians...
You do know that some doctors in the US don't allow for tubaligations...even if you already have 'enough children'?
My sister's an example. Doctors refused to 'fix her' as they thought she may want more kids later in life. She was youngish when she had the 2nd and 3rd. 
As for the OP of this post. Since we're dealing with Choice and youth.
How about the reverse?
Should a pregnant teen be forced by others to terminate a pregnancy? Even if she doesn't want it?
Youth Shelters often paired with doctors and the teens parents will arrainge for oral inducement of a miscariage vis medication. My wife as a youth shelter supervisor was instructed to administer the medication to do so, however she refused.

On this point, though, only when 'fuzzy' notions of ""what is a human being"" is sufficient and even then the goal of most laws is to take appearance out of the equation.

The single cell of the zygote is the whole. Regardless, however, unless you assign special significance to 16 cells vs 8 cells vs 4 cells vs 2 cells vs 1 cell the difference still seems arbitrary between the sperm, egg and zygote. Perhaps you can shed more light?
Yes, as there is a difference between the 8 cell embryo and the 16 cell embryo. Some differences are more significant than others, and some do not appear to be reasonably significant enough to warrant a change in moral status.

It has the potential to do so, yes.

Life never begins...or it begins at conception.
There have been comparisons to rapists and a desire to kill a woman who's had an abortion. Which aren't true.
You lost the objective debate whether you realize it or not because you can't maintain your position without resorting to subjective value judgements. When I reply that such subjectiveness can be arbitrarily applied to other points (besides birth event), you resort to the admittedly arbitrary legal system as support. A legal system that can be manipulated.
I've seen the laws tossed aside several times to force abortion against one's will in regards to a minor child. 
Fact of the matter is a unique life begins at conception. It's a human life. It goes through several developmental stages before maturation.
You think it's okay to terminate that human life prior to conception for subjective reasons as it's not a 'person'.
I really don't care what reasons you use. Factually speaking, you're killing something.
The legals of whether that killing is murder, justifiable or not...really don't matter.

@sigma
Irrelevant whether society had problems. It wasn't included in this scenario. Other factors besides 'societial issues' could play a role in this decision by all women to have abortions.
And, quite frankly, unless science were to change to make your desires for artificial reproduction possible, we would go extinct following your wishes.
In all likelihood, exteme draconian behavior would take place to ensure that human existance would continue. The type that existance continued as is irrelevant seeing as human societies have changed drastically over time.
With those standing in the way removed forcefully. (See also Children of Men and the Handmaids Tale.)
Heck, under your method, if successful, we could even see the removal of the female portion of humanity in this scenario. It wouldn't take much to convince some that they're less useful than males. (See also China).
Knowing how flexible human beliefs are, odds would be you'd change your tune if such an event were to happen.
