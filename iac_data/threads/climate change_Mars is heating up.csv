0,Mars is heating up,climate change,support,"Turns out, scientists just found out that over the last 3-4 decades (the term of the Earth's warming since its last cooling) both the Earth and Mars have risen in average temperature 1/2 degrees celcius. Only difference is there are no human carbon emissions on Mars. This is further evidence that leads me to believe that human's impact on global warming is not near as significant as the environmentalist movement harps on and the sun actually has more to do with warming than we do. Anyone's thoughts?",0,1,topic_stance_votes_2
1,Mars is heating up,climate change,support,Earth certainly goes through cycles of massive climate change without any human intervention. Question is whether or not human emissions have hastened/added to this,1,2,topic_stance_votes_2
2,Mars is heating up,climate change,support,"Shhhhh, the global warming crowd don't want you to publish this kind of information, because it completely contradicts their man-made global warming myth.
But yeah, Mars is heating up and so are other planets. This is because the sun is hotter now tha it has been for the last 50 years.
It's stands to reason that the sun is also the main reason why the Earth is warming up.
But the global warming corwd won't even acknowledge that this might be the case and they continue to argue that people have more effect on the Earth than that flaming ball of nuclear fusion 1.5 million times the size of the Earth.
Nobody ever said that Mankind was a rational race...",1,3,topic_stance_votes_2
3,Mars is heating up,climate change,attack,"I'd like to see a link for the sun being hotter causing warming on mars, because from what I've read the warming is due to changes in albedo (basically how reflective the surface is) which mean mars is absorbing more radiation now than it was previously. These changes fluctuate over time as different types if dust are redistributed on the surface.",3,4,topic_stance_votes_1

5,Mars is heating up,climate change,attack,"So, the claim is solely based on the fact that both Earth and Mars are warming, rather than any causative evidence (like, for example, some evidence of an increase in solar radiation)? I'm also puzzled by the assertion that the greenhouse effect has no scientific basis, I'd like to see Habibullo Abdussamatov's new version of quantum theory that apparently contradicts it. Apart from anything else the greenhouse effect is a big part of the reason Earth is so much warmer than mars in the first place, and why Venus is so much hotter than earth (distance from the sun is a factor but heat retention, not application, is the biggie here). There is also no explanation as to why CO2 levels have risen in line with industrial development, and occurred before temperatures started to rise. Abdussamatov is an astronomer who no apparent clue about climatology, or even basic quantum physics.",5,6,topic_stance_votes_1
6,Mars is heating up,climate change,attack,I think there was something about the frequency of sunspots and warming. Like the more spots means more heat. I'll search.,6,7,topic_stance_votes_2
7,Mars is heating up,climate change,attack,"Traditionally you don't do science by reaching a conclusion and then googling til you come up with the requisite answer...
The Earth is definitely warming. Mars *may* be warming. Or it might be a localised effect. Venus already experienced a runaway global warm due to - guess what - a large amount of CO2 in its atmosphere. Mars has a thin atmosphere but its mostly made of CO2. What does this suggest? That if you increase CO2 in the atmosphere, you get a warming effect. What does this suggest to me? That pouring CO2 into the atmosphere is a bad idea.
If the sun was causing this warm up we'd expect the rest of the planets to be warming too (and our own moon). You say they are. Where's the evidence?",7,8,topic_stance_votes_1

BTW if CO2 causes global warming, why did the Earth cool off in the period between 1940 and 1980 eventhough the CO2 output went through the roof?",8,9,topic_stance_votes_2
9,Mars is heating up,climate change,attack,"From the linked article re Pluto: David Tholen, an astronomer at the University of Hawaii who measured the size of Pluto in the late 1980s using a series of occultations and eclipses involving Pluto's satellite, noted that even though Pluto was closest to the sun in 1989, a warming trend 13 years later shouldn't be unexpected. ""It takes time for materials to warm up and cool off, which is why the hottest part of the day on Earth is usually around 2 or 3 p.m. rather than local noon, when sunlight is the most intense,"" Tholen said. Because Pluto's year is equal to about 250 Earth years, 13 years after Pluto's closest approach to the Sun is like 1:15 p.m. on Earth. ""This warming trend on Pluto could easily last for another 13 years,"" Tholen estimated.
Which makes more sense given that Pluto is so far from the sun and yet seems to be warming more quickly than the planets closer in.
The usual explanation is that we were pouring sulphur-based chemicals into the air in those days. As we often see from volcanoes, this causes a cooling effect.",9,10,topic_stance_votes_1
10,Mars is heating up,climate change,support,"While what you guys say is true about Earth going through phases, it should not be happening this quickly.

P.S.
How many people here have read the entire UN report on global warming? I'm guessing not many, because if you did, you would know that the entire aspect of the possibility of the suns influence on our climate has been completely ignored.

19,Mars is heating up,climate change,attack,"What?
Unless point 1 was intended to mean you don't believe climatologists exist (a point that your link refutes) then I think you may have meteorologists and climatologists confused. They don't even study the same thing.
And how do you judge the quality of your list of climate luminaries...which includes TV personality David Bellamy...
The last sentence is dripping with irony given that you invoke Godwin's Law in the preceding one. Is that genuine debate? Or is it an emotionally-laden soundbite?
How do you know it's been ignored.
All of which ignores my point which was that - at the risk of argument from authority - on what basis are we arguing this? Are we better equipped than the scientists? Do we really have any option but to take their word for it given that they are the *experts*?",19,20,topic_stance_votes_1

21,Mars is heating up,climate change,attack,"If you're unqualified to disagree with scientific findings, you're not qualified to agree with them either.
Incidentally the reason I reject creationism isn't because I have blind faith in majorities of scientists, but because their arguments are specious and available information doesn't support their position.
I find many of the arguments of the prophets of global warming specious too. They roughly amount to.
a) We should accept scientific consensus about global warming, because we aren't qualified to challenge it. Therefore global warming is true.
b) Because global warming is true, any scientist who challenges it is a crackpot or corrupt.
So what do we have, unquestioning faith in a belief system that we won't question ourselves or allow scientists to question without labelling them as moral or intellectual degenerates.
Truth doesn't need this kind of argument behind it, I don't see ""evolutionists"" telling creationists they're wrong because they disagree with consensus, they use data and reasoning... not character assassination and threats of what will happen if we don't believe,these sounds more like arguments to convince people of a religious belief. Believe or you'll be forced to live in a fiery world, heretics are morally corrupt people who know the Truth but deny it because they've made a deal with the devil. Don't question the Faith, only our leaders can interpret the Word for us.
Are you aware that the historical record shows the temperature rise occurring ~800 years PRIOR to the increase in CO2, indicating that it is not CO2 which is the cause of temperature change historically, but rather that temperature change is the cause of CO2 being released? Correlation does not equal causation, especially when the cause is occurring 800 years after its effect. But of course, I'm not a climate scientist, so let's just ignore the facts and instead buy into consensus as the sole arbiter of truth, swallowing whatever lies Al Gore wants to broadcast in the process.",21,22,topic_stance_votes_2
22,Mars is heating up,climate change,attack,"Which is why I said the default should be 'I have no opinion'...except that's not really an option in this case.
...Which is quite easy to make out because the creationists have a few crackpots not doing real science, whereas the scientists are legion and do good research. How many other fields of mainstream science do you support a minority view of? 
Prophets? We're talking about the scientists, not the likes of Al Gore. I'm not inclined to listen to non-experts as I'v already mad clear.
I have no problem with them questioning. I believe it was mentioned in the UN report that it was 90% (or thereabouts) certain that GW was man-made, so there remains room for error. Trouble is, of course, that, because we have only one planet, the stakes are rather high to gamble with uncertainties. 
You can't possibly think that climate scientists missed this?! CO2 in the atmosphere is a positive feedback system. What you have stated does NOT indicate that CO2 is not the cause of temperature change. Moreso it indicates that CO2 is not THE cause. There are several.
The salient points are that we are experiencing the hottest temperatures for 10,000 years AND that this warming has happened faster than at any other time in history that we can make out. The *fact* that human-produced CO2 was having some kind of noteable effect was known in 1938 - before worldwide industrialization really kicked off *and* during the time when we were still pumping sulphur-based chemicals into the atmosphere (which aided in negating warming). These effects have become *so* noticeable that even the politicians are sitting up and taking notice (and possibly even taking steps that could potentially harm our economies).
The question remains, if you think that CO2 *doesn't* cause warming (as well as being produced by it), what mechanism prevents it from doing so?",22,23,topic_stance_votes_1
23,Mars is heating up,climate change,attack,"I was talking about scientists in general. These are the same guys that 30 years ago were convinced that we were going to have global cooling. And now 30 years later, which is basically 1 second later in Earth terms, the scientific community has done a 180.
They use computer simulations to study climate change, but these computer models rely on an incredible amount of variables and I'm not convinced in any way that they managed to get all the variables right.
I don't put that much faith in Mankinds ability to predict the future.
I think it's rather arrogant to think that the human race has somehow figured out how our entire eco-system works. Especially considering the almost infinite number of variables that are involved.
Contrary to popular belief, we are not the masters of the universe.
Oh I agree that some of them are ####, but a lot of them are not. And in my opinion if there is doubt amongst these people, then the phenomenon of global warming must be researched more thoroughly instead of just saying that it's a done deal.
Is it now forbidden to compare anything to what happened during WWII because of said law? Does even mentioning Godwin's Law automatically close off the debate?
Well the catalyst for bringing global warming to the mainstream was the UN report. This report was touted as the most comprehensive study ever done on global warming. But surprise, surprise, the report didn't mention the suns influence on the Earth, past and present, at all.
Now how can a report that is supposed to be ""the most comprehensive study ever"" not include the effect of a big flaming ball of nuclear fusion on the Earth?
The answer is of course that this information was omitted because it didn't tow the party line of manmade global warming.
First of all, I question everything, especially things that are being said by the government and their ""experts"".
I don't fall for the dogma that the government knows best. When I look at all of human history, I rarely find a case where the government did something that was in the best interests of the people.
Government is all about control. And people that are afraid are easy to control. Just give them something to be scared about (like terrorism or global warming) and tell the sheeple that the government will protect them, because the government knows best.
Secondly, even the rigged UN report says that there is a 90% chance that global warming is man made. So basically that leaves a 10% chance that it isn't man made.
Yet we now are putting into place all kinds of rules, regulations and of course taxes eventhough we are not 100% or even 99% sure that we're the cause of global warming. We are getting way ahead of ourselves and we need to study the phenomemon more before we decide what to do.
But to do that we need real debate on the subject and at this moment in time, that's not possible because anybody who doesn't believe in global warming is ridiculed as a crackpot, a loony or a henchman of Big Oil.",20,24,topic_stance_votes_2
24,Mars is heating up,climate change,attack,"A number of points spring to mind. Firstly, which scientists are you talking about? GW has been known about since the 19th century. Secondly, there was still widespread use of suplhur-based chemicals 30 years ago which DID cause cooling. Thirdly, whilst on the one hand people are talking about how ideas get turned over, in science, for better ones when better data and more accurate equipment becomes available, we seem to be exempting GW from the same courtesy.
Why are you not convinced? Do you have some evidence that these people don't know what they're doing? It might well be quite complicated to work out *exactly* what's going to happen but doesn't it just stand to reason that pumping vast amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere would raise the temperature? Otherwise, what's your proposed mechanism for it not doing so?
Arrogant? Is it arrogant to think we might know what happened fractions of seconds after the Big Bang? Or what goes on in the heart of a star? Or to model how things work at sub-atomic levels? Calling it arrogance is a weird sort of ad hominem against the whole of science.
Well there aren't 'a lot of them'. I also have a working hypothesis that if one has to scrabble around to find ""experts"" to the extent of including honorary professors, mathematicians and (God help us!) engineers, that list is unlikely to be worth the bandwidth it's written on. 
And you speak of arrogance?! Just when would you be satisified?
Merely pointing out the irony.
No it wasn't. Unless you've been living in a cave, we've been talking about global warming in the mainstream since at least the '80's. 
Possibly because we've known about that for about 150 years. The sun's effect in the way you're talking about runs in 21,000 year cycles - the warming we're seeing is far to quick to be its result.
Now we get to the crux of the matter. My own theory for why people question GW is *because* government has suddenly got involved. Immediately our authority aversion kicks in and we shy away from what governent believes. But that doesn't make sense. Scientists have been trying (with little success) since the '80's to get governments to take the GW threat seriously. Now, when the evidence points so firmly towards the manmade cause, they are finally doing so.
You play those odds? Good luck. I wouldn't take them on a horse race let alone the fate of our only home.",24,25,topic_stance_votes_1
25,Mars is heating up,climate change,attack,"Climate scientists are the ones who discovered this, about 5 years ago. The same climate scientists who are increasingly skeptical of global warming claims.
But of course the Global Warming propaganda machine didn't get the message, since they only rebroadcast information, even false information, that suits their message. It was well known before Al Gore lied about it in his documentary, and it was well known before unriggable rebroadcast it (I won't say ""lied"", because its likely he just saw it on tv and repeated it without bothering to check up on it). You probably never heard about it until now, since obviously any scientist revealing this kind of information is fringe-element crank you can just disregard.
And yes, that's right, it shows CO2 is not THE cause, and it destroys THE central piece of evidence for it even being A cause. Bear that in mind next time you assume that temperature changes MUST be due to CO2.
So its arrogant to disagree with the ""mainstream"", because we're not qualified, but you think you are qualified to agree with the ""mainstream"". Are you trying to be ironic or is insulting anyone who disagrees with the global warming ""consensus"" all you have to support it?",25,26,topic_stance_votes_2
26,Mars is heating up,climate change,attack,"I studied those positive feedback systems in A-level geography about 15 years ago.

They aren't new. 
So far I've seen a short list of people who dispute GW - even shorter if you take out the non-climatologists...and I've seen you, Symbiote, debate creationists before and I'm pretty sure you wouldn't accept that from them...
I haven't seen Al Gore's film, so I can't comment. I pay little notice of lay-people who talk about GW.
Seems to me that I laid out quite a lot of support for GW. Doesn't it make more sense to go with the mainstream until you have something conclusive that goes against if? If I visit my doctor and (God forbid) he tells me I have HIV, I don't debate with him about whether it will turn into AIDS as some fringe researchers have done.

27,Mars is heating up,climate change,attack,"I'm talking about the scientific community at large. Newsweek and TIME magazine both did articles about it.
And as for you sulfur argument, I suggest you look at the current industrial powerhouses India and China and see how much sulfur they still spew into the atmosphere. According to your logic the Earth should still be cooling because of it.
I suggest that we first take a more in depth look at the suns influence on the Earths climate before we start levying eco-taxes and start to take away more of peoples rights.
So if I question one part of science I question all of it? Talk about disingenious debate...
Has it ever occurred to you that the vast majority of scientists get funding from the government and as such have a conflict of interest with regards to politicized science? 
I'll be satisfied when parties on both sides of the argument can be heard without one party being ridiculed by the other.
Anybody who makes up their mind without hearing both sides of the argument is a fool.
And what did we do about it in the 80's and 90's? Nothing.
Only around the same time that UN report was released (give or take a few years) did national governments really start to act (Kyoto was a farce) and did the global warming movement get into high gear.
These days it's all about CO2 (taxes), global warming, eco this, eco that, and of course my favourite, carbon trading.
5 Years ago that wasn't the case.
Actually the suns has many cycles, the most common one being the 10-11 years cycle.
And if you want quick warming how about 10.000 years ago when the Earths temperature rose 6 degrees Celsius in a decade.
And in the 70's they were convinced it was global cooling. So in the space of 5-10 years they do a complete 180. Yeah that'll instill my confidence in them.
BTW it was snowing in Stockholm recently. Imagine that, snow in the spring. That's warming alright.

The fact that historical CO2 trends follow historical temperature trends rather than lead them.
These aren't mere fluctuations, they are extremely large shifts in atmospheric CO2 concentrations mapping onto prior changes in temperature.
It doesn't have more data supporting it, and you already claimed you were unqualified to understand or interpret the data, and that to do so would be arrogant. You don't accept it because you have considered the data, you accept it because
a) You believe blindly following majority opinion is the way to the Truth, and that the problem with Creationism isn't its faulty reasoning, its the failure to accept majoritarian science.
b) You believe that the risks of disbelieving global warming are high, and the benefits of disbelieving it few.
It's only now you've even mentioned considering the data. Certainly you haven't even considered your views in light of this data about global warming across the rest of the solar system.
What's your point? I don't have an ideology of ""Follow mainstream views"" or ""reject mainstream views"", I like to see some kind of logical argument for a conclusion. In the case of evolution, it is well supported by both evidence and reason, in the case of global warming, it is not. Why should rejecting global warming mean I also reject a whole lot of other science?
Actually here's one: The idea of ""sunlight is bad for you, you should avoid it as much as possible"", there's some interesting research in that area going on too.

Furthermore, what's your mechanism for higher CO2 production? This'll be the kicker won't it? Why is it getting warmer? AFAIK when it happened in the Jurassic, it is supposed that large scale release of methane was the cause.

Argumentum ad clairvoyance?
I discussed that earlier on in the thread I believe - I aksed whether there was data for ALL of the planets. I'd also question why there would be global warming across the rest of the solar system when solar output hasn't increased: http://www.mps.mpg.de/images/projekt.../climate_l.gif
My question is, given the dearth of data (or possibly research) supporting your position, why do you hold it. 
This rather beautifully illustrates my hunch. I would imagine that scientists would say that sunlight is necessary for the proper synthesis of vitamin D. They might also say that it aids in combatting depression. They might further say, don't stay out in it for too long because the UV will cause damage. All of these points are correct. It's not scientists that say 'sunlight bad', it's the media who chop it up into manageable (and generally innaccurate) chunks. I think it's the media that has presented the GW debate as if there was any real dissent in the scientific community - they've done exactly what the Discovery Institute and its ilk have done with the evo/creo debate.",32,33,topic_stance_votes_1

It is published, you just haven't heard of it before now, because it doesn't support the MMGW position.
Given the complexity of the climate system, how could you predict with any confidence that proposed restrictions on CO2 output would change the rate of climate change sufficiently enough to justify their costs. We're talking about obscene amounts of money, enough perhaps to cure AIDS, cancer, to develop the third world, but instead the imperative is to manipulate CO2 output in some way when it is unclear this manipulation will have much an effect at all.

Why do you continue to ignore the causal link between CO2 in the atmosphere and increases in average temperature? We're not only talking a statistical link, but one with a known cause and effect. Do you simply not understand quantum theory?",34,35,topic_stance_votes_1

I'm sure as a qualified scientist you can search for other articles which reference this, or go through the reference list yourself. Of course, I don't know if Science is peer reviewed, and it's one of the lesser read journals, so it's understandable you wouldn't have heard of it.
Quantum theory won't tell you whether the indefinite benefits of a carbon reduction scheme will outweigh the definite costs. I don't deny CO2 has some warming properties, so does water vapour, the question is: how much, how much do we expect a proposal to reduce output by on earth, and how much will it cost.",35,36,topic_stance_votes_2
36,Mars is heating up,climate change,attack,"Quantum theory will tell you how much warming CO2 will produce, and my understanding is that this forms part of the climate models. Costing and quantifying reductions in carbon emissions is perfectly possible. Obviously there are different methods of doing this and we could argue over which ones to use, but the costs of, for example, wind power are quite well quantified, the energy payback is less than a year, the cost works out a bit more expensive than gas or coal but cheaper than nuclear.
The journal article you linked to appears to refer to a single period a quarter of a million years ago and to the end of an ice age, it also points to a lag of 600-1000 years, so unless you want to associate the current CO2 level rise (which is far higher than that referenced in the article) with the mediaeval warm period you're not making a lot of sense.",36,37,topic_stance_votes_1
37,Mars is heating up,climate change,attack,"Ok then, how much?
Ok, how many lives is it worth to effect an X% reduction in carbon emissions? You tell me. I mean we could eliminate modern industry virtually altogether, lose let's say a couple of billion people, mostly in the developing world, with a dramatic reduction in living standards for those remaining, and be left with just scattered CO2 emissions from burning of wood and animal dung, respiration.
What's the correct number of lives to sacrifice, so that on balance, the sum total of human happiness is greatest, perhaps just 100,000 from Africa, 50,000 from Asia, 20,000 from the West, get a 0.1C reduction in global temperature and be satisfied with that, or do you have more dramatic measures in mind?
Should other options be considered, or is human sacrifice the only scientific response to a potential environmental problem?
You asked me to provide an article, I did so, now you've forgotten why you asked. I'm not suggesting CO2 rises now are because of the medieval warm period (perhaps some of them are, but certainly a lot are manmade), I'm suggesting the primary source of evidence for man-made global warming is no longer a source at all, it hasn't been since 2003, yet it still makes its way into Al Gore's documentaries and to this very thread as an apparent ""proof"" of CO2 as the driving force behind climate change.",37,38,topic_stance_votes_2
38,Mars is heating up,climate change,attack,"Without going and looking up the figures for the energy levels of a CO2 molecule, and how many CO2 molecules there are in the atmosphere, and factoring in the curvature of the earth (plus a few hundred other variables) I can't provide an exact figure. That's why we pay research climatologists to build models, because it's complex. You were claiming that warming precedes CO2 release. You've provided one instance, a situation completely different to the present day, and no reason to suppose that this is the orientation of cause and effect in the current climate, which was very much what you implied previously
I don't recall specifying any cost in lives, I fail to see how getting power from renewable sources instead of fossil fuels need cost any lives. There is no need to stop all carbon emissions, just make sure that they come from renewable sources. Rampant global warming, however, has the potential to cost millions of lives through consequent flooding, famine and disease. If you want to be utilitarian about it, the balance should be struck when inaction will cause more deaths than action.
I don't know why you feel the need to attack this strawman enivronmentalism that demands a return to the stone age. Wind, wave, solar and tidal power have the potential to sustain modern technology and standards of living, as well as support the development of poorer countries. And since when did Mr. Free Market become concerned about the developing world?",38,39,topic_stance_votes_1
39,Mars is heating up,climate change,attack,"I didn't imply that previously, I was responding to a previous poster who linked to a graph showing correlation between CO2 and temperature over hundreds of thousands of years, indicating his belief this was a clear sign CO2 is and has always been the primary driver of global temperature, just as Al Gore does in his documentary. It has not been, historically the situaton has been reversed.
As for whether it is still the case now, that's a different question.
Being in favour of the free market doesn't mean you hate the developing world, or the poor. I could just as easily claim that since you're a socialist you hate humanity.
If you ignore the costs of fighting global warming you will be unable to come to any rational conclusion about what should be done about it. Any increase in costs of living will cost lives, especially in the third world, but still too in the first. Although the lives lost in the first world will tend to be more among the elderly, so perhaps we can weigh them less than the more demographically diverse groups of people affected by flooding or disease.
And when would that be?
My final question for you Jo, if you're really so concerned about global warming, and its potentially disastrous effects, why is it you seem even more concerned about nuclear power? Is there something you know we don't? I've heard the whole spiel about ""its not cost-effective compared to wind power"" before, and frankly I don't believe you.
So basically what have we concluded, we can't come to an exact conclusion about how much the earth is warming via CO2 emissions, let alone what the human cost, if any, of that warming is likely to be, let alone how much we could expect to reduce that warming by taking a particular initiative, and what human loss could be prevented, and we don't know what the costs of that would be. All we have are some highly suspect models that can't even accurately simulate historical trends.
The only thing I conclude from the global warming debate is that utilitarianism is worthless.",39,40,topic_stance_votes_2

Two points: 1) China has indeed (based on estimates) passed the US in CO2 production. In case *you* hadn't noticed, the US doesn't make up the whole of 'the west'. But China and India are indeed churning out a lot of sulphurous gas. This is not a good thing. It's rather toxic and causes acid rain. Chances are they'll start using cleaner technology when people start keeling over dead and their water supplies are fouled. 2) Global warming is not a homogenous effect.

Invisible pink unicorns spring to mind.
ABE: I'd also suggest that arguing that the measures we take to combat global warming being the cause of widespread death in the developing world are something of a red herring. Given that Global Warming is unequivocally happening, if we *aren't* the cause of it, then we're pretty much screwed anyway.
