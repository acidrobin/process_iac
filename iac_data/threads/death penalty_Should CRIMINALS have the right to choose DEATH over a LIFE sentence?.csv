5,Should CRIMINALS have the right to choose DEATH over a LIFE sentence?,death penalty,support,I am also for capital punishment and believe that the criminals should serve the sentences passed down to them. I don't believe we should do anything in our legal system just for the sake of being sadistic though.

@WorldTraveller:
I see your point, but don´t you think that a criminal whose offer to be executed got denied will take any chance to show his environment that a lifetime sentence was wrong? He had nothing to lose anyway so he could attack any guards or prisoners walking by. In that case I would rather give in and grant his wish.",7,8,topic_stance_votes_1
8,Should CRIMINALS have the right to choose DEATH over a LIFE sentence?,death penalty,support,"Sure they should be able to pick death. One less prisoner to guard. Actually, I think the idea of life with no chance of parole is a waste of money as well. Simple, fast, economical execution could control the prison population, and save vast amounts of money. As you might have guessed, I am very pro-capital punishment. 
By the way, just out of curiosity, does anyone here (without looking it up on the internet), know how many legal methods of execution there are in the US? Can you name them?",8,9,topic_stance_votes_1
9,Should CRIMINALS have the right to choose DEATH over a LIFE sentence?,death penalty,support,"Lethal injection is the common method now.

10,Should CRIMINALS have the right to choose DEATH over a LIFE sentence?,death penalty,support,"That is correct, the vast majority are lethal injection. The gas chamber is still used occasionally, I think mostly in NC. The others are the electric chair, firing squad, and hanging. You win a gold star for the day. I once read a very interesting article on execution methods, I will post it if I can find it again. It actually went step by step throughout the different types of executions, and layed out the procedures and policies associated with them.",10,11,topic_stance_votes_1
11,Should CRIMINALS have the right to choose DEATH over a LIFE sentence?,death penalty,support,"*clappingmyshoulderwithpride* ;)
Just a few questions from a foreigner:
- What is NC? North Carolina? Just because I thought that California is using the chamber as only state.
- Was any criminal ever killed by a firing squad since you re-introduced the death-penalty?
And now one for the pro-capital-punishment fraction (not the right thread, but it´s just a short question):
- Do you think there is some form of ""humane"" death penalty? And if, should these methods be used? 
Please no comments like ""torture them"", stick to existing laws.",11,12,topic_stance_votes_1
12,Should CRIMINALS have the right to choose DEATH over a LIFE sentence?,death penalty,support,"Ok, I stand corrected. NC is not a chamber state. It is now a lethal injection only state. And yes, it is North Carolina. Where are you from?
-Since 1976 when capital punishment was re-introduced:
* 700+ inmates executed by lethal injection
* 151 inmates executed by electrocution
* 11 inmates executed by lethal gas
* 3 inmates executed by hanging
* 2 inmates executed by firing squad
States still using the gas chamber (can be requested by inmate as an alternative if he/she so wishes): Arizona, California, Maryland, Missouri, Wyoming.
I think the firing squad cases were in Utah, and requested by the inmates.
The hangings took place in Washington state.
As for a humane method of execution, I believe that lethal injection is the most humane method of execution possible. The worst part physically is getting the IV placed in the hand/arm. A lot of people argue that the mental anguish is akin to torture, but I really don't buy that. If we must accept it that way, then couldn't sending someone to prison in the first place be called torture too? It is punishment, not toture. Lethal injection is gentle, and no different than going into surgery. You get a sedative, then a paralytic (collapses muscles / stops breathing), then you get a massive dose of KCl to stop the heart. It is painless.",12,13,topic_stance_votes_1

14,Should CRIMINALS have the right to choose DEATH over a LIFE sentence?,death penalty,support,"Germany.
Interesting stats; the high numbers of the ones electrocuted (thk god I´m not pc) somehow shocked me, because imho it is as barbaric as the chamber and afaik the chair already used to have malfunctions a century ago.
Edit:
I found this on your linked site (interesting site somehow) and it made me wonder:
""Wyoming"":""Authorizes lethal gas if lethal injection is ever held to be unconstitutional.""",13,15,topic_stance_votes_1
15,Should CRIMINALS have the right to choose DEATH over a LIFE sentence?,death penalty,support,"Nebraska is the only state where electrocution is the sole means of execution. Believe it or not, there have been prisoners who have requested electrocution despite lethal injection being available. I agree that electrocution is cruel, as is the gas chamber. But as long as they are only options, I support the criminals right to choose that particular method. 
The Wyoming thing only means that if lethal injetion is ever held to be unconstitutional for some reason, the gas chamber will be available for executions. This is not saying that if capital punishment is found unconsitutional they can still gas people and get away with it. The likelyhood of lethal injection ever being held as unconstitutional while capital punishment remains constitutional is highly unlikely.",15,16,topic_stance_votes_1

17,Should CRIMINALS have the right to choose DEATH over a LIFE sentence?,death penalty,support,"Personally, I think the option should be beyond their jurisdiction. We all know the death penalty is more costly, and we wouldn't want to expend more because of the whims of a criminal.

zachvac: yes the penalty has issues, I'm not going to even bother contesting that. I agree.

30,Should CRIMINALS have the right to choose DEATH over a LIFE sentence?,death penalty,attack,"I guess I forgot that the money does come from the appeals.

Big difference between having a small living space and being in constant agony, however you make a good point. Still bear in mind these people are still in control of themselves so either you will get depressed ones commiting suicide unless you are paying attention (and these are the ones you exclude from death penalty) whilst the ones that are sound in mind and body can kill themselves if they want to anyway without you being able to do much about it (as you arn't expecting it).
Only difference it would make is to catholics who see suicide as a sin, but then isn't a request to be killed suicide anyway?",36,37,topic_stance_votes_1
37,Should CRIMINALS have the right to choose DEATH over a LIFE sentence?,death penalty,support,"I see, so you're position on voluntarily choosing death is a pragmatic, not principled belief?

38,Should CRIMINALS have the right to choose DEATH over a LIFE sentence?,death penalty,support,"I honestly don't think that many people would choice suicide without a serious reason, and think the idea of vetting potential executionees to make sure they arn't just depressed is bizarre.
How is it different if a person feels so totally neglected at school and at home that they want to 'end the pain' and commit suicide than if a prisoner decides that life is not worth living in prison where no one cares about him and wants to end the pain and request execution.
In the first example its assumed the girl suffers from depression (and usually does) and would not be just allowed to commit suicide if there was something that could be done, I don't see how this is different from the prison example.
I don't see how you could sort out the depressed ones from the ones who just are sick of life and want to end it all.

Why would criminals being given a benefit that is currently not available to other miserable people? At what point would you allow a prisoner to opt for execution?

Do you believe that the State should execute people for treason? Or that the military should be able to execute deserters? Under what conditions would you favor execution, if any?
Laws should be written to make victims ""whole"" again, whenever possible. In the case of murder, the victims are the family AND society. Murder is an afront to civilized behavior and, IMO, punishment should be determined by those communities suffering the loss. With limited space in prisons, a life sentence for a murderer typically means that a criminal from a lesser offense will have to be displaced back to the streets, where he will almost certainly commit more crimes.
IMO, it's no business of any other nation how we punish criminals as long as they aren't tortured in the process.
