0,Why this inconsistency?,abortion,support,"The pro-life argument quite plainly revolves around the premise that fetuses are human beings, and therefore have a right to life. However, many (if not all) pro-lifers say that they will allow abortions in the ""extreme cases"" of rape or incest. Now, what does that imply? Rape/incest fetuses aren't human beings, while others are? Pro-lifers say that they don't want the government picking and choosing who has the right to life and who doesn't, but this sounds like picking and choosing to me.
I think this inconsistency effectively nullifies the pro-life argument. Of course, to get rid of the inconsistency, the pro-lifers can bring rape and incest babies into the sphere of protected beings. The result - a horribly unreasonable position I can't suport.",0,1,topic_stance_votes_2

The rape and incest things is strange and comes down to the fact that she didn't willingly have sex. And? It's murder if you had consensual sex but not if you didn't? It doesn't make sense. On the other hand, if they are consistent and condemn abortions in those circumstances...I find that horrific. Just my opinion.

I, myself, have come to the conclusion that abortions hurt much more than they heal. Not just phsyically (Side effects can occure months afterward) but psychologically as well. Guilt, depression, so forth. 
In my view, abortion is murder, one way or the other and rare extreme cases don't justify its legality. Even the rape victim gets a better chance than the baby does. They're at least alive while they kill their baby. That in itself will eat at the person for years until they find some way of forgiving themselves.

I believe my original argument with her is that one could not prove that an uborn baby was not sentient based on the definition of sentient. Indeed it would seem irresponsible to assume that it is NOT sentient even if we suspect it may not be because if it is and we are wrong then we are determining to kill a baby.
She also aruges the point of sapience. My argument is that sentience and sapience are really irrelevant when it comes to deciding about life. One would not consider an animal to be sapient (although many who argue evolution would argue that apes and dolphins are) because it cannot be considered to be wise really. Animal cruelty is still criminal as far as I know.
If we start defining a human life based on sentience and sapience we would also then begin to euthanize the severely mentally retarded (IQ < 50 I believe).
