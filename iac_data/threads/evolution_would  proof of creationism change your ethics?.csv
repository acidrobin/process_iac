0,would  proof of creationism change your ethics?,evolution,support,My moral compass does not care if genesis is literally true or not. Can anyone explain why it should?,0,1,topic_stance_votes_1
1,would  proof of creationism change your ethics?,evolution,support,"Well, if Genesis was in fact true, then we would have to assume that God is real and the Bible more or less explains what he wants, right? And if there is someone ""up there"" who will damn you to eternal torment if you don't do what he wants (which is one interpretation of the Bible) than that might effect the way you act. I realize that that isn't exactly the same as changing your moral compass, but history has demonstrated that most people's moral will stretch to accomodate pressing needs, and I think an actual vengeful diety would qualify.",1,2,topic_stance_votes_1

Imagine you are shown god exists and did create the universe ""genesis stlye"". How would it change YOUR behaviour? Would it change YOUR ethics?",2,3,topic_stance_votes_1
3,would  proof of creationism change your ethics?,evolution,support,"An excellent question. I've always felt I've led a good life. My philosophy has been that if A) God wants some specific behavior from us and B) He can't make it clear what it is, then to heck with him. I lead a good life and if that isn't good enough than phooey. That wouldn't be a God I'd want to worship anyway. You understand of course that I don't except the mere existence of a book as God making his desires clear. 
Now all of a sudden we know that the Bible is in fact God telling us what he wants. The problem then becomes deciphering it. The Bible is not as cut and dried as some would like. God seems to undergo a radical personality shift between the OT and the NT, from a God of smiting to a God of love and tolerance. Which part are we to listen to? Do Paul's letters carry the same weight as the Gospel? I'd have alot of questions.
I guess how much I'd change my life depends on how forthcoming God is. Is the only thing we've learned what you've spelled out? God exists, Genesis is correct? If that's all we've got, than I'd still be forced to judge God based on my own ethical standards, same as before. The mere fact that a God exists does not, in my opinion, mean He is worthy of worship or following. God does alot of stuff in the OT that seems unjustifiable to be, and I'm not willing to let things slide just becuase someone claims ineffability. So I guess I would still lead my life as best as I could, according to the standards I've developed. At least, that would be my intention. Knowing that God was in fact watching and judging me might, for example, put a damper on my support of gay rights. I'd feel like a coward, but it could happen.
On the other hand, if God was willing to do a Q&A session and fill me in on a few things, and clarify a few points, then it's entierly possible that I might change my lifestyle. I really haven't written up my interview with God, so I'm not sure what I would ask or how the answers might change me, but I've got to assume that if I could chat with God, something about me would change.",3,4,topic_stance_votes_1

5,would  proof of creationism change your ethics?,evolution,support,"Yesterday, former KKK leader and Baptist preacher Edgar Ray Killen was finally brought to justice. He had avoided it previously because he was a man of cloth. Even though seven other of his co-horts were convicted and served their terms, Killen was spared because a Christian woman serving on the jury in the original trial could not convict a man of God, leading to a deadlock.

6,would  proof of creationism change your ethics?,evolution,support,"Thus my wanting to question God. I am strongly pro gay rights. The Bible seems to be pretty strongly anti gay. Not anti gay rapists, just anti gay. If all I knew was that the BIble was ""true"", then in my estimation that would make God homophobic, which is to say immoral. If you have an omnipotent immoral being hanging around I could see it having a definite negative effect on ones ability to stick to ones morals.

7,would  proof of creationism change your ethics?,evolution,support,"the problem with a ""un-genesis style"" creation is that it would effectively nullify everything in the bible. the biblical god both created life on earth in 6 days and sent his son to die for the sins of humankind. to me there is something very wrong with blatantly rejecting one biblical claim and blindly embracing another
the god in this context (one that created the world some other way, and may not necessarily disapprove gays) may also not care about your ethical code. then such a god's existence should have no bearing on how we live our lives, now would it?
if such a god requires us to be ethical, is not against homosexuality, and created the world in a way other than genesis' description, then you are talking about a god of specific characteristics that would lend itself to a precise definition. we would require a lengthy list of rules by which we should live, and a description of how the world was actually created, as well as historical references of god's interaction with mankind in times past. you'd end up with another bible",3,8,topic_stance_votes_1

There are aspects of Christian ethics that I feel are very sound (turn the other cheek and the removing the beam(?) from ones own eye before trying to remove a speck from anothers for example). Unfortunately just like any religion, it's the tiny vocal extremist nutter minority that tend to try and impose their own warped morality upon others that gives Christian ethics a bad name.
Large scale religions are highly conservative and XXXX at adapting to a changing world: that is what makes allowing religious ethics an influence in modern thinking a bad thing, not some stupid woman who's warped sense of duty prevented her finding a vile man guilty of his crimes.",6,9,topic_stance_votes_1

suppose it was knowable in some realm that you were definitely going to wear a green shirt next week tuesday. you have serveral shirts of various colors, all of them equally comfortable and stylish, all of them clean. you usually pick your shirts in no particular order, and you dont wear the same color twice in a row. if you are foreknown to be wearing the green shirt on tuesday, it eliminates the option to wear the green shirt on monday, and it eliminates the option of wearing any other color shirt than green on tuesday. in other words, the option of wearing a not-green shirt on tuesday does not exist. you could not choose, for example, a white shirt on tuesday, because it would make the prediction wrong.
seeing the future means that the path of options is already known. each decision you make can only be the decision you were foreseen making. the other options can never be chosen because they are not the ones you were foreseen to choose. events that lead to your decision making are also already foreknown, meaning that the other possible events that could have happened instead of the foreseen one could never possibly happen. in a future where the outcome is foreknown, only one option is choosable: the one that is foreknown. one option = no choice",66,68,topic_stance_votes_1

All the options were there at the ciritical moment, and it was my will which decided which path would be taken. Likewise, you say ""the other options can never be chosen because they are not the ones you were foreseen to choose"". It's the cause and effect you cite here that I disagree with. The other options were not ""not chosen"" because of forshadowing. They weren't chosen because I didn't choose them. The decision was mine. 
Let me give an example. If I let go of a rock, it's going to fall. This is known ahead of time. But what causes the rock to fall? Is it destiny or fate, since we know it's going to happen? No, it's gravity. Even though we know ahead of time what will happen, it's still gravity that's the motivation. It's gravity that makes the rock fall. Likewise, even if you know ahead of time what I'll choose, I'm still the motivation, I'm still the one choosing. 
Another question to ponder. Once again I'm wearing a green shirt. Does the fact that I'm aware of this now mean I had no choice this morning?

lets say i can travel into the future one week from now. i am now seeing the things that you will do next week. if the future i am seeing right now is the true future, then you will do nothing but fulfill what i am seeing next week. in order to do exactly what i am seeing you doing next week, a specific sequence of events throughout the entire world must occur in a very specific way and order. these events can do nothing but occur in exactly that way and order so that what i see you doing next week will be fulfilled.
in order to see the future exactly as it will occur, the events that will take place and the reactions that you will make to these events must also be specific to the outcome of next week's future. in other words, the single and specific action that you will be taking next week at this time can only be achieved if the specific path that leads to that specific event is followed. this path consists of the events that you encounter, and the reactions you make to these events. furthermore, nothing but these specific events and specific reactions can occur during this week, otherwise what you will be doing in exactly a week from now will be different to what i saw you doing next week in my time-travel trip
since no events except the specific events leading up to your foreseen actions can occur, and since no reactinos to these events except the specific reactions leading up to what i saw next week can occur, it means that there are no possible options to encounter or react to any other events than those in that specific event-path. there are no options other than those you must follow in order to stay on that event-path, therefore there are no choices",75,79,topic_stance_votes_1

is there anything wrong with the following summary of your argument?
100% foreknowledge possible if and only if there is NO uncertainty.
Uncertainty possible if and only if mulitple outcomes possible.
Choice if and only if multiple outcomes possible
free will if and only if choice is possible. 
So if there is no uncertainty there is only one possible future and there is only one future and a humanity is a child on a train that where think it is steering it but where the train goes is entirely determined by the tracks. 
I think it is true and such things have occured to me personally but my brother pointed out that this statement is just the same as saying reality is the dream of something else, It does not go anywhere. If you could prove that you had free will in the sense of the above argument you could prove uncertainty but it is not going to happen. 
If you use of the phrase ""free will"" is problematic because often if someone states they are doing something of there own free will it just means someone has not threatened them into doin it. We are considered to be free people unlike africans dragged to texas 100s of years ago.
