The concept of creationism has significant evidence in it's favor -- as long as one accepts non-scientific 'evidence' such as religious documents and beliefs. The point at which the Young Earth Creationist viewpoint falls apart is when comparing it against objective evidence that can readily be verified by anyone who wishes to do so.
As a belief, Young Earth Creationism is steadfast and unshakeable... because it does not rely upon any objective scientific evidence -- more of which is continuously discovered.

14,Creationists lose debate because they avoid questions.,evolution,attack,"It's not that only Creationists give proofs and answers to questions to show that their believes and theories are right. Throughout history there have been a lot different scientists and evolutionists that have shown enough evidence to state that the theory of Evolution is true. It is not that Evolutionists are stubborn and don't want to believe in Divine Creation, it is that many Creationists don't want to face that their believes might not be true.
The whole war about Evolution und Creation is just a fight between scientists and theologists who try to make other people believe what is right. The truth is that no one knows what is right, but there is a lot more proof for Evolution than for Divine Creation. Everyone just wants to be right, no one wants to be the one that is wrong.
Because of that the fight between Evolution and Divine Creation will go on forever, because the people don't want to be wrong.
Many Christians often say that the proofs for Evolution is very doubtful...
hmmm... but isn't the ""Word of God"" in the bible doubtful, too? I mean, it is just a book that is over 2000 years old. Throughout history there have been many people who tried to manipulate the basics of church. There is no real and definite proof that the words in the bible are the complete truth and that's why there is no real proof for Creationism.
So people should stop fighting about whether to teach Evolution in school or not. Modern medicine and science is mostly completely based on Evolution. If there wouldn't be any teaching of Evolution in school, the science wouldn't come very far in future.
The theory of Evolution in science, just like many other theories in biology (germs and viruses, DNA, ...), are mostly proven and approved. These theories are used and often said to be true.
So in my opinion the supporters of Divine Creation should stop to doubt every little issue that doesn't fit their beliefs...

23,Creationists lose debate because they avoid questions.,evolution,attack,"I used to be a die-hard creationist. When I went to school, I used to roll my eyes at the Evolutionary theory and filter out all that was said about it, denying all the proof science had to back up it's claims that we came about by evolution. I used to be just like all other good Christians, and I thought all of my views were right and infallible, and that science was completly wrong.
Then I started to grow up, and I started to listen to what science had to say about how we came about. As time went on, I started to accept the views of the scientists, and so then I started to mold my own beliefs of a deity around my new-found belief that Evolution is a viable way that humanity could have came about.
Personally, I like to believe that there is a God or a creator of some type, because I still cling in someways to my childhood beliefs. However, over time, my faith in religion dies more and more, and science begins to consume my mind. There's too much in the bible that angers me to really accept it as 100% true, because if it is as the bible has said, then God hates all of us, and he's only holding a grudge against humanity for not being the sheep he wanted us to be. He wanted us to be his 'pets', so to speak.
I cannot bring myself to believe that the words of the bible were divine in origin. When you think about it, the only people who could read back when religions began proliferating the world were royalty and clergymen, so the laws they wrote were made to protect the kingdoms and the churches, and to keep the populace at their mercy. From this perspective, religion starts to look more like a tool of control used to facilitate those who were educated enough to understand it and powerful enough to control it, rather than the liberating words of a benevolent, divine power.
There is so much proof that Evolution is plausable. But then again, who's to say that a creator didn't use Evolution as the means of creating life? Why would a creator spend so much time creating each individual lifeform on the planet? There are so many possiblities for how we came about, so who's to say which ones are correct and which ones aren't?
For those of you who are still clinging to your faith in Religion, keep in mind religion itself has throughout the course of human history been used to commit horrible atrocities, has been responsible for holding back free will, and held back intellecual advancment ever since it was first concieved. Be sure your beliefs coincide with your own logic rather than an emotional attatchment to your original beliefs.

26,Creationists lose debate because they avoid questions.,evolution,support,"I completely agree with you in that point because it is really true that the ""Men of Church"" abused the name of the church to protect their positions in society and to make more money... (Pay to get sins forgiven, ...)
And just like I read in another post, where it said that the Bible is completely written by HUMANS, not by God... people might have visions where God speaks to them and shows his word, and it might be true that there was a guy called Jesus. But who can prove me that he really IS the son of God? What if he was just a ""crazy"" preacher who had thought about many things in life. Then he finally thinks he is God's son und that stuff... Finally he dies in Martyrum so that his name will be carried on throughout history.
And if God is so allmighty, why doesn't he just give a proof for everyone... Most people who really think can't just live a life in faith and belief...
That is right, too. And I completely agree that there might be a creator, there might be a God who created all there is...
But I can't believe the details in the Bible, that talk of Divine Creation and that stuff... Why can't it be true, that a God created the ""system""... It is completely possible that a God created the whole stuff with DNA, cells, and change of things (Evolution)...
I just can't believe the Bible because it's been abused for many years and it's still only a book written by Human...

29,Creationists lose debate because they avoid questions.,evolution,attack,"Personally I believe that Jesus was a regular man who did a lot of good things for people, but all the people around him embellished his deeds, making him into a deity. I believe that after he died, his followers made him out to be something he wasn't so they could profit from his name, and become more powerful.
I feel better believing there is a creator who doesn't bother us all the time and telling us all he did for us. I prefer to make my own decisions and discover things on my own than have a creator who wants us to know he exists and wants us to worship him. I believe it may exist, but who knows if it has any intentions for us later. Maybe this 'creator' has already moved on to the next universe, leaving us independent of it. Either way, I'm not going to lose sleep over it.
By the way Evident, I agree with pretty much everything you've said so far, but I wanted to express my own views on these subjects. I do believe that the bible is a type of history, but a lot of it was embellished upon in order to gain more power and to make those who don't believe afraid that if what is in the bible were true, they'd be going to a place of eternal damnation. It's mostly a means of creating fear in the 'heathen masses', and make them change their views so that the church can have more control.

31,Creationists lose debate because they avoid questions.,evolution,attack,"Not even if it has been shown to be wrong?
But you misuse the term theory. Scientists and teachers of science prefer to limit what is taught in science classes to science - you know, theories of science. Things like the theory of gravity, the theory of light, or atomic theory in physics. In geology they teach the theory of plate tectonics. In biology sciene teachers teach the theory of evolution. It is a scientific theory. Creationism isn't. Creationism is religious dogma. The courts in the U.S. have agreed with this view in all cases over the past 40 years or so.
Perhaps if you devoted enough effort to learning what you were talking about. For example, try to learn the meaning that is assigned to the term theory by scientists. It doesn't mean a wild guess. In science, a theory is as good as it gets. There is no such thing as a theory of creationism. It is religious dogma that is not based on observations, predictions and experimentation. A scientific theory is. A scientific theory has been tested and found to correctly explain the data. A theory is considered correct until such time as it is demonstrated that it is incorrect.
Creationism cannot be tested and is therefore not a theory. In fact, most versions of creationism (flat earth, geocentric, and young earth creationism) have been demonstrated to be incorrect. It doesn't matter how many people believe them, they should not be presented as science in science classes.

34,Creationists lose debate because they avoid questions.,evolution,support,"Of course it hasn't. In fact, it has been shown to be correct over and over again. In fact, even creationists accept evolution because they have difficulty in cramming millions of species on an ark. So they reduce them to ""kinds"" and then postulate hyperevolution (and speciation) at rates that make biologists heads spin.
Proof is a matter of math and booze. Science doesn't ""prove"" theories correct because the possibility always exists that there may be some data as yet observed. It isn't likely with well developed and tested theories like evolution. That's why biologists actually regard it as fact. Other theories, like the various theories of gravity, aren't as secure and are all pretty shakey, where current work is an effort to resolve the theory of gravity of the very large (general relativity) with the theory of gravity of the very small (quantum mechanics).
You didn't read what I said very carefully, did you? My objection was your comment that ""they're both only theories."" They most defintely are not. There is a scientific theory of evolution.

Let me give you an example. I always heard from my mother that I should wear a sweater or a jacket on a cold day or I would catch a cold. This is still ""widely believed"" by much of the general population of this country. It isn't true. Way back in the 1940s the Army did some experiments. First they isolated some soldiers for a period of time to make sure that none had a cold. Then they had them stand in ice water in their skivvies, poured buckets of ice water over them while fans blew on them until their teeth chattered. They were volunteers, by the way. None caught cold. The Army then took another isolated group without colds. They were kept at a comfortable tempature. One individual with a cold was then introduced to the group. Everyone in this control group caught cold.
Should we teach children that if they exposed to cold that they will catch cold because it is widely accepted? Nonsense. A cold is caused by one of several viruses. Should we teach children that the earth is 6,000 years old because it is widely accepted? Utter nonsense. We teach science, not widely accepted mythology.

If your relationship is with an all powerful deity that you have faith in, then thats religion, simple as that.

First of all those who support evolution don't do so just because 99.9% of the world's biologists accept it, they do so because all the evidence supports it and it makes the most sense. There is an overwhelming amount of supporting evidence from multiple scientific disciplines that converges in the theory of evolution.

You say scientists know evolution isn't 100% absoultute truth like it means something! Nothing in science is 100% absolute truth! Do you question that the earth orbits the sun, after all, it's only a theory! Do you question electricity, after all it's only a theory! Do you question germs cause diseae, after all it's only a theory! 
When theories are considered valid, even though they are not 100% true, practical applications can then be based on them. If the theory was 100% false, these practical applications would not work. But the electromagnetic theory allows us to harness and use electricity, the germ theory allows us to treat and cure diseases, the geologic model of the earth allows us to determine the earth is roughly 4.5 billion years old, so we can locate oil fields and coal deposits. The theory of evolution allows us to successfuly breed new strains of plants and animals and is a major component of modern medicine. If these theories were wrong, we couldn't do these things but since we can, they must have a high degree of validity. 
Now, I have admitted that there could be other possiblities, remote as they may be. But since, according to you, they aren't logical, they have no practical applications, they are essentially useless. If you require no evidence to support your ""possiblities"", then, of course, everything is possible. What your baseless possiblities boil down to is an end to progress, after all, what can we learn from ""Goddidit"". 
Everything in life is not logical. 
So far, everything in nature has been logical.
There, Heavenbound, someone has admitted that there are other possiblities beside those proposed by science, the problem is when there is no requirement that these possiblities be logical or there is no evidence to support them, they are worthless.

69,Creationists lose debate because they avoid questions.,evolution,support,"Perhaps you are unaware of the connotation of the phrase, ""no balls at all"" among males. It means that a person lacks the moral fiber to support their assertions in the face of adversity. Given that the comments were made with the understanding that you are male, a comment that you have ""no balls"" is actually on the mark. If you were a male, then the reference is to the fact that you are a coward who is unwilling to support your assertions and claims.
Since you actually don't have any balls, then understand the comment to mean that you have no Christian fortitude; no moral fiber. You have demonstrated that you are unwilling (or unable) to support your assertions and claims. Instead you try to distract with your sex. I assumed that you were female from the beginning. You just seem to exude a sort of female hysteria and paranoia without any sort of logical thought. All of the above are extremely evident in female fundamentalist/evangelical christians. How sad that both are younger than evolutionary theories. The theories of evolution are about 150 years old with a major revision about 60 years ago. Creationism is about 40 years old, evolved from concept latched onto by fundamentalism about 50 years ago. Would you like a reference from a former fundamentalist christian who wrote a book? It is interesting to learn that while Christianity is about 2,000 years old, creationsim is actually less than 100 years old.
