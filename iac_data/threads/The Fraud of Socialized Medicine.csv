2,The Fraud of Socialized Medicine,unknown,attack,"isly,
Are we in the US on our way toward the unavailability of medical care due to governmental control?
Get serious, man.
We already have unavailability of medical care based on something far more cruel - ability to pay.
I have a dear friend who is not making enough in wages to be able to afford private medical insurance (Now there's an oxymoron. The only thing that gets healthy is these companies' bottom line.).
My friend needs a liver transplant. No, he's not Mickey Mantle who drank himself into this situation.
The hospital wants $150K up front to put his name on the waiting list.
Now there's a death sentence.
America as a country should be ashamed of things like this.
The sooner we have single payer health care financed through taxes, the better I will like it.",2,3,topic_stance_votes_1
3,The Fraud of Socialized Medicine,unknown,attack,"I am serious. Governmental control of the medical industry will be catastrophic.
Why don't you have your friend move to Canada and try to get a transplant from within a single payer system such as you describe? Let me know how it turns out.
I am not in agreement with all practices maintained in our current health system....such as hospitals charging the uninsured many times higher prices than the insured are charged. This is a ridiculous practice. If your friend's hospital wants $150,000.00 from him, they'd likely bill an insured person something like $30,000.00 for similar services related to the transplant. I have heard that the bills are sometimes FIVE TIMES higher for the uninsured.
Socialized medicine is not going to solve the problem of the actual care being expensive. Under socialized medicine, the number of physicians will decrease as they are limited by the government and told who to treat, where they must work. The demand for services will increase and the supply of quality doctors will decrease. Fewer college students will go into medicine because their major incentive will have been removed. Many are in it for the money.
Likely, we will still have the problem that the rich get served first because there will be graft and corruption within the government employees that handle who gets what. The rich will simply have to grease the right palms. The poor will still be last in line.
The only benefit that socialized medicine will bring to this nation will be to those who love big government. Can you imagine how many more government employees we could have with a fully socialized health system? Who is going to pay these people? (Don't answer that...I know already.)
If the government demands that no physicians practice privately, we may develope an illegal underground system where the best medical care is available on the black market only.
I would rather have the government subsidize health insurance (with our tax monies) for those who cannot afford it rather than control the systems that treat them. 
Then there are those who can afford health insurance but choose not to purchase it. Do we force them to buy it?",3,4,topic_stance_votes_2
4,The Fraud of Socialized Medicine,unknown,attack,"What makes you think doctors are paid badly in a national healthcare system? GP salaries in the UK average GBP100 000, that's US$200 000, around 4 times the median income in this country. Medical training is hugely competitive, requiring higher grades than anything except Veterinary Science. Transplant surgery here is limited by a shortage of donors, not doctors or funding.",4,5,topic_stance_votes_1
5,The Fraud of Socialized Medicine,unknown,attack,"I don't think I said they'd be paid badly.
...and you say ""this country"" as if you're here in the USA. Are you in the UK or not?
I noticed you did not provide a link to your claim of doctors pay in the UK....so I looked it up. It is hard to conceive of an average being higher than any one of the samples and the highest paid in the UK appear to be 20 year veterans making GBP79,500 ..... updated 4/1/2008 (That's today and I doubt it's an April Fool joke.)

Do you have another source that justifies your exageration?emoticonXRolleyes 
I do notice in the third bar chart down the page that UK Physicians IN PRIVATE PRACTICE make GBP100,000. It appears that the Government Doctors make a lot less (GBP42,500 for state and local...GBP54,000 for federal.)

Why don't we have a competitive market for health insurance the same way we have for car and life insurance?",6,7,topic_stance_votes_2
7,The Fraud of Socialized Medicine,unknown,support,"So, obvious child, why don't you go play with the other children your age?
We do have a competitive market for health insurance. That's why companies keep changing underwriters....somebody cheaper comes along with an offer.
This will cease in a government controlled system. The government will set all rates. The government will create one big insurance provider that may consist of several existing providers all charging the same regulated rates for coverage. The government will set rates for procedures, compensation for doctors and technicians, compensation for drug companies, compensation for test kits and all sorts of things related to medical care that are currently being driven by the free market, thereby making profits attainable to those in the business. Government control will wipe out the profits and destroy the incentive to perform. The medical industry will become a nightmare of forms, long lines, inefficient matriculation and a huge waste of taxpayer's money.
More importantly, the government will be choosing who gets treated and who does not...essentially choosing who dies.",7,8,topic_stance_votes_2
8,The Fraud of Socialized Medicine,unknown,support,"I do, it's called a bar. I'm not the only one annoyed with your 'behavior.'
Not in the same way we do for car and life insurance. There doesn't exist anything similar to progressive's site which details each competitor, product and service. 
But companies dictate who you can go with. Not individuals. Furthermore, the whole medical insurance agency is adding exponentially to the cost, rather then reducing the costs. 
I'm not saying the government run is better, I actually believe it will be worse, but as you have stated, the current system is not acceptable, so how about you do what I asked you to do;

9,The Fraud of Socialized Medicine,unknown,attack,"Without a universal health insurance, the limiting factor is the individual's wealth, and thus only the rich can afford health care. With universal health insurance, the limiting factor is the total amount of resources available, meaning that anyone can get treated regardless of their individual resources, unless the total resources are not sufficient. 
Given that serious treatments are so expensive that only the truly rich can afford them (just who can afford 150000 just like that?), I'd say universal health care is better.

11,The Fraud of Socialized Medicine,unknown,attack,"That's strange. Your source claims that the average first year income for a GP is over 100K (in 2005). Mine says it is more like 26K for first year doctors (in 2008). Has it gone down or are we comparing two types of doctors here? Or are we comparing two sources, one of which is incorrect?
Mine differentiates between government and private practice doctors. Are you touting socialized medicine based on the salaries of private practice doctors instead of government doctors? Do both private and government doctors participate in the national system?
",5,12,topic_stance_votes_2
12,The Fraud of Socialized Medicine,unknown,attack,"The number of private GPs is vanishingly small. In any case my understanding is that the 106k figure is based on the new NHS contracts that have seen GP pay double in the last few years. Private doctors would not be subject to these contracts. The figures on the website you link to are based on a tiny sample (look at the numbers in brackets), and despite the claim to have been updated on the 4/2/08 (I'm assuming that's US dating) I suspect that this is because the most recent piece of data was added then, rather than all the data. It's a self selecting group with no statistical validity. The 100k+ figure has been widely reported in the UK media, there has been a lot of discussion about whether doctors are now overpaid compared to other public sector workers for the work they do.",12,13,topic_stance_votes_1
