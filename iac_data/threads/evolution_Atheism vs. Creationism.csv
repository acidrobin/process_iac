2,Atheism vs. Creationism,evolution,attack,"Just because we are so amazingly complex does not necessarily mean that we have to be created by some omnipotent creator. It is my belief and that of the scientific community, too, that we evolved from apes. It is more probable to me that we came from apes and monkeys than from Adam and Eve. Do you really believe that there were two people, in the Garden of Eden, and that this God character made Eve from Adam's rib? How can you make a person from a rib? ""Well God can!"" Is the eager answer that I usually get to this question. But how would you? Is there any way to make a person out of a rib? I mean, it sounds like a fairy tale to me.",2,3,topic_stance_votes_1

I do realise your cute belief, but it’s not very convincing.

10,Atheism vs. Creationism,evolution,support,"I think what people have been trying to say with the complexity thing is Intelligent Design theory. When we look at a building, we say that it was designed and built. Why? Why could it not have just risen out of the ground one day or even come together from a large pile of bricks? Have we met the designer? No, but we believe that he exists.
Here's something kind of related to the topic. A physicist estimates the probability of God existing at 2:1 (67% chance of existing). The book is due out sometime in the Fall. I for one am curious as to how he did that, though I believe it has something to do with probabilities of evolution, of prophesy fulfillment, and such.",9,11,topic_stance_votes_2
11,Atheism vs. Creationism,evolution,attack,"Creation vs Evolution is a garbage debate because Creation proposes supernatural origins of life, evolution is a change in the frequency of alleles from one generation to the next within a group. They are not at all opposed, and arguments typically only arise due to a misunderstanding by the religious that evolution somehow relates to the big bang and neccessarily is inclusive of abiogenesis.",11,12,topic_stance_votes_1
12,Atheism vs. Creationism,evolution,support,"Here's my understanding on theism- well, at least from what I know and from what I've seen in most religions, anyway, is that:
A) Humanity's greatest fear is its own mortality, so they create an afterlife for themselves.
B) Life is not fair. But people want it to be. Schoolyard bully push you down in fourth grade? Well, come judgement day, they'll pay for that one. It just doesn't happen like that in real life. People create god(s) so that they can justify the wrongs in their lives. 
C) Humans are arrogant and self-centered by nature. We love to make ourselves the center of the universe. (This is only from what I have learned about Christianity. I say this because in Christianity, it is only humans who get to go to heaven, it was the human who was made in God's image, and it is us who are masters of the universe.) We feel alone, and so we have this God figure to give us purpose and more meaning to life.
D) Humans always look up. For some reason, we always keep looking for a higher power. I think that Morgan Freeman in Bruce Almighty pretty much said the same thing, except much better than I did here. ;-)
These are only my thoughts and feelings, and no offense is intended. I do not follow atheism simply because I do not understand theism; rather, I feel that I understand humanity well enough to make my own decision. So instead of just assuming that everyone is stupid, try to be a little less blunt. Thanks for the correction, by the way.",10,13,topic_stance_votes_1
13,Atheism vs. Creationism,evolution,support,"Point well taken. So why would you want to be an atheist if you understand all of that? Don't feel bad God is an atheist so you two already have something in common.

You cannot ask a question in place of the question that i asked you first! That goes against the rules of proper debate!!! Your question is the classic evolutionary way out of a difficult situation which is the incapability of being able to answer the simply question;
If intelligent Human Beings cannot design and build something as simple as a cat then how should anyone in their right mind believe you when you say that they were built by something less intelligent like evolution, a dumb cause with no control or thought pattern.

30,Atheism vs. Creationism,evolution,attack,"For one, if these debates are so boring, what are you doing here in the first place? And if you'll allow another question, what do you mean a ""dumb cause""? Evolution is not dumb; as I have already told you, it does not live nor does it does not posess any sort of intelligence. Your thought that evolution is some sort of entity in the sky that watches over us is foolish and wrong. It is the process by which our ancestors have grown and developed and by which we change and grow, also. So your question about a ""dumb cause"" creating what an intelligence can't even begin to mimic does not make any sense. If I am correct in assuming that you mean how could just an evolutionary process that created such intelligent beings as ourselves make us unable to create less complex creatures, then maybe we have reached an agreement. Have you looked at a cat? Have you ever tried to ""build"" a cat? Do you realize how insanely complex that would be? You seem to think that we are the only extremely complex creatures; a cat is also equally complex. It is not a matter of finding a suitable head, body, and tail and the liberally distributing fur over it. That's why cats create cats; it's what they're there for.

Did you think that your beliefs are more provable than mine?
Technically it is because you are a devout follower of a belief that has no proof, it doesn’t even have any real evidence or logic so yes the religion of evolution will go down in history as the stand up comedy of all beliefs.

It is simply, Human beings are the most advanced machines ever to walk the earth, we are the absolute hight of technological achievement, we have self-conscience, can talk, hear, listen, laugh, cry we even have the intellectual capability of producing our own technology we are unmatchable by human science, no group of humans can build something as amazing as us.
Now what you believe is that we came from something less intelligent namely a un-thinking cause, which I find absolutely 100% foolish to believe, it is not logical in the slightest.

2)if these mutations are advantageous then they are inherited
3) eventually the whole population has this mutation and has evolved

The universe tends towards chaos, not order. Things do not assemble by themselves, they fall apart. The issue really is not one of natural selection, but rather where did the matter come from in the first place. How did the order begin. The point I was making in post time stamped today at 8:30 am is that the idea of the origins of things accidentally devolping by shear luck in a universe that tends toward disorder (corollary to entropy) is as fanciful as believing the bible.

Whether it is God or the Universe, something  must have been self existent. Now we know the universe came into being. Something akin to the big bang at least. Could it have come from nothingness?

If we say it came from nothing, and that the entire framework was cast from nothing then you have something. 
In fact Steven Hawking states that the evidence points to a universe that is either infinite and bounded or finite without a boundary.
Something from nothing, transcendant yet immenent, these are and have been for centuries a description of the creator.

You claim to understand evolutionary theory, but the questions you ask raise doubts to that. You're question about why green algae is still here if we evolved from it was one example. You admit that smarter creatures survive better, yet you don't want to believe that species as a whole will become smarter (instinctually or otherwise!) Some animals learn faster than others, as I'm sure you'll agree, and this tendency to learn quickly can be passed on, etc etc. These animals will survive better, leave more offspring which will increase how many animals there are that learn faster, etc etc. Since you understand it so well, I'm sure you can see where I'm going with this?

There is a lot of information on evolution on the Talk.Origins website.
We aren't born from slime, and no humans have even been created fully-grown from slime. Creatures have evolved from ""slime"" to become other creatures, who became other creatures, etc., until you got to mammals and primates and humans. 
Fittest doesn't mean strongest. It means ""most fitting"", in other words, ""most well-adapted"". Therefore, if being a big and strong creature is a good adaptation in your environment, being big and strong is ""fitting"". Conversely, if being small and quick is adaptive, than that is fitting. This is where ecological ""niches"" come into it. 
The giraffe is a good example. The giraffe-ancestors with the longest necks always got the most food because noone else around was that tall. So, the longest-necked giraffe-ancestors lived longer, were healthier, and reproduced more. As time went on, the long-necked giraffe-ancestors outnumbered their shorter-necked peers, and this trend continued. A giraffe's neck at this point is disproportionately long and thin- this could be seen as a weakness (and would be in some environments). However, the circumstances of the giraffe-ancestors were such that having an extremely long neck was advantageous, so that characteristic has survived.",101,102,topic_stance_votes_1

I don't believe in god because:

3) Humans are self centered.
4) Humans want to be in control.

They create a God to give/fulfill these things. We as humans are afraid of our own mortality, so we create God to give us everlasting life in heaven. We cannot imagine the world going on without us. We want to be in control, so we create a God that supposedly created us as the masters of our earth. (Mind you, this is Christianity I'm talking about here.) We want justice in the end; we hate having to face that life is not fair. People don't seem to realize this vital fact: LIFE IS NOT FAIR. But with God, life gets a whole lot better, it seems. There is some big loving entity in the sky that loves us unconditionally and will give us everlasting life for believing him. And for all of the people who wronged us, well, they're going to hell.

That is precisely what I was pointing out. 
emoreno, if you asked a logical question, I would have given a logical answer. If you will note, I have over 1800 posts on this board, and while I occasionally avoid hard questions for the sake of debate, it is not my habit. You will find many who have asked LEGITIMATE questions that are hard to answer and I have given the answer ""I don't know"" I have also said, ""this is my opinion."" 
You accuse me of something I do not do on a regular basis and avoid the answer that you should be giving which is to show how your question is logical. You, however, do have a history on this board of avoiding logical questions as you do not understand logic and instead answer out of your lack of knowledge and understanding and out of your obvious bias. This weakens your position greatly in the argument. Be ready to accept that your arguments are not logical and learn how to be logical. If you have legitimate questions I would be happy to answer.
ccr: I appreciate your rewording of the question. However, you still do not avoid the begged question on the existence of God. To answer either question one must still assume the existence of God. If you assume the existence of someone all powerful and omniscient etc. then you give up the right to define his attributes as you (and I ) are finite while he is infinite. If however you assume he does not exist then the question is nonsense and irrelevant. 
If we assume that God exists, then the question is, rightly, ""what is the nature of God?"" If we are looking at what it means to be all powerful, then that would mean that He can do anything within his nature. Just as a anyone can do what is within their nature. neither you nor I can take on the nature of a squirrel. No matter how hard we try we cannot BE a squirrel. We can immitate one but cannot BE one. God cannot be anything other than God. This does not mean he is not all powerful. It only means that God is the definer of what it means to be all powerful.

evolution: any change in the frequency of alleles within a gene pool from one generation to the next. (from talk.origins
in other words, evolution is the phenomenon of genetic variation that occurs within a species from generation to generation. this gives rise to physical variation among a species, allowing advantageous physical traits to be common in the population over time. when this trait has become so widespread that it has dominated that species, we say that the species has ""evolved"". environment and natural selection does a lot to determine what specific traits are advantageous and which are not
ok, in response to Waxy's remark, there is nothing in the Bible that opposes this definition of evolution. therefore one does not have to selectively apply the bible in order to acknowledge evolution
the more common definition of evolution - the process of man evolving from simpler life forms - should be more accurately defined in the term ""theory of evolution"". this theory is a speculated extrapolation of evolution over millions of years, and is a form of macroevolution on a very large timescale. the macroevolution of man directly opposes the story of creation. i think its safe to say that its impossible to believe in the macroevolution of man and simultaneously believe in creation (jim, correct me if im wrong here)

I understand evolution just fine thanks.
Evolution, even when properly defined, does NOT mesh with the Bible to the best of my knowledge (admittedly I'm no theologian, I'm basing this on my knowledge of the Bible as a ""reformed"" Christian and my conversations on boards like this). God created man and woman, and all living things, as they are, a very short time ago. The idea that species have evolved does not jive with the Bible. For certain, the ""theory of evoltion"" as it pertains to the creation of new species does not jive with the Bible.
This isn't limited to biological evolution though, numerous other sciences also come into play when examining the Bible.
Therefore, IMO, you have two choices as a creationist -
1) You interpret the Bible as it suits you, literally when necessary/convenient, and beyond our understanding ""so just fill in the holes, God is all powerful"" when necessary/convenient. That's a precarious position IMHO.
2) You dismiss science as being invalid altogether. 
The way I see it, there really is no #3. I think most creationists fall into #1. I think that's also why most ""atheists"", or those that believe in science, (at least for myself, and I know I've posted on this in the past) find creationists so frustrating.

I've talked with other posters about the issue of personal bias in science. There's no doubt that it exists, despite the scientific ideals that would remove it. 
I think we're dealing with different levels of ""reality"" here as well. Abiogenesis, the Big Bang, and other theories are still very abstract in their definitions and processes. The data we have is not sufficient or concise enough to allow any definite conclusions to be drawn, they're theories, and in many ways, still completely open to debate and research. However, there is a common thread in it, the data that is there. That data requires explanation and understanding.
I'm a petroleum geologist by training, so let's deal with geology. To be a creationist, you must dismiss geology. You can argue that you don't have to dismiss geology as the ""science of studying the origin, history and structure of the Earth"", only the conclusions of MOST geologists, but I would argue that is simply an unrealistic assertion.
For sure there is a lot of disagreement within the geological community when it comes to conclusions drawn about detailed geological formations/structures/mechanisms/timing/etc..., geology is in many ways a ""soft science"" as we are unable to turn back the clock or dig up miles of rock inch by inch. However, when it comes to the main tenets of geology that would contradict a young earth Creationist's time frame, agreement among the geological community would be nearly unanimous. Those that object would have to do so based on preconceived notions, not the data before them, at least IMHO. 
I think this is the case for most sciences. The data is there. If A,B,C,D and E all lead toward conclusion F, it's hard to justify conclusion Z based solely on A, or on G. 
In this manner, I think to reject some or all of the conclusions of many or all of the sciences I mentioned means to dismiss them entirely, or to so distort them that they aren't in fact realistic depictions of the science anymore. 
The analogy would be to pick and chose only certain passages from the Bible. Doing so would allow a person to justify almost any action imaginable, that doesn't mean that the Bible supports that action, or that the justification is correct according to the Bible.

these theories are treated as fact so often that people generally consider them as bonifide sciences of themselves. furthermore, many people that subscribe to the theory of evolution also subscribe to the big bang and abiogenesis. all 3 theories combined are used by atheists as a substitute for creation in religious circles, and some creationists refer to these 3 in the term GTE (general theory of evolution)
true. in fact, the overwhelming amount of evidence that supports life on earth longer than 6000-10000 years is causing a lot of bible scholars to rethink the validity of Genesis and creation as a whole. im not saying that geology as a science is invalid, but there is no shortage of convincing rebuttals to geological experiments. and when athiest say that the rebuttals are based on lies, noone is surprised because its almost their duty to do so, whether its a lie or not. not that the rebuttals are always true, but the creationist position also depends on the application of science to build a case for it

You are right when you say that sometimes a theory will become its own branch of science, like big bang theory. There are no mainstream cosmologists that do not agree with BBT. To do so puts them outside the mainstream.

Actually, it sounds like BS to people who do understand (unlike evolution). From what I can gather from physicists that I have asked about this, to overthrow IBBT without a better theory to replace it would mean too much for the grant funding, peer review, and tenure seeking processes, not to mention rewriting all those books!

one of the main reasons that creationist group the 3 theories together is because together they collectively replace the explanation for existence that genesis provides. and for scientists to subscribe to 1 or 2 of the theories without subscribing to all 3 is extremely rare.
evolution itself is observable and undeniable. genetic variation does arise in species from generation to generation. macro-evolution is an extension of this, where given enough time and generations, one type of organism can evolve into another kind entirely. those that accept macro-evolution usually believe that the living organisms that we see today statred off as simple unicellular primative lifeforms, started of as chemical reactions that naturally fused into more complex molecules. this is the basis of abiogenesis. and even before abiogenesis was the universe itself, that erupted into existence and spewed out matter into space, forming plantary systems everywhere, many with conditions suitable for abiogenesis
the 3 theories, BBT, abiogenesis and macro evolution, though considered separated sciences, are related in that together they form a theory that answers ""how come existence""
the alternative, of course, is ""poof! God did it""
anyway, i think there are many people that agree with you that the BBT has so many holes and patch theories to hold it together that it doesnt sound valid at all. yet they hold on to it because they dont like the other options that try to explain how the world came into existence. so far i think it is the best scientific theory out there, but its likely it may be wrong entirely",199,200,topic_stance_votes_1

But, as far as science goes, it's still a niche market, mainly because it's so interdisciplinary and just plain hard. Actually, scientists are not looking to the past, but the future. It's been dubbed ""Artificial Life."" Usually for physical artificial life, there is some sort of self-replicating membrane system (as in cells), some sort of ""metabolism"" that keeps going as long as it's ""fed"", and some sort of ""genes"" where some sort of information is conserved in order to maximize ""survival.""

But, usually when any insight into abiogenesis comes out, it's from some other study that had no intentions with regard to spontaneous life. I'm talking about things like the origin of homochirality (all one handed) in sugars and amino acids. Sometimes someone is studying something about aa's and realizes a natural mechanism for enatiomerically enriching (making more of one handedness) amino acids.
I don't know. I don't know how many scietists subscribe to what theory. If a biologist reads something in Scientific American (just a mag) that talks about BBT, they don't usually say ""why yes, they are absolutely right!"" they don't know what they are talking about because they probably don't know enough physics to make that claim. If he were shown the paper from Physical Review (a real journal) they probably won't understand it entirely. 
If some random scientist believes what some other scietist in another field tells him about that field, he might be inclined to believe him. It is of little consequence whether he believes it or not and the decision to believe has nothing to do with genesis.

creationism is ********. heres why:
1) string theory. mathematically proven by the current einsteins all over: basically it states that there is a series oc paralell planes or *something* (no idea what) that, where they collide, they form new universes, each with their own laws: imagine an entire planet as an ocean, then have another ocean, facing down, hovering right above it: where the waves collide, you get a universe. so in that sense, you probably won't like it because besides taking away your source of superiourity (by you i mean 'anyone religious', and by source of superiourity i mean the god who grants your whimsical prayers) and also it makes us seem so much smaller when we think about it.
2) because evolution was bound to happen *SOMEWHERE*. i don't care how low the chances are for it, the chances that there is a planet capable of supporting life- as we know it- was bound to happen. it was one in 900 billion, you say? good job! possibly even correct! now start counting the stars. which one do you think supports life? why, this one!
point (3a) assumes that there IS a god. and its still pro-evolution. essentially, i'm going to make the point that, like anywhere else in the bible, maybe genesis has some inacuracies (if you think the bible is absolute, compare the last words of jesus in the gospel). could it have originally been 'millenia' instead of days? i think so- especially since it would have been a much larger time, and we even today don't have a word commonly used to describe *millions* or *billions* of years. i consider that, in the odd chance it happens to be correct (in which case i still refuse to worship god, but this isn't the place for that argument), one of those things 'lost in translation'.
point (3b)- also assuming there is a god who created this world- what input did he ask from you? why, none! absolutely ****ing nothing was decreed by man EXCEPT the names of the animals, plants, and all other living things. thats the only input adam had! god didn't say 'how long should i take to make this place?' or 'do you think maybe i should just give it a set of rules and see what happens?' as far as you know (and further than i honestly can claim to care) this is like god's version of solitaire. some games last longer than others, he could have created universes and civilizations and all sorts of things and scrapped them in the middle- it certainly seems to have happened to us.",15,202,topic_stance_votes_1

Second of all, Humans and modern apes share the same ancestor. From
a biological point of view, humans ARE apes that have a specialised brain.
The third problem is many religious people take much of the bible as allegorical. That means they are able to reconcilate such things as
scientific fact, (evolution, expanding universe, age of the universe, biology, geology and physics), and their belief in God.",195,204,topic_stance_votes_1
204,Atheism vs. Creationism,evolution,attack,"Trebor's logic here is quite correct. You forget also that the theories (theories) which you quote also have base assumptions forwhich there is no proof. Particularly string theory. The path does not prove it's existence, it merely proves the possibility. Possibility because it is based on assumptions that cannot be proven. Namely the existence of those infinite planes that converge. There is no proof of their existences.
Evolution violates the laws of thermodynamics. And your comments about the probablity that it would happen because of the immensity of the universe are uneducated. Have you taken what it takes to make evolution happen and calculated the probablity based on the size of the universe. I did in my junior physics class in college. Quite interesting. Even accounting for the enormity of the universe the probablity of evoultion is still below 50%. I cannot remember how far but it was somwhere around a 20% chance.

20%? That's some pretty damn good odds IMHO. If 1 out of 5 times it's gonna happen, you can pretty much take that to the bank, it's certainly better than a roll of the dice.

206,Atheism vs. Creationism,evolution,attack,"The universe is a closed system. It violates the laws of entropy. If you think those are good odds then go play black jack in vegas. The reported odds in most casinos for standard 7 deck shoe is 23% for the palyer. The odds are not good. A basket ball player with that fieldgoal percentage gets fired. That hitting percentage in baseball might get you a pinch runner or pitcher position. A field goal kicker with that percentage would not make a high school team. 
Point being the odds are that it did not happen. Far likelier concept. It is possible that it did happen. 
By the way, that is the odds that radomly complex animals formed from lower ones. The odds for human beings coming from virus like forms accounting for the size of the universe is somewhere around 10 to the power of 10000000000 to one.

I can walk away from a casino up $$ playing black jack more often than not, if that one basket is to win the NBA championship, that pinch hit is a HR in the World Series, or that field goals wins the SuperBowl, it suddenly doesn't matter anymore. Timing is all important, it only has to happen once. 
I'd settle for - ""given our current data and understanding, it's most likely that it happened this way."" 
The alternative, creation, can't even have odds placed on it. ;)
I wouldn't want to take those odds to Vegas, but ""so you're telling me there's a chance"" to quote Lloyd Christmas in Dumb and Dumber. :p

208,Atheism vs. Creationism,evolution,attack,"Well, you are very incorrect when you say that Evolution violates the law of thermodynamics. # The second law of thermodynamics says no such thing. It says heat will not spontaneously flow from a colder body to a warmer one, or equivalently, that total entropy (a measure of useful energy) in a closed system will not decrease. This doesn't prevent increasing order because
* the earth is not a closed system; sunlight (with low entropy) shines on it and heat (with higher entropy) radiates off. This flow of energy, and the change in entropy which accompanies it, can and will power local decreases in entropy on earth.
* entropy is not the same as disorder. Sometimes the two correspond, but sometimes order increases as entropy increases. [Aranda-Espinoza et al. 1999; Kestenbaum 1998] Entropy can even be used to produce order, such as in the sorting of molecules by size [Han and Craighead 2000].
* even in a closed system, pockets of lower entropy can form if they are offset by increased entropy elsewhere in the system. 
In short, order from disorder happens on earth all the time.
As for the probablities of evolution... well, when you make numbers up out of thin air, you can make the probablity anything you want. 
The people who give 'probablity' of abiogenesis, or evolution only give numbers that they make up. There is no support for the numbers by which they do their calculation from.",205,209,topic_stance_votes_1
