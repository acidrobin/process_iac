1,So much for the death sentence being a deterrent,death penalty,support,"Let's research the quality of there Prisons, cells, food, routines, and the prison lifestyle that these lifers find so difficult to endure and copy it here so our lifers suffer the same depth of despair and hopelesness. Lifers shouldn't have access to TV, Radio, Newspapers, or even interaction with other Prisoners. They should be in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day with access only to the religious book of their choice if they want one. Life for a convicted murderer should be so hard that they pray for death over living like that.
But coming from the Italian Prisoners, It's probably nothing more than reverse psychology to lay guilt on the Politicians for better living conditions. emoticonXBanghead",1,2,topic_stance_votes_1

I could quote the Bible endlessly with quotes that tell you that you should forgive those that have sinned, treat others as you would wish to be treated, love thy neighbour as thyself, but nowhere have I seen it say that you should love thy neighbour but only if it is convenient or unless they have done something wrong.
I just thought it worth mentioning.

6,So much for the death sentence being a deterrent,death penalty,attack,"These are convicted murderers who have forfeited their rights be a part of Society. This isn't about fellowshiping with brothers or forgiving a neighbor for trespassing. How can you consider the two equal ? If my daughter was murdered, I would really try to forgive her killer. But I would stand up in Court and ask for the harshest punishment allowed by Law in order to protect other innocents from his violent tendancies. That action would be my expression of love for good and innocent people my friend. Murderers and rapists have forfeited their rights to recieve Societies love.
If the murderer humbles himself before the Lord of grace, he will be saved and forgiven by God. If you read back, you'll see that I said they should get the religious book of their choice if they ask. Let them seek forgiveness from He who can truly forgive, but according to the laws of man he has forfeited those rights when he stole life he couldn't return. And if you show me where the bible say's to let the murderer go free to kill again, or to treat them with respect and dignity, I'll quickly change my stance.
I didn't call for torture, just that they have none of the modern conveniences that make their lives pleasurable. Let them think about what they've done and maybe they'll repent for their sins and reach out to God in their hour of need.",5,7,topic_stance_votes_1
7,So much for the death sentence being a deterrent,death penalty,attack,"Let's have a look at what you really said in your original post.
As you are a true Christian who follows the teachings of Christ and tries to live his life by Christ's words, I was just wondering how you could make these statements. They don't show the same moral code at all. They show a true hatred for these criminals, which I might expect from one of us immoral types, but surely you should have it in your heart to forgive them, and be trying to bring them to the realisation that your god is 'the one true way'. Instead you feel that they should feel such depths of despair and hopelessness that they would pray for death rather than endure their punishment.
I was just wondering how you could have such a hateful view of those that have sinned, rather than trying to save their souls.
Yet you seem to have the impression that I would release them into society to commit these crimes all over again. So let's see what I said in my reply to your second post.
Yet you reply with this.
In reply to this, I would say that everyone should be treated with respect and dignity, and I would think that you as one who follows the words of the 'one true God who forgives all those who sin against him', you would feel something that remotely resembles his teachings.
But as per usual you have just demonstrated that you are filled with hate for another (perhaps more deserving) segment of humanity.
And just to pick up on one part of the first paragraph in your last rant
I'm sure if you had truly read and understood your Lord's teachings, you would realise that these miserable wretches that you dispise so much are your neighbours and they need your help more than any others. They may have forfeit their rights to dwell as members of society, but they are still human beings, and you more than anyone else should be fighting for their souls rather than wishing dispair and hopelessness upon them.

9,So much for the death sentence being a deterrent,death penalty,support,"Exactly, unless one repents. That is the key to salvation and repenting means to turn away from. Now post from the levitican law where convicted murderers are to be put to death if you want to tell the whole story. And is it possible to discuss any issue on any forum here without religion becoming the issue ? Are we not in the crime forum here ? But if you want to use the bible as evidence then let's go. But stay on track and deal with murderers.
Lev 24:17 'If a man takes the life of any human being, he shall surely be put to death.

10,So much for the death sentence being a deterrent,death penalty,attack,"I don't have a hateful view of those who have just sinned at all smiley. My view is to make sure murderers never get to kill again. That child abductors, rapists and killers of their victims in order to hide their crimes, who are human predators and have forfeited their right to live in a civilized society actually suffer for their crimes against humanity. Do you find that prospect so repulsive ? 
I actually endorse the death penalty for such criminals but if they must get life without parole then let it be hard and not just a new address to live comfortably within at the expense of the State. In other words, I'm for showing these violent predators the same mercy they showed their victims. They deserve nothing less. Now you can try to make this a debate on my personal faith. I'll go there too because the bible has been very clear on how killers should be treated according to the laws of god. It's hard to show love for society by allowing predators to exist within it.",8,11,topic_stance_votes_1
11,So much for the death sentence being a deterrent,death penalty,attack,"But surely the death and resurrection of Christ means that we no longer live under the law, but under grace? If the relatives of the victims of the Rwandan genocide and the apartheid regime in South Africa, and the Northern Ireland troubles can all recognise that people can be changed and hence forigve, as God does, those who have committed terrible crimes, then why can't you? God doesn't just call us to love when it is easy, he calls us to love when it is hard. Jesus didn't call for the death of those who nailed him to the cross, he said ""father, forgive them"". We lock people up because we can't trust them not to re-offend. Being deprived of liberty is punishment in and of itself. If prisoners want to turn their lives around, whether religiously of simply by contributing to society, one Norwegian model offers a much better example than what you propose.

12,So much for the death sentence being a deterrent,death penalty,attack,"You are not hateful? So you did not make these statements?
I would like an answer to this.
And yet again you imply that I would set these people free to commit more crimes. I requote myself so you can ignore it once more.
The you go on to mention the Laws of God. It is easy to pick and choose when it comes to the laws of god, as they contradict each other more often than not - Murderers must die/Thou shalt not kill etc etc.
But you are a Christian, and should follow the words of Christ. He clearly says, ""Love thy neighbour as thyself"". This was one of his most important messages, yet now we learn that you are wishing death upon these people, not just the extreme suffering that you previously wished upon them.
What's that other quote that fits you to a T?
John 8:7
“He who is without sin among you, let him throw a stone at her first.”
You are so quick to judge, yet you don't seem to understand the first thing about the words of the one you claim to follow.

Archangel, your 'applicable only when it suits my needs' approach to Christianity is really clearly spelled out in this argument. Wishing suffering, despair, and hopelessness on someone is not exactly loving the sinner. Making conditions so bad that he ""prays for death"" is not being your brother's keeper. 
Being able to quote scripture ad nauseum in support of your arguments does not make you a good Christian. You actually need to understand the scripture and apply it to your life as well. Something many bible toting, scripture quoting people just don't seem able to do.",15,16,topic_stance_votes_2

In biblical lore, Mohammad, as escaped murderor with a bad temper, is the one chosen by God to deliver the 10 commandments to his people. Please take that in. A murderer is chosen to deliver the highest moral laws. Not a teacher, not a lawyer or judge, not the president. And, one who never serves out his deserved sentence. His friends tell him, ""You better split before they come for you."" And split he does.
Also, Jesus was unjustly imprisoned, unjustly tried, and unjustly executed. The legal system is profoundly called into question as a guideline for what is truly the best way of assess another person's character or need for their improvement.
And we are also bound by laws when imprisoning people not to inflict cruel or unusual punishment and to make every attempt to make an environment that leads to rehabilitation, and a factory for turning out repeat offending, which is what happens to most prisoners who go through the system.
So, I'd guess that we don't need an example for better dehumanizing prisoners. We are doing 17 star hotel on that feature.
I'm not saying some people shouldn't be kept away from society. But the quality of our prisons are awful, and IMO, it would make far more sense to send most of these individuals to college instead. Cost a lot less in money and in stress to society overall. And probably give our econony a good kick in the butt.",23,24,topic_stance_votes_1
