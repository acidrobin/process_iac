0,Setting it straight,abortion,support,"Some people say that they believe that having a child is too expensive, or that they just don't want the child. This is not a sufficient argument. If you don't want to have the child, protect yourself, or practice abstinance. If a married couple doesn't want a child, surgeries can take place to remove the possibility. If you are willing to have a surgery to avoid having a child, have the surgery before you become pregnant, not after. Why must you wait until after you become pregnant? One person can have multiple abortions, but it only takes one operation to remove the possibility of becoming pregnant. When a woman first becomes pregnant, she has a living organism inside of her. It was her fault that it came into existence, but she should not be able to kill it just because she doesn't want to suffer the consequences of her own actions. Under certain cercumstances, such as rape, or possible injury to the woman, I believe that they should be allowed to have an abortion. I do not believe it is right, but the life of the woman is more important than the unborn and the woman should not have to suffer from rape more than she has to. Under the condition of rape, I believe that, though it would still be murder, the woman is not responsible for the creation of the living being, and should not have to suffer for it.",0,1,topic_stance_votes_1

I think a significant part of why this is such a issue over with you is that you've enough of a 'fundamentalist' opinion for it to be regarded as a serious point.

33,Setting it straight,abortion,support,"Though I may disagree with juleacatz views, I think I understand what she is trying to say. Namely, I believe she is saying that, if a person committs an irresponsible act, then they have a responsibility to face the consequences of that act - not as a punishment but as a requirement of personal responsibility to face up to the consequences. For example, if you choose to drive a car and crash into someone's property, it is your requirement from personal responsibility not to run but to face the consequences (no ""hit and run""). The negative consequences (ex. paying for the repair of that property) is not a punishment for driving. It is a requirement to face up to one's responsibilities, which arose in the first place since one was not driving carefully. If people did not drive carefully but did not crash into anything, there would be no such negative consequences. Similarly, if people had unprotected sex but didn't get pregnant, there would similarly be no negative consequences. 
I must add, however, that I disagree with juleacatz views that such a responsibility (carrying a pregnancy to term) has to be carried since, prior to the fetus gaining a mental existence, there is nobody to whom one owe's that responsibility.",33,34,topic_stance_votes_2

Not all unwanted pregnancies are due to unprotected sex or irresponsibility, contraception can fail. Humans are sexual beings, they have sex (something some posters may understand some day if he ever have sex) and pregnancy can occur despite the best of precautions. The puritan expects everyone to be celibate until marriage. Not all people get married. Also, unwanted pregnancies also occur within marriage. I totally understand the concept of being responsible, but the consequences of a pregnancy or an unwanted child can be devastating to a woman or a couple.

I disagree(obviously). Studies have proved that a new organism is created at teh moment of conception, not when the brain is formed. Even though the child may not know or understand it, an abortion would be murder. The child is teh responsibility of the people who created it. It did nothing wrong. An abortion is punishment for a child who did nothing wrong, but was unlucky enough to have been concieved, by accident, only to die before it was developed enough to know it.",34,36,topic_stance_votes_1
36,Setting it straight,abortion,support,"However would you hold that position in all circumstances - say if there is no problem with getting an abortion but a women for some reason just keeps putting it off to the point where the fetus meets your person requirement - at that point I would have no problem with saying 'look you could have done something if you really wanted to, but chose not to. The deadline for making up your mind has passed, now live with your choice). Its a somewhat more grey area if there is a justified reason for not making use of the options made available to you (say being locked up by your rapist til the cut of point is exceeded) but those are really special cases that a judge should be able to use his discretion over.
If you ignore the extra issues around Juleacatz's point of view (i.e at what point she thinks something becomes a person etc) then I really can't see the problem with it.

41,Setting it straight,abortion,support,"I agree that the car crash analogy is not a perfect analogy since the consequences are much less harsh than those of carrying an unwanted pregnancy. I was simply using it to illustrate a point. People who drive cars, even if they drive carefully, can still accidentally damage property. Most such property damage is not done on purpose and some of it is not even done due to irresponsible driving (ex. there might have been a slippery icy road). Nonetheless, that responsibility to others has to be faced. 
I agree with you that the woman who gets pregnant does not, at least in the early pregnancy, have to face the consequences of carrying that pregnancy to term. However, I think my reasoning may be different than yours. The main issue I have against Juleacatz position is that, in early pregnancy, there is no ""somebody"" existing yet to whom we owe a responsibility. If, with that car, you damage something that nobody owns, that carries no negative consequences. One has responsibility to ""someone"" not to ""something"". There is no ""someone"" yet in an early fetus.
The very concept of ""innocence"" assumes a mental existence. For example, an entity without a mental existence, such as a rock or tree, cannot be called ""innocent"". Before having a mental existence, there is no ""someone"" there to empathize with.

Well I look at it this way. When a baby is conceived, from that very moment that it is conceived, it is ALIVE, and it is a human that suffers when women get an abortion. So women who purposely have sex and get pregnant only have themselves to blame and for those that are raped, giving up a child for adoption is far better than killing it. And yes, women are killing a living baby when they get an abortion. Yes, they make mistakes, and sometimes they realize it and have to live with the guilt for the rest of their lives.

59,Setting it straight,abortion,attack,"Almost everything we humans eat, drink, slather on our skins or otherwise consume was (or is) a living organism at one time. So what? If sentient life was the basis of this argument, then I'd expect you all to be vegetarians as pigs are quite intelligent (certainly more so than unborn human children) and display all the same basic physical changes under stress that humans display (elevated cortisol level, elevated heart rate, dilation of the pupils, etc).... yet we still treat these animal horribly and continue to abuse them for our own needs.
So, the unborn. If the fact that it were merely alive was the issue... well, that's just ridiculous. Humans use and abuse the living every second of every day- most of the time, needlessly. It's not the fact that the unborn was or is living. It's that it is comprised of HUMAN genetic material.
Big deal. Living human genetic material is washed down the drain every time I scrub myself a bit too harshly with the loofah brush.
Lots of people want to try and make the unborn into something it is not- a human BEING, with connections to others, with interests, a history, memories, a life. But it has none of these things. It is merely a parasite in the truest sense of the word, feeding off the mother.
And that is the real debate. Does anyone, any court or ""parental unit"" have the right to tell someone, in this case, of course, a woman, that something foreign to them must remain within them? No. As long as the unborn is completely dependent on the mother for its survival it is not a person in the sense that even a newborn infant is (newborn infants are viable and don't require leeching off the mother to survive).
As for surgeries, etc.... Surgeries are not always 100% effective and there is that nasty little four letter word called rape that often renders the virgin pregnant despite her best intentions at celibacy. As for parental permission to terminate... despite the fact that parents aren't perfect and whether or not a minor wants an abortion HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PARENTS (afterall, the unborn isn't their unborn, it is not their potential child and potential liability, it really has nothing to do with them at all except in name).... try telling me that a young girl who is pregnant because her father has raped her is going to even DARE asking for parental permission.....? I doubt it. A back alley operation with a clothes hanger is more likely and there you go: two deaths for the price of one.
Abortion may be a sad thing, depending oupon your views... but to deny the need for it only opens up the possibility for even greater trauma and loss of life.

If the court or parental unit is not allowed to interfere with abortion plans, does the mother have the right to kill the child? Who is she to interfere with her child's life if her own parents can't make her live with a baby she can just give up for adoption?

We can't lay the blame for everything on the parents, despite how much some people seem to want us to (it seems mainly a reaction to the various apparently overeacting social policies, such as violence in video games etc), we do have to bear in mind that children, especially teenages are sneaky SoBs and may well hide the full extent of a relationship or even the whole thing itself if they think their parents will disapprove.

Pure speculation, but is certainly something that seems feasible at the very least.

They just have to live with a baby (unborn fetus) for a few months? 9 is not a few.

Also, there is the little thing of one's body stretching horribly out of shape, of the whole alien-parasite sensation of being invaded, not to mention the horrible pain on delivery and, if ""natural"" delivery can not be performed, there is the deep scarring of a C-section.

In short. Humans are animals. We are mammals. We are primates. We have opposable thumbs, which have allowed us to adapt a little better than most primates. Like other primates, we kill en masse, engage in incest, rape, viciously cruel physical abuse and cannibalism, among other acts.
We are not special as a species, nor unique. Or only true not worthy point is that we are an incredibly egotistical species that, for the most part, likes to take credit for the inventions of a SELECT few of the homo sapiens spectrum (those that argue- but man has invented this and that... most people are profoundly dense and that is why there are ""HOT COFFEE- CAREFUL NOT TO SPILL"" labels on <cDonald's cups).

Fetuses and anything less developed have none of the above. They are tabula rasae, blank disks to be filled, with certain genetic quirks and dispositions. The tragedy of throwing out a few floppies because the office space is getting a little crowded hardly strikes me as a great tragedy.

parasite
n 1: an animal or plant that lives in or on a host (another animal or plant); the parasite obtains nourishment from the host without benefiting or killing the host [ant: host] 2: a follower who hangs around a host (without benefit to the host) in hope of gain or advantage [syn: leech, sponge, sponger]

Now, I'll go slow, seeing as this is at least fifth grade biology. What does an embryo or fetus do BESIDES leech food and nutrients, as well as oxygen, from the mother, without offering anything back in return? The mother in this case is the host, or autosite, the fetus is ""the parasite"". The unborn is also, I think we can both agree, sheltered by the autosite mother.
Now, big words can be tricky and confusing, I realize. But when they say ""different organism"", what they mean is a different life.... not necessarily different species (as the example of conjoined twins, who share 100 percent of their genetics, illustrates). So if someone with your exact DNA can act as a parasite, of course an unborn child acts as a parasite... it uses up food, oxygen and other resources without giving anything back except perhaps morning sickness and hormonal moodswings.... it is not what one would call a ""symbiotic"" relationship because the mother does not require ANYTHING from the unborn to survive, and the unborn requires EVERYTHING. Not exactly fair.
With me still? So, using the above dictionary definition, how exactly is my definition ""uneducated""? I'd say, if anything, your objection is that I am being a little too educated and pedanatic and probably not emotional enough for the subject. 
As for counselling. Yes, I get counselling. My risk of suffering a fatal heart attack due to my almost constant annoyance at the human species puts me in severe risk for my later years (I am 24 now). I have held the same views regarding the unborn and ""motherhood"" since the age of 2, when I had a fairly complete grasp of what an embryo was and why my cousin had that shrivelled bit of umbilical cord drying against her abdomen like a sun-dried annelid.
P.S. Simply calling someone uneducated doesn't make it so. If you don't like their views, find a real hole. Most people seem to use the ""XXXX BS insults"" in the opponent's face as a means of distracting and unsettling them. However, I know I am educated. I have had two psychiatrists tell me that I knew the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders better than both of them, I grew up in various universities and animal testing labs (and believe me, when a baby monkey is watching it's mother try to sit up after a prefrontal lobotomy... let me tell you!

However, our intelligence is just a jump on a continuous spectrum of intelligence - not a quantum leap into another realm altogether. 
Our emotional reactions are not that different from those of many higher animals, except that most of us have forced ourselves through our social expectations and intelligence to suppress the show of those emotions instead of letting them get out of control. Certain social animals can show similar restraints, but much less rigid. As for the more noble emotions: I once read of an interesting experiment in which apes starved themselves for the sake of their fellow apes since, when they would pull a designated rope to get food, their fellow apes would get electric shocks. That means that certain noble emotions that we often associate only with humans can also reside in animals.
Certain animals also have analitic capabilities. Dogs, dolphins, and parrots are just a few examples of species that have shown analytic capabilities. I always enjoy hearing about the research on a parrot named Alex. Parrots ability to immitate human speach has made it easier to investigate their level of intelligence. I have seen videos of Alex being able to tell its owner (with its > 100 word vocabulary) how many, say, red square blocks there were in a pile of randomly shaped blocks of random colors. Here is a web-site on bird intelligence that I found from a quick search on Google:
http://www.pbs.org/lifeofbirds/brain/
We have spent nearly all of our human history automatically assuming that animal intelligence, emotion, etc. were a vast leap below ours. Though I don't think anyone is seriously challenging that we, humans, still have the superior intelligence, new research is showing that certain animals can be a lot more intelligent than we give them credit for.

I'm also sorry that you feel 99% of women have abortions irresponsibly.

We don't think of a frog being a possible mammal simply because SOME of the things in its bodies resembles that of a mammal's. It is an amphibian, everyone knows that, and a bear is a mammal, and everyone knows that. A human is a human, but you're trying to classify us with animals.
In this country, this law is going to affect all women, whether they're rape or non-rape pregnancies. In the idea of saving more life, (By the way, rape victims don't even have to die) forbidding it for the other 99% of women (couples for Simone) who have nobody to blame but themselves for their pregnancy, the logical choice is obviously clear.
I think I can show you I'm wrong with my idea of what to do with these children. By the way, if women want rights to have an abortion because getting pregnant is not their problem or responsibility, I would be considered no less guiltless than they. They seem to think they don't have to, so if I did in this case, logically, I shouldn't be shot either. But I do, so it's different.
I think I've said this about a bizillion times before, a baby can go to an orphange where it can get adopted. NOTHING is stopping those women from giving their baby up for adoption. There are tons of couples who want babies out there to take care of them. It's not like doing that is throwing them into a recycling bin and hope for the best. It is giving them a better chance than their own Mother's give them.
That covered, I've still been looking into after abortion accounts and how many people (including rape victims) would never have an abortion afterwards again. They talk about the psychological and physical scars it left on their bodies and their memories. Something like abortion should not offered as a solution for the reason that they automatically think something like this might heal them. It never does, and months afterwards it can still hurt.
I'm afraid I'm still stuck with the belief that abortion hurts more than it heals. You'll have to do something to try and make me think differently if you want to debate about rape victims.
I've not seen any reason to change my mind yet.
The actions required to gain a pregnancy are still there. A woman has to voluntarily allow a man access to her body in order for something like this to happen. She does, the baby is conceived, they have to take care of it. For all those people saying a woman wants rights on her body should stop and think first about what she should do to protect it. Like, abstaining from sex. I heard a governor (can't remember the state) made such an information imperative to teaching when to avoid pregnancies.
Those other 99% have nobody to blame but themselves. They didn't think or rights for their body, didn't think of the consequences, so they should keep it. It is their fault, and the baby should not have to die for that.",82,83,topic_stance_votes_1

However, once again, as a scientist, evidence is what speaks to me most and the great amounts of evidence pointing to our animal origins is hard to ignore. From an evolutionary standpoint then, we are simply a member of the animal kingdom whose mental capabilities have so surpassed those of other animals that we have largely mastered that world. 
I, for one, am curious about the new research going on in animal intelligence.

In the modern age, with all these human advances, it can indeed be difficult to compare us. However, fifty thousand years ago, before agriculture, animal husbandry or writing, our lives were very much different and infinitely less impressive than our current human achievements. The comparison with animals might have been easier to make at that time, even though we were just as human as we are today. 
We are very used to separating ourselves from the animal world, partly for religious reasons and partly since we do see a vast difference in our relative achievements. However, there is such a vast amount of evidence about evolution that it is simply wishful thinking to think that we also did not evolve as evolution outlined.

However, I do have a prejudice for our own species - we are all part of the same ""family"". It may not be a satisfactory answer for some, but almost all people would agree that animals should not have the same rights as people.

In response to this, I think that its the government doing this is where it becomes the issue. Its not considered moral for the government to enact 'eye for an eye' type punishments, nor do I think it should be (I'm afraid I'm one of those pro-choice, anti-death penalty people the pro-life side finds hypocritical). However I can certainly understand the idea behind that, as its pretty close to the idea that I see as the thing underlying the various moral codes and laws of people all over the world - Society should prevent its members from doing things to each other that they themselves would object to if it were done to them (or thereabouts). 
Its here that the pro-choices failure to recognise a fetus as the same sort of thing as a fully developed person comes into play, they don't display the vital characteristics that would qualify them as a member of the society (there are several very important differences that would make similar behaviour directed at me, something very different). On the other hand, if we ignore the suffering of the mother (no matter how serious or slight for the time being) and the nature of the fetus, I think the pro-life example could certainly lead to other things that might directly effect me - especially if we are start including the religious aspects that tie in closely with their arguments. If I someone can be forced to care for someone against there will, what stops that principle being applied to me in other situations. If I intentionally go for a job that will leave someone else unemployed (or at least know that taking the job could well leave someone else destitute) - am I now responsible for looking after someone who can now no longer look after themselves due to an action I took?

Evolution, after all, is still a theory in progress. For example, there will always exist some missing link in the chain of evolution between ape-like creatures and man. After all, it would be impossible to find fossils of every single generation that came between. However, so many intermediate stages have been found between ape and man that that evolutionary path is fairly well outlined. Also, intelligent design proponents often claim irreducible complexity as an arguement against evolution - saying that there are structures in nature that are so complex that the chance of their evolution is negligible. They assume that the constituent parts could not have evolved separately since they only work together. However, all the examples that they have come up with so far have been refuted by other scientists who have indeed found various constituent parts evolving separately. Anyway, my main point is that there may still be unexplained aspects of evolution that may allow room for some people to express skepticism, but this does not discredit evolution. To discredit evolution in favor of another idea, one would have to not only prove that evolution will never have answers to the unexplained aspects, but one would also have to present some credible evidence for the other theory. I'm afraid that your theory of a 10,000 year old earth is sorely lacking in credible evidence.
Well, you did say (post #90) ""I am not ashamed of animals and their lack of intelligence, I'm ashamed that some people think we arose from them."" However, I will accept that you are simply trying to defend your views, as opposed to attacking ours. My only comment here is that you are trying to claim that your views are based on something other than religious belief - a claim that most of us would dispute.
The term ""separate"" is a relative term. Our mental and cultural development has placed us in a far superior position to animals, which make our lives and capabilities distinctly very different from those of animals and, in that way, separate. Similarly, the mental and social development of apes are far above those of fish, making their lives and capabilities very different and, thus, separate. It is all relative. However, any scientist who would refute that humans evolved from ape-like creatures would be faced with the daunting task of explaining away all of the supporting evidence. If they simply choose to ignore that supporting evidence due to dogma, then they do not deserve the name ""scientist"" despite any education they may have had. Science, after all, is the pursuit of truth based on evidence.
On the first point, many animals do take care of their young and do defend each other. We may not yet have the means to ascertain whether this is purely due to an instinct of compassion or whether there is any thought put into this. However, at least part of our sense of morality is based on our instinctual emotional responses of compassion, self-defense and anger. As to our ruling animals, our mental development and subsequent development of powerful tools has allowed us to control much of the animal kingdom. That does not mean that we did not arise from the animal kingdom. I should also add that often the tiniest animals in the form of viruses, bacteria or insects can get the better of us and, where inanimate nature is concerned, the only reason we feel mastery over nature is that we are lucky enough to live in a fairly benign planet. Hopefully, the effects of global warming will not change that too much.",114,117,topic_stance_votes_2

It's always good to re-examine your beliefs-you'll either be more committed to them or find out that they weren't correct in the first place, and then you're a better person for it.
There's no shame in it; you, nor I, really know anything about, say, the origins of wo/man. I don't discount religious theories, I don't discount 'alien' theories, I don't discount evolution. I believe what I've experienced, and everything else is up for grabs.

You(I, anyone) do not really know people. You might think you have a grasp on what someone will do, or what someone thinks, or how they feel, but get into certain situations with them and they will surprise you. Most of the time, people are very 'programmed' in nature; they will act similarily across the board. But once in a while, you'll find something that totally surprises you. So in summary of this, people might say they believe one thing, or they might even write a book about it, claiming this or that, but perhaps that's not their reality at all for whatever reason. So question everything.
2. There are such things as ""ghosts"" or the ""supernatural"" or whatever you want to call it. I've experienced physical impossiblities, and I've just barely managed to keep my bladder in check. I used to utterly discount this, and other bizarre concepts-like, oh, tarot or the power or crystals or whatever other crazy New Age thing you can think of- but now, I don't discount anything. I don't really believe it unless I experience it, but I don't have a closed mind to such things.
Thanks for bearing with me on that long winded diatribe; I just wanted to tell you what I have concretely learned from experiences and what I base some of my life decisions on. Maybe you could pick up something from that.

You can stick to your style of what you believe, but considering people, I think I live much more securely than you do. We can still make judgements on people based on what we know.

There is supernatural things out there. True. There are some things I've experienced with God that I could not have done on my own without him.
Considering the Tarot deck or crystals, I'm pretty sure those are based on just blind superstition. Superstitious people will swallow any kind of thing like that. I don't need to experience the dime-a-dozen things out there to know they aren't true.
Superstitious people (including those who believe in Palm Reading) will even be cautious of the Bible. Not because of what it says, but because it has something to do with supernaturalism. A man stuck a sign outside a palm reader's house saying ""GOD SAYS TO READ PSALMS, NOT PALMS."" and nobody ever went there again. I doubt you'll need to experience their wares to know they're screwy.
Perhaps I could. I have had wild experiences before, maybe what you say is true. I already live pretty cautiously, so I do know what you're saying.

I think it is foolish to put your faith in fellow wo/man. I think it is also foolish to assume you live more ""securely"" than myself. I am secure in that I can count on myself. Can you?
Do you count on the people driving down the highway to always do the right thing and not hit you? Do you count on that stranger you don't know to not harm you? 
I don't. 
This is one of the reasons bad things happen to people. They think, ""that could never happen to me""-and most often, it's because they have the parallel belief that other people are not capable of such things.
So I walk around, assuming that one day, knowing that one day, I could be raped, or beat, or assaulted. Therefore, I walk around with these thoughts in mind, and my doubt in the stability and intelligence of people keeps me secure. 
Give me some credit here. I'm not just blowing this out my arse.

Having a religion like the Aztecs did when they violently sacrificed their own people (and those of the people they ruled) was obviously wrong. And they fell because of it. Religions like hate have torn their own disciples apart. Religions of alternate realities has turned normal people into strange worshippers of the earth, and the belief that stars and cards and animals and trees hold the prophecies of the future.

Are you saying that, even if someone had decided ahead of time that they would want to die at a stage far before brain-death, you would still not unplug them until brain-death? 
The trouble with the case presented by young earth creationists is that they don't take the arguement to the next step. They present a set of evidence and an arguement against the old earth theory. Scientists (as in the first web site that I quoted) then give an arguement against the young earth evidence as well as defend the old earth theory against the arguements of the young earth creationists. The ball is then in the young earth creationists' court but they ""drop the ball"". They do not counter with their own arguements why the Scientists are wrong in their criticism and defense. I haven't seen any websites on the young earth side that take this next step. Therefore, either 1) I just haven't looked hard enough (perhaps you could find one) or 2) They just don't have any arguement back - i.e. they lost the arguement. Debates are not just a one time back and forth. They are back and forth and back and forth until one side wins. In a debate, if one side gets stuck and doesn't have anything to argue back, that side loses the debate. It looks like the young earth theory proponents have lost.

But first I must say some other things. so before we start Abortion is wrong and I will get to that in a bit. 
Next I read some arguments on the earths age? Through science we determine the age of the earth through sediment fossil dating correct? Well there are innumerable ways for me to go with this. 
According to the evolutionary theory, life first appeared on this planet in the form of a microscopic, single-celled organism. Hundreds of articles and books have been published containing speculations about how this event may have occured, and crituques of these notions by creation scientists are available. Eventually it is beleived by evolutionists, this first form of life not only diverged into the many single-celled organisms that now exist-bacteria, algae, fungi, amoeba-but that the Metazoa evolved from one or more of these single-celled organisms. Just how that occured and what intermediates were involved is viewed as one of the great, as yet insolved mysteries of evolution. Metazoans, that is, highly complex multi-cellular creatures with specialized organs, abruptly appear fully-formed in the fossil recor that link single-celled organisms to the complex invertebrates that supposedly arose from them.
The first abundant fossil record of complex invertebrates appears in rocks of the so-called Cambrian Period. it is assumed by evolutionists that the sediments which formed the rocks of the Cambrian began to be deposited about 530 million years ago and that the time involved in their deposition stretched over about five to ten million years. In Cambrian rocks are found fossils of clams, snails, trilobites, sponges, branchiopods, worms, jellyfish, sea urchins, sea cucumbers, swimming crustaceans, sea lilies, and other complex invertebrates. The appearance of this great variety of complex creatures is so startlingly sudden that it is commonly referred to as the ""Cambrian Explosion"" in geological literature.
Sedimentary rocks that are beleived to have formed prior to the Cambrian Period are assigned to a rather nebulous period called the Precambrian. Rocks of the Precambrian generally underlie (although not always) Cambrian rocks and are beleivedto have been laid down during several hundreds of millions of years preceding the Cambrian. There are now many reports in the scientific literature of the discovery in Precambrian rocks of fossils of microscopic, single-celled, soft-bodied creatures, such as bacteria and algae. On the basis of these claims, evolutionists are asserting that life arose on earth more than three billion years ago, perhaps as much as 3.5 billion years ago.
it would be well to insert a cautionary note at this point concerning the nature of these reports. Certainly many are questionable and open to dispute. Some papers have suggested uncertainties of such identifications. For example, although they accepted the probability that certain alleged microfossils of Precambrian age were of biological origin, Engel et al. cautioned that.
Establishing that the presence of biological activity during the very early Precambrian clearly poses difficult problems... skepticism about this sort of evidence of clearly Precambrian life is appropriate.
In any case, if single-celled creatures gave rise to the vast array of complex invertebrates which abruptly burst open upon the scene, and nearly three billion years intervened between the origin of life and this ""Cambrian Explosion"" of complicated invertebrates, we must find the record of that evolution somewhere in the rocks of the Precambrian. Ever since Darwin the rocks have been intensely searched for this record, but to evolutionists the results have been agonizingly disappointing. Nowhere on this earth--neither on any continent nor on the bottom of any ocean--have we been able to find the intermediates between single-celled organisms and the complex invertebrates. Wherever or whenever we find them, right from the start jellyfish are jellyfish, trilobites are trilobites, and sea urchins are sea urchins.
Concerning this, Axelrod has stated: 
One of the major unsolved problems of geology adn evolution is the occurence of diversified, multicellular marine invertebrates in Lower Cambrian rocks on all the continets and their absence in rocks of greater age.
After discussing the varied types that are found in the Cambrian Axelrod goes on to say:
However, when we turn to examine the Precambrian rocks for the forerunners of these early Cambrian fossils, they are nowhere to be found. Many thick (over 5,000 feet) sections of sedimentary rock are now known to lie in unbroken succession below strata containing the earliest Cambrian fossils. These sediments apparently were suitable for the preservation of fossils because they are often identical with overlying rocks which are fossiliferous, yet not fossils are found in them.
George Gaylord Simpson has struggled valiantly but not fruitfully with this problem, being forced to concede that the absence of Precambrian fossils (other than those of micro-organisms) is ""the major mystery of the history of life""
It had long been maintained by a significant number of evolutionists (including simpson above) that no undoubted multi-cellular fossils had been found in rocks that were unqestionably older than the Cambrian.
Do you see a pattern here? No intermediates anywhere.
In 1984 at Chengjiang in the southern province of Yunnan, China, a spectacular discovery of a vast array of complex invertebrates in Cambrain rocks occured. The strata in which these fossils were found, according to the paleontologists, constitute the very early Cambrian. The discovery was made by Dr. Jan Bergestrom. According to Bergestrom ""the cambrian transition was a revolution more than evolution."" Refering to what was termed a ""riotous proliferation of more advanced life forms."" Bergestrom states that ""evolution of these creatures seems to have been a sudden and widespread phenomenon."" Not only were these the oldest such fossils ever found, according to evolutionists, but their soft body parts were usually well-preserved. Despite their supposed great age, a majority of these fossil species belong to animal groups that still exist. Thus, these creatures were not tiny, primitive fore-runners of later, more advanced forms as evolutionists should expect. It is reported that one creature stood two feet above the floor of the ocean, another had a large disk with concentric air chambers divided into numerous partitions, and the largest animal found was two feet long with stout segmented arms. Three species of trilobites were found. Trilobites, now beleived to be extinct, were just as complex as any invertebrate in existance today.

I would urge people to make a living will so that they can choose these issues ahead of time and also make it easier for those deciding (loved ones or medical professionals) to make that final choice. I have yet to do that myself. It hasn't been a high priority yet since I am still young enough that such an event is low probability but you never know what might happen. I wonder, though, about other situations where someone hasn't made a living will but is clearly suffering with very low chance of recovery.

As for the old earth vs new earth discussion, we can drop that for now (though it looks like I may be continuing some of the discussion with scifmania).

Indeed, I wouldn't say that any theory is proven 100% (I had a long discussion with Obvious Child about the issues of our source of knowledge in the ""Metaphysical Discussions"" topic in this Abortion forum). However, my general approach and the approach of most scientists is to trust those theories with a lot of evidence more so than those with little or no evidence. Those theories that stand the test of time usually do end up being true (or at least so highly probable that nothing has proven them wrong yet). Evolution has so much evidence behind it that, at this point, most people following science would say that it has a high probability of being true. Does it have all the answers yet?

I certainly agree that there are still unknown areas of Evolution - the question of the Cambrian explosion being one of the large ones. Evolution is a theory in progress, where its progress is limited by the small possibility of certain types of fossils being able to be found or by the limited knowledge one can get from fossils (lack of soft tissues, DNA, etc.). I would also be quite curious about what caused the Cambrian explosion. Perhaps there was a slower transition in a local, isolated area (which has not yet been found by fossil hunters) that then spread suddenly to the rest of the planet once that area became less isolated (just guessing here). I am sure that some explanation exists - a tantalizing mystery.
Just to sanity check, given that you were quoting my post about debunking young-earth creationists, I am assuming that you do agree that the earth is at least many millions and probably billions of years old (i.e. not a young earth) and that you do agree with Evolution but see some unresolved areas that are interesting to bring up.

So you see, I cannot agree that the earth is millions of years old if all there is, is simple speculation that cannot uphold basic argument. I have also looked in depth into this young earth theory as well. It holds arguments for a young earth which is easily and only possible through God. There it becomes a question of faith.

163,Setting it straight,abortion,attack,"I get the impression that by ""solid evidence"" you mean a complete description with no unknowns and no other possible explanation for the same evidence. It seems that the criteria which you set for proof of Evolution or an old world is impossibly high. 
Evidence is not the same thing as absolute proof. Evidence is the appearance of something being true. The more evidence there is for a theory, the stronger the case for that theory until you get to a point where it is extremely likely to be true. There is a lot of evidence for an old world (that first web site that I quoted points out a lot of it) and a lot of evidence for evolution. Are these theories complete? No. But do they have to be? THe evidence for an old earth and for evolution far outweight those of a young earth or creation.
As for your choice of a combination of God and Science (if I am reading that correctly that that is what you mean by God/Science), then that is still a possibility. If you are implying that perhaps God was the one causing the Cambrian explosion or, say, the Big Bang, then, since we have no clear evidence either way, we cannot totally discount that. There is no evidence for it but neither is there evidence against it. That leaves room for people to still hold onto those beliefs while still respecting Science. I admit to having some trends toward a Science / God approach myself - trying to fit some level of religion within the cracks in Science. 
My main point is that one cannot just discount large amounts of evidence because it doesn't fit ones dogma. Also, just because a theory isn't complete and doesn't have explanations for everything yet does not mean that it is wrong and a theory that has no evidence therefore has to be right.

164,Setting it straight,abortion,attack,"I'm new here so don't tear me apart too much. 
On the topic of abortion, It seems that the primary issue is what is considered 'alive'. 
Disregarding morality and beliefs and looking at the issue from a purely dry, scientific point of view, here is a definition of life taken from 
http://www.religioustolerance.org/abortion.htm: 
""Human life: This is any living entity that has DNA from the species homo sapiens. 9 This includes an ovum, spermatozoon, zygote, embryo, fetus, newborn. It also includes an infant, child, adult, elder. It also includes a breast cancer cell and a hair follicle and a skin scraping. Some forms of human life, like ova and spermatozoa, are generally considered to have little or no value. Others, like a newborn or infant, are generally considered to be extremely valuable; their life is important to preserve.""
And a definition of a human person taken from the same source. This is where the confict takes place:
""Human person: Any form of human life that is also considered a person, and thereby is granted civil rights, including the right to life. There is a societal consensus that a newborn is a human person. People disagree about whether a zygote, embryo, or fetus is a human person. People also have different opinions about the stage at which human life becomes a human person. This is one of the core disagreements that causes the conflicts over abortion.""
After conception, a DNA code is formed that is unique and lasts throughout the person's entire life. At 2 weeks the human zygote is capable of fulfilling all requirements to be considered alive. At 3 weeks the fetus begins to develop limbs. After 4 weeks a heartbeat develops and after 6 weeks brainwaves are detected. According to some scientists, after 2 weeks the fetus is technically 'alive' but is not a person. 
In Roe vs. Wade, 1973, the Supreme Court decided that abortion was legal during the first trimester, the first 12 weeks of gestation. At this point, the fetus begins to resemble a person, and is therefore considered a person according to the scientific definition, however, the fetus has been displaying obvious signs of life since two weeks after conception. 
With the facts aside, my person opinion is that as a nation, our definition of when a human becomes a person disregards scientific findings. If not immediately after conception, the baby should have human rights within two weeks. At that point, abortion would be murder. No life is worth more than another and aborting a baby for any reason, even if it is done with good intentions, is immoral in my opinion. 
I know that is a harsh stand to take and I am aware of all of the difficulties that can be associated with having a child. Childbirth could kill the mother, the child, or both. The child could be born with any number of issues making its' life difficult. The child could be born into poverty or with a mother unequiped to care for it in another way. Regardless of all of this, it is a human life and I am opposed to taking an innocent life for whatever reason.

Discussing when ""life"" begins is fruitless to me.
The issue is personhood. When the embyo/fetus becomes a person is not a scientific question. It is a legal one.
I think the argument above is lucid. We agree that a newborn is a person, there is some point before that we as a society have to decide when personhood starts. That point lies somewhere between zygote and newborn.

To add, it could also be possible that when God was creating he was also testing. He could have kept changing his designs on creatures and that would explain fossils that are incredibly old.

As for when you say ""My main point is that one cannot just discount large amounts of evidence because it doesn't fit ones dogma."" I absolutly agree with you. I have spent countless hours studying these theories and evidences. The fact that every time I read through a new theory and found it shallow in answering the ultimate questions, used to be very depressing. But now I have answers. Now I understand why it was so unbleviably hard to find full proof evidnece when i was an evolutionist, There was a key element missing. 
(God) 
I get the feeling that you feel religion is there to fill in the cracks in Science untill there is a better answer. While I feel that there is no better answer. 
Suppose for a moment there is God. God exists and has set moral, good/evil boundaries etc. That is a hypothetical fence. 
Now lets take that fence out of the picture. Remove all religion and God from the world. Madness ensues. Anarchy, complete chaos, and ravagaging of everything. For if there is no future heaven to look to, why be good? Why follow codes of conduct and order when there is no point? So if there isnt God then we should all be attempting to do whatever we feel like. No boudaries. No reason for anything. Might as well go ahead and die if this is the case. We should die and dissapear out of existance. The possibilities for evolution are somewhere in the trillions to the power of 60, so life will never exist again. And so life dissapears in our empty void of a universe and thats it. The end. All that is left after us will be rocks in space drifting around. 
So the point remains, without God I may as well run down the street killing as many people as possible untill I die. For, why not? There is no reason not to.
This world is not of random chaos (aside from the law of thermodynamics). Sitting in the woods one day it was obvious the incredible intricacy and order everything held about it.
Even to the smallest thing such as DNA. It holds order that could not have occured through random chance. The mathematical impossibilities and improbabilities are phenomenal. 
For example:
There is a tree called the Brazillian nut tree. It drops a rather large nut that does not break when it hits the ground. by the time it decays the seeds inside of it are dead and useless. However, the tree still exists. It survives because a rat with razor sharp teeth specifically designed for this tree, digs into it and eats the nuts then excriments them. The seeds then are not only free from the powerfull container but are also fertilized. For a tree to evolve and a rat to evolve at the same time for those exact reasons are spectacularly impossible. 
Is my criteria for evolution exceedingly high? Or perhaps the things evolution tries to answer are impossible. All of these scientific theories in essece tell me that none of this world can exist.

Some of the foremost evolutionists alive today have written that if evolution is right, then there is no God, indeed can be no room for a God, that we are ourselves God, and responsible to no one but ourselves.
Hitler believed that, as did Stalin. Have you ever read Hitler's book, Mein Kampf? In there he talks extensively about Darwin and the theory of evolution and survival of the fittest. What Darwin's theory did, for people like Hitler and Stalin and others who have come after them, was to eliminate God from the universe and when God was eliminated and they became, in effect, their own Gods, they then went out and practiced what the theory of evolution preaches, survival of the fittest. Hitler excecuted/exterminated Jews, homosexuals. the old and infirm, the mentally retarded, gypsies, in short, anyone who did not fit his definition of ""the fittest"". He believed that all Caucasians, except Aryans, were sub-human and worthy of death. He felt the same about people with yellow, brown, red, and black skin--all were sub-human to him and so it was okay in his mind, and the millions who followed him, to try to exterminate them.
In the world that we would have today, had those two monsters, either of them, succeeded in imposing their ""evolutionary survival of the fittest"" world upon humanity, the kindness, the nurturing, the caring, that we have for each other, the way we take care of the elderly and the sick, the way we try to save animals and plants from extinction, all of that would be gone and we would live in a brutal world where whoever is in charge sets all the rules and if you do not like those rules, accept them or be eliminated. 
Stalin killed 40 million of his own people. Hitler had 6 million of the ""not fittest"" by his definition gased and cremated, men, women and little children. World War II led to the deaths of some 60 million people. Since then, there have been others that have slaughtered people--Mao Tse Tung, Pol Pot of Cambodia, etc.

You claim without god you may as well go on a murderous rampage, and then when pressed you deny that you would act in such a way without god to hold you back. So which is true, are you a murderer held back by god, or is morality possible without god?
Serenity, Nazi soldiers carried two books, Mein Kampf, and the bible. Far from ""removing god"" from the minds of the soldiers who carried out execution, they believed god was on the side of the german people.

182,Setting it straight,abortion,attack,"Look at the nations. Look at the way Christianity has affected so many people world wide. It has changed entire empires, turned savage fearful tribes into God-fearing peaceful people. It has changed the hearts of so many people, and has an effect more powerful than any other religion on earth. 
It even managed to get to me, and open my eyes as to how wrong I was going in my way of life, and last winter I managed to get back on track and I was recently baptized. It has changed my life, and I could not do any of things I have without personal help from another person. His name is Jesus, and he's given me the courage to accept the things I can't change, the courage to change the things I could and the wisdom to know the difference. I could never do that on my own, but with God's help, I have. I am not praying to a non-existant being here, he has helped me personally and has spoken to me through his word and my prayers. He is real, no doubt about that. 
It wasn't until I began to hate my sin and look to him for help did I realize his power. I have felt his presence, and others have been blessed because of it. Not because of what I did, but because they saw God working in me. I am a changed person, something I never accomplished when I tried on my own. A non-existant being could never do that. By my knowledge of God's truth and his existance and his sacrifice, I know my beliefs to be correct.
Initial teachings that are glorified by the religions of Budda and Confucious may be good in some ways, but none of them will take proper root if there isn't an absolute authority- namely God, enforcing them. If he didn't exist, or his word wasn't true, than how did I change? How has it motivated missionaries to go to places where the chances for being killed were practically 100%? What motivated them to live for years to reach those people while completely changing their lifestyle and sacrificing comforts they had had for their entire lives? How did those whole nations of savage brutal people change? God was there, and he helped them. I can certainly certify my view to be correct.",167,183,topic_stance_votes_1
183,Setting it straight,abortion,support,"I don't see how you can assume this. First of all, most of the most brutal wars in history have been led by religious people who felt they had God on their side. The current crisis of terrorism in the world is largely caused by a religion that tells young men that they will automatically go to a wondrous heaven if they die for their faith. Even given various circumstances that may have otherwise led them to hate the West, do you really think that they would XXXX themselves up along with so many innocents if it were not for their religious beliefs? History has shown that religion does not stop violence or the horrors of this world and, in many cases, is used as an excuse for them. Human nature will be human nature and will use the arguements of the society that it finds itself in (be it religious or secular) to justify its actions. The thing we do have which stops us from violent actions is a sense of compassion that seems to be part of our biological makeup itself. It is our societies that can either nurture that compassion or subdue it in the name of an external goal. Nothing in history has shown me that those countries ruled on religious grounds are any less violent than those that are ruled on secular grounds. As for personal morality, it is absurd to think that people who are not religious have no restraints on their morality. People have the capacity for compassion and empathy that is independent of any social construct (religious or secular). I, for one, do not stop myself from hurting others due to fear or respect for God. I do it because I feel compassion for others and would feel guilty if I purposely hurt someone if that hurt could be avoided. 
The calculations of improbability I have heard from people who argue against Evolution are based on false assumptions - namely, that the thing that turned out was the ultimate goal. For example, the chance that another set of beings exactly like us turning out in another planet is miniscule. However, that does not mean that some other type of intelligent life might not arise. As for arguements such as irreducible complexity, I would refer you to the Intelligent Design vs. Evolution section of 4forums.com, where people far more knowledgable on the details of Evolution than I present very valid arguements. Basically, for most if not all of the challenges (such as irreducible complexity) that anti-Evolutionists have brought up, scientists have found examples which negate their arguements.
Evolution and Science in general does not have all the answers. However, that does not automatically mean that the only alternative is God. Before we knew what causes lightning, we thought it was caused by the gods / God - until we learned otherwise. Does this mean that Science will eventually push out all room for a belief in God or the supernatural? I doubt it and, personally, I hope it doesn't. For example, I would still like to believe that there is more to us than just the physical - I have no evidence for this but it is still not completely disproven. So, I try to fit some level of religion within those unknowns of Science.",180,184,topic_stance_votes_2

187,Setting it straight,abortion,attack,"I have always found it tragic how so many religions, whose original intent may have been far more peaceful and compassionate, can be destorted by people with an agenda into excuses for war and brutality. People often will pick and choose the teachings of a particular religion to suite their purpose. Even Islam, which is blamed for so much violence, when taken as a whole, is far more mild than the distorted version. In an ideal world, I would agree with you that religion can be a force for good (though I would argue that it is not the only force for good). Unfortunately, the real world is often different.
One would think that those countries and peoples that are more prosperous and, therefore, mainly more educated and less desparate would be more compassionate in their approach to others - both in their religious outlook and in their secular outlook. In general, I think that tends to be true. On those occasions when our (US) government ever performs any brutal actions against others, most of the time it is without the knowledge of the people (either due to lack of proper reporting or simple disinterest in foreign affairs). The thing that scares me is that otherwise peaceful and compassionate people can be turned barbarous and cruel under the right circumstances. Even the September 11 terrorist attacks caused many people to not only blame those responsible but to hate all of Islam. Imagine how harshly people would react if the crisis was much larger.
That is why I am so supportive of a free press and of a society which has the courage to teach all sides of an issue instead of spreading propaganda that makes an enemy subhuman. Compassion should be encouraged in all aspects of life - though a realistic compassion that understands that not all people are well intentioned or redeamable.",187,188,topic_stance_votes_2
188,Setting it straight,abortion,support,"This reminds me of an ""animated conversation"" I had with someone about the death penalty. I'm anti-death penalty, and he's all for it. He asked me how I would feel if my loved ones were brutally murdered. I really sat and pondered for a long time, trying to find the truth other than what I ""should"" say.
I think many people's opinions would change if they were honest with themselves.
That said, mine did not, although I recognize the fact that I would be feeling very, very vengeful for quite some time. I'd really have to work at being compassionate. Just as an abortion wouldn't ""cure"" pain from a rape an act of murder by the gov't on my loved one's behalf wouldn't ""cure"" anything. But people don't think of this, they stick with their feelings of vengefulness and hate. Can't blame 'em, sometimes, you do have to work at being compassionate, and too often people just don't use their noggin.
Isn't it odd that the same person who supports reproductive freedom (abortion), is a semi-vegetarian and is against the death penalty? Surely I am not the only person out here like this. Why does this phenomenon exist?

189,Setting it straight,abortion,support,"I also have to admit that, if a loved one were killed in a criminal act or in a war, it would be very difficult for me to view the perpetrators with any compassion as a fellow human being. Fortunately, I am lucky enough to live in a country (the US) which has never dealt with the inhumanity of an invading force. That is one of the reasons why so many Americans retain a sense of idealism that other countries (I have Europeans in mind) find quaint but useful - at least in past years. How would we change, on the national and personal level, if we were subject to the same brutalities that many other people have experienced? I fear that we would distort the secular and religious ideals of freedom and righteousness to wage brutal war on not only the guilty but on the innocent as well. When people act on hate, their judgement is often very impaired.
Well, if a woman was raped and got pregnant from that rape, it would take a very strong personality indeed to be able to keep that pregnancy from being a mental torture - a constant reminder of that rape, that extremely personal violation. Not too many people are strong enough to withstand that. 
I think that part of your view of the pro-choice stance being contrary to the semi-vegetarian stance or stances against the death penalty stems from your assumptions about the embryo/fetus. My personal view, being closer to pro-choice, is that what matters most is when the fetus starts acquiring a mind. That is when I start to feel compassion (it is hard to feel compassion to just a body) and would place strong restrictions on abortion. Science seems to tell us that the first possibility of that is around the beginning of the third trimester. Most people who I know who are pro-choice are also quite uncomfortable with third trimester abortions since the fetus indeed starts to become quite similar to a baby. However, the great majority of abortions happen in the first trimester (almost 90%), when the embryo/fetus is in a state so far from a born baby that it elicits much less compassion. Then, the compassion for the woman wins out for most pro-choice people. 
I know that it is wishful thinking to hope that our press would be completely free and objective. However, I think that one should never loose one's sense of idealism completely. Idealism is not the same as naivete. Just because one thinks that an ideal is possible doesn't mean that one thinks it currently exists or that it would be easy. I just think that, once we lose hope and become cynical, the battle becomes lost and an ideal that once had a chance then has no chance.",189,190,topic_stance_votes_2
