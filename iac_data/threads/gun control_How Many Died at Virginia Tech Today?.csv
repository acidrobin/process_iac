You need to do a little more research on this, Simone. Every study I have ever seen on the subject shows the exact opposite...gun owners tend to be confident, self assured individuals who are confident in their ability to handle adverse situations. Anti gunners, on the other hand, tend to be afraid of crime, afraid of their fellow human beings, and doubt thier ability to handle adverse situations.
Course, I don't know that we really need a study to tell us that. It is a simple logical exercise to come to the same conclusion...and frankly it is the only logical one that can be drawn. 
I personally feel sorry for most anti gunners. It must be horrible to live in such fear of the people around you and have so little confidence in your ability to handle problems that may arise on your own. I cannot even imagine living like that. 
I was coming back fron denver one time with a guy from work. We had gone out there for a trade show and driven because we had a bunch of stuff we had to take with us. We were coming back on I-70 and it was getting dark and we came up on a minivan that was having problems. Dad was rooting around under the hood while mom and two fo the kids sat on the embankment well back from the road. I pulled over and backed up to see if I could help and the guys I worked with went ballistic.
""What the hell are you doing?? That could be a crazed killer back there!!""
I briefly wondered if maybe it was time for a drug screen for my valued employee. What kind of crazed killer takes his wife and kids with him in a minivan on his killing sprees? 
It turned out that the alternator in the van had gone out, and probably some time before. I gave them a jump and followed them until their vehicle stopped again, then gave them another jump. We did that abot 4 times before we got to a town big enough to have an auto parts store. Then I helped the guy put the new alternator on because he didn't have any tools and I alwasy carry a small tool kit in my vehicles.
Every time I got out of the truck, that other guy locked the doors behind me. He refused to get out when that family was anywhere in view. He was just sure that it was all a ruse to get us alone so they could kill us. 
What kind of way is that to live, and what kind of society can you possibly have that is worth living in when people are so afraid of everybody else that they will leave a family stranded on the side of the highway rather than help them out? 
I do not envy you, simone. I can not imagine how terrifying it must be to be constantly afraid of everybody around you and to be constanly in fear for your life. I don't know if maybe there is some medication you could take or something but you might look into that. The world is a lot better place once you realize that not everybody is a crazed killing machine. Some people are actually good folks. That family by the minivan may just be a family on vacation with broken down car.

Naturally the police can't do anything about it because they are only a reactionary force and are never pro-active.

Nah, you don't need guns for anything. The Masters of the land will chase the wild beasties off with their pure breed hounds, flushers and artistically rendered weaponry whilst straddled atop their stallions. The serfs can cower in their hovels.
Over here however, we needed weaponry to protect all of out precious resources from foreigners...and the indigenous peoples were were taking them from. Self determination was placed in the hands of the people with a modicrum of military might (that won by luck alone more often than not) to form posses and militias to go do fightin' when it was deemed needed.
Furthermore, wars we've seen have been opprotinities where a citizen owned gun could affect a difference. Wars you've recently seen...having one would be more like spitting in the wind.
We also have plenty of space for storage of our weaponry. I'm sure you could use a rifle as a hanger rod in the closet or as a hat rack...but that kind of defeats the purpose. Me, I have a firing range in my home...it was built on a sacred Indian burial site...

Hi there, nice to meet you all. I'm new here. 
Now lets get into the meat of it shall we... emoticonXKill 
There is not one person out there that can make an intelligent remark about Gun Control in the aspect that banning guns or stricter laws would have prevented the VT massacre. I'm sorry folks your little dream world of rainbows and glitter is as silly your opinion on this matter. 
Take a look at the facts of the issue: 
1:) Nature Finds a way:
An Intelligent person determined to do a great deal of damage will find a way. If not with a gun then with a bomb, or with a sword, or with a pointy stick. I mean for crying out loud the 9-11 attacks were accomplished with BOXCUTTERS!!!. The argument that less damage would be caused if there were no guns holds no water at all. 
2:) The guns purchased in the attack were Purchased Legally 
Meaning that the gunman bought his weapons legally. They were not stolen from someone who didn't put them in a safe. Just because it was a ""School Shooting"" people tend to assume the gunman acquired the weapons through some gap in the law that needs to be closed. This was at a College. Most people there are old enough to have guns legally. People need to consider things like this before jumping to conclusions. As for his ability to get the weapons he used being the cause? See point #1. 
3:) Banning Guns in Australia made everything better
Wake up people... The statistics show that after that Ban in Australia Violent Crime Skyrocketed. Violent Home invasions going up by some horrible figure. 
4:) Why does this seem to happen at schools more then other environments?
The brutal truth is that for someone looking for a nice body count a school is an ideal target. Schools are the ultimate sheep flock for a wolf with a taste for lamb chops. Most Schools are absolute Gun Free Zones with little to nothing to protect themselves with. Classrooms with only 1 way in and out most times. Like shooting fish in a barrel. Seriously a school or campus is the place where anyone looking to go on a rampage would expect to find the lease resistance. They figure that is the place they can do the most damage before being stopped, and sadly it's true. I'm not saying that Students in High schools should be packing. But maybe some of the Teachers should be. In College everyone is an adult for the most part and or legal age to carry a weapon. That 2nd amendment right should not be infringed. If it had not been there might be 30+ less victims today. 
5:) 1 honest and brave person with a gun can save as many lives in a place like that as a 1 dishonest one can take. 
Image if even 1 or 2 of the students in the room had a weapon for self defense. The gunman would have only been able to get a few shots off before he caught return fire. There exists a good chance that no one would have died at all even. The gunman could have gotten wounded and his targets might have only caught non life threatening wounds. Had there been someone with the means to defend them we could be looking at 0-3 dead instead of 33. Imagine if all of them were carying heat. There woulda been nothing left of the gunman but a twitching pile of meat before he even had a chance to do any damage. 
6:) There is no such thing as Banning all Guns
This point has been made so many times by so many people with such solid evidence to back it up that it should be a law of physics by now. Best example I've seen to back it up is a Prison Museum I saw once on Discovery. There was a semi-automatic pistol on display that a prisoner made from plumbing pipes and utensils. And it worked. If a prisoner in a high security jail can construct a firearm then it can certainly be done by anyone in the country with a bit of tinkering skills.

57,How Many Died at Virginia Tech Today?,gun control,attack,"I haven’t gotten into this discussion before now because I think it’s too early to speculate on what has happened. 
I have nothing to do with the investigation of this incident. I do know some of the people working the investigation because the massive call-up for assistance summoned officers whom I have worked with in other shootings. They are extraordinarily competent and thorough investigators. But bear in mind that these men and women are not actors reading from a prepared script that has them solving a murder case in a half-hour TV time slot with room for commercial breaks. I can guarantee that this investigation will not keep pace with the expectations of impatient media news anchors. 
I think we all need to slow down and wait to see what they uncover lest we embarrass ourselves with rampant speculation which later proves unfounded. I know, for example, that a search warrant has been obtained to search the suspected shooter’s dorm room, and by now his room has undoubtedly been searched. The investigators have 72 hours to file a return with the Clerk of the Court containing an inventory of what, if anything, was seized as evidence from that room. Assuming that it is even possible to obtain a definitive answer to why and how this incident happened, we won’t know it for several days. I remember our vain discussions of the officer-involved shooting in England that came in the days of heightened fear after the subway bombings. We were all (myself included) just ####### in the wind and speculating about an event before we really knew what happened. 
There was a time after 9/11 when people stopped calling themselves liberal or conservative, Democrat or Republican, and simply said “we are Americans.” This shooting is also an event which should temporarily transcend politics, and today it brought an anti gun ownership Democratic Governor and a pro gun ownership Republican President together to mourn the loss of life. Their reaction should serve as a lesson for all of us. 
It amazes me that opportunists are lining up to claim political capital from an event which is still under investigation and not definitively answered yet. Locally, I see ignorant racists are already blaming the suspected shooter’s national origin, and are arguing that persons of Asian descent are “ungrateful” for the opportunity this nation has afforded them, and that we should send them all “back home where they belong.” And now I see that within hours of the media awakening to this event gun control supporters are already using a shooting which they don’t fully understand for their own ends. My friends, there will be a time to bring this event to the floor for evaluation in the gun control debate, but I submit that the time is not now. Now is the time to mourn what has happened, and to await the answers law enforcement can bring us for how and why this happened that will enable us to have a rational discussion of this tragedy.

It seems to me that there are obvious problems in thinking that would-be armed assailants can somehow be controlled by allowing the entire population to arm themselves with equal deadly force. 
I have no doubt that many gun owners derive some confidence from possessing a weapon. It's possible that a gun owner could be better armed, faster, or more skilled at handling their weapon than a would-be assailant. But do we really want to find this out, and do we want to force a deranged individual to take their threat to the next level, or perhaps even worse, pick an easier target? I agree that it’s terrible that no one was able to stop the individual in this case, but I’m not sure that extreme answers that could cause other problems are necessarily good solutions to isolated mass shooting incidents. It’s a sad event that doesn’t need a knee jerk response.
If we promote arming the population, where does it stop? If we truly believe in the right to carry arms, then perhaps we are saying that every country in the world should also be entitled to pack the biggest guns, a nuclear arsenal, in the name of “safety”.

I live in Australia, and the government made a “fair” (some might say “token”) effort to remove as many automatic and semi automatic weapons from the general public as possible. It’s still fairly easy to legally obtain a non automatic weapon, but you do have to jump through a series of hoops that makes a moderate attempt to screen individuals.

Has it worked? Probably not. People who are up to no good, will always manage to get their hands on weapons. Do I feel safer? Absolutely, but maybe it’s a false sense of security. To me it’s a simple case that even if you are a criminal, guns are harder to get (because not every man and his dog has a range of semi automatic guns at home), and if you do have one, you will be targeted by police if they see it, because these weapons are not permitted in public.

The authors remind us that the main aim of the National Agreement on Gun Laws was to reduce the risk of gun massacres continuing as they had in the decade before the Agreement; hence they are able to claim that this aim has been achieved, and they state, ""The Australian example provides evidence that removing large numbers of firearms from a community can be associated with a sudden and on-going decline in mass shootings, and accelerated declines in total firearm-related deaths, firearm homicides and firearm suicides.""

Sharp Drop in Gun Crime Follows Tough Australian Firearm Laws 
Latest official data from Australia shows a marked reduction in gun-related crime and injury following recent restrictions on the private ownership of firearms. 
Twelve days after 35 people were shot dead by a single gunman in Tasmania, Australia's state and federal governments agreed to enact wide-ranging new gun control laws to curb firearm-related death and injury. Between July 1996 and August 1998, the new restrictions were brought into force. Since that time, key indicators for gun-related death and crime have shown encouraging results. 
Firearm-Related Homicide 
""There was a decrease of almost 30% in the number of homicides by firearms from 1997 to 1998."" 
-- Australian Crime - Facts and Figures 1999. Australian Institute of Criminology. Canberra, Oct 1999 
This report shows that as gun ownership has been progressively restricted since 1915, Australia's firearm homicide rate per 100,000 population has declined to almost half its 85-year average. 
Homicide by Any Method 
The overall rate of homicide in Australia has also dropped to its lowest point since 1989 (National Homicide Monitoring Program, 1997-98 data). It remains one-fourth the homicide rate in the USA. 
The Institute of Criminology report Australian Crime - Facts and Figures 1999 includes 1998 homicide data showing ""a 9% decrease from the rate in 1997."" This is the period in which most of the country's new gun laws came into force. 
Gun-Related Death by Any Cause 
The Australian Bureau of Statistics counts all injury deaths, whether or not they are crime-related. The most recently available ABS figures show a total of 437 firearm-related deaths (homicide, suicide and unintentional) for 1997. This is the lowest number for 18 years. 
The Australian rate of gun death per 100,000 population remains one-fifth that of the United States. 
""We have observed a decline in firearm-related death rates (essentially in firearm-related suicides) in most jurisdictions in Australia. We have also seen a declining trend in the percentage of robberies involving the use of firearms in Australia."" 
-- Mouzos, J. Firearm-related Violence: The Impact of the Nationwide Agreement on Firearms. Trends & Issues in Crime & Criminal Justice No. 116. Australian Institute of Criminology. Canberra, May 1999; 6 
Assault and Robbery 
Those who claim that Australia suffered a ""crime wave"" as a result of new gun laws often cite as evidence unrelated figures for common assault or sexual assault (no weapon) and armed robbery (any weapon). In fact less than one in five Australian armed robberies involve a firearm. 
""Although armed robberies increased by nearly 20%, the number of armed robberies involving a firearm decreased to a six-year low."" 
-- Recorded Crime, Australia, 1998. Australian Bureau of Statistics, Jun 1999 
Firearm-Related Crime in Tasmania 
""A declining firearm suicide rate, a declining firearm assault rate, a stable firearm robbery rate with a declining proportion of robberies committed with a firearm and a declining proportion of damage to property offences committed with a firearm suggest that firearm regulation has been successful in Tasmania."" 
-- Warner, Prof K. Firearm Deaths and Firearm Crime After Gun Licensing in Tasmania. Australian Institute of Criminology, 3rd National Outlook Symposium on Crime in Australia. Canberra, 22-23 Mar 1999. 
Curbing Gun Proliferation in Australia 
In the 1996-97 Australian gun buy-back, two-thirds of a million semi-automatic and pump-action rifles and shotguns were sold to the government at market value. Thousands more gun owners volunteered their firearms for free, and nearly 700,000 guns were destroyed. 
By destroying one-seventh of its estimated stock of firearms (the equivalent figure in the USA would be 30 million), Australia has significantly altered the composition of its civilian arsenal. 
In addition, all remaining guns must be individually registered to their licensed owners, private firearm sales are no longer permitted and each gun purchase through a licensed arms dealer is scrutinised by police to establish a ""genuine reason"" for ownership. Possession of guns for self-defence is specifically prohibited, and very few civilians are permitted to own a handgun. All the nation's governments, police forces and police unions support the current gun laws. 
Other Countries 
Similar reductions in gun death and injury have been noted in several countries whose gun controls have been recently tightened. 
In Canada, where new gun laws were introduced in 1991 and 1995, the number of gun deaths has reached a 30-year low. 
Two years ago in the United Kingdom, civilian handguns were banned, bought back from their owners and destroyed. In the year following the law change, Scotland recorded a 17% drop in all firearm-related offences. The British Home Office reports that in the nine months following the handgun ban, firearm-related offences in England and Wales dropped by 13%. 
A British citizen is still 50 times less likely to be a victim of gun homicide than an American.

Print Normal font Large font When 35 people were slaughtered in an insane rampage at Port Arthur in 1996, Australian Prime Minister did two things that no American leader would ever contemplate. He banned a wide range of firearms and imposed a universal tax (by raising the Medicare levy) to buy them off shooters.
In the wake of the mass murder at Viriginia Tech, America's political elite from President George W Bush down, voiced shock and sadness. 
But there was no tilt at the 2nd amendment to its constitution which reads:
""A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed"".
Those 27 words - written two centuries ago after the War of Independence - have made gun control is one of the most sensitive issues in American political life. Groups, like the National Rifle Association, have become powerful lobby machines defending this constitutional right.
Republican 2008 presidential hopeful Senator John McCain is standing by his view that the Constitution guarantees everyone the right to carry a weapon although ""obviously we have to keep guns in the hands of law-abiding citizens"". 
Other candidates from the White like Hillary Clinton and Barrack Obama expressed grief about the terrible loss at Blacksburg, but did not state how such tragedies might be prevented.
When Mr Howard took his act against guns he did so in step with public opinion that was overwhelmingly in favour of getting rid of most weapons.
Today, the Prime Minister said: ""You can never guarantee these things won't happen again in our country. We had a terrible incident at Port Arthur. But it is the case that 11 years ago we took action to limit the availability of guns and we showed a national resolve that the gun culture, that is such a negative in the United States, would never become a negative in our country.""
There are many individuals the United States who feel the same way. 
Yet it still remains relatively easy to buy and keep guns in many parts of the country. And, despite massacres like Virigina Tech and Columbine, the political will to change that seems almost nonexistent.
We think alike in many ways, so why are Australians and Americans so at odds on this issue?
UPDATE: The assailant may have bought the two weapons legally. Cho Seung-Hui paid $571 for a 9 mm Glock 19 pistol just over a month ago, the owner of Roanoke Firearms told CNN. He also used a .22-calibre Walther pistol in the attack, police said.

94,How Many Died at Virginia Tech Today?,gun control,support,"Winston, Honestly what does it matter if Gun related crime decreces if the overall crime itself is the same or higher. 
What is the facination with spacificly reducing gun crime while ignoring the overall statistic?
The thing I see happen most in the media is this: ( The following is a scenario based on media trends observed in these situations )
-Some tragic event occurs to stir public opinion on the Gun subjet
-You get some laws in passed that put some rediculas restriction in place.
-The Media is all over the whole process
-The statistics come out the next year
(Lets use suicide as an example) 
-They tell you that since the new law there has been a 50% drop in the number of teenagers shooting themselves. 
-Then they interview a bunch of paid intelectuals and a mess of moronic soccar mom's. 
-Then the story is finished and were stuck with a bad law
-Logic and reason are squished out by the screaming hoard of soccar moms who drown the subject in a sea of overblown misdirected emotion
(this leavs the impression that some good has been done and there are less teen suicides and that everyone is happier for it.) 
Here's what got left out: 
-They neglected to tell you that the number of hangings, ovserdoses, and suicides by other means all showed signifigant increce. 
-They neglected to tell you that the overall rate of suicide has not dropped. 
-The same or more teens killed themselves Post new Law as did before the new Law. They just are not useing guns as often. 
See how that happened? The media didn't lie to you, they just left a few numbers out and it changes the whole perspective. You tell someone that gun crimes are decrecing because of a new rule and most people will not question you beyond that. You can even use the whole thing and simply emphisise the reduction in gun crime and still get a posative public responce and even though people have been shown that things are worse. They believe that things are better because ""Gun Crime is down"" and of corse ""Guns are Scarry"".

OK This is the statment that was your biggest mistake in that post. You say it does not happen as often in the UK as it does in the US. Which is like saying You don't roll a 5 as often when you throw 1 die as you would on when you throw 5 dice.

The USA Houses 300 million people. 
Let's Define Mass Shooting: 
In order to qualify as mass shooting lets set a victim minimum of 5. 
In the last 3 years there have been 6 mass shootings in the USA. Which is an unusualy high trend. In years before It averaged about 1 every 3 years or so. 
Based on averages, There are 5 times as many people in the USA as in the UK and the average overall for Mass Shootings in the USA is 1 every 2 years when you compile the latest handfull. 
Which means that if there has been even 1 shooting in the last 10 years in the UK then the UK is per capita on Par with the USA in terms of mass shootings. If there have been more then 2 in the last 10 years then the UK has double the Mass Shooting per capita ratio of the USA... and so on and so on.

Now on to something else I wanted to hit on. 
This one is a kicker. Why do we have murders. Why do somethings work in one country and not in annother? 
I'm not saying that there is a lack of a ""Problem"" in the USA. I'm simply saying that the problem is not the availability of firearms. 
Statistics do show that per capita the UK has less murder issues overall then the US does. However those overall numbers in the UK are a constant and have not been affected by the UK ban on handguns. I saw an article recently that said there was a proposed ban on Samurai Swords in the UK (or was it Scotland spacifcally) because of their frequent use as a gun alternate. 
I think the problem is mostly social. America being the melting pot is also something of a powder keg because of it. Baltimore Maryland is one of the deadliest cities in america and In the city for over a year. I hated every minute of it. The place is a cesspool. There is a murder there everyday. It's a social thing mostly. The drug abuse and poverty there are insane. The whole place feels like one big dumpster. Thats where you get the big murder numbers in this country. Extreme social circumstances. It's like a 3rd world country in some of our cities. 
Anyhow.... thats the overall murder number. The spree killings are something alltogether different that can be more directly applied to ratio's. More people tends to mean a higher chance of breeding a mentaly unstable phycopath. A person like that will be driven to kill by any means nessesary. If he can't get a gun he'll make a bomb or go nuts with a thresher in on a soccar field or something. 
Guns are not the problem. There just simply isn't enough advancement yet in medicine and society to eliminate the causes of the bulk of the murders and to quell the phyco's into normal lives.",105,107,topic_stance_votes_2

Now you are getting somewhere. If there was no profit in firearm production, there would be no firearm production. If you could not make a profit making a TV, you would not make a TV. The producer cares not one whit what ye do with a product, so long as ye pay for it. Simply saying ""handguns are made to kill"" is an ineffective argument.

A real world example of what we've all been saying. If I were in the business of robbing houses I would avoid that town like the plague. Most people out to do bad things still have a sense of self preservation. If you are in a town where you know for a fact that every home has a gun. You know that if you are going to break into a house you stand a real nice chance of getting caught, wounded or killed. 
Longterm concequences do not detur criminals. Jailtime and other punishments done by the state are an ""IF"" in the minds of people doing crimes. They know there is a decent chance they won't get caught and even if they do get caught there is a good chance they can beat the system and get off scott free. The risk is well worth the reward for them. Watch the discovery channel show ""It takes a Thief"" at some point. Check out what kinda loot the guy gets from the places he robs. 
On the other hand Imediate concequences have a more intresting effect and are a great deturent from criminal action. If a person knows they stand a 50-50 chance of getting killed by breaking into a house chances are very very good that they will decide the risk is not worth the reward by a longshot. 
If that towns policy of every head of household must own and maintain a firearm were adopted nationwide. You would see such a dramatic drop in crime not to be believed. 
For those who are in good standing with the law and cannot afford a firearm the GOV should issue state owned Colt AR-15 hbar Sporters and mandate a series of training sessions. Those AR-15's are plentifull. Police Baraks across the nation have millions of them in surplus and it's a great simple rifle.",113,114,topic_stance_votes_2
114,How Many Died at Virginia Tech Today?,gun control,support,"I disagree with this. The AR-15 is too expensive to hand out and I am not sure that I like the idea of poorly trained homeowners opening up with an AR in suburbia (I don't like the idea of poorly trained police doing it either). 
IMO a better idea would be to back down gun control laws and provide tort relief to gunmakers in order to lower the price of their product. A NIB Sig P228 (my personal favorite for a carry weapon) runs abotu $600 in the US. It runs about $300 in most other countries because there is a significant implied risk to selling that weapon in the US that does nto exist other places. In most of the world, nobody would even DREAM of suing a gun manufacturer for a crime comitted with that weapon. 
Another good option, IMO, is to repeal the laws that make cheap guns illegal. For instance, the import ban did away with $80 AKs. The MAC 11/9 was a high quality, reliable weapon, and the production cost on them was only about $80 per gun (side note...there is now a MAC clone being made that is extremely high quality and can be had for under $350). The UZI is another reliable, high quality weapon that could be produced cheaply.
The MAC or Uzi either one make ideal home defense weapons. They SHOULD be cheap enough that people can afford them, they are heavy enough to be stable in the face of recoil, big enouh to handle easily, and as reliable as a brick, and have a high enough magazine capacity to carry on a relatively drawn out engagement if need be.
The gun grabbers could take solace in the fact that while they are evil looking and high capacity, they are also damn near impossible to conceal. The secret service uses the Uzi, and they have devised a concealed carry method for it, but it has to be carried UNLOADED for it to work. 
We don't need to hand out weapons paid for from the public coffers. We just need to go back to allowing people to purchase cheap, reliable weapons. The problem is that most truly cheap, reliable weapons are military weapons because it is the militaries of the world that primarily push to design cheap, reliable weapons. The AK, MAC, M3, Carl Gustov, Uzi, FM-3, these can all be produced for under $150....under $100 if we go back to allowing open bolt semi auto weapons.

Now that I think about it more... 
If there were GOV issued firearms in the USA. It should be on a ""where you live"" basis as to what kind of firearm and ammo gets issued to the household. 
For instance... You wouldnt's want someone in a row of townhouses shooting an AR-15 at someone inside. Or any high powered rifle really. Give those Folks a shotgun or a carbine that fires semi-auto. 
As far is the SIG... I think if GOV were to issue it shouldn't be a pistol. Were talking about a home defence weapon and while pistols are good for that. I think a carbine rifle with pistol rounds would be more suitable to the general public. There are several HK models out there worth looking into. Not everyone is even a halfway decent shot and a person who dosn't practice with a postil is not going to be very accurate and hit what he's intending to hit with good confidence. A sholdered lightweight carbine rifle I think would serve pretty well all around.",115,116,topic_stance_votes_2
116,How Many Died at Virginia Tech Today?,gun control,support,"$750 a pop is WAY too much to spend on a program like that. While $750 for an Ar might sound cheap, multiply it by 2 million and suddenly you are talking about real money. 
A rifle is a poor weapon for entry or building sweeps. The problem with sweeping a building is the doorways and hallways. You have a poor field of view there and no real escape route. Bad guys know this, which is why the most common ambush point during building sweeps is at a doorway.
Do a little experiment. Get a rifle. Make certain the weapon is empty and safe. Have somebody grab the barrel and try to take control of the rifle. You cannot possibly maintain control of that weapon. Try the same with a pistol, holding it in a proper 2 hand grip, and it is virutally impossible for them to take it away from you because in that situation YOU have the leverage AND a better grip. I was explainging this to my wife at one point and despite the fact nobody is ever going to call me ""pewee"" and the fact that my wife is small, i can not hold onto the barrel of that pistol if she pulls straight back. 
This is why you see insanely short tactical stocks on the MP5. They are trying to shortent he weapona nd bring it in to the point that a bad guy has less of a chance to grab it, and the guy weilding the weapon has SOME chance of maintaining control. Even when you are talking Navy Seals or Delta, they are taught NOT to try to retain full control of the weapon, but rather to fight for it with one hand and draw their pistol and kill the perp with the other...and these are professionals. 
Ultimatly homeowners should probably not be sweeping their homes anyway...they should choose a barricade position where they can put up a defense. Behind a bed with their rifle/shotgun pointed at the door is a good choice...as is laying at the top of the stairs with your weapon ready. They fact that SHOULD NOT be sweeping the house does not mean that they WILL NOT. When considerign defensive weapons, that has to be considered. You have to plan for worst case, so you assume that your homeowner will be half asleep, stumbling through the house with a weapon they are not particularly skilled with, in search of an adversary who has planned ahead and knows what they are doing. In that situation, a pistol is the only real choice for a weapon. Short range instinctive shots with a pistol have a VERY high hit rate. With a rifle that rate is much lower. when you are talking home invasion youa re talkin a range measured in feet, not yards.

I agree with you on your tactical points totally. 
I own a Glock-17 , an AR-15 and a AK-47 
The Glock is the one I keep loaded for home defence. 
However I still believe that it would be a bad move to issue pistols to the general public for these reasons and more. 
-pistols are easily misplaced or stolen 
-bad public stigma on pistols
-higher risk of accidents in general
-more likly to be used to the wrong reasons
People in general who buy pistols knows these things and take safty measures accordingly. When you buy a pistol you accept personal responsability for the things that owning a pistol comes with. Something given to you by the government might not see so much care and attention. 
The more I think about it the more I'm leaning toward the idea that a general public issue weapon should be someone new and spacifically designed for that purpose. 
The idea is that every household should be required to own and maintain a weapon. 
-Head of household would need to certify that the household has a maintained weapon with a minimum amount of ammo each year.
-Heads of household unable to legaly own a firearm due to criminal activity or mental illness would be exempt from the mandate. 
-For those people who fall short of a certain household income must apply for a federal issue household firearm. 
-The firearm would be a short pistol round carbine styled like an mp5, semi-automatic with laser beam targeting. 
-The firearm would be equiped with an onboard fingerprint scanner that would activate the firearm for only those in the household who the firearm has been approved for use for. -
-The firearm would have an onboard GPS chip that would activate if the firearm was reported stolen or tampered with in any way beyond cleaning procedures. 
-Issued ammo would be issued in special clips. First 2 round would be a less than lethal rubber bullets, the rest would be 9mm hollowpoints. (maybe even the first round a blank)
-The weapon would have to be checked in every year for inspection and maintenence. 
I think such a weapon could be designed and mass-produced at a low cost. 
Probubly 400-500 per weapon if produced on a large scale. 
I garuntee that if the GOV put out a contract for reliable firearms with all the features listed. Being that there would be a garunteed millions bought for distrobution. Every firearms manufacturer in the world would be falling over themselves to get a firearm to spec for the right price. 
Now Please keep in mind: Those features and regulations would only apply the GOV issued firearms issued to households in lower income brackets. Most people would just buy something of their own choosing. Each houshold that bought privatly would need to register 1 owned weapon as the official household registered weapon. Would be registered by serial number and balistics. Thats just for the Official family gun. Other owned firearms would be normal ownership by whatever current state laws are.

BTW, that ""+1"" in the chamber may get you in trouble some day.
Aside from faulty trigger mechanisms, there's no discharge that occurs without some deliberate action on the part of the user. The single actions must be cocked first...then the trigger activated. The double actions are virtually impossible to fire accidently unless you c o c k them first rather than use the trigger pull for cocking. Most of the good revolvers have mechanisms that keep the firing pin away from the casing unless the trigger is back, making it virtually impossible to fire by dropping the gun or striking the hammer forward from the outside.

Only a very small percentage of gun owners go ""crazy"" and use the guns to carryout their “crazyness”
Although I still think that certain regulations need to be set in place in order to control the distribution of guns, complete gun control is not the answer; however, something still needs to be done.
Major laws should not be made in advent of isolated incidents, especially ones that encroaches on the freedom and protection of others.
“Gun control regulation solutions”
-Personality test
- Justifying ownership of a gun and it being registered on a national gun ownership database.
-Based on the justification, according ammo supplies would be sold…eg the justification being self defense: the owner would not need a few hundred rounds.(The national gun database would also include ammo sales) 
This would prevent someone such as the VT killer, or at least deteriorate the motives. (He would not have been sold so many rounds)
Of course the above solutions have obvious flaws(I will add more later, but I am pressed for time currently and need to think more about the matter), but it would not encroach upon the freedom of citizens (a gun database already exists) and it would add another layer of “security” to bypass, thus decreasing the probability of them happening.",137,138,topic_stance_votes_1

First off, all you would have to say is that you shoot at the range on a regular basis, and bam...unlimited ammo. Heck, at present I have 2000 rounds for my .40's and about 500 for my .38. If people are going to carry guns for protection, they should be encouraged to put lots and lots of rounds through the gun. That way, if they actually do have to use the gun for protection, they are well versed in it's use and hopefully are fairly accurate with it. I train with my pistols all the time at the range.

The same form that is used to justify the need to own a gun can be used to justify the need to vote and the need to exercise free speech. The justification page can go in and the government can decide whether your vote is reallly going to matter and whether what you wish to say is actually necessary.

As a result the people who really should have a CCW never get it. I use to work in some bad places in Baltimore. Everyday I wished I had a CCW, Denied everytime.

-No firearms for convicted Violent Felons... ever. 
-No Firearms for those posessing a potentially untreated mental illness likly to cause violence. (something where if you forget to take your meds for a day or so you will freak out and kill a bunch of people) 
-No Firearm Purchase under age 18 
-Common sense restrictions on what conditions must be present to discharge a firearm in a non-emergency situation. (I.E. no target practice on a public streat) 
-Carried weapons should be conceled: (This one would need to be variable from place to place. Some parts of the country it's normal to see someone walking around with a gun on the hip, some places it would cause too of a publi problem)
-Restriction on Class 3 weapons (machine guns) should be re-thought. I think more people should have easier access to Class 3 Weapons.

Don't ever forget this story:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Be...rracks_bombing
On October 23 1983, around 6:20 am, a yellow Mercedes-Benz truck drove to Beirut International Airport, where the 1st Battalion 8th Marines, under the U.S. 2nd Marine Division of the United States Marine Corps, had set up its local headquarters. The truck had been substituted for a hijacked water delivery truck. The truck turned onto an access road leading to the Marines' compound and circled a parking lot. . . . The suicide bomber detonated his explosives, which were equivalent to 12,000 pounds (about 5,400kg) of TNT. The force of the explosion collapsed the four-story cinder-block building into rubble, crushing many inside. It is said to have been the largest non-nuclear blast ever (deliberately) detonated on the face of the earth. ""The force of the explosion,"" continues Eric Hammel in his history of the Marine landing force, ""initially lifted the entire four-story structure, shearing the bases of the concrete support columns, each measuring fifteen feet in circumference and reinforced by numerous one and three quarter inch steel rods. The airborne building then fell in upon itself. A massive shock wave and ball of flaming gas was hurled in all directions.""
About 20 seconds later, an identical attack occurred against the barracks of the French 3rd Company of the 6th French Parachute Infantry Regiment. Another suicide bomber drove his truck down a ramp into the building's underground parking garage and detonated his bomb, leveling the headquarters. . . . In the attack on the American barracks, the death toll was 241 American servicemen: 220 Marines, 18 Navy personnel and 3 Army soldiers. Sixty Americans were injured. In the attack on the French barracks, 58 paratroopers were killed and 15 injured. In addition, the elderly Lebanese custodian of the Marines' building was killed in the first blast.[1] The wife and four children of a Lebanese janitor at the French building also were killed.[2]
This was the deadliest single-day death toll for the United States Marine Corps since the Battle of Iwo Jima (2,500 in one day) of World War II and the deadliest single-day death toll for the United States military since the 243 killed on 31st January 1968 — the first day of the Tet offensive in the Vietnam war. The attack remains the deadliest post-World War II attack on Americans overseas. . . . President Ronald Reagan called the attack a ""despicable act"" and pledged to keep a military force in Lebanon. Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger said there would be no change in the U.S.'s Lebanon policy. . . .The Marines were moved offshore where they could not be targeted. On February 7, 1984, President Reagan ordered the Marines to begin withdrawal from Lebanon. This was completed on February 26; the rest of the MNF was withdrawn by April. . . .",155,157,topic_stance_votes_1
