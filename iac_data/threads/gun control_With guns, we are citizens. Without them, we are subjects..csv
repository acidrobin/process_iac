In 1929, the Soviet Union established gun control. 
From 1929 to 1953, about 20 million dissidents, 
unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and 
exterminated. 
-------------------------------------------------------- 
In 1911, Turkey established gun control. From 1915 
to 1917, 1.5 million Armenians, unable to defend 
themselves, were rounded up and exterminated. 
-------------------------------------------------------- 
Germany established gun control in 1938 and from 
1939 to 1945, 13 million Jews and others who were 
unable to defend themselves were rounded up and 
exterminated. 
-------------------------------------------------------- 
China established gun control in 1935. From 1948 
to 1952, 20 million political dissidents, unable to 
defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated. 
-------------------------------------------------------- 
Guatemala established gun control in 1964. From 
1964 to 1981, 100,000 Mayan Indians, unable to 
defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated. 
-------------------------------------------------------- 
Uganda established gun control in 1970. From 1971 
to 1979, 300,000 Christians, unable to defend 
themselves, were rounded up and exterminated. 
-------------------------------------------------------- 
Cambodia established gun control in 1956. From 
1975 to 1977, one million 'educated' people, unable 
to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated. 
-------------------------------------------------------- 
Defenseless people rounded up and exterminated in 
the 20th Century because of gun control: 56 million.

It has now been 12 months since gun owners in 
Australia were forced by new law to surrender 
640,381 personal firearms to be destroyed by their 
own government, a program costing Australia 
taxpayers more than $500 million dollars. 
The first year results are now in: 
Australia-wide, homicides are up 3.2 percent 
Australia-wide, assaults are up 8.6 percent 
Australia-wide, armed robberies are up 44 percent 
(yes, 44 percent!) 
In the state of Victoria alone, homicides with 
firearms are now up 300 percent. 
(Note that while the law-abiding citizens turned 
them in, the criminals did not, and criminals still 
possess their guns!) 
While figures over the previous 25 years showed a 
steady decrease in armed robbery with firearms, this 
has changed drastically upward in the past 12 
months, since the criminals now are guaranteed that 
their prey is unarmed. 
There has also been a dramatic increase in 
break-ins and assaults of the ELDERLY. 
Australian politicians are at a loss to explain 
how public safety has decreased, after such 
monumental effort and expense was expended in 
""successfully ridding Australian society of guns."" 
-------------------------------------------------------- 
The Australian experience and the other historical 
facts above prove it. 
-------------------------------------------------------- 
You won't see this data on the American evening 
news or hear our president, governors or other 
politicians disseminating this information. 
-------------------------------------------------------- 
Guns in the hands of honest citizens save lives 
and property and, yes, gun-control laws affect only 
the law-abiding citizens.

Take note my fellow Americans.....before it's too 
late!

The next time someone talks in favor of gun 
control, please remind them of this history lesson.

5,"With guns, we are citizens. Without them, we are subjects.",gun control,support,"Is your point that citizens should be allowed to have guns to defend themselves from the government or that citizens should be allowed to have guns to protect themselves from other citizens?
As for protecting form the government, I highly doubt that the U.S. military would be used to massacre U.S. citizens because its actions are far too public. It certaintly is possible that a more secretive organization such as the NSA would be able to carry out plans such as the ones which you described in other countries. However, do you think it would be possible for ordinary citizens armed with firearms to stop the highly trained employees of the NSA?
As for protection from other citizens, I think that the government should allow this, but I also think that people shouldn't have guns. So if the number of guns owned by citizens in the U.S. were to decrease, I would want it to be a voluntary change, not one forced by the government.

Try reading both the Federalist and Anti-Federalist Papers for starters. If you were familiar with them, then you would've already had the answer to your first question.
Your selective memory is at work again. As I recall, in Waco military vehicles and equipment were used against the Branch Davidians. Nevermind the presence of members of Delta Force which was denied, at first, by the government. Then they were caught lying again about using flammable tear gas which, ironically enough, is banned by the Geneva Convention for use against enemy troops. In the end, the 'open and shut case' the government thought they had, blew up in their faces because of their lies and abuses. I also recall, at some point around the time of the Great Depression that U.S. troops were called out to quell food riots in New York, I think it was. There were a couple of young officers present by the name of MacArthur and Patton, I believe. There are a few other instances I'm sure.
I note your glee about secret agencies and their awesome firepower in which mere citizens would be defenseless against. Is your closet full of brown shirts? You must be proud.
Huh? You're for protecting yourself against other citizens as long as it doesn't involve guns? Of course, that wouldn't apply to the criminal that you're protecting yourself against! Why don't you read how well your gun bans are working in other countries? Regulation? The only regulation should be mandatory firearms training for all citizens like in Switzerland. Not the 'regulation' that you liberals would propose which, of course, always leads to an outright ban of private ownership. Why do you fear the 'people'?

The standoff at Waco, the NYPD shooting of Diallo, the FBI shooting at Ruby Ridge. While I don't believe that our government has sinister intentions, I do believe that if a civilian had pulled the trigger in a situation like Ruby ridge, or the Diallo shooting, then that citizen (or citizens in the case of Diallo) then jail time would be served. C'mon, shooting at a man 41 times (only hitting him 19) for reaching for his wallet, and the cops walk, but in the same city, a man defends himself with a handgun from a mugger in an elevator, and they charge him for possesion of a firearm? There is certainly a double standard that allows law enforcement to get away with more than civilians. Like I said before, I don't believe our government has sinister intentions, but there has yet to be a government anywhere that does not betray some of its citizens, and so a level of distrust is certainly appropriate when dealing with any government body, plan, or agent.",6,8,topic_stance_votes_2

""The simple conclusion is that there are no lessons about the efficacy of gun control to be learned from the Germany of the first half of this century. It is all too easy to forget the seductive allure that fascism presented to all the West, bogged down in economic and social morass. What must be remembered is that the Nazis were master manipulators of popular emotion and sentiment, and were disdainful of people thinking for themselves. There is the danger to which we should pay great heed. Not fanciful stories about Nazi's seizing guns.""

And would guns in the hands of citizens have stopped that? Or does publicity, which has only increased since those events, stop them? Your selective reading ability is at work.
And what is the point of this?
Your selective reading ability is at work again. I said that I don't support a gun ban, simply regulation, since there is regulation for ALL products on the market. Then you accuse me of being like every liberal that is conspiring to start an outright gun ban followed by a question about why I fear the people.
Maybe you don't notice the contradiction there. You obviously don't trust liberals, perhaps even fear them, yet you say I'm wrong to fear the people, even though I don't.
If you had read my first post correctly, you would have realized that I don't want the government to institute a ban. But at the same time I don't want people to have guns. But I don't think that the guns themselves are the problem. They are more a manifestation of the problems with society, so I government ban would not do anything. It would be more effective to eliminate those problems with society so that people would give up their guns voluntarily. But I'm obviously not sure how to do that right now.
It doesn't matter, eh? Then why are you even debating me? Why are there gun control laws in place that haven't been ruled unconstitutional, since obviously the antigun position doesn't matter, and the second amendment is clear enough all by itself?
No, the second amendment isn't exactly clear. I guess its clear if you conveniently leave out ""A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state."" The key words there are well, regulated, and militia. You see, that first part is implying that the purpose of guns is for the militia and that this militia must be regulated. For who can regulate the militia, let's look to another part of the Constitution, Article 1, Section 8. This section states the powers of Congress. It says, ""To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, reserving to the states respectively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress."" Wow isn't that interesting. So the Congress can regulate the people who own guns in the country, also known as the militia. Isn't that funny? Maybe that means that Congress can pass laws that will maybe regulate gun usage and give these laws a catchy title like ""gun control."" You know what else it says in the Constitution: ""The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several states. (Article 2, Section 2)"" This means that the President can also control the gun owning members of this country just as he can control the military.

Hmmm..... 
* Gun-free England not such a utopia after all. According to the BBC News, handgun crime in the United Kingdom rose by 40% in the two years after it passed its draconian gun ban in 1997.18 And according to a United Nations study, British citizens are more likely to become a victim of crime than are people in the United States. The 2000 report shows that the crime rate in England is higher than the crime rates of 16 other industrialized nations, including the United States.19 
(clue... 19 is a footnote... It reads: 19 John van Kesteren, Pat Mayhew and Paul Nieuwbeerta, ""Criminal Victimisation in Seventeen Industrialised Courtries: Key findings from the 2000 International Crime Victims Survey,"" (2000). This study can be read at http://www.unicri.it/icvs/publications/index_pub.htm. The link is to the ICVS homepage; study data are available for download as Acrobat pdf files.)
* Australia: Readers of the USA Today newspaper discovered in 2002 that, ""Since Australia's 1996 laws banning most guns and making it a crime to use a gun defensively, armed robberies rose by 51%, unarmed robberies by 37%, assaults by 24% and kidnappings by 43%. While murders fell by 3%, manslaughter rose by 16%."" 154
(154 Dr. John R. Lott, Jr., ""Gun laws don’t reduce crime,"" USA Today (May 9, 2002). See also Rhett Watson and Matthew Bayley, ""Gun crime up 40pc since Port Arthur,"" The Daily Telegraph (April 28, 2002). See also supra note 155.)
. British authorities routinely underreport murder statistics. Comparing statistics between different nations can be quite difficult since foreign officials frequently use different standards in compiling crime statistics. 
* The British media has remained quite critical of authorities there for ""fiddling"" with crime data. Consider some of the headlines in their papers: ""Crime figures a sham, say police,""161 ""Police are accused of fiddling crime data,""162 and ""Police figures under-record offences by 20 percent.""163 
* British police have also criticized the system because of the ""widespread manipulation"" of crime data: 
a. ""Officers said that pressure to convince the public that police were winning the fight against crime had resulted in a long list of ruses to ‘massage’ statistics.""164 
b. Sgt. Mike Bennett says officers have become increasingly frustrated with the practice of manipulating statistics. ""The crime figures are meaningless,"" he said. ""Police everywhere know exactly what is going on.""165 
c. According to The Electronic Telegraph, ""Officers said the recorded level of crime bore no resemblance to the actual amount of crime being committed.""166 
* Underreporting crime data: ""One former Scotland Yard officer told The Telegraph of a series of tricks that rendered crime figures ‘a complete sham.’ A classic example, he said, was where a series of homes in a block of flats were burgled and were regularly recorded as one crime. Another involved pickpocketing, which was not recorded as a crime unless the victim had actually seen the item being stolen.""167 
* Underreporting murder data: British crime reporting tactics keep murder rates artificially low. ""Suppose that three men kill a woman during an argument outside a bar. They are arrested for murder, but because of problems with identification (the main witness is dead), charges are eventually dropped. In American crime statistics, the event counts as a three-person homicide, but in British statistics it counts as nothing at all. ‘With such differences in reporting criteria, comparisons of U.S. homicide rates with British homicide rates is a sham,’ [a 2000 report from the Inspectorate of Constabulary] concludes.""168

The stuff on that website doesn't agree with the raw data I've seen. The truth is that the UK police has changed its system for recording crime. This change in recording crime made it appear that the crime rate went up. The British Crime Survey, which was unaffected by this changes in how the police record crime, shows a decrease in crime. The BCS is the most accurate measure of crime in England because it takes into account crimes not reported to police. 
Go to the section under violent crime in the British Crime Survey. 
""The increase in violent crime recorded by police, in contrast to estimates provided from the BCS, appears to be largely due to increased recording by police forces. Taking into account recording changes, the real trend in violence against the person in 2001/02 is estimated to have been a reduction of around five percent(see Chapter 3).""
So when you take into account changes in recording crime, there was an actual decrease in the violent crime rate. 
Furthermore there has been a considerable drop in violent crime since 1997:
""BCS violence estimate has fallen 17 per cent since 1999 and by 22 percent since 1997, both falls being statistically significant (Table 3.01).""

The claim that following the gun ban Australia experienced big increases in crime due to Australia's gun buyback has been refuted as an urban legend at www.snopes.com, a website that is committed to exposing urban legends 
""Given this context, any claims based on statistics (even accurate ones) which posit a cause-and-effect relationship between the gun buyback program and increased crime rates because 'criminals now are guaranteed that their prey is unarmed' are automatically suspect, since the average Australian citizen didn't own firearms even before the buyback."" 
http://www.snopes.com/crime/statistics/ausguns.asp
Australia's homicide rate is lower than the homicide rate in the US and there has been little variation in Australia's homicide rate in their buyback.

They are brought in through Mexico and canada. The one I bought was an H&K 9mm. Total cost was only $400 (retail is $1200). I even had the number on the thing run to make sure it wasn't stolen. It wasn't. 
I would imagine people would get guns the same places they get drugs. I don't do drugs, but I am absolutly certain I could get a bag of weed in under an hour if I wanted one. I don't keep illegal firearms, but I am absolutly certain I could get an M-60 in less than 2 hours (would have to drive a bit for that one). 
They haven't managed to control smuggling of drugs, and guns would be MUCH easier to smuggle. Dogs can't be trained to smell them.
I am still not seeing the logic in this. While black amrkets could concievably be found and eliminated, I haven't ye seen anywhere in the world where they have managed this feat. As long as there is money in it, people are going to do it. I know a guy who sells cigarettes that are smuggled in from Mexico by the truckload. They sell for $2 a pack (as opposed tot he after tax price of $4.25). This guy can't be making THAT much money on the deal, but there is money in it, so he does it.

I guess banning drugs are also a tyranny then. Why don´t you fight against the laws in US that restricts drug-use?

Did you know that we have spent of 100 billion JUST on sombating the illegal import of drugs since 1985? It seems to me like drugs are widely available. Logic would dictate that in order to make guns any less available than drugs, we would probably have to put at least 10-20 times the money into anti-smuggling efforts for guns as we do for drugs. Thi is because drugs actually have to be smuggled. YOu cannot just pack a cargo container full of drugs and ship it to the us, becuse the dogs would smell it.

I am for the legalisation of drugs fro an entirely different reason, whihc is because I believe that people should be free, that includes free to fry thier brains if they so desire.

When the mistakes you do is likely to harm others then those mistakes should be prohibited. Not only are drugs very hard to get out of even if that is your wish, so you will use drugs against your will eventually and there is always people that can trick people into using enough drugs to get dependant. Also, when under the influence of drugs you have little or no control over your actions and thus could act in ways that may be harmful to others. Lastly, the craving for drugs can be so great that you resort to criminality to get them. Guns and drugs can both in such great ways affect others that they should be restricted for public use.",48,49,topic_stance_votes_1

I know a guy who went through detox for a $500/day cocaine habit. 2 years ago, he quite smoking. He claims that quitting smoking was MUCH more difficult than giving up coke. Yet, you don't see smokers knocking over convenience stores to support their habit. I think that biggest effect that we would observe from the legalization of marajuana would most likely be an increase in the sale of snack foods. 
AS far as guns go, I am still not convinced that guns in the hands of the public at large are dangerous. Guns in the hands of criminals are a nasty business. I believe a valid point was made here not too long ago about guns being heavily restricted in Haiti. THe revolutionaries seem to have plenty of them. There is also the question of Sierra Leone. Pls, do a search and get some infor on that one (I saw it first hand). 
In a nutshell, a civil war broke out, guns were outlawed for the population at large. The gurillas were being supported by certain foreign factions, but their supply lines were poorly designed. They used their ammo against the gevoernment forces, and used machettes and strong arm tactics against the population at large. The population was entirely defenseless. Take a look over on Amnesty Intl's web page, they have several reports on Sierra Leone, as well as some nice pictures of children whose arms have been hacked off, eyes put out with hot pokers, an interesting story about a 13 yr old girl who was raped to death in front of her family.
I have seen enoguh of that kind of thing that I cannot sleep at night. This is why I am staunchly pro-gun. If there is one lesson that individuals can take from such things, it is that your government cannot protect you against domestic threats. Even when you are talking about small scale stuff like a prowler in the house, nationwide average police response time in a metropolitan area is 7 minutes! Seven minutes is s VERY long time when you are talking a life and death situation. 
Right now, the odds of a wide spread uprising in the United States is slim, as was it at the time our constitution was written. The second amendment was included in the constitution as insurance against a time when it is not so unlikely. The second amendment is the smoke detector of the bill of rights. You hope you never really need it, but yu keep it in good working order just to be sure.
I generally don't fear my government, I sometimes fear my fellow man. This is the problem (as I percieve it) with the socialist doctorine. It assumes that human beings want to live together in a utopian society and everybody will be willing to pull their load for the greater good.

Honestly I think people overestimate the ease of getting drugs just like that, it is not in the interest of the dealers being that easy to get hold of, guns would be even more difficult as you won't have to keep going back and will have no need to remain loyal to your dealer once you have what you want and the cost will be higher so you are less likely to be able to just get them off a friend who had got a gun in the past (who would be quite unlikely to offer you his given the most probable use of a black market gun).",50,51,topic_stance_votes_1
51,"With guns, we are citizens. Without them, we are subjects.",gun control,attack,"But it does seem to be pretty easy to get ahold of drugs.

So far, the cost on grey market guns is much lower. They are not subject to multiple markups, thea re not subject to regulation, and they are not sold by folks like gun dealers and weapons importers that are subject to high overhead.
I have a friend in S Africa who was telling me once about a great source he had for K&K MP5-S (the silenced version of the famous MP5). He had found a guy that was selling used/refurbed versions for only a few hundred bucks. I told him ""I wish I could find a source like that"".
5 weeks later, a box arrived from south africa with a silenced MP5 and 10 magazines. THis was a fully automatic firearm which had passed through customs and been shipped right to my door. If I was a criminal, I would have, of course, just kept the thing. Since I am not a criminal, I torch cut the reciever to BATF specs.
This is one of the (many) reasons I do not believe a firearms ban is the solution to any problem. Countries with strict gun laws still seem to have gun related crime (or, probably more properly, crime related gun use).",51,52,topic_stance_votes_2

As for the difference, you don't use guns as often as drugs so you don't need to keep going back for more, hence the gun dealers don't have to be so open as they will likely be doing one-time sales to people. Drugs make money because people have to keep buying them while guns do not- the economic of them is different, as I said before I think the economic of illegal guns would be more similar to that of illegal cars (expensive one-time purchases) rather than drugs (continual purchases)",54,55,topic_stance_votes_1
55,"With guns, we are citizens. Without them, we are subjects.",gun control,attack,"By that logic, they would not have offered to sell me drugs. A white guy at 62nd and the paseo (kansas city missouri) driving a jag at 11:00 at night is definatly going to be a one time purchase (since if he made a habit of it he would most likely be killed).
AS far as stolen cars, people buy them all the time and just don't know it. They are re-registered and resold. There was a big deal about 6 yrs ago in missouri because the attorney general of that state wanted to crack down on cars that had been stolen and re-titled. It turns out that her personal vehicle had been stolen and re-titled. She had no idea, the dealer she bought it from had no idea. Want to know where to buy a stolen car? Try a used car lot, no big deal.
It would be a lot easier to smuggle a crate full of guns than is to smuggle a single on. Single packages are more heavily scrutinized than containers or large crates. I order a lot of stufff from overseas, and a lot of time I will get a small package that had been opened by customs. It is no big deal. They also X-ray small packages (so if you ever order film or radiation sensitive items from outside the US, make sure you have the shipper mark it clearly). I have yet to have a crate arrive that has been opened. They just don't do it, it costs too much to have thousands of crates searched. I the customs decleration says ""teddy bears"", that is good enough for them.
It seems to me that the exact inverse of your scenario is probable. Since they are so easily imprted, and so cheap to purchase in ther countries, supply and demand would dictate that there would be a greater number of guns available at rock bottom prices. 
I think we would also see a major change in what types of firearms we see on the street. Currently, the most common firearm in the united states is shotguns. They are used for hunting almost everything. Next common is sporting rifles, followed by hadguns, ""assault weapons"", submachine guns, and last, machine guns. If you are going to go to the trouble of illegally importing weapons, why not just start with machine pistols and SMG's? There would be no reason to mess with sporting rifles or shotguns. You can buy a kalishnikov overseas for half the price of a deer rifle, and if they are all equally illegal, why not do it?
The cun ban scenario seems to me like a good way to disarm victims, and arm criminals with military weapons. This has happened in other countries that have enacted gun bans (in fact this is EXACTLY what happened in Sierra Leone). I think in the future, the british are going to see this start to occur. These things take time to develope, though. When they first passed theri gun ban, crime dopped for the first year, and the anti gunners all went ""LOOK, IT WORKED!!"". It took a while for the criminals to change tactics in response to the new social situation. Now that some time has passed, we can look and see that it certainly has NOT worked. Somewhere on here there is a thread about arming british police officers. Ranking officials seem to think this is needed because of the rash of violent crimes in the UK. We can argue that this has nothing to do with their gun ban, but we both know differently. And that is the UK, which tends to have a much more reserved and nonviolent public than the US.",55,56,topic_stance_votes_2
