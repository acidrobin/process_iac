Full-autos were regulated in 1934, but could still be owned. They had to be registered though, you could even make your own. They were banned (with existing stocks grandfathered) in 1986 via an amendment to the FOPA bill.
A shotgun is not inhuman for hunting, following certain guidelines. Just as hunting with an assault rifle or handgun is not inhumane. Though, if he hunts with his over/unders, I would be highly suspicous. They have no way of firing slugs accurately (smoothbores) and have no aiming devices beyond a bead.

A quick answer on what the AWB is...
""ugly"" guns. Rifles that looked like full-autos (but weren't) were targeted in the ban. Things like ""flash hiders"" and bayonet lugs made them AWs. Rifles that didn't have these ""evil"" features weren't considered AWs.
After the ban was enacted manufacturers then removed the offending items that made the rifles AWs then sold the new ""post-ban"" rifles. Remember mechanically they were the same as the AWs but cosmetically they were different.
As soon as these rifle got on the market the gun haters said the manufacturers had evaded the AWB by using ""loopholes"" in the law that allowed them keep selling the rifles.

25,Viva La Liberty! The End Of The Awb Is At Hand!,gun control,attack,Because it was used for hunting deer and might still be legal in some places. It's pretty humane at close distance too.

26,Viva La Liberty! The End Of The Awb Is At Hand!,gun control,attack,"It is used for hunting deer in some places. I have killed a deer with buck shot before. Anymore, it is mostly used for hogs and defense.
Any uzi that has seen use is fairly inaccurate. This is because the uzi was designed as a short range defensive weapon that could be pushed into production rapidly. For what it is, the uzi is a fine weapon.
The problem you run into with the uzis, even the good ones (my experince has been that the chinese ones are better than the israli ones. The chinese didn't blindly copy the uzi, they made some changes andd removed some known failings), is that right out of the box the barrel mountig system leaves something to be desired. Back off your barrel nut and give the barrel a twist. It will jiggle in either direction fairly easily. If your barrel was straight, this would not be much of a problem. Gun barrels are rarely completely straight. They don't need to be (put a laser on one and you may be surprised) and the cost of handf straightening them (which is the best method) is prohibitive.
If you take the Uzi and mill the back of the barrel mounting flange, and where the barrel flange mates with the reciver (so you have a good, smooth mounting surface) it will do wonders for acuracy. Then, tkae the barrel and add material to the flange. Precision grind it and the mating surface on the reciver, taking all the jiggle out of it (so you can't rotate it at all even with the barrel nut loose). 
Now, chrome plate evrything in there (engineering grade chrome, not shiny stuff. It doesn't need to look pretty) to keep it from wearing.
If you have an israeli uzi or one of the group industry or vector jobbers, pull ut the barrel trunion (requires welding) and heat treat it. The factory heat treat on these was terrible (one of the problems the chinese fixed). Now, pull your lower reciver off, remove the sear disconnector, and have a new one made that is about 3/64 taller. this will reduce the trigger pull in both distance an weight (trigger pull ont he Uzi has always been terrible). 
You now have a weapon that, using the proper ammunition, is capable of an accurate takedown at 300 meters or more. The 9mm, custom loaded for the S/A uzis 16"" barrel (slower burning powder but with higer charge) is a great round and is a capable medium distance round (200-300 yds). The Uzi reciever is more than capable of taking the extra pressure (unless it is a vector, in which case the back end of the reciver will start to split at the weld). 
Without modification, the Uzi is, in all practicality, a ""paper plate"" weapon at 100 meters (you can probably hit a paper plate if you are good).
Of course, this is still better than the sigs that law enforcement officers carry, which is a paper plate weapon at 40 meters.",25,27,topic_stance_votes_2
27,Viva La Liberty! The End Of The Awb Is At Hand!,gun control,support,"A lot of positive changes came about when Mossberg took over importation of UZIs, including closed bolt on selectfire models and the like. They also had one of their Mini-UZI selectfire models tested by GWLE modified for closed bolt operation and it could keep fist sized groups at 100 yards. I also know of one guy who uses a carbine UZI in .40 S&W for deer hunting. I'd personally like one in 10mm.",27,28,topic_stance_votes_2
28,Viva La Liberty! The End Of The Awb Is At Hand!,gun control,support,"cerainly quality went up (I have one of the older ones, and the quality is terrible). They were still purchasing cheap, stamped and welded weapons. I think the worst problems were elds at the back of the reciever breaking (this was not just a problem with the vecotr units), poor heat treating of internal weld pack components (feed ramp, trunion, etc...) and the poor fit of the barrel to the reciever.
You can certainly get good, accurate results form even a stock Uzi as long as tyou crank down on the barrel nut hard enough to ensure 0 barrel movement (not hard to do) and re-sight it EVERY time you take the barrel off.
If you don't want to mess with that, make the mods mentioned above and you will have a weapon whcih rivals the MP5 for accuracy and blows it out of the water when it comes to reliability.

Rook, when you finally decide to make the plunge and get the Uzi, contact me about a gas operated trigger return system. Gives almost full auto rate of fire (mine clocks at about 500 RPM). Not quite as much fun as the open bolt, proper full auto unit, but also not $6k, nor does it require that you jump through a bunch of hoops.
Also, rather than SBR it, spend the tax money on a stamp for a silencer. Have the barrel ported agressively (VERY agressively....skeletonise the thing) and the silencer will work great, even with the long barrel (short barrel length silencer). When you don't want the can on there, put on a dummy can.

Leo",37,43,topic_stance_votes_1
43,Viva La Liberty! The End Of The Awb Is At Hand!,gun control,support,"Yep, thats how it works. The trick is to shorten your trigger pull (the trigger pull on a stock uzi is TERRIBLE....6 inches and 40 lbs) to the point that the trigger just kind of ends up jiggling there. On the Uzi, what slows down the ROF is the fact that the semi auto is closed bolt. With the gas operated blowback, the trigger actually resets, then is released again, before the bolt makes it back up with the next round. If you shoot a long time, your finger will get sore unless you wear a glove. With a glove, you can roll through thousands of rounds. Unlike the hellfire and some of the other trigger return setups, the gas operated setup doesn'y throw off your accuracy.
You could adapt it to other firearms if you have a well equipped machine shop and don't mind some external moving parts. the best part about doing it on the Uzi is that it is all internal except for a sleeve on the barrel (a short one), which looks cool anyway.
You get your uzi and I will set you up with the parts you need. I have lots and lots of them. It gives me an almost perverse thrill to do these things.
NO NO NO NO NO EXCELLENT way to end up in jail. The baffles are considered, in and of themselves, supressors. Here is the ATFs opinion on this (and no, I am not Mr Bardwell)

La signifies Spanish as well, just so you know. Learning the various feminine/male patterns is terrible, though some do follow common characteristics in determining an unknown word. Vivir is the noun in Spanish, means ""to live"", though it changes in spelling depending on how you use it. There's vivo (yo(I)), vives (tu(you)), vive (el/la(he/she)), vivimos (nosotros(we)), vivis (vosotros), and viven (ellos/ellas(they)).

First off, the ATF has taken its responsibilty to regualte such things as a responsibility to LIMIT such things.

They do not want you switching around your silencer parts in order to avoid having to buy more than one. They want you to have no silencer, but if you just really feel compelled to own one, they want it to be as limited as possible.
I think the other reason they do it this way is that they don't want you building silencers at home.

I'll explain it in its simplest terms (though I am not good at verbally conveying the workings of mechanical items, so if it is not clear enough PM me and I can send you a solidworks file or a .DWG file).
I am certain we all understand how a gas operated action owrks. Gas from the barrel exits a port and drives a pistron, which is attached to the bolt, back (again, simplifying). On the gas operated trigger return,. you do something similar, only kin dof reversed. Gas from the barrel exits through a port and drives the piston, which is attached to the trigger, forwards. On the Uzi, the piston surrounds the barrel. It is placed just in front of the barrel nut and has a shroud around it (a stainless tube) with exhaust ports in it (so once the piston travels a sufficient distance, the pressure is dumped, which allows you to return the trigger to firing position). On the Uzi a rod between the piston and the trigger runs through the front had guard and into the lower receiver, so it is never exposed (which would be both ugly and dangerous).
There is also a blowback operated version for battle rifles (in fact I have a G3 and a CETME sitting on my work bench right now that I am modding for my brother). You put a pivot in at the rear of the bolt travel (essentially a lever that the bolt strikes and drives rearward) the bottom end of the lever pushes forward a bar that is attached to the trigger, which drives it forward. The CETME is getting a cam, for 3 rd burst capability.
Anyway, that is the incredibly simplified version. I have several thousand mods through both types of conversion and they work fine. Of course, the idea has progressed, and changed, from that outlined above for a better system.
It is such a simple concept that I am surprised that it has not been done before. We went ahead and patented the systems, since a patent search yielded no similar designs.
That was first generation (abviously simplified). Th",62,63,topic_stance_votes_2
