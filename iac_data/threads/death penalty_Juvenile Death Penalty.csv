0,Juvenile Death Penalty,death penalty,support,"Can anyone make a rational argument as to why executing a criminal who was 18 years old when committing the crime is not ""cruel and unusual punishment,"" but executing a criminal who was less than 18 at the time of the crime would be cruel and unusual?
Put another way, can anyone explain why it is constitutional to execute a person who was 18 years old when they committed the crime, but it is unconstitutional to execute a person who was under 18 when they committed the crime?
Participants in this discussion should assume that the death penalty, in general, is constitutional. This has been the case from the beginning of our Republic, and has been reaffirmed multiple times. In other words, it is not an appropriate argument to try and argue that the death penalty, in general, is unconstitutional. That has neither been the case through our history, and is not the current state of the law.

1,Juvenile Death Penalty,death penalty,attack,"I believe the rationale for treating persons of different age differently is their respective ability to understand their actions. The human nervous system is not fully developed until adulthood, therefore the ability to appreciate right from wrong, understand consequences of actions and mediate impulse control (among other things) differs between children and adults. The age of 18 is an arbitrary designation. The reasoning is that the criminal behavior may actually be different even if the outcome of the behavior is not. 
There is considerable evidence that neurophysiology and its resultant behavior does not develop completely until adulthood. When that occurs is variable. I am not arguing the validity of that rationale, but that is at least part of the reasoning, I believe.
I didn't know that anyone argued the it was unconstitutional to execute someone under 18. I do not know why the above physiologic difference would matter constitutionally. But that is one consideration when deciding a penalty for a conviction.",1,2,topic_stance_votes_1
2,Juvenile Death Penalty,death penalty,attack,"That is the premise of my question. On what basis can one claim that the Constitution makes this arbitrary designation with respect to the death penalty? I simply don't see any rational argument for it.
So why cannot juvenile crimes which would otherwise be death penalty eligible be treated on a case-by-case basis? Under the theory of variable neurophysiological development, we could suppose that some individuals under 18 will have a fully developed moral understanding, and also some individuals 18 and over who do not.
Fair enough. But I am curious to see if anyone can defend the rationality of the rationale (whatever it is purported to be). You're obviously not obliged to do that, but that is sort of the curiosity that I have.",2,3,topic_stance_votes_2
3,Juvenile Death Penalty,death penalty,attack,"A specific age is picked because it occurs sometime and there is no way to know in any specific individual whether their pre-frontal cortex is up to snuff or not. There is no way to judge on a case-by-case basis. If this occurs (I think it's clear that it does) and if this is a rational reason for treating persons differently (that is, of course, arguable) then the line must be drawn somewhere. 
I was wrong to say 18 is arbitrary. I misused the word. I would assume that most people have a mature CNS by that age, so that is why it is picked. The objective evidence of this is done looking at populations, not individuals. 
Subjectively, anyone who has kids will know that a young teen's judgement is pretty bizarre at times.",3,4,topic_stance_votes_1
4,Juvenile Death Penalty,death penalty,attack,"What do you mean by this? Could we not have the law treat under-18 capital offenders on an individual basis, determining whether the individual offenders in the individual cases were sufficiently developed?
Also, what would you say to the response that our current law provides that juveniles are sufficiently developed enough to have the responsibility, without parental involvement, to decide whether to obtain an abortion? Is it not a conflict to say juveniles should not be eligible for the death penalty because they are not morally developed enough, but at the same time say juveniles are morally developed enough to decide whether to obtain an abortion without involving their parents?",4,5,topic_stance_votes_2
5,Juvenile Death Penalty,death penalty,attack,"No way to measure that. I stated already, the objective evidence of this is done looking at populations, not individuals. 
Look at it this way:
Do you think we should treat a 5 year old differently than 25 year who commits the same crime?
If you answer is ""no"", we're done, but if it is ""yes"", then:
How about a 6 year old?
a 7 year old?
And so forth until you say ""no"". Then you have drawn the line somewhere.
Anyway, I'm just sayin'.
I am not gonna comment on abortions, except perhaps other things may be weighed into the equation, like the consequences of telling parents or having an unwanted pregnancy. I don't know. 
You asked for a rationale to treat different ages differently, I gave you one. Sounds like you don't like the answer. Sorry.",5,6,topic_stance_votes_1
6,Juvenile Death Penalty,death penalty,attack,"This is exactly my point. Could not juries take the facts of the case into account in each individual situation, and determine the moral culpability of the offender? I think yes.
I wasn't trying to discuss abortions, but rather the argument that juveniles lack the necessary development to be morally responsible.
On the one hand, the current law says that juveniles do possess enough moral maturity to make the very difficult moral decision to have an abortion without any input from their parents. On the other hand, the law says that juveniles do not possess enough moral maturity to be held responsible for decisions to commit murder.
In other words, I assume you will agree with the proposition that the decision of whether to obtain an abortion is a much more involved moral decision than is the decision whether to murder someone. Yet our law says that juveniles are mature enough to be responsible to make the former judgment, but are not mature enough to be responsible for the latter. We treat juveniles like adults in the more involved moral question of abortion, but we do not treat them like adults in the much easier moral question of murder.
I did ask for a rationale, but I'm now aware that my tone did not come through.
I do not believe that there is any conceivable rational argument that reasonably proves that the constitution actually does forbid the execution of a person whose crime was committed while he was a juvenile, but does not forbid the execution of an adult.
Are you persuaded by the rationale you have provided, or were you merely giving one of the rationales that some have given?",6,7,topic_stance_votes_2
7,Juvenile Death Penalty,death penalty,attack,"Look, Phyl.
You asked why the state sentences children differently than adults. One answer might be that children are physiologically different than adults. They don't think the same. Seems simple. As to whether that's constitutional, I have no idea.
If you wanted to make a point you should have just stated it, rather than pretending you are asking a question.

8,Juvenile Death Penalty,death penalty,attack,"With respect, this is not what I asked.
Within a particular context, this is what I asked.
I wasn't being argumentative. But I am trying to understand the argument in order to decide whether it is persuasive, which will necessarily mean that objections to the argument be dealt with. You may not be interested in doing that, and of course that is your prerogative. But do please try to be civil should you so decline.",8,9,topic_stance_votes_2
9,Juvenile Death Penalty,death penalty,attack,"I think that we've got to draw a line at some point, to demarcate between adult and child. Where ever we do draw it, it will seem, in some situations to be arbitrary. If we made it 20, the question would be why 20 year olds and not 19. Through the years society has determined that by 18 people should have attained enough life experience to form intent and to comprehend that their actions have consequences (at least as it applies to the death penalty, they can be tried as adults w/o death). We don't execute people who can't comprehend the nature of their crimes and society says that, under 18 you can't fully comprehend criminal actions.",1,10,topic_stance_votes_1

12,Juvenile Death Penalty,death penalty,attack,"Actually, society hasn't said this. 5 judges, in very recent times, have. I for one think that some 17 year olds fully comprehend the full implications of murder, and therefore should be held accountable in the same way as an 18 year old. I guess I just don't see any reason why a jury could not address the issue on a case by case basis. I do not see the ""18 and over execution rule"" in the eighth amendment.
No, this is not about abortion, and I think that is very clear. If I wanted to discuss abortion, then I would mosey on along to the abortion forum and post there.
The point about abortion that I brought up is that it questions the premise offered by thelmoose with respect to juvenile development. In fact, this point was made in the dissent of a Supreme Court opinion dealing with executing juvenile offenders.
On the one hand, it is argued that juveniles do posses enough moral maturity to be able to have the same right to abortion as an adult, but on the other hand, it is argued that they do not posses enough moral maturity to be able to be held to the same standard as adults when it comes to the decision to commit cold blooded murder.
For your convenience, I underlined the key parts. We have here two contradictory statements. That is what I was pointing out.",11,13,topic_stance_votes_2
13,Juvenile Death Penalty,death penalty,attack,"[QUOTE]
Well, actually society has said that 18 is the dividing line. It can then also say, that under certain circumstances, for a particularly bad person, in some cases it will be considered if the person is 16 or 17. That's why we have all the judges and lawyers, etc...
Well the main difference is under the law (and I don't want to get into the right or wrong of the law) a fetus isn't a person yet so they aren't making 'life and death' decisions. Just as you said we must assume constitutionality, we can derive the legal distinction here as well. Punishment for an action against someone is different then a decision concerning personal health (or privacy)",13,14,topic_stance_votes_1
14,Juvenile Death Penalty,death penalty,attack,"I think many things are getting confused here.
First, I have no idea what “moral maturity” means. You talk as though that is some definable entity.
Next, one may reasonably consider that children are cognitively different from adults. Despite what society or 5 judges have to say, that seems to me a valid reason for applying different sentences to different people.
The question was raised with respect to the death penalty as well. We are not talking about criteria for guilt, but once convicted, we are talking about whether to execute a person or not. Unless you feel that punishment should be based solely on retribution, I think there is some wiggle room for different sentencing guidelines for different aged humans. 
You have conceded that a difference in neurophysiologic fitness makes sense, but we should decide on a case by case basis. If you can figure out a reliable way to do that, go for it. 
We draw the line based upon age all the time for all sorts of things.
The issue of abortion is different for many reasons. We are not deciding on whether to execute a person based upon a crime they committed. That makes it a different issue. Ideally, we would never have a pregnant young woman under the age of 18 make a decision like that without the support and guidance of her loving parents. The ideal situation sometimes does not exist. An underage female may legally make this decision precisely because there are many out there who do not have that guidance at all or informing parents would make things worse. It just so happens that females are fertile prior to 18, so we do not have the luxury of applying similar age requirements. If you could ban pregnancy prior to 18, now you’d be talking.
And no, it is not at all clear that this is not about abortion, Phyl, because you keep bringing the topic up. Because you declare something, that doesn’t make it so.
Lastly, you are asking the opinions of members of a forum here. If you want our opinions, great. If our opinions differ from some court ruling, it does not mean the opinions are wrong, it means they differ. Given your criterion, the only way to express opinions here would be if we were doing it from the bench.",13,15,topic_stance_votes_1
15,Juvenile Death Penalty,death penalty,attack,"Assuming capital punishment, in the prescribed form, is constitutional, it is still not constitutional to execute a person for a crime committed at 17. It has been tried and I think was successful, but in my opinion, as I will depict below, is not constitutional. 
First, we must establish the age of majority at 18. Majority is defined as the ability to enter contracts and be held accountable in court. The first part of that definition is for the most part inconsequential to this argument. However, it shows knowledge of consequence. A 17 year old cannot, by himself, purchase a car on a note. Because he can't be held liable for the note and he is assumed to not understand the consequences of that contract.
Now, we must define juvenille, one who is not of the age of majority. Therefore, do not understand consequences and are unable to enter into contracts. I take exception to the notion that a 14, 15, 16 or 17 year old can be bound over to adult court for crimes committed as, our law defines, a child. These children did not enjoy, nor do they gain, the privelleges of adulthood. They do not gain the right to vote, the right to enter into a contract, or the right to drink, etc. Threfore, at the time of the crime and while sitting in court they are not adults. And cannot be subject to an adult sentence. By the way, we have signed treaties saying it is illegal to execute minors, and those are law... What you have proposed for discussion generally shows a desparity of our criminal justice system. Our societies thirst for blood outweighs our moral conciousness.

17,Juvenile Death Penalty,death penalty,support,"I seem to recall instances wherein the courts have chosen to try juveniles as adults. It seems likely that the court examines each case separately and does not have a fixed policy about who gets a pass and who doesn't. If I'm not mistaken, the severity of the crime and the professional evaluation of the accused criminal come into play when making the decision. I suspect that a death-penalty crime will weigh more heavily on the judges mind when considering a juvenile as an adult.
What do you think should be done with the 9 third graders that plotted to kill their teacher for punishing one of them? Had they succeeded in murdering their teacher, what would you want done with them? They are NINE YEARS OLD.
