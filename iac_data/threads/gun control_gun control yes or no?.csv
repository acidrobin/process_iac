I am for rational gun control laws, like the ban on felons possessing firearms. I am against irrational gun control laws like the cosmetic, deceased, and demonstrably useless 1994 AWB.
I believe gun control proponents should accept that the RKBA is an individual right. To argue that the right is a state’s right or a militia member right is to do so in the face of both history and legal precedent. Such a weak foundation renders all their gun control proposals, despite the public marketing tag of “common sense measures,” extremely suspect as nothing more than the gradual encroachment towards an unspoken yet much desired goal of a total firearm ban. Gun rights supporters are naturally wary of gun control supporters who are wedded to this view. 
You cannot have an honest discussion of whether a gun control measure is constitutional where one party to the discussion is chained to a warped and disingenuous interpretation of the RKBA.

Portions of The Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms (July 6, 1775) 
“Administration sensible that we should regard these oppressive measure as freemen ought to do, sent over fleets and armies to enforce them.
(Lexington/Concord)
General Gage . . . sent ought from [Boston] a large detachment of his army, who made an unprovoked assault on the inhabitants of the said province, at the town of Lexington, as appears by the affidavits of a great many persons, some of whom were officers and soldiers of the detachment, murdered eight of the inhabitants, and wounded many others. From thence the troops proceeded in warlike array to the town of Concord, where they set upon another party of the inhabitants of the same province, killing several and wounding more, until compelled to retreat by the country people suddenly assembled to repel this cruel aggression.
(Registration/Government Storage)
The inhabitants of Boston being confined within that town by the general their governor, and having, in order to procure their dismission, entered into a treaty with him, it was stipulated that the said inhabitants having deposited their arms with their own magistrates, should have liberty to depart, taking with them their own effects. They accordingly delivered up their arms, but in open violation of honor, in defiance of the obligation of treaties, which even savage nations esteemed sacred, the governor ordered the arms deposited as aforesaid, that they might be preserved for their owners, to be seized by a body of soldiers; detained the greatest part of the inhabitants in the town, and compelled the few who were permitted to retire, to leave their most valuable effects behind.
(Martial Law)
The general, further emulating his ministerial masters, by a proclamation bearing date on the 12th. of June, after venting the grossest falsehoods and calumnies against the good people of these colonies, proceeds to '[D]eclare them all, either by name or description, to be rebels and traitors, to supersede the course of the common law, and instead thereof to publish and order the use and exercise of the law martial.
(The Declaration)
“We are reduced to the alternative of choosing an unconditional submission to the tyranny of irritated ministers, or resistance by force. The latter is our choice. We have counted the cost of this contest, and find nothing so dreadful as voluntary slavery. Honor, justice, and humanity, forbid us tamely to surrender that freedom which we received from our gallant ancestors, and which our innocent posterity have a right to receive from us. We cannot endure the infamy and guilt of resigning succeeding generations to that wretchedness which inevitably awaits them, if we basely entail hereditary bondage upon them.
Our cause is Just. Our Union is Perfect. Our internal resources are great, and, if necessary, foreign assistance is undoubtedly attainable. - We gratefully acknowledge, as signal instances of the Divine favor towards us, that his Providence would not permit us to be called into this severe controversy, until we were grown up to our present strength, had been previously exercised in warlike operation, and possessed of the means of defending ourselves. With hearts fortified with these animating reflections, we most solemnly, before God and the world, declare, that, exerting the utmost energy of those powers, which our beneficent Creator hath graciously bestowed upon us, the arms we have been compelled by our enemies to assume, we will, in defiance of every hazard, with unabating firmness and perseverence, employ for the preservation of our liberties; being with one mind resolved to die freemen rather than to live slaves.
We fight not for glory or for conquest. We exhibit to mankind the remarkable spectacle of a people attacked by unprovoked enemies, without any imputation or even suspicion of offence. They boast of their privileges and civilization, and yet proffer no milder conditions than servitude or death.
In our own native land, in defense of the freedom that is our birthright, and which we ever enjoyed till the late violation of it - for the protection of our property, acquired solely by the honest industry of our fore-fathers and ourselves, against violence actually offered, we have taken up arms. We shall lay them down when hostilities shall cease on the part of the aggressors, and all danger of their being renewed shall be removed, and not before.”

“Is it necessary for your liberty, that you should abandon those great rights by the adoption of this system?. . . Will the abandonment of your most sacred rights tend to the security of your liberty?. . . .I am fearful I have lived long enough to become an old fashioned fellow: Perhaps an invincible attachment to the dearest rights of man, may, in these refined enlightened days, be deemed old fashioned: If so, I am contented to be so. . . . Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it, but downright force: Whenever you give up that force, you are inevitably ruined. . . .
My great objection to this Government is, that it does not leave us the means of defending our rights; or, of waging war against tyrants. . . .
The Honorable Gentleman who presides, told us, that to prevent abuses in our Government, we will assemble in Convention, recall our delegated powers, and punish our servants for abusing the trust reposed in them. Oh, Sir, we should have fine times indeed, if to punish tyrants, it were only sufficient to assemble the people. Your arms wherewith you could defend yourselves, are gone. . . . Did you ever read of any revolution in any nation, brought about by the punishment of those in power, inflicted by those who had no power at all? You read of a riot act in a country which is called one of the freest in the world, where a few neighbors cannot assemble without the risk of being shot by hired soldiery, the engines of despotism. We may see such an act in America. A standing army we shall have also, to execute the execrable commands of tyranny: And how are you to punish them? Will you order them to be punished? Who shall obey these orders? Will your Mace-bearer be a match for a disciplined regiment? In what situation are we to be? . . . .What resistance could be made? The attempt would be madness.""

“We're going to have to take one step at a time, and the first step is necessarily, given political realities, going to be very modest. Our ultimate goal, total control of handguns in the United States, is going to take time. The first problem is to slow down the increasing number of handguns in this country. The second problem is to get handguns registered, and the final problem is to make the possession of all handguns, and all handgun ammunition illegal.”--Nelson T.

I'm not really against full auto weapons, although I don't see the point of them- good trigger control on a semi-auto can get you a much more controlled group at a higher range in roughly the same time distance from a full auto gun- but it should be understood by everyone in the community that these are not toys, they are weapons that are shot by some people purely for entertainment value (why do you need a nice car with a 300hp engine that can go 200mph? you don't: but it's still fun to own one. why do you need a .50BMG rifle? you don't- but that doesn't mean it's not fun to shoot one).",15,16,topic_stance_votes_1

That means that, your more likely to drown, die in a fire, or suffocate than to die by a firearm! Since firearms according to some of Clinton's research team.. are used 1.5 million times a year to fend of an attacker etc etc. So laws that require safe storage realllly do nothing. Besides, most LEGAL gun owners are responsible and keep their firearms under lock in key. Not only that they teach their children about firearms. Just last week some kid killed another kid, with a firearm that the parents could not own legally. Not only that! They did not follow the states storage laws of Illinois!

Responsible people already don't drink and drive. How many of those dumb enough to drink and drive would not have done so had there been a law telling them not to?
An important part of a law is allowing punishment, which in turn decreases the number of people breaking the law. If a person is irresponsible with a firearm, and their kid gets it and accidentally shoots themselves or someone else, I feel that we should be able to punish the person responsible for that firearm. Without some kind of storage requirements, as a rule, this person has broken no laws depite the fact they allowed a gun to come into the hands of a child. And despite the fact that someone has died as a result of their negligence, they cannot be punished for it.
Like I say, I don't want draconian gun laws. I just want all firearms to be out of reach of kids, or other irresponsible people. If a child in your house can find and fire a gun, you have failed to store it responsibly. While I concede that using a firearm for home defense is limited by this, it is not greatly so. I'm not saying every gun needs a trigger lock, and to be locked in a seperate cabinet from the ammo. It just needs to be in a place where kids can't get it, of if they can get it they can't fire it.

I’ve never had the occasion to prosecute anyone for unsafe storage. To my knowledge there has never been a case prosecuted on the grounds of unsafe storage alone. The facts are often mixed with other evidence of neglect. See, for example, the following case summary in which the Virginia Court of Appeals upheld a conviction applying the “gross, wanton, culpable reckless disregard for human life” standard in the statute (the defendant, Taylor, was the mother of the child in question):
“On April 18, 1998, Taylor invited Henrico County police officers inside her apartment, where the officers immediately noticed smoke and smelled marijuana. Several adults, who had been in the living room, ran to the rear of the apartment. Based on their observations, the officers secured the apartment and obtained a search warrant.
Sitting in the living room throughout the incident was Taylor's six-year-old daughter, Malise. Upon searching Malise's bedroom, the officers found a juvenile male, in possession of marijuana, hiding in the child's closet. Two loaded handguns were lying on her bed. A large plastic container and a shoebox lid, both containing marijuana residue, were sitting on her dresser. Several bags of marijuana were found under her bed, near her closet, and elsewhere in her room.
In Taylor's bedroom, police found more bags of marijuana, partially burned marijuana cigarettes, and an assault rifle hidden in the air conditioning duct. More marijuana, packaging supplies, and another weapon were found elsewhere in the apartment. Taylor told police that some of the contraband belonged to her boyfriend, who spent nights in the apartment. She admitted that her boyfriend was a drug dealer who carried guns to protect his drugs and money.
Malise was present in the living room while armed adults were preparing marijuana for sale. Drug deals had been made in and around Malise's presence. Taylor acknowledged that drug dealing was a violent activity and that her boyfriend was a drug dealer.
Taylor exposed Malise directly to drug dealing and its hazards, as well as to loaded firearms. She thus showed a culpable disregard for the child's life. Further, evidence showed that the air in the apartment was thick with marijuana smoke. Police found in Malise's room a nebulizer machine and prescription medications used to treat severe cases of asthma. Malise's condition was so severe that, in the past, Taylor had needed to take her to the emergency room for treatment. Heavy smoke exacerbates respiratory ailments such as asthma.
Taylor willfully, wantonly, and culpably allowed in her home activities that exposed Malise to drug activity, loaded weapons, and risk of death. By smoking marijuana in the apartment and by allowing the air in the apartment to be saturated with smoke, Taylor showed a reckless and wanton disregard for Malise's life and health. Proof of such conduct supports Taylor's conviction.

I view Virginia's statue as adequate for investigation and prosecution in instances of adult negligence regarding firearm accessibility to minors who can then intentionally or unintentionally harm themselves or others. I'd think most states have similar legislation as we are the nation of redundant laws. 
Current sentiment and objectives by gun control advocates lean towards making firearms unusable in the event minors do gain access to them, the trigger guard in various forms being an example. Do you feel the accessibility issue is one that will be pursued, perhaps to an eventuality of gun control advocates seeking legislation barring firearms in households where minor children are present? 
I've posted my opinion on this issue, that available statistics do not display justification for public concern of minors being harmed by accessibility to firearms. That minute number would be difficult to reduce with supposedly no accessibility, but realize 'even one is too many' and 'zero tolerance' are the cries of most reformers on any public safety issue.",39,40,topic_stance_votes_2
40,gun control yes or no?,gun control,attack,"Making firearms inoperable within the home is a goal that I think gun control supporters will continue to pursue. It furthers the goal of greater governmental control over privately-owned firearms, and it appeals to a “saving the children” mentality which tends to give causes far more emotional weight than logic dictates they are worth. (A similar “saving the young children from guns left lying about” argument is also used in the push the ban all guns that are not equipped with the fictional if not futuristic “smart gun” technology)
I doubt that we will see any serious push in the near future towards gun bans for homes with small children. Gun control supporters are currently arguing for the necessity of “safe storage” laws. By supporting these laws they implicitly say that such laws work and can protect young children. Arguing for a complete ban on firearms in homes with young children takes the opposite position that these same safe storage laws are useless and cannot work and therefore nothing but a complete ban on firearms in the home can protect small children. Arguing for a total ban for firearm in homes with young children will have to wait until after the passage of gun storage laws, where gun control advocates can then argue that “we tried the safe storage laws, but now the ban is needed because (for example) too many people ignore the safe storage law and the only way to make their children safe is to disarm the home.” 
It would be the next logical (or illogical, depending on your point of view) step after the passage of some “safe storage” law.

“Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.” Justice Brandeis, Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 485 (1928).
“False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that would take fire from men because it burns, and water because one may drown in it; that has no remedy for evils, except destruction. The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity, the most important of the code, will respect the less important and arbitrary ones, which can be violated with ease and impunity, and which, if strictly obeyed, would put and end to personal liberty--so dear to men, so dear to the enlightened legislator--and subject innocent persons to all the vexations that the guilty alone ought to suffer? Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man. They ought to be designated as laws not preventative but fearful of crimes, produced by the tumultuous impression of a few isolated facts, and not by thoughtful consideration of the inconveniences and advantages of a universal decree.” Thomas Jefferson, Commonplace Book, 1774-1776, quoting 18th century criminologist Cesare Beccaria in On Crimes and Punishment, 1764",40,41,topic_stance_votes_1

Thanks. That proves me with a broader image of potential gun control reasoning; the red herring of safe storage as a foothold of 'let your government take care of this' with full compliance being a statistical impossibility due to many factors. A few more deaths of children (still boggles my mind that such a fractional number can breed so much emotion/support) and move to disarm those homes. Establishing that landmark legislation would provide a short step to tacking on riders to other bills referring to that section deeming other circumstances unworthy of firearms ownership for various and sundry reasons, such as a moving traffic violation.

However if someone is going to kill someone with a gun do you really think they care about any of these different gun laws? All gun laws do is make it harder for honest civilians to get a hold of guns. Do you really think the person who goes on a shooting spree got his gun legal when you can simply go to any major city and buy a gun from a gang or a dealer for 100$ or a little more. I mean come on! Think of it this way lets say you are a powerful leader in America and in the constitution it says the people have the RIGHT and duty to overthrow any corrupt government. Now do you see why the government tries to keep American scared not of our government but of terrorist or other things that frighten people like the DEADLY bird flu OH KNOWS!!!! Americans in general (no one can take offense to this) are stupid and scared and those are the easiest kind of people to control and if you take away guns from them they are nothing. Now let's say you have a large group of very educated, organized, well informed people how hard would it be to control or lead them when they maybe smarter than the government itself?
