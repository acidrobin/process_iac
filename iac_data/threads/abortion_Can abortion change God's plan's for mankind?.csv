0,Can abortion change God's plan's for mankind?,abortion,support,"First of all let me say I am a devoted follwer of God and Jesus Christ our Lord and savior.
As with all issues involving life and death I saught God's council in prayer .
The answer I believe I recieved is that if man can create it , it is not from God.
What does the above statement have to do with abortions you ask?
Well I had never considered the 400K frozen embryos that are tossed away as bio hazard yearly from fertility clinics in the US alone.
Compound those 400 K embryos by the frozen embryos tossed away around the world yearly, and the number would certainly be in the millions of embryo's that are tossed away as bio hazard garbage every year around the world.
I found a world wide statistics forum on the web that has a constant ticker for abortion's in the world. They claim 100,000 plus million abortions happen yearly.
Okay we have millions of frozen embryo's just tossed from fertility clinics and we have a 100,000 million abortions around the world yearly.
Now compound those numbers by the children most of those embryo's or fetus's would have had of thier own had they been given the chance to be born.
Wow , now the number is literally in the billions upon billions , of people who never will be born due to being tossed away as a frozen embryo from a fertility clinic or as the result of abortions.
So I went to God in prayer and said how can this be so? You my God have decreed that man will walk upon this earth a determined number of years. The bible tells us you know how many breaths each of us will take. The bible tells me you have the hairs on my head numbered that you know when a sparrow falls from the sky. How oh God can billions upon billions of people you decreed should live be denied that through abortions and fertility clinics?
The answer came back as I posted above.
 If man can create it , it is not from God?
Ah I get it. Mankind has proven they can create flesh . We can create embryo's we can clone flesh of man and beast. But mankind cannot create the soul of man or beast only God can.
God is concerned with the souls of man , never the flesh as the flesh is only a temporary temple of the spirit ( soul ) of mankind.
You see people mis interpret the scripture so many anti abortion folks like to quote. 
I knew you before you were formed in your mother womb.
Of coarse God knew us before we were formed he knew he would create our souls each , as individual 's; each with our own free will and mind to think and learn with during our times on this earth.
He also knew the genetics we would come from, so he knew what we would be in body and soul. Lines of man have signifigance to our God.
Ah hah thank God I now know. It was not the abortions I worried about after all wern't they really the lucky souls? Given the teachings prevelant in the church's of men today? Those aborted souls never had to live upon this earth, They never had to know pain or sin. They got a free pass so to speak.
No judgement from God for thier sins as they died before they were born.
I had intended given the oppurtunity to ask God when I stood before him in judgement why I couldn't have been one of the aborted one's? 
No fair I planned to state, you are holding my sins against me, yet millions upon millions never had to be born and counted as sinners because they were aborted. Were they special ? Why did I have to live on earth? Why did they get to stay with you God?
 But God is always fair . so that was a silly arguement and I am thankful he cleared that up for me, least I had been in error questioning his fairness .
My real worry had always been since fertility clinics became the norm.
God how can this be? Across the world today millions of frozen embryos exsist. frozen Are those souls frozen too? Are they in limbo waiting and hoping to be born and released from that frozen state. Are they aware of anything in that frozen state?
The same answer came to my prayers.
 If man can create it , it is not from God.
Ah hah , man created those lumps of flesh, man cannot create a soul.
So the embryo's have no soul's . Nor do fetus's in utero.
 God gives the soul at the moment of birth , just as he takes it from the body at the moment of death.
Besides God has a plan for man, God has decreed from the beginning of the world who would be counted among the number of man. Who would be born to walk upon this earth and have the chance to learn to love and worship the one true God.
Nothing man can do , is able to change what God has planned.
 I repeat nothing that man can do will change God's plan for the world.
And God is fair always, so to be counted among the number of mankind , the flesh must be born , recieve a soul from God and die.
God is just that powerful and well able to send all he has decreed shall live in the world to walk among man.
So have faith, in a all powerful God. He does not allow the souls of mankind to be destroyed . He does give us the free will to destroy our own souls once we are born. But God will not allow man to take the right of free will he has given to each of us away before we are born.
 He send 's the soul to inhabit the flesh at the moment of birth, just as he call's the soul back from the flesh at the moment of death.
Praise God for his ways.

what does the word sophistry mean? Its not in my websters dictonary.
Certianly mine is at least 40 years old , so is that a new word?
In answer to your question sin jin.
God just as he answered me simply above , does not always explain in detail his ways to mankind.
But my study and prayer tells me that babies born who live only a short while , may have been saved from worse fates that awaited them had they lived longer.
They may indeed be the lucky ones who were so loved by God he craved to have them walk the earth only a short while to be counted among men, he knew thier souls were not in need of years of learning many of us must do on earth to evolve into who we become .
They were simple , beautiful souls who did not reguire the rigors of the world to perfect them.

My father has produced a anti abortion news sletter for fifteen year 's I helped support with money for most of that time. He was to say the least not happy that God gave me this revelation.
Hey shooter and proud , at the Risk of sounding like a nut , on the net.
I will attest and confirm to you that the devil does exsist.
I've seen a angel maybe twice in my life . Its a scary event.
And I've been unhappy about being confronted by demons a few times.
Its worse in some ways than seeing a angel, because the human mind becomes frightened and takes a moment to grasp what is confronting it.
Now I know that sounds crazy , and I assure you that is what the demons want you to think. They try hard to make sure most of the world think they are a fable, But I attest to the fact they are real, and roam the earth in legions , much like a army to plague the people.
God has given us the tools we need to make them go away, however till Jesus return this world really belongs to thier master Satan and they make trouble and indeed kill people almost as they please.
No I am not a nut, just a faith ful servant of the one true God and his son Jesus Christ. Don't know for sure , but believe they ( Satan and his demons) always take a shot or two at people like me, till they find out even should they be able to kill our body , our soul will leave it loyal and in worship of God.
Then they seem to give it up. But they seem to be given leave to tempt us and frighten us till its proven we won't switch sides. But again thats just my opinion and life expierence.

There are many things that can cause hallucinations. A long time ago in Massachusetts bay colony, they used to eat rye bread. Unfortunately, something happens when a certain grain rotts, and it becomes a hallucigent. Thats why a lot of people started seeing witches and magic and all that weird stuff.

The l moose IMHO opinion only you understand .
God eguips his children with just what they need to act on his behalf.
if I didn't see a demon for what it was I might be at the mercy of that demon and ill eguiped to to put it down.
It also has to do with faith. I certainly never hoped to see a demon, nor do I hope to see one ever again. But God has been kind enough because I asked for it to give me great faith in him and through much study and prayer a knowledge of the bible. I never thought much about either demons or angels till I encountered them. I encountered them and saw thier true nasty forms inhabiting people I know and still know. As far as I know both still are inhabited by those demons. I had no power to make them leave , but I did have the power to stop them from bothering me or my home and family.
I rarely hear from those two any more. yet they do call out of the blue from time to time , still with lifes in total disaray and they havn't got a clue why.
Nor has it been given to me I should tell them. Instead it was given to me they know something is wrong and if they should seek God themselves , God will be faithful in getting rid of thier demons.
Unfortunately the unschooled in the ways of God are fertile breeding grounds for demons to take over. Its just that simple.

You aremuch too young to make such sweeping statements about what you believe. I am trying to be nice here , but believe me at 14 you do not yet have a clue as to what you relaly believe that will change as you age.
My advice to you is to listen , study what you hear and observe.
Sooner rather than later your thoughts on most things in life will change. Its part of growing up and like it or not you are a child shooter and proud.
You will see life differently as you mature into a adult.

God gave man all the tools to creat many things. Computers and the bible are among them. However Jesus himself gave a stern warning about not taking away from or addding to the bible because he knew men would do exactly that. Through prayer and study the Holy Spirit will give one the decerment needed to tell what is of God and what is man made.
Are you trying to make the arguement that making flesh is the same as making a object like a computer ? If so please go on with that arguement as I am interested.
Making flesh being the providence of God . man having control of the elements in this world making objects I do not understand how you think they are the same , but will listen to your arguement that you claim they are.

The book of Revelation was written before 100 AD. The Councel of Nicea did not occur until 325 AD - over 200 years later. Would the good lord have made a warning about a book that did not yet exist?

Although I know hundreds of people, many more online, and not one person has seen a demon. A couple who may have seen ghosts, but never demons. Sorry, the concept is just a little too for fetched for me. It would be illogical to thing they exist, but thats just my opinion.
I respect them, I just disagree.
Trust me, if i ever see or meet Jesus I am almost positive he will be a liberal lunatic (assuming Jesus was a he). Besides, why do you act as if it is so bad to not share Jesus's opinions?
You're not very good at answering questions for people.
Ok, so what if I do change? So what if I don't? How is this relevant to my opinions at this time?
Ever since I was about 10 (maybe 11, can't remember that well), I've been reading the newspaper, and following politics closely. I've talked to many intelligent people, liberal and conservative and fell that I am fairly at peace with my opinions, and truly believe they are right. I listened for 4 years, I believe I am ready to speak out without this critizism because of my age.
I may, I may not. If I open my own buisness, then yes, I probably will turn conservative, at least financiallly. There are many issues in which I still have much to learn, however, I believe I know enough about abortion, gun control, civil rights, religion, evolution, and the death penalty to be debating these topics. I don't know much about the stock market, financial liberalism and conserviativism, and some other areas of politics that don't come to mind at the moment. But, I have studied the subjects listed above closesly and am fairly certain that my opinions are the right ones. IMO, you are no more likely to change than I.",49,56,topic_stance_votes_1

Now, if by the oddest chance you encounter a demonic being, please remember that such a being is stupid and angry and you, as a caring human, must set this being on the path to samsara, to encounter wisdom and understanding. Be kind to demons, but be masterful. You are their superior and must never forget that. You also have the power to exorcise them--if you actually believe in them and put your mind to it.
