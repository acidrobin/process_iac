Actually it does less damage to the brain then alcohol and it cannot kill you. It is impossible. It takes 20,000 joints in one sitting to overdose on marijuana. Alcohol however kills thousands of americans each year from alcohol poisoning. You know that idiot pothead. He didn't get dumb from pot, he got dumb from birth. Marijuana does not have long term effects on IQ. The only side effect is the lazy side effect. The day after a person tends to be more lazy however it is like a hang over..... it only lasts for a day. There is no reason why it should remain illegal.
I also support all drugs being legalized because the drug war has failed. We spend billions each year on the drug war and I can call someone right now and pick up some crack. It is a failure. What we should do is make it government controlled and then spend the money to fight drugs on drug education. Flood the schools with ACTUAL info about how herion kills and how it breaks a person down. Tell the kids how you can die from one use of coke. Tell them the short term and long term effects of each drug. If we can educate our kids and even adults through an ad campaign about what drugs do to you then we could save far more people. Also allowing drugs to be regulated will lower the prices and effectively kill drug dealers and gangs off the streets. There are so many benefits to legalizing drugs. Anyone want to fight it? I have proof to back up what I say and also have the effects of each drug.",0,1,topic_stance_votes_1

To be fair, on the cannabis front, it doesn't effect IQ but may effect memory, and 'that idiot pothead' is usually an idiot because he is stoned at the time. Also it can act as a catalyst, speeding up the onset of schizophrenia etc. in those with a tendency in such a direction.

You have a simplistic argument going for pot. I can't agree that legalizing all drugs would be a good thing either. Programs in Holland have failed to produce significant if any benefits to society in general. The druggies seem to have benefitted by having arrest-free drug zones and access to whatever they want, but the cost of drugs still requires some income, something that most of them likely do not have other than from crime, begging or social programs.

The 20,000 joints theory is true. What the site did was take the average amount of THC in a joint then the amount needed to OD on THC and divided it. It came out to around 20,000 average joints. In other words no one has ever died from ODing on weed.

We spend billions of dollars every year on the drug war. Not to mention the HUGE amount of prisoners that are simply up on drug charges. Drugs would never become a social norm because many are very damaging to the mind and body.

As for marijuana being bad for you..you sound like my friend who is a pot head. Let me be the first to say (since I know way to many weed addicts...side effect of liking DMB I guess) marijuana does do more damage then one might think. It WILL make you an idiot if you are a chronic user. I have seen a guy smoke up since 13 and it takes me 4 tries for him to actually understand a simple sentence I tell him. Then a marijuana addict will rationalize his/her behavior by saying things like ""well atleast I don't do herion""...thats like a theft saying ""atleast I don't steal at gunpoint""...i mean you are still stealing. As a side not, rationalization is a sign of addiction. I have worked with a few weed addicts too. I am glad companies drug test becuase of this. These fools look stoned 24/7 after awhile and are the worst employees on earth. Then you got the benefits of being a weed addict like all you can do is have weed addict friends because you don't have time for anything else. The marijuana addict will work, buy weed, smoke it, work to buy more. AND THEN, you get to the marijuana addict that decides to try crack because all drug addicts hang together and so someone will try to get you to try new stuff.

Although, the addiction is more psychological than physical.
If you smoke weed all the time and then stop for a week or so, you get really pissy and irritable, but that's about it.
But no regular pot smoker sits around justifying why they do it, they just do it cuz they like it, nothing too complicated about it. 
We're all addicted to something. 
I had a tough time recently giving up coffee.
It was interfering with my life. 
It was making me feel like XXXX, I couldn't sleep right, my bowels were out of whack, but I couldn't just stop cold turkey. I tried, but I got these really bad headaches and my whole body felt like XXX. It was hell at work, my head felt like it was going to explode and I was achy all the time. I had to gradually wean myself from it. Now I drink tea which has less caffiene but I still sometimes feel like I have to have it. Since I've cut down (I don't think I've really gotten totally over my caffiene addiction)I fell so much better. I have more energy during the day, I don't wake up half dead desperately needing a quad espresso. 
Maybe they just drink too much coffee.
And you probably work with more ""reefer heads"" than you think.
Now this is a totally inaccurate generalization.
I don't think you actually realize the sheer numbers of people who smoke pot in this country, and I'm talking on a regular basis.
I am certainly one of them. I have friends that do it and friends that don't.
We all lead your typical normal life.
Yeah, see this is the old ""gateway drug"" fallacy.
If anything is a gateway drug, it's alcohol, so why is it still legal?
If a drug can act as a ""gateway"" to other drugs, isn't that why it's illegal?
So are people sitting around drinking alcohol all day, waiting for someone to come by with something ""harder""? No, and the same is true for people who smoke pot. Oh, sure they may also do other things once and a while, but it wasn't simply because they tried that first joint. It's just a personality trait and a common one. If pot didn't exist, these people would be doing something else. The same with alcohol and cigarettes. If they didn't exist, people would find some other type of vice.
Hell, one joint a day isn't going to kill anyone.
But who drinks one beer a day? No one drinks beer like that, or not many people at all, anyway. People who drink beer (like me and you) will drink a few one day, and for a few reasons. I like good beers, like microbrews and we have a few good ones here, so I like beer for its flavor. I also like the fact that if I drink 24-48 oz. of the stuff I catch a nice buzz. 
I also like to buy good pot. It smells great, tastes great and gives you a nice mellow buzz.
But alot of people will come home from work and drink 3-4 beers every single day. This has to add up to bad health. 
A glass of red wine though is supposed to be good for you. (That must be why I drink it so often. ;))
Anyway, you're going way overboard with what marijuana does to people.
It's truly less harmful than alcohol, it can only interfere with your life if you let it. The person who would do this would do it with anything. If pot didn't exist or alcohol didn;t exist, they;d find some way to screw up their lives. This doesn't mean that there aren't millions of responsible casual pot smokers who lead normal productive lives.

This obviously depends on the person. Both are not good...once again, a comparision is not gonna work. Whether you are an alcoholic or a weed-a-holic(not a real word) you will still mess up your health (which is a good reason we shouldn't have public health care).
I mean't this in a more general sense then you took it because obviously a pot head is not going to spend 100% of his time with other pot heads. However, I must say that all my pot head friends spend an abornomal amount of time getting (or trying to get) high which sure is a pain in the a** if you wanna do something else...this is more of a problem with the friends of the pot head that don't smoke more then anything. I just think a coming together for drugs is probably not a healthy friend relationship as it depends on a drug.
Try going to a concert, party, club, and see if the guy selling weed is on the opposite end of the guy selling coke....doubtful (unless it is second hand) as weed has no real value compared to coke and what not. The whole leads to something for a better high is pretty dependable..many crack heads will tell you that they wanted a better high but that doesn't mean every pot head will go to crack. HBO had a good special about this some time back.
I don't recall talking about addiction..I believe I was talking about 1-2 beers as opposed to a bowl or somthing. If one drinks in moderation then they will be fine...there is not ""moderation"" for pot (unless you say a couple hits a week for a few years). http://www.valdosta.edu/aode/alcoholfacts.htm
Finally, why do you compare it to alcohol anyway? Are you trying to say we should ban alcohol? Guess what, eating McDonalds every meal every day is probably worse then drinking alcohol...should we ban that or legalize everything? Well no.

29,Legalization of all drugs,marijuana legalization,attack,"Fair enough. However people don't have 1 beer. They tend to have more than one, sometimes 7+ (in England at least, where binge drinking seems to be more prominent than in other countries). On the other hand, people tend to not smoke more than 1 joint per 'session'. As such although 1 beer isn't as bad for you health as 1 joint (I think...), the amount of beers drunk per joint smoked is much higher.
So you do still hang around with potheads.
Everyone at the event will be exposed to the guy selling cocaine then, not just the people buying pot.
""A couple of hits a week for a few years"" seem about right to me. I'd call that ""moderate"" pot use .Considering the % of the population that's used pot and the % of the population that use their lives only to smoke pot, I guess most people do use pot in moderation. 
No: legalise pot. Obviously if you're smoking £50 of pot a day, then it's going to be worse than a couple of beers a day. However I doubt most people who use pot, use anywhere near that amount a day. Considering the % of the population that's tried pot, and the % that has tried heroin, pot use seems to rarely lead ot heroin addiction. Heroin has a huge stigma attached to it, crack and cocaine a lesser one. Were pot use to inevitably lead to heroin addiction, I wouldn't want pot legalised, but clearly pot use rarely leads to heroin addiction, so I'm all for legalising it.
Maybe, but nor is alcohol, or smoking. Those aren't banned however, and until there's some unrefutable proof of pot being worse than smoking or alcohol, wasting money trying to keep it illegal seems pointless to me.

30,Legalization of all drugs,marijuana legalization,attack,"I understand this. It is hard to compare with 1beer 1 joint as not all people have 1 beer and no one has one joint (it is normally passed and what not). Maybe a ""responsible"" beer drinker and a ""responsible"" pot smoker would be a better comparing tool? In that case I would say the same result would apply...but would probably come out as a little worse then a smoking to alcohol comparison.
:/ If I have to. A lot of my high school/college friends went down that way and lots of times if we have a large number of people hanging around then the pot smokers will go off and come back a few hours later. I could give some examples to clear that up if you like.
Yeah, but someone that doesn't want drugs won't be.
I would say this is true. Most people try pot a few times maybe during college and then stop when they go into the real world. Legalizing would probably cause that trend to end.
And you are right, it rarely does lead to herion or crack addiction, however, that is not my reason for keeping it illegal...I was just talking about why it is not exactly good for you. The reason to keep it illegal would be to not be like amsterdam. If every country did it then you wouldn't have a flood of people coming to the US to smoke up and make our country cr*p.
Smoking is not bad for society anymore (in the US) as it only causes harm to the one that does it. Alcohol is kind of like pot in the way that you would have to legalize it or make it illegal...you would have to make it across the world for either one. Prohibition in the US caused higher organized crime because no other country had it...however, with weed, you can have the same thing...if we were the only ones to have it illegal (and once had it legal) then we would have the same situation.

Pot is helping organised crime at the moment, as well as draining money from the government in trying to combat it.

I guess so, since I'm trying to explain why it's silly for it to be illegal.
But, guess what, you are rationalizing why beer is legal.
And you're SO WRONG about drinking beer for 50 years. 
Drink enough beer to get a buzz and smoke enough pot to get a buzz every day and the beer drinker will be worse off.
But you and I both know that all this depends on the person.
If you want to limit it to a beer a day then I can limit it to one toke a day.
There you go...
If weed is good enough, one or two tokes is all you need.
You probably got WAY less tar than a cigarette and you didn't tax your liver with alcohol. (You also didn't tax your kidneys and GI tract with caffiene.)

The number one reason I believe is that the drug world is too big of a money machine for the legal industry including police, bondsmen, lawyers, courts, rehab centers, etc. People can proudly claim they are fighting the war on drugs all the while knowing that it is never going to end. It's like coming out against something you know is never going to stop just to say you are against it. It makes the Bible thumpers happy.

Ok, you're being overly technical here. Yes, legalization of all drugs would decrease drug crime in the same way that legalization of murder would decrease violent crime. This doesn't stop people from using though.
On another note, I do think the ""War on Drugs"" has been handled very poorly. We need to treat users very differently than we treat traffickers and the like.

I do not think we need mandatory sentencing which has tossed judicial discretion out the window. I think we need to be treating users, not jailing them.

127,Legalization of all drugs,marijuana legalization,support,"i think that if you legalised drugs, but anyone who wanted to buy them must register, so for instance if a parent wanted to check weather there child was or wasn't doing drugs they could, for lesser drugs such as cannibis. harder drugs should have an age limit on. hard drugs would need a prescription, so only for addicts, and would have to be taken on the premises, so they couldn't give some to other people to get addicted, and in the use of needles infetions could be stopped spreading as much.
and i agree with who ever said earlier, that we could use the tax money to educate children and to advertise that drugs where wrong and maybe help with rehab. 
i think the key is education on the facts, not just give the children the bad bits and leave out the rest, that just causes conflict of facts when the child reads something somewhere else. and causes them to doubt other info that is true.",127,128,topic_stance_votes_1
128,Legalization of all drugs,marijuana legalization,attack,"I've been very iffy on the issue of legalization for quite some time. I used to be pro-legalization (atleast for weed) but now I'm pretty much against it.
I really hate the idea that we're wasting money on 'problems' that simply will not go away. If people want to do drugs, they WILL do drugs... its really simply as that. There has been a lot of talk about the actually harm that marijuana does and I will have to agree that it is much less a problem than alcohol.
I go to a college were both the binge drinking and the marijuana use is extremely rampant (#1 party school). I have friends who smoke pot every single day and I have friends who never smoke at all. I usually partake in smoking when my friends do it on weekends. The college here isn't easy and many of my friends are doing just fine in their classes. MARIJUANA DOES NOT MAKE YOU STUPID. Its the most distorting lie that I hear. It might make you lazy and a little short on memory DURING your high... but that only lasts a few hours.
But now back to the issue... why should marijuana be legal anyway? If you want to smoke marijuana in your home, you can. I've done it probably 200 times in my college career and not once has a police come knocking or have I felt like my privacy was at risk. It feels  perfectly legal and I think that perceived freedom is the essence of what is important.
Why pot should stay illegal... it makes it pretty damn expensive for a college student. I think this is a good thing. (This might not apply to everyone but atleast in my situation). Another thing is most people in jail are doing significant time were selling. They should be arrested... its the risk they take for making a lot of money. Either way our spending on the ""drug war"" should almost be cut out completely... but legalization isn't a good idea either. It sends the wrong message to young people.
I think people in my situation (hold a job, are in schooling, are in control of their life, etc.) hold a certain degree of responsiblity that allows one to handle drugs if they please (this includes delving into mushrooms, or cocaine if one is so inclined). The essence of a REAL addiction is when being sober just doesn't cut it anymore. Its the people with ****** lives who like their reality forever distorted (and who can blame them). I think everyone has the right to do whatever the **** they please as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else.
As I said before my thoughts are all around on the subject but my main point is this: The main argument for legalization is that the government shouldn't tell us what we can and can't do if it doesn't hurt anyone else... and I agree with this. But really... what are they doing to stop you from doing the drugs you want (atleast not blantantly in public)?... nothing! Legalizing drugs will lift much of the stigma (which I actually believe is good in some respects) that drugs are BAD simply stated. Kids at impressionable ages should believe this. They are to young and naive to have a plan for life and weed might just become it if they don't like school. When you're older and wiser you can make better decisions for yourself. You can 'rebel' if you want. You know the government is full of **** and weed won't make you stupid or crazy. But maybe its better for the youngin's to think so.

You don't see people robbing banks or killing or raping on a joint.
You are right you can not overdose on marijuana.
However to say it does not kill you is wrong.
Anything that effects the mind like that does kill you it just takes time.
Pop kills,tobacco kills,driving a car kills and water kills (usually too much at one time but however it might have some additives in it that someone might be allergic to).
You are also correct that the war on drugs is not working it is a miserable failure.
However we can not decriminalize hard drugs like Crack and Heroine and most of all Meth.
Any money seized in these wars should go for education.
But how can children respect the teachings of why they will harm you and destroy your life if they can easily get it?
I know a meth user (I hate this guy but he uses).
If I was a kid being taught how it kills and I know he uses and I can legally get it why would I believe you that it kills?

If anyone can prove anything contained in this site wrong I would gladly hear him or her out.
Now the debate of legalization of drugs is a debate that shouldn't exist in the first place if people would just remember what happened during prohibition of Alcohol.
There are many claims about how crime will go down or how violent crime has gone up blah blah blah…. None of this really matters if you look at the big picture. Think about it, when you buy drugs whom do you think produces sells and profits from these drugs? Whose profits and financial support would disappear if drugs were to be legalized? That’s right, gangsters and terrorists that’s who and no amount of law enforcement will ever be able to fully stop them, its just not working its as simple as that. Many people say that if drugs became legal that usage would rise. Well this is logical and I agree it would rise, but not by much and not enough to justify the wasted money, lives and the power prohibition grants organized crime and terrorists as well as the rampant corruption of public figures. Many people talk about legalization as if it will bring all sorts of problems associated with drug use. Let me clue you in: the problems already exist and drugs currently are illegal so, explain to me again how all these problems would magically arise if drugs were legal, but for some reason don't exist now? Now I agree that the problems would rise, but again not enough to justify the wasted money, lives and the power prohibition grants organized crime and terrorists as well as the rampant corruption of public figures. Many people say that of course crime would go down it would be the same if you legalized murder. This simply is not true there is a large amount of crime associated with drug use as well as selling drugs so, crime would go down but, in many different areas that hurt our society much more then drug use. Claims that drug use will sky rocket are simply false this has been proven true with prohibition. Also minors will have restricted from drugs due to age limits. It was much harder for me to get dope then it was for me to get a beer. To get beer I had to know somebody that was 21 and that was willing to buy me beer but, to get drugs I just had to know a dealer and many weren't much older then me when I was 16.
