0,Three problems of evolution,evolution,support,"1 - There is no scientific law that allows something to evolve from nothing. If there was nothing in the universe to begin with, obviously nothing could happen to cause anything to appear. 
2 - No scientific law can account for non-living thingsâ€™ coming to life. The soil in your garden didn't turn into the trees and flowers. They came from seeds, cuttings, or grafts from other trees and flowers.
3 - There is no known scientific law that would allow one kind of creature to turn naturally into a completely different kind. Insects don't evolve into more complex non-insects for instance, because they don't have the genes to do it.",0,1,topic_stance_votes_2
1,Three problems of evolution,evolution,attack,"This has nothing to do with evolution and so is not a problem for evolution.
Two things here. 1. ""non-living things? coming to life"" has nothing to do with evolution and so isn't a problem for evolution. 2. Soil in your garden is made from dead ""trees and flowers"": it is a living organism of sorts and most certainly isn't a ""non-living thing"".
Yes there is such a law: it is called natural selection. Insects do not ""evolve into more complex non-insects"" because there is no selection pressure upon them to do so as they are already incredibly complex organisms that fit their niches very well.
There are problems with evolution, but you haven't listed any. You have simply listed three problems with your understanding of evolution. My guess therefore is that you are an ignorant YEC supporter as you express opinions, based on flawed knowledge, on a subject about which you know next to nothing.

2,Three problems of evolution,evolution,support,"The theory of evolution is about LIFE evolving from LIFE, it has nothing to do with the state of the universe ""to begin with"".
The theory of evolution is about LIFE evolving from LIFE, it has nothing to do with LIFE arising from NON LIFE.
My definition of ""kind"" goes like this:
A poodle is a kind.
A dalmation is a different kind.
As we know that poodles can evolve into dalmations, therefore one kind can evolve into another.
If you disagree please specify how exactly I am supposed to define kinds. If you cannot then please don't be annoyed when I continue to use my own tried and tested definition rather than yours.

3,Three problems of evolution,evolution,support,"The posts above are correct in that evolution does not involve the origin of life. In fact, Darwin didn't even consider the origin of complex organs such as eyes as part of the theory. But, to play along, I'd like to address it anyway.
Life didn't originate from ""nothing"". As I understand it (which may be admittedly flawed, so if anyone has a better understanding, just chime in), conditions in the pre-biotic Earth's atmosphere allowed for the formation of basic (inaminate) amino acids, proteins, and nucleotides in the oceans. A chance formation of a nucleotide that could duplicate itself marked the beginning of heredity. 
Some molecules ""survived"" longer than others because of their different formations. For example, nucleotides wrapped in protein shells would be more protected and last longer than those that had no shells. Thus, viral pre-organisms emerged and eventually formed bacteria. 
Conceptually, bacteria that work together could fill a niche. These cooperative bacteria started working together and eventually formed proto-cells. Furthering this logic, cells that work together could fill a niche, too, and so they formed tissues. You could apply a similar logic along the line until you get to a complex organism, such as an animal. 
Your third concern goes back to Darwin's avoidance of the problem of emergent features, and I think it is a valid criticism. Eyes and wings can't just pop-up out of nowhere. However, many of the phenotypes for animals are strikingly similar. For example, the same basic bones exist in a human arm as in a reptile's leg, a bird's wing, and a fish's fin. Their form is remarkably different, yet their similarities hint at similar origins. I suspect something similar happened with the development of emergent features (i.e., eyes), but the emergence was slow and so far in the past that its true origin is difficult to ascertain.",3,4,topic_stance_votes_1
4,Three problems of evolution,evolution,attack,"If there was nothing in the universe to begin with, where did god come from?
And, like others have said, this has nothing to do with the Theory of Evolution. 
I don't know what ""scientific laws"" have anything to do with it, but there are people doing research that is trying to figure out exactly what you are talking about, how life could have come from non-life. Of course, we'll never know how it happened exactly without a time machine, but certain people are working on ways to simulate what may have happened and synthesize self-sustaining reactions and self-replicating vescicle structures in attempts to mimic how life may have first started. 
One thing of interest is that a 3-carbon sugar has been spectroscopically identified in intersteller gas. If this reacts with formaldehyde (2 of them), fairly common in interstellar clouds as well, you get ribose. Miller-Urey showed that under certain conditions believed to exist on the early earth, you can get naturally occuring amino acids as well as purines and pyrimidines. There is a mineral called montmorillonite (comes in scoopable kitty litter). It was found that mont. surfaces catalyze the formation of RNA from individual nucletotides. Remarkably, the same mineral also catalyzes the formation of vesicles from a mixture of fatty acids. Put these all together and you have RNA inside a vesicle (a protocell?). Anyway, this is just part of the basis for this type of research, but I think it's a good illustration.

You're right. An individual insect doesn't spin around and poof he's a dog. But, if you laid out individuals in a line, generation by generation, over a long period of time, there would be such small differences between generations that one couldn't tell the difference. If you then jumped from one generation to one born millions of years later, there may (or may not) be a discernable difference. One insect doesn't have the genes to become a dog, but over time, changes accumulate in the genome that a distant descendant may be quite different from it's distant predecessor, and it could even be a different species.",1,5,topic_stance_votes_1
5,Three problems of evolution,evolution,support,"The interesting thing to me is that it is repeatedly stated that evolution is not concerned with the origin of life. However, evolutionists continuously use evolution as an argument against creation, which is concerned with the origin of life.
So, evolutionists are arguing something that they should not be arguing.
Even if you do want to make the argument, however, you have to look at the origin of life. Whether you want to admit it or not, creation is about exactly that. Creation. It all starts with God creating the heavens and the earth and Adam and Eve. We, creationists, believe that and admit that. My question is...where does your 'belief' start?
However you believe (and that is what it is...a believe system) that a person is created, you will eventually, after tracking it back come to a point where you will have to question how things came to be. Maybe you get all the way to the beginning of time and you find yourself with a molecule of some matter. The question is...where did it come from.
My point is this...at some point you will have to account for the beginning of all things. The only answer for this is some sort of supernatural event and the only good answer to that supernatural event is God. Unless you know of a better one that I have not heard before. But, I doubt it.

7,Three problems of evolution,evolution,attack,"This is untrue. ""Evolutionists"" use the evidence around them to argue that a literal ""young earth"" reading of Genesis is blatantly false, ie that YEC supporters are wrong. Many ""evolutionists"" though are Christians who believe that God used evolution as his tool of creation. Only YEC supporters try to paint evolution and creation as mutally exclusive. They are not, as evolution is not concerned with beginnings; it is concerned with change.
I don't have any belief in this area. I don't know how life started and accept that I probably never will know. It might have started through a God ""magicking"" the first cell into existence, it may have started through purely random natural processes or anywhere in between the two. One only has belief and faith in this regard when one claims to know how life started. ""I don't know"" is not belief.
Some of us are capable of accepting ""I don't know"" as an answer to this question though.
And the answer is: we don't know. Maybe it came from nowhere. Maybe it was created. We don't know.
Tell me, what made your God? Your answer will likely be ""nothing, God has always been"". Why the need for the God though? Why not ""the universe needs no creator; no beginning: the universe is its own creator and its own beginning""?

10,Three problems of evolution,evolution,support,"Evolution (in the natural selection sense) does involve speciation, but it does not address the origin of life itself. Darwin was careful not to include the initial origin issue with selectionism, and believed (rightly so) that it was out of the scope of the natural selection argument. Selection is an explanation of how and why species change over time, but not how life originated from inanimate chemicals. 
I think I was a bit misleading in my initial post in that I was referring to only natural selection and not evolutionary theory as a whole. Chemical evolution addresses the origin puzzle, so I suppose in a way you're right: evolutionary theory, as a whole, could be seen as inclusive of life's origins, while natural selection (which I guess could be called a ""speciation"" subsection of the holistic evolutionary theory) involves only the changes and origins of species.",10,11,topic_stance_votes_1

Yes, the theory of evolution does not concern itself with the origin of life, it only is concerned with how life diversifies. It makes no difference how that life got there, if it self organized (a la abiogenesis) doesn't matter, evolution happened, if God (or Zeus or Odin or whatever god exists) magically zapped it into existance, doesn't matter, evolution happened. The theory of evolution explains how living organisms that imperfectly reproduce account for the biodiversity found on our planet. Abiogenesis deals with how inorganic chemicals can self organize into organic substances and finally life itself.
Two different scientific disciplines, biology and chemistry. Yes they are connected but proving (or disproving) one has no effect on the other.

""Evolutionist"" is such a vague term and the theory of evolution makes no mention whatsoever about God or creation. It does contradict the myth of creationISM, which makes predictions that have been falsified. Many christian scientists believe in creation, they just believe God created by natural means, like evolution. 
tlj13 said:
No, I accept the evidence that man evolved, the theory of evolution is NOT a belief system, it's an incredibly well supported scientific theory. You claim that an ""evolutionist"" must account for the begining. What evidence do you have that there had to be a begining? And where is your evidence that God created everything? You have yet to give us any......
tlj13 said:
You've really made no point, why can't reality be eternal? And why is a supernatural event the only explaination for the begining? We've seen uncaused events happen in the quantum world, sub atomic particles can just spontaneously appear. So at least we have evidence (slim evidence, to be sure) that the universe could have began uncaused, it could have spontaneously popped into existance. Now, we have absolutely no evidence of the supernatural, so why do you say that a supernatural event is the only way the universe could have started and why do you say the only good answer for that supernaturl event is God? Seems to me the only reason you assert this is because you want to be right, not because you have any evidence.... Since everything we've observed so far has had a natural explaination, it's reasonable to think that events we can not yet explain have natural explainations that we just haven't figured out yet.

Why do you say the begining (if it even exists) is beyond our understanding? Even now theoretical physicists, cosmologists, astronomers are conducting observations and experiments on the ultimate origin of our universe and the nature of reality.

We have made great strides in understanding our universe, the big bang theory is a reasonable explaination for the evidence we've observed so far.
