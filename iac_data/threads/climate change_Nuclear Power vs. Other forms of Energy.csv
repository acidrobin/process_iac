0,Nuclear Power vs. Other forms of Energy,climate change,support,Now I know that Nuclear Power has already been discussed but I just wished to see if people thought we should have nuclear power or not. Just curious.,0,1,topic_stance_votes_1
1,Nuclear Power vs. Other forms of Energy,climate change,support,"The nuclear power debate is emerging once again in my country. We finally have some distance (time) to Chernobyl so we can discuss the matter rationally. Apparantly many young adults who didn`t experience Chernobyl as grown ups do not buy into the ""nuclear=death-machine that will kill us all"" propaganda :)",1,2,topic_stance_votes_1
2,Nuclear Power vs. Other forms of Energy,climate change,support,"In the future, unless some radical new technology gets discovered nuclear power will become more important as a source of energy. At some point oil and gas will be more costly to use for electrical power then nuclear power. When that happens nuke plants will become more common.",2,3,topic_stance_votes_1
3,Nuclear Power vs. Other forms of Energy,climate change,support,"There have been some rather impressive developments with non-nuclear power. For example, newly developed Thermo-Depolymerization Technology (which converts carbon-rich garbage into crude oil). The conversion process doesn't create any harmful pollutants and use of the new form of oil actually releases less greenhouse gases than would be released by the natural decay process if the material had been stored in a landfill.
'Turkey waste turned into oil' - New York Newsday - New TDP plant generating a positive cash flow while selling crude oil converted from garbage at a price 10% less than equivalent oil produced at a conventional refinery.

'Missouri plant begins making oil from farm waste’ – Waste News - Crude oil No. 4, produced from agricultural waste products, put on the market.

'Turkey Fuel? Factory to Turn Guts into Crude Oil' - National Geographic - Details how a Carthage plant is converting turkey waste into crude oil and its potential to solve many of America's waste disposal problems while making us less dependant on foreign oil.

'Researchers turn manure into crude oil' - MSNBC News - Researcher Yanhui Zhang of the University of Illinois has successfully converted pig manure into oil in small batches. He uses a similar process to the one already being used by a plant in Carthage, Mo., that converts tons of waste material, such as feathers and entrails, from a nearby Butterball Turkey plant into light crude oil.

And on the hydrogen frontier, there was a recent breakthrough in an ethanol-to-hydrogen reactor that will make hydrogen much more competitive as an energy source.

4,Nuclear Power vs. Other forms of Energy,climate change,support,"There is an interesting article in a recent issue of Fortune magazine detailing the success of French nuclear power. The article gives a reasonably good case to the advacement of nuclear power plants. 
There are some security concerns that would certainly have to be addressed before we start popping plants up across the country. Other than that I think new nuclear power plants deserve their day in court.",4,5,topic_stance_votes_1
5,Nuclear Power vs. Other forms of Energy,climate change,support,"There is a huge difference between fission and fusion. fission bad, fusion good.",5,6,topic_stance_votes_1
6,Nuclear Power vs. Other forms of Energy,climate change,support,"Oh yeah, generalizations are cool! Let's all jump on this bandwagon!
Black people bad, white people good.
Muslims bad, Christians good.
Fission bad, fusion good.
Geez.",6,7,topic_stance_votes_1
7,Nuclear Power vs. Other forms of Energy,climate change,support,"Obviously you need to read up on the differeneces. They are in no way equal, and why you brought race and religion into this debate preplexes me.",7,8,topic_stance_votes_1
8,Nuclear Power vs. Other forms of Energy,climate change,support,"I bring it up, because you seem completely unafraid to make gross generalizations. It's the mindset I'm talking about, not the specific issue. Read what I wrote, and understand it, before you respond.
Beyond that, trust me, I'm well-read. Probably more than you.
The point I was trying to get across... you didn't get it the first time, rather concentrating on the social side-issues of my first post... is that both forms of power have their advantages. At this point, fission's biggest advantage is its feasibility; fusion HAS NONE!
People are afraid of fission, and rightfully so, remembering Chernobyl. Yet, if mankind is to progress, he must fight past his fears, and advance.",8,9,topic_stance_votes_1
9,Nuclear Power vs. Other forms of Energy,climate change,support,"Sorry, but we don't have to apply social equalities to inanime objects. Fusion is better, the ONLY problem is it's not ready for mass use yet. That doesn't make fission power any better.
I'm not really worried about a three mile island. I'm more worried about those thousands upon millions of gallons of radioactive waste and their effects.",9,10,topic_stance_votes_1
10,Nuclear Power vs. Other forms of Energy,climate change,support,"They make the crude oil by heating waste under pressure.
WHERE DO THEY GET THE HEAT?

11,Nuclear Power vs. Other forms of Energy,climate change,support,"Controlled fusion ain't ready by a long shot. It will be decades before we see the first prototype fusion power station.

I agree that fission waste is terrible.

12,Nuclear Power vs. Other forms of Energy,climate change,support,"At least you think you're smart. I wish others could say the same about you. How do you come on this forum, make 28 posts, and then decide you are well-read, more so than everyone else? 
Also, I have no clue why you brought race into this. Saying fission is good, fusions is bad has no business being compared with saying someone of one race is better than another. Get a clue.
P.S---You would think someone so well-read would know how to spell screw, wouldn't you?",9,13,topic_stance_votes_1
