0,God has emotions?,existence of God,support,"So I've heard a lot of people say that ""God loves"" or ""God hates"" or some other phrase which assumes that God has human emotions. How can you compare how human beings feel and interact to the way an omnipotent and omniscient being could ""feel""? What motivates God? If He has the power to know, see, and do everything, what ""feelings"" or purposes would guide His actions. We can't assume in this case that God has feelings like loneliness or affection because these are human emotions and would make him an imperfect being (as humans are called when compared to deities). So how can you make the assumption that He can love or hate?
Also, when answering, don't quote Scripture. If I wanted to ask the Bible, I would read it. I'm asking for your thoughts and ideas, not quotes from a book.",0,1,topic_stance_votes_1
1,God has emotions?,existence of God,attack,"Your wrong, God does feel affection, at least the God in my Bible. Why else would God repeatedly woe the Isrealites turning their backs on him and worshipping other gods? He loves you, that's affection.
Lonelyness, I don't think so. He has angels, and he is a Truine God. And he has an infinite imagination and infinite power. I think he could figure out something to do. (But he did create Angels and Humans to worship him....and he has Angel's still left even if we're rebelllious)

2,God has emotions?,existence of God,support,"I ask you how we can know something that does not already exist? We know science and math, because the patterns existed before we did, leading way to out discovery. Man does not create concepts of his own, but all ideas come from simplified ideas all mixed together. Take a unicorn for example; we've all seen a horse, and a horn, so if you combine the two ideas, you have a unicorn. Furthermore, if God was to create man in his image, I believe that means something besides the physical. How can the eternal, which transcends the physical, in itself be physical? I believe we cannot comprehend Gods true form, so instead, he gives us the mental image of a perfect human form as a guideline (since we are so needy). So if God made us in his image, meaning the sould in this case, then we would have many of the same traits as He would. How can we have something that He did not create? It doesn't make sense? How can there be a specification that the manufacturer did not notice, especially when the design was perfect? So God must have emotions, because if not, then why did men love in the first place if we knew not what it was?",2,3,topic_stance_votes_2

8,God has emotions?,existence of God,support,"A Russian scientist visiting an American University said ""Either there is a God or there isn't. Both possibilities are frightening!"" This is so true.

If you ask me, both possibilities are extremely frightening. So I look at your question I see that it first assumes that there is a God and it questions the ""who He is and what he wants"" aspect of this situation. So if He is perfect can he have emotions? And are human emotions really 'human' or something we get from God when he made us in his image? Well, I'm not gonna quote scripture but the Bible implies that God doesn't just have love but he is love itself. For some strange reason this makes sense to me, because we know the physical aspects of this world but we hardly experience the spiritual aspects of our souls, we can kinda sense that there's more to ourselves then brains that have feelings because of chemical reactions. Yet it's very easy to write it off as just that. Since the question assumes the existence of a God we then have decided that there is this Spirit that exists as a spirit (along with Jesus who came to earth in physical form) we can then decide that we have souls inside ourselves (well not so much inside ourselves as actually ourselves). These souls were made in Gods image, emotions we feel aren't weakness our sinful natures can make us feel rage and hatred and it's okay to hate what is evil (people aren't evil they've just fallen) we can hate sin in the same way God does.

While this is an interesting idea and something you should at least wonder about, I don't think it's so. My definition of God is taken from the philosopher Anselm (I will not quote, for I do not remember it with clarity) who said something like this; the idea of God Himself is perfection. When you speak of God you imagine (as well as an imperfect being can, I suppose) a perfect being. Is it more perfect to exist or not to exist, to remain an idea or to fulfill the potential of being?

26,God has emotions?,existence of God,attack,"If I may butt in here........
God does not want you to deny your emotions. He does not want you to let them rule you either. There are actions that could benefit many if we can but get past our fear. God does want us to feel our emotions, to know them and understand them. We have them for a reason. It is not so that we obey their thrust. They are a clue as to what is going on in us. 
The subduing of emotions (all of them by the way, not just ones typically identified as bad) is simply bringing them under submission to the will. It is how some people can behave heroically. They do what they know is the right thing to do even though they don't really feel like it.
Not heroic, but even for myself, I grew up with an alcoholic father. I learned as a child that if I did not take care of myself then no one else would. Consequently, I treated people as if they are suspect. Unfortunately, I have brought those feelings into my marriage. It is a poor way for a wife to live in relation to her husband when he treats her as always suspect. I have to unlearn what my emotions tell me. I have to learn the new way of thinking. I have to choose to treat my wife like she is on my side, even though it doesn't feel that way.
Emotions tell us where things come from. In the above example, my fear that my wife is against me (when she is obviously not) is unfounded, so where does it come from. I recognize the emotion, feel it, realize its origin and then take it to God for Him to help me to deal with it. He (through prayer, meditation, study etc, helps me to learn to think differently. 
You can feel free to come out publicly against christianity (naturally), but you should educate yourself about it and don't assume what a few teach that all teach. It is very prejudicial to do that.

Ok, so let's say the universe is only chaotic and random. By random, I mean that there is no constant and that existence is real at various points by the roll of the cosmos' dice. If that would be true, then existence (what we perceive to be true; everyday life, you, me, everyone) would not exist in a stream, but in short fragments. Look at it this way. Imagine that the characters in a book are real, and only have existence when being read. So, with that laid on the table (yeah, I know, this is weird) you're reading a book, and the characters in the book are experiencing existence. But then you put down the book to take a short break and grab a snack. The universe for them stops, but are they aware of it, or is the lapse of their existence as seamless as dozing off without realizing it, coming right back into play whenever you decide to get back into it?

32,God has emotions?,existence of God,attack,"The emotions are never labled as sin. The actions are the sins. The emotions MAY be indicative of a sinful heart. This is why we don't deny them. Sex outside of marriage is not an emotion it is an action. A choice. Murder, Idolatry, covetousness is even not an emotion but an action. envy would be an example of the emotion. To envy your neighbor's new jaguar XJ is an emotion, to compete with your neighbor by making the car the most important thing in your life and denying your family so you can drive a similar car, that is covetousness. Adultry is an action, and so on.
Lust is an indication of desire for something forbidden. While it is an emotion and jesus says he who looks on another woman with lust in his heart has committed the sin of adultery, the point Jesus is making is that the condition of the heart is what is important. It is an indicator that I have put sexual relations with a woman who is not my wife above God. I have now begun to treat this woman as an object. That is the true sin, not the emotion, but rather the way I think about this woman. The emotion is what notifies us of problems in our thinking and actions, it is why they are there. To make them paramount over our thinking is sinful, to ignore them altogether is just as sinful.
Does that explain my position better?
edited note:
Also, people are not to judge others because only God can know that condition of the heart. We should be wary of others that regularly display sinful behavior as they may not be trustworthy. That does not imply condemnation on our part,just caution. As for God deciding on who gets to be condemned, who would you rather have decide that, you? Me? Bush? Clinton? I think a God that sent His Son to take the punishment for the Sin of the world is the one who deserves to be judge. What he states is that you have a choice to be judged by your behavioror by identification with His Son. You decide the choice is yours. If you go to Hell that is your choice not His. He wanted so much for you to be with Him that He sent His Son. Had he removed the choice altogether then that would not be love, but rather compliance on our part.

Your last paragraph is correct except that lust is an emotion coupled with an action. The actions are sinful. 
As well, there are two types of sin. There is the noun and the verb. I have sin. NOun. I sin, verb. 
Here is the last thing. The majority of protestant churches teach salvation by Grace through faith regardless of the sins committed. 
Montalban could speak more clearly on the orthodox positon and maximus on the catholic. I think the three of us have some dogmatic disagreement but all think all three would say the nicene creed is true. (doctrine).
Lastly, it is wrong, completely wrong for any human to condemn another. It is right for God to condemn as the definer of all things. If God is perfect, and the christian doctrine says he is, then He is the only one for whom it is right to be in the positon of judge.
We in our judicial system may condemn to prison or physical death, but only the creator has the right to condemn to final death. Personally, I would not want anyone else to do it. No one else would know enough.
Identification with Jesus is what leads to salvation. This is not just avoidance of punishment,but actually being declared righteous, and being adopted into the family of GOd. It is choice offered to all. God will not force it because he desires love, not compliance. 
MOntalban: God does experience emotions. Jesus showed anger when he drove out the money changers at the temple (and I know the orthodox consider Jesus to be God). He also said to Jerusalem ""how I long to gather you under my wings.) He cried in the garden before his crucifixion. He felt the shame of the cross. In the psalms God describes himself as a jealous God. (not jealous of but rather jealous for). God states frequently what he desires. These are all emotions. God certainly experiences them. You would have a difficult time scripturally proving otherwise. God does not sin. 
This all only goes to prove my point that emotions in and of themselves are part of how we are made and are not sinful. Denying our emotions only leads us into slavery to them. Recognizing, admitting, and discovering what they mean are vital to our growth, physically, emotionally, spiritually.

They are simply one church's attempt to categorise sins, because (some) people want to know what to do and what not to do, to avoid separating themselves from God.
One poster here seems to suggest that Protestants believe that God's Grace will be conferred regardless of the sin committed. In fact Jesus did say that one sin will not be forgiven, that of an insult against the Holy Spirit.
Matthew 12
31
And so I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
However, James Hogg lampooned this Protestant notion in his book (which from memory)* is called ""Confessions of a Justified Sinner"" in which he says that once he's received his justification -through declaration of faith, as Protestants do, then he is free from worry, and can commit any sin he wants.
It also is problematic to Protestants who believe that they are 'saved', when one realises that some, just one or two, might actually convert to another faith - does this mean that they become 'un-saved'?
Further, Heb.10 says...
26
If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left,
27
but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God.
So to those that are 'saved', if you now sin, your condemned to hell!

Is it wrong to feel sexually attracted to someone because of their looks? This is also instinctual. Why would a religion support the supression of instinctive emotions conveniently labeled lust and envy? Or does this go back to the orignial flaw that caused the Original Sin?

58,God has emotions?,existence of God,attack,"I am enjoying this discussion. As to this, MOntalban is on the right track. Hebrews chapter 11 also answers this question. However, from a philosophical view consider:
1 God created time.
2. God acts both inside and outside time (as the creator of it this is natural).
3. Jesus salvation extends in both directions of time.
4. Believers were justified by faith in God prior to the first coming. (hebrews chapter 11)
5. In genesis the story of Abram/Abraham says ""abram believed God and it was accounted to him as righteousness""
6. The trusting Jesus is that we believe God that Jesus is the way (Jesus is also God by the way).
Now on to the topic:
You see, the majority of christians do seem to act the way you say. It is a sad commentary for the church. Believers lives really ought to look different. If we truly believe what GOd has said, we should act that way. Just as an atheist believes there is no God then they act that way. Lying becomes just a necessary tool in the hands of an atheist. 
My church is different. Or at least, I think so. I have seen many people come in hurting. I have seen them reveal their addictions to those they trusted in the church and watched the members say, ""you are okay"" They have said this even if they did not stop their addiction (sin). GOd has declared me righteous. If I have an addiction (mine is codependency) then the church should be a place where the sick, sore, wounded and hated can come and find healing, rest, and love. This is what my church believes.
We are not perfect. In fact we fail often. But then we are human beings. God gives us the mercy and grace to fail. In Romans chapter 7 paul describes it as thus: ""I do the very thing I don't want to do and the thing I want to do, I don't do."" He then asks the question ""who will save me from the body of this sin?"" He also answers, ""thanks be to Jesus Christ."" He then goes on to say, ""There is therefore, now, no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus...""(Romans 8:1).
Perhaps the difference is my church believes that we all sin. We are not better than you because we are christian. Even a blind squirrel gets an acorn. I am one blessed squirrel. I am not better than you. I am living under the grace of GOd. You can too. Just because you may choose not to, does not make me better than you. Those that condemn, do so out of their flawed selves. That does not make you better than them. We are all flawed. The question is how are you and I going to deal with that. We can try to live up to the law of God and be perfect all on our own. However, given that we are flawed, that is impossible. It is only by trusting in the grace of God that it is at all possible.
That is my take at least.

You are very incorrect. Jesus Christ (and especially God the Father!), is not dead. He is alive, as explained through John 20. He has been successful in conquering sin and death. Did you know that the Christian belief is the only one - to my knowledge - that talks about a risen Saviour, i.e. is alive today? What an amazing LORD we have. One who would freely give His life to save man kind from an eternity of pain and suffering with the devil in hell. Just to think that Jesus would have done that for me (and for you) is just amazing and it illustrates His (and God the Father's) LOVE for us. In fact, John 3:16 tells us that ""God so loved the world that He sent His one and only Son so that everyone who believes in Him will not die but have eternal life."" What a great promise! So hence, since Jesus Christ is alive, and the Holy Spirit is everywhere, is it not alright to talk to God? I do so on regular occassions.

Yes, I understand that you do disagree, but I'm still confused as to what it is you're driving at. I state the Christian view, which is what you want, then you say that lust is good... that a negative is good.
I would expect that you would get them confused. Even finding two people being negative does not make a positive.
No, desire from love leads to respectful marriage. Sex can be a result of love, or of hate. If you love, your coming together for sex is not for yourself, but for the other. If you lust, then you are acting upon your own desires, and possibly your partner is doing the same thing, so you believe that just because you're both using each other to get off, that it's love. That's more like a social contract - let's have sex with each other, so that you'll pleasure me, and I'll pleasure you.
In your case perhaps, it is the act of two individuals coming together to use one another, and feeling good, because you both at least got something out of it.

"" It is clear that Paul here is denying anything like a general personal guilt for the sin of Adam. Sin was, however, in the world, since death reigned even over them who had not sinned as Adam sinned. Sin here is obviously the person of Satan, who ruled the world through death even before the coming of the law. This is the only possible interpretation of this statement, because it is clearly supported elsewhere by Paul's teachings concerning the extraordinary powers of the devil, especially in Romans 8:19-21. St. Paul's statements should be taken very literally when he says that the last enemy to be destroyed is death [ 226 ] and that ""the sting of death is sin.""[ 227 ]
From what has been observed, the famous expression, eph'ho pantes hemarton,[ 228 ] can be safely interpreted as modifying the word, thanatos, which preceeds it, and which grammatically is the only word which fits the context. Eph'ho as a reference to Adam is both grammatically and exegetically impossible. Such an interpretation was first introduced by Origen, who obviously used it with a purpose in mind, because he believed in the pre-existence of all souls whereby he could easily say that all sinned in Adam. The interpretation of eph'ho as ""because"" was first introduced into the East by Photius,[ 229 ] who claims that there are two interpretations prevalent--Adam and thanatos--but he would interpret it dioti (because). He bases his argument on a false interpretation of II Corinthians 5:4 by interpreting eph'ho, here again, as dioti. But here it is quite clear that eph'ho refers to skensi (eph'ho skenei ou thelomen ekdysasthai). Photius is interpreting Paul within the framework of natural moral law and is seeking to justify the death of all men by personal guilt. He claims that all men die because they sin by following in the footsteps of Adam.[ 230 ] However, neither he nor any of the Eastern Fathers accepts the teaching that all men are made guilty for the sin of Adam.
From purely grammatical considerations it is impossible to interpret eph'ho as a reference to any word other than thanatos. Each time the grammatical construction of the preposition epi with the dative is used by Paul, it is always used as a relative pronoun which modifies a preceding noun [ 231 ] or phrase.[ 232 ] To make an exception in Romans 5:12 by making St. Paul use the wrong Greek expression to express the idea, ""because,"" is to beg the issue. The correct interpretation of this passage, both grammatically and exegetically, can be supplied only when eph'ho is understood to modify thanatos--kai houtos eis pantas anthropous ho thanatos dielthen eph'ho (thanato) pantes hemarton--""because of which"" (death), or ""on the basis of which"" (death), or ""for which (death) all have sinned."" Satan, being himself the principle of sin, through death and corruption involves all of humanity and creation in sin and death. Thus, to be under the power of death according to Paul is to be a slave to the devil and a sinner, because of the inability of the flesh to live according to the law of God, which is selfless love.""

The Orthodox Church compiled the Bible, in keeping to traditions - it is how they judged which books were inspired - by those which kept to the traditions of the Church as understood for the first 300 years of its history (some Epistles had only limited circulation and were unknown in other parts of Christendom, yet the majority of Christendom kept to the teachings.)
They taught what Jesus had passed down to them.
They wrote in Greek, and they understood it.
1,500 years later Luther says ""No, hang on, if you change a few words here and there then you'll really understand that the Bible says this...""
And now it does, in it's updated, re-translated, changed form.
Charels Taze Russell tried this again in the 1800s, re-working difficult texts till he had a Scripture that fits in part with what he taught.
SO, when you, or they (the JW's) resort to Scripture, you are going down the path of self-fulfillment.",82,85,topic_stance_votes_2
