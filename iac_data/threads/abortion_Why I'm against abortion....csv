3,Why I'm against abortion...,abortion,attack,"Perhaps but by the time they have learned, it's far too late. Both for them and their unfortunate child who will start their life with one strike (or more) against them. 
(I will take a stab in the dark and anticipate your counterpoint. Teenagers do a very poor job of learning from the mistakes of their peers. Having two or four teenagers screw up their life in this manner will not prevent the rest of the high school from having sex. IMO, I doubt that that this would prove to be much of an impetus for engaging in safer sex.) 
Now, taking a step back I am not sure whether this is a legitimate reason for undergoing an abortion. I did say the child would start out life already behind his or her peers, but at least they are starting out. 
Hmmmm...but is it really a child? Or is it just a lump of tissue with the potential to become a child? As someone who has seen the results of an early term miscarriage I would have to go with the latter (at least at that point in the pregnancy). Late-term....that gets tricky in a hurry.

Dear Mommy, I am in Heaven now, sitting on Jesus' lap. He loves me and cries with me; for my heart has been broken. I so wanted to be your little girl. I don't quite understand what has happened. I was so excited when I began realizing my existance. I was in a dark, yet comfortable place. I saw I had fingers and toes. I was pretty far along in my developing, yet not near ready to leave my surroundings. I spent most of my time thinking or sleeping. Even from my earliest days, I felt a special bonding between you and me. Sometimes I heard you crying and I cried with you. Sometimes you would yell or scream, then cry. I heard Daddy yelling back. I was sad, and hoped you would be better soon. I wondered why you cried so much. One day you cried almost all of the day. I hurt for you. I couldn't imagine why you were so unhappy. That same day, the most horrible thing happened. A very mean monster came into that warm, comfortable place I was in. I was so scared, I began screaming, but you never once tried to help me. Maybe you never heard me. The monster got closer and closer as I was screaming and screaming, ""Mommy, Mommy, help me please; Mommy, help me."" Complete terror is all I felt. I screamed and screamed until I thought I couldn't anymore. Then the monster started ripping my arms off. It hurt so bad; the pain I can never explain. It didn't stop. Oh, how I begged it to stop. I screamed in horror as it ripped my leg off. Though I was in such complete pain, I was dying. I knew I would never see your face or hear you say how much you love me. I wanted to make all your tears go away. I had so many plans to make you happy. Now I couldn't; all my dreams were shattered. Though I was in utter pain and horror, I felt the pain of my heart breaking, above all. I wanted more than anything to be your daughter. No use now, for I was dying a painful death. I could only imagine the terrible things that they had done to you. I wanted to tell you that I love you before I was gone, but I didn't know the words you could understand. And soon, I no longer had the breath to say them; I was dead.I felt myself rising. I was being carried by a huge angel into a big beautiful place. I was still crying, but the physical pain was gone. The angel took me to Jesus and set me on His lap. He said He loved me, and He was my Father. Then I was happy. I asked Him what the thing was that killed me. He answered, ""Abortion. I am sorry, my child; for I know how it feels."" I don't know what abortion is; I guess that's the name of the monster. I'm writing to say that I love you and to tell you how much I wanted to be your little girl. I tried very hard to live. I wanted to live. I had the will, but I couldn't; the monster was too powerful. It sucked my arms and legs off and finally got all of me. It was impossible to live. I just wanted you to know I tried to stay with you. I didn't want to die. Also, Mommy, please watch out for that abortion monster. Mommy, I love you and I would hate for you to go through the kind of pain I did. Please be careful. 
Love,
Your Baby Girl

This story is especially putrid because you are taking the qualities of at least a teenager [and a very wonderfully subservient one at that (I had so many plans to make you happy.)] and giving them to a fetus.

50 years ago, premature babies of <7 months of development time typically died.

Someday, we may be able to raise a fetus entirely outside of the womb.

Anyway, back to the discussion. I'm glad you admited that abortion can be justified in some cases, in this case, when the life of the mother is at risk. I mention it for a few reasons, one of which that the ban on late term abortion (D&X procedure or ""partial birth abortion"" as pro-lifers call it) did not contain an exception for the life of the mother. Regardless on my opinion on the subject, I think this was a gross oversight, as I think you'll agree. Regardless of how rare it is, we should allow doctors to do their jobs and save their patients.
Galton, you acuse me of emotional blackmail when it is you and JP which say that I, and thus by extention all those who are pro-choice, want to ""kill babies"". The life and health of the mother is a real problem in some cases, while the term ""fetus"" is the appropriate medical term, and ""baby"" is only used to evoke emotional response.
That article is interesting, jp. I like 
This seems very irresponsible to me. The woman cannot have a necessary medical procedure because being pregnant makes it illegal. To me, the woman should at least have the choice between having the child and saving her own life. With these laws, there is no choice (This is the essence of what being pro-choice is, having choices)
I have no problem with this, really, since it protects those who decide to carry their babies to term. My only problem is that pro-lifers will want to extend this to prosecute doctors who perform a desired medical procedure.
This also concerns me. I am against smoking, but I don't mind what others do in their own home generally. Illegal drugs are obviously illegal whether or not you're pregnant :P This is a hard subject, and I'll have to think about it before I can give an informed opinion.
I like the ""food for thought"" at the end.
Both points are really laughable. The first, ignoring the emotionaly blackmail in calling it a ""baby"", the father doesn't have *any* rights in this sense. He cannot decide whether to have an abortion or not at any time during the pregnancy, and I see no reason to change that.
The second, shouldn't that be the woman's choice whether or not to charge the ouside person? It also doesn't clarify if that outside person intended to cause a miscarriage. If I trip and accidently knock down a pregnant woman and cause a miscarriage, should I be charged with murder? If I had accidently killed an adult, the most I would get is an involuntary manslaughter charge, since murder includes intent (as I understand it).

No problem. I aim to please. :)
In reality, there are always choices. If the life of the mother i truly at risk, how many juries do you think would convict her? How many prosecutors would even charge her?

No such thing, seeing as we are being accurate here. Nothing magic happens that changes what was replicated cells from the parent into a happy bouncing baby. They just grow, nothing new is added that wasn't there before until much later. Your terms are just a nebulous as the superfical terms you picked to attempt to discredit my viewpoint, I just don't feel that I want to class something as human that could have cancer in the same definition. As far as I am concerened a person is more than a DNA code. 
There is a great deal of times when an abortion is really beneficial to a family, not in some stupid example like you chose. If the mother is very young (12 for example seeing as we are picking extremes) and would have to drop out of school to have the baby and look after it, sacrificing her chance at a better life for herself and any future children. If the family really cannot afford another child and would be forced into bancruptcy, ruining the future of their children who can no longer afford any further education. 
As for sugar coating, you are no different from any other religous extremist, wanting to enforce your view of the world on people who want to think for themselves rather than follow others blindly. An abortion will not affect you in the slightest, nor could it possibly ever so why should it be your choice rather than the mothers? That is the main argument for prochoice.

The fact it is your or my spouse is irrleevant in this case (what is punishment going to do really, chances are it was a crime of passion and she wouldn't do it again anyway- the law here is there for a more general reason and stop her doing it in the first place). Abortion laws do not follow the same reasoning as there is never going to be the threat of harm to you. 
If the ban was passed, then the choice is being forced, there is no problem with wanting the law to be enforced, if it was passed then they should be punished, but it is the first bit that is important- at what point the embryo/fetus is considered a person which the debate is about.

Neither do zygotes. Zygotes only form into a type of cell. Never a human being. Unless of course...you can prove there is such a thing called a human being cell. 
""Once this course is set on its path (the sperm has fertilized the egg) then it has become an independent form of human life.""
If it is an independnet life form then it can physically live on it's own. However a zygote cannot and thus it does not meet the definition of independent life. 
""Now this individual does rely on its mother for the next 9 months, but that is not an argument for it being not an individual. This child also depends on people for many years after this as is grows and matures.""
You are comparing apples to oranges and using limited depth. A fetus is physically dependent on the woman's body no differently a cell. A child is socially dependent on a care giver. Hypothetically, if that care giver were to die off the child would still live. Now on the other hand if the woman died then the fetus would also follow suit.

127,Why I'm against abortion...,abortion,attack,"My apologies if I seem to be skipping over a bunch of open issues in this thread, but I felt the need to at least voice an alternate P.O.V.:
If a man and woman choose to engage in an activity that any rational individual understands can have undesired ""sideeffects"" do we as a society, even as individuals, hold them responsible for the unintended results?
For example: a man and woman are engaged in an act that involves considerable repetitve motions, ends with a rather large ""bang"", and leaves both of them satisfied...unfortunately their having cut down the 75' oak tree between their houses crushes the neighbor's 5 year old child and dog when it falls into the wrong yard. Do we hold the man and woman responsible for the death of that child and family pet? darn tootin' we do, not only that if it can be shown that there was gross negligence the crime is even more severe.
Let's roll this forward to the following example: again a man and woman are engaged in an act that requires considerable repetitive motions, ends with a rather large ""bang"", and leaves them both satisfied...unfortunately she (or rather they) ends up pregnant...should we hold her (or at least them?) responsible? Or do we let them off the hook by terminating a very probable new life?
I have been through the entire gamut of issues with my wife, we've had ectopics, spontaneous abortions, medically necessary D&C (fetus died inutero), home births, and a C-section.... we have four kids (I have a good job, stable family, yada yada yada) - so my opinion may be tinted by that. But I still see it in terms of responsibility, if you chose (see the loophole for rape here?) to engage in an activity that could have undesired results, you should be held accountable if an accidental (!!?) pregnancy results. Basically - suck it up for nine (nearer to 10 according to MDs) months and put the child up for adoption, or find a family member willing to take the child,...or (Oh No..!) keep it. Responsibility people...sometimes life sucks, sorry.
Your economic position in life, level of schooling, family environment -- none of that matters in ANY other event where the individual is at 'fault' for the outcome..why is pregnancy any different?",127,128,topic_stance_votes_1

Let me propose another. You leave your keys in the door of your house. During the night a burglar comes into your house. You call the police. Do they say ""You were irresponsible to leave your keys in the door. You have to take responsibility for your mistakes, and deal on your own with the consequences of your actions.

To place responsibility (the way I described it in my post) you would take your examples to their logical completion: The ambulance workers treat her (it is their job), send her a bill and the Insurance company refuses to cover the cost making it her responsibility to cover it. Or, the home owner left their keys in the lock - the police work to find the burglar (it is their job) but the insurance company refuses to replace the lost items due to negligence - the responsibility is on the owner.
ummm...at least you used a lower case 'r'. You have NO RIGHTS in a criminal case in which you are found liable or negligent...you go to prison. Comparatively, it is no longer ""just your body"" if a woman gets pregnant, and therfore a DIFFERENT set of governing 'rights' is involved. You chose to commit an act that could possibly change the status of your body, guess what - it worked..there are now two people you are responsible for. Your 'rights' are not reduced at all...your responsibilities are dramatically increased.
Pregnancy isn't a punishment, it is a natural result of a process of events that the woman chose to initiate, it is also a result of events that may not be of her chosing (rape, incest, etc...) but that is a slightly different topic - and my previous post allows that this is only relevant to CHOICES that we make.
It is a utopian fantasy that a child and a pregnancy should always be wanted. The woman had the CHOICE to not have sex - if that particular need is that great, there are a multitude of alternatives that are GUARANTEED to not result in pregnancy. 
Further mine is not a Pro-Life position - mine is a realist. I for one am not against abortion in the case of rape or incest, immediate danger to the maternal host, or non-viability of the fetus.
Can you honestly tell me that it wasn't (at least partially) ""her fault"" if she chose to have sex? We could branch into success rates of condoms, partner responsibility, and myriad other things...but at the root of all those avoidance measures it still comes down to - She CHOSE knowing what COULD happen.
Have you looked into the ACTUAL abortion figures that started this whole 'mess'? (one of the original Pro-Choice founder has admitted to grossly falsifying the numbers)
And finally, please don't infer that I - or anyone involved with any group - does not have compassion for women.

No, I am saying that whether or not the woman or person causes what happens or does it to themselves does not mean they must endure the consequence you choose for them, whether or not it is the 'natural' consequence. The 'natural' consequence in my example is for the woman to be burned, but she does not have to endure that consequence, even if some people might wish them to. Such as yourself.
Thank you for making my point for me :D Yes, there are consequences for every action. However, what consequence these people wish to go through is a personal decision. If the woman does not wish to pay for the care, she may indeed stay burned. If the person does not wish to involve the police, he or she does not have to call them. The people involved choose what consequence they wish to endure, not you.
Now, bringing that back to abortion, if a woman falls pregnant she can indeed carry the entity she carries to completion and bear it. If she chooses, she can also have an abortion. Both of these choices are consequences. Abortion is a consequence, and women may choose this consequence instead of remaining pregnant.
...
Sex is not a crime. You may wish it to be, but it is not. The gov't should not violate a woman's rights.
""Do the crime, do the time"" is a horrible way of looking at motherhood. It should always be a choice.
It is always the woman's body. Nothing changes that. The gov't does not have a deed to it to hand over to another, not even the fetus. The fetus should never have the right to use her body over her right to her own body. If the gov't enforces the fetus' right to use her body, then it is violating her right.
Disease can also ""change the status of your body"". That hardly matters whether or not you chose to engage in the act for this. You can change it anyway. Remember my examples? Whether or not you chose to do that does not change whether or not you can choose a different consequence, if you can.
Besides, consenting to sex is consenting to sex. It is not consenting to anything else.
Why did you put 'rights' in quotes? You do not believe in individual rights?
Our society believes in individual rights as paramount. It is a fascist gov't that puts the interests of the State as superior to individual rights. The State does not exist to make us moral. 
Oh boo hoo. ""It's natural so it has to be good!"" I see that **** a million times spewed by pro-lifers.
Disease is also natural, and is also a possible consequence to sex. That does not mean we must ""deal with it"".
Well excuse me. I prefer to work towards a world where children are wanted. Making abortion illegal will certainly not do that. Forcing women to have children against their will and without their consent will certainly not do that. I don't particularly like abortion, but I know that it is immoral, demeaning and disrespectful to believe I should choose for women whether or not they should carry a pregnancy.
You know what, I agree. Women and men should not have sex irresponsibly. Guess what? They do anyway. And women should never be forced into carrying a pregnancy and birthing a child.

“Actually, the fetus is recognized as a person in many instances. Just last week, Scott Peterson was convicted of 2nd degree murder for killing Laci's fetus....and that was in the Republik of Kalifornia.” 
The fetus is only recognized as a person if viability can be established. This is nothing new and was reinforced under Roe v Wade. Laci was 8 months pregnant when the crime was committed. The destruction of a non-viable fetus can get you sentenced for conducting a wrongful abortion. 
“To further delute your argument, the government NOW can forcably prevent you from killing yourself ,against your will, so it can be argued that you don't even have full rights to your own body, let alone the fetus'.”
Yeah but abortion wasn’t legalized because women “had a right to their bodies (this is a moral argument)” but because the government doesn’t have a right barring people from certain surgical procedures that effect their lives. But then again no one has ever had full rights in regards to a “right to life.” Even rarely do pro-lifers feel the fetus ever deserves such a right. Even ask the republican governor in the Republik of Kalifornia…he thinks it is a rather silly notion. 
""I disagree. It is her responsibility.""

All people are asking for is a sense of respect and acceptance of how precious life is, espcially a life that can grow into a child, a teenager, an adult, and live a full life. I don't understand why the pro-choice movement can't take their stance in way that is not so disrespectful of life and sound so hateful. There has to be a better way.

Let’s start talking about the woman’s physical/psychological health during pregnancy.

According to pro-life ideology only this 5% is technically pro-life and thus most pro-lifers believe that the fetus’s right to life is conditional…not ever absolute.

Apparently also impervious to fully thought out concepts... but hey - ignorance is bliss, and really conducive to self-centered emotional foundation of a persons self-esteem and world view apparently.
Sperm and Egg carry only half the genetic code of a given indivitual and do not have, in isolation, the ability to create life.
Zygote :[n] the cell resulting from the union of an ovum and a spermatozoon
The demands of a zygote are simple, merely an environment friendly to it's continued existance until implatation (thus a test tube works nicely for fertilization clinics) and further development. Given an environment conducive to its existance, but not to implantation and further growth, it eventually becomes defunct and is reabsorbed or flushed from the body.
Fetus :[n] an unborn or unhatched vertebrate in the later stages of development showing the main recognizable features of the mature animal
The demands of the fetus are dramatically different. It needs not only the environment, but sustenance from the host. Thus once established the fetus does have, innate, demands.
One might argue they are no different than the demands of an intestinal fluke, or heart worm, or any of a myriad of other parasites that require sustenance from a host. One would also have to argue then that the fetus is not a mere parasite. In the case of a true parasite, it merely continues its existance. A fetus on the other hand, evolves into a more advance vertabrate and eventually become a self-suporting being with self-awareness - provided its demands are met.
Technically then, ""the morning after pill"" is a grey area at best, if taken in time it merely prevents a Zygote from moving to the next stage. There is then a stage open for debate (that I would place in the Zygote end of the spectrum) where a Zygote has implanted and is becoming a fetus - still a vaible period of time for ""the pill"" in my book. If taken later, it causes the body to abort a fetus. Can we determine at what point the pill was taken? No. Therefore, IMO, the pill is no different than pennyroyal, or shepard's purse, both emmenogouges that - in proper doses - instigate shedding of the uterine lining. My issue is with the point at which these are taken. At one point you are disposing of a Zygote - a amalgamation of cells that - while they have potential - cannot become a human without implatation (causing additional hormaones to be produced) and further growth to become a fetus. Taken later you are intentionally aborting a fetus that has considerably more potential provided its demands for sustenance are met.
We know, scientifically, at what point a zygote becomes a fetus. This is relatively early in the development process and a considerably short period of time after implantation. So - once the entity has reached fetal status, IMO, you have abrogated the choice of preventing it.
Soooo... back to my original statement: If you choose to have sex, you choose to endure the consequences. Not withstanding Sigma's childlike and emotional understanding of the point, responsibility falls to the mother to NOT abort at the time the fetus exists. There exists a window of likely up to a week after intercourse where many methods may be implemented to ensure a fetus is not allowed. If you have sex, protected or otherwise, you enjoin the responsiblity to have RESPONSIBLE sex. If, for you, that means doing everything possible to prevent pregnancy - do so. But should you become pregnant (viable fetus) you are also responsible for living with that consequence. To do other wise is selfish :) (I looked up the definition...at the point the cells become a fetus it has demands, selfishness is placing those demands - however feeble - above your own.)",180,181,topic_stance_votes_1

I believe the form you are looking for there is ""are enjoined the responsibility"". The way you have used it implies that the woman enjoins someone else.
And what authority enjoins the woman to your definition of responsible sex? The law?
You're right, you have to live with the responsiblity of abortion, if that is what you choose.
Is being selfish illegal now? That would certainly be a large step toward fascism.
So, you have failed to provide anything resembling a compelling argument as to why abortion should not be allowed as a consequence, and have failed to answer the flaws that were pointed out in your previous post. All in all, quite an accomplishment :)",181,182,topic_stance_votes_2
182,Why I'm against abortion...,abortion,attack,"Christ, you people are lost. I have spent seven years doing research in abortion on both sides and I have never read a single account of a single woman having an abortion because her belly would get big. You need a reality dose instead of feeding yourself with these fictional scenarios. No woman has an abortion out of fear of her belly size. Has it ever occurred to you that women take their pregnancies seriously and see them as a life altering events? I think so and I am a male. 
Actual pro-lifers find all abortions unethical. If you are conditionally pro-life then you have no business calling yourself such or speaking on behalf of those who are pro-life. 
This isn’t about “bad causes” but whether abortion is a frivolous right. It isn’t. Abortion rights are nearly viewed as a human right in the world because of how important they are. 
So how many abortions did you have in order to come to the conclusion that it is an easy way out? It isn’t an easy way out. It isn’t easy being faced with an unwanted pregnancy and faced with the decision between childbirth or abortion. It isn’t easy finding someone who performs abortions. It isn’t easy finding a place that can perform them. It isn’t easy finding the money to pay for it. It isn’t easy taking yourself to the clinic when an angry shouting crowd of pro-lifers screaming and threatening you guards the doors. It isn’t easy living with an abortion when you know a good portion of Americans do not support your access. It isn’t easy living in fear questioning whether your family, friends, community and etc. will accept you. Abortion is never an easy way out. In fact it is one of the most difficult choices to make during a pregnancy. 
That isn’t the woman’s responsibility or problem. Her pregnancy isn’t a raw material to be exploited for the sake of childless couples. If pro-lifers really felt these childless couples or individual’s circumstances were critical they would be producing children for them instead of exploiting their unfortunate situation for their agenda. 
Pro-lifers do not have the legality, morality or reality on their side. You people do nothing and are incompetent. For little more then 70 years your side had a chance to prove how effective laws against abortion were here in America but instead you choose to do nothing except sit on your hands. And for 70 years people continued to have abortions. By the 1920s it was America’s “open secret” and statistics show that nearly one in four American women were having abortions. By 1930 it was demanded due to the Great Depression and more women suffered from blotched back alley abortions then any other decade before. By 1940 it was practically legalized for the upper and middle class and twenty years latter did the pro-life movement really rally. But against what? Certainly not over the poor aborted “unborn babies” because there movement was nowhere to be found in the 1920’s “open secret”. Certainly not because women were being hurt by the very criminalized abortion laws they supported…they were nowhere to be found by the 1930s. There wasn’t even a National Right to Life Committee until after 1965! So what were you guys protesting? Legal abortion. Not the legal abortion that was provided to those in the middle and upper class through “therapeutic abortions” in the 1940s and beyond but instead legal abortion that was available to the masses. 
Reality doesn’t support your position because not a single law against abortion has ever proven to be successful. Instead what happens it that abortions go underground, women travel to countries where it is legal, women start to die, the legal system becomes more totalitarian and the pro-life movement is completely AWOL. 
Laws do not support you because the American legal system has never said abortion was murder.
Morality doesn’t support you because your entire argument is either based on a religion that worships a child killing God or you are too busy personifying what a fetus wants based on your own demands instead of the fetus’s. 
And you think appear hateful? The pro-life movement is too busy attacking itself to make a collective effort. You have social republicans condemning pro-life homosexuals to hell and refusing to cooperate with them. You have extremists condemning the moderates and moderates condemning the extremists. You have major pro-life organizations like the American Life League and the National Right to Life Committee that call one another “pro-abortion.” Your side cries how abortion is the “holocaust” but you are too busy attacking each other to do anything about it. 
It is only the pro-choice position that has offered a realistic and moral solution. It is only those who fought for abortion rights that changed things for the better.

You have no leg to stand on to say that women aren't having abortions for the sake of comfort when you have actively lobbied for them to be able to do so.
Then you know very little about the issue of abortion, pro or con. There are people of varying degrees on the stance, on both sides. Some pro-lifers are ok with abortions very early in the pregnancy. Some are ok with them if the life of the mother is in danger or if it is a rape case. Some are not. Just like there are people who say they are pro-choice but are against late term abortions. The fact that you think everyone on either side would think exactly alike shows that you apparently haven't done that much research, after all.
You aren't going to find much sympathy for the hardship of an abortion for convenience. But you are right in that there are sometimes risks and emotional scars from the experience. I wish your movement would do more to educate expecting mothers on the emotional and psychological downfalls of abortion rather than just pitching it as some inane 'us versus them' feminist empowerment. I have read so many accounts of mothers who had abortions and wish they hadn't afterwards, deeply regretting the descision. (And they came to that conclusion on their own, not by any outside influence.) And it's interesting to me that your movement isn't nearly as passionate about making sure mothers know the risks about abortion as they are empowering them to do it. You see, the gig is up. You say you are about the woman and her well-being, but you aren't even about that. 
Oh of course, let's not dare try to see pregnancy as a chance to help someone--even other women! We wouldn't want to actually entertain the idea of other ways to help people, now would we? Or that abortion just might not be the only option? 
You say you are for women and their well-being--but what of women who want to have children but can't? I know such women and they stand by and watch you and your movement do nothing to discourage abortion, painting it as some feminist empowerment issue, all the while they are wishing they could raise some of those children if you would only use your movement to help them as well. The fact that you can't find it in your heart to think of this as an opportunity to help those women who are childless once again shows that you really could care less about women, even though you claim that you do.

I never said there weren’t people who support abortion in conditional circumstances but what I did say is that people who are conditionally pro-life are not pro-life. You can claim that you are but you aren’t. Either way the movement itself will reject you unless they are that desperate for support. 
Okay! Go spouting that kind of logic off to the American Life League and watch how fast they’ll call you pro-abortion. You may think you are pro-life but you are not. 
I am not looking for sympathy from the pro-life movement. To do so would be looking in the wrong direction.
Just like with any life altering sequence but the only difference is that pro-lifers proliferate the social stigma of abortion and hence increasing such a risk. 
Right after you educate expecting mothers about the health risks of childbirth and adoption. 
I am sure they did come to that conclusion after they sought some direction for their blame via pro-lifers. Regardless, I have heard of regret with adoption and childbirth but you will never hear pro-lifers talk about. Pro-lifers only care about what they can exploit from post-abortive women. 
A woman who has an abortion is just about as equally informed about her choice as a woman who is opting to send her baby into adoption or is planning to give birth. The only difference is that pro-lifers demand that women who are planning to have abortions need to have more information that will scare them from having an abortion. They don’t women informed but instead keep them “informed” with research done by their think tanks and junk science over a single procedure.
- Pro-lifers don’t want you to know about childbirth linked breast cancer is far more lethal.
- Pro-lifers don’t want you to know that childbirth is that far psychology trauma are more common then trauma linked to abortion.
- Pro-lifers don’t want you to know that childbirth is far more lethal then abortion. 
- Pro-lifers don’t want you to know anything about psychological trauma to adoption.
Like I said, pro-lifers never cared about women or even about empowering them. Their own movement is rooted in anti-feminism, exploitation and pushing there failed coercion childbirth policy. Where were you guys when women were puncturing and rupturing their bodies with coat hangers? Nowhere. Only the pro-choice movement has reacted and answered to this. 
Pro-lifers haven’t and are perfectly happy with the public health disasters they create. This is why they are bad news to women. 
I don’t recall the pro-choice movement having anything to do with situations outside the reproductive rights anymore then pro-lifers having anything to do with situations outside the issue of fetal rights. 
Don’t be silly. 
Then these women are virtually uneducated. The pro-choice movement has had great success in decreasing the rate of abortions performed. Notice how the most pro-choice leaning countries in the developed world (i.e. those in Western Europe) have the lowest abortion rate in the world. Meanwhile the country with the most restrictive laws against abortion (the United States) has the highest abortion rate in the developed world.

188,Why I'm against abortion...,abortion,attack,"No, ultimately abortion comes back to the ethical question of whether it is right or wrong to kill. You'd like to avoid that question in every case obviously, but you can't. Deal with it. 
Then you are contradicting yourself. The point is that there is no definition of ""conditionally pro-life"" any more than there is a definition of ""conditionally pro-choice."" Pro-life people vary in their stances just like pro-choice and no one is getting kicked out of the movement for it as you seem to think they would. For that matter, there is no more room for diversity of opinion in the pro-choice movement than there is the pro-life one. 
These anti-pro-life statements are downright comical, they are so inaccurate and biased. Your tendency to portray your movement as angelic and then obviously try to demonize the pro-life movement at all costs comes across as ridiculous. I could care less about which movement ""one-ups"" the other--the thing I care most about is saving lives which is why I identify with the pro-life stance. But there is no card-carrying membership plan in the pro-life movement and there is no leadership in the movement. People identify with it depending on their views. Pro-life is an ideology, not a club.
Again, the pro-choice movement has lost touch with women--they are more interesting in bashing other people and than they are giving genuine support for women as your posts have demonstrated. The bottom line is that you are are not pro-women, you are only interested in bashing pro-lifers. And if it were true that the pro-choice movement were all about the needs of women, you would never limit yourself to helping them in the issue of abortion only. You can't claim to be all about women and only 'be for them' in the area of abortion choice. And you would be trying to find ways to help them in all matters related to childbirth and family planning (such as adoption) instead of just helping them get out of pregnancies via abortion. Obviously you don't really care about the women who do want children and would adopt, in a heartbeat, to have one. And again, your tendency to be much more passionate about giving them the right to abortion rather than a balanced approach which would help ALL women with reproductive issues including those not wanting abortions betrays you. This issue is not about which group or organization wins as in some rhetorical ballgame--this isn't a game. This isn't about groups trying to one-up the other or bash the other.

You'll have to do better than feminist bitterness and rage.
Again, your idea that 'pro-life' and 'pro-choice' are soundly defined is ridiculous. There is no step-by-step criteria to be ""pro-life"" or ""pro-choice."" People just identify with the one they feel best describes them. I don't know how many times you have to hear it for it to sink in, but people can be pro-life and and still be for abortion in some cases (such as when the woman's life is in danger and very early in the pregnancy, as I hold to). 
LOL!!! You don't know much about this issue if you think one lobbying organization defines the pro-life movement and could kick out it's members. People can't be kicked out of an ideology. What you are claiming is just as silly as someone saying that Planned Parenthood could kick someone out of the pro-choice movement. Come back to reality.
So? He's still pro-life regardless of what one organization says he is, because that's what he identifies with. No one leads either the pro-life or pro-choice movement.
Everything you offered is mere opinion. You showed no proof of anything you said.
The only ones demonizing the pro-life movement are the ones who hate it and it's members, which includes you.
At one time your movement was unified and would not even consider being open-minded enough to stopping late-term abortions. Now you all can't even agree on that, as many in your movement have found that knee-jerk feminism just doesn't do anyone any good and there is plenty of science that suggests a fetus is viable after about 24 weeks. At least some in your movement have grown a conscience, much to the frustration of stalwarts such as yourself, I'm sure.
And you don't think its a reproductive issue when a woman can't have a baby? Again, you aren't out to help women--if you were you would put just as much effort into making sure women had other 'choices' as well (other than abortion) and you would be just as passionate about helping women who can't have babies as you are to help those who don't want a baby (even though they've already gotten pregnant).
There it is again, opinion with no proof. This is getting to be a serious habit for you.
That's right; that's the difference between your movement and the pro-life one: Pro-lifers don't claim to be ALL about women, but also about the baby as well. The best the pro-choice movement can seem to do is give no respect for the baby's life that could grow into a person, and claim to be for women when in fact they obviously really aren't.

I guess for the pro-life movement, who refuses to discuss these critical situations and subjects, these are sparkling examples of their success. If this is the case then why are you called pro-life if cause so much death and destruction in your wake? 
When the World Health Organization reports that 45% of all abortions in the world come from countries that have criminalized them this isn’t a “conjectural opinion” but a fact. You people are incompetent.
I am not the one becoming bitter and when did I align myself as a feminist? I would strongly recommend you to take a pause before making such a spiteful remark. It apparently you need to cool off.
Remember, not my fault you people cannot get it together. This is your fault. 
My, why are you becoming so hostile and bitter in your comments? Personal attacks are the refuge of someone who is hollow of substance and conviction. Keep it up…you only prove to make my side look good. 
Whether you like it or not there is a set definition for being pro-life and you do not fit it. However this isn’t my problem. You can pretend to be pro-life all you want but in the end you are just another pro-lifer who supports abortion and thinks fetal rights are ridiculous. Your consistency aids me and makes your own movement “ridiculous” because you think they should accept your embracement of abortion. Keep it up because I couldn’t ask for a better opponent. 
I am sure they do…just like there are people who identify themselves with religious movements let do never follow the dogma. You are no different then the millions of Americans who engage in contraception, premarital sex and yet call themselves Catholic. 
You simply amuse me and acknowledge the decay within your own movement. 
And were you actually foolish to think it was just one? The American Life League is a BIG organization and is far more international then NRLC. Many hardliners of the Pro-Life movement like those in the Pro-Life Action League reject him. He isn’t pro-life and approves of Roe v Wade. 
Sure they can. In fact it is people who align themselves with an ideology and never follow it who kick themselves out of it. But this isn’t my problem…I am not going to keep arguing with someone who is aiding my own arguments against the pro-life movement. Keep it up…I encourage you. 
So just as long as someone identifies themselves with something then that is what they are. I suppose a Hindu can claim to be a Christian when it suits them, a capitalist can claim to be a communist when it fits their means and a social democrat can be a social republican when it helps their agenda…however none of the three would follow the beliefs they claim to have. Such a foolish thing you believe in but then again it helps me. 
George W Bush is the first president in American history that I know of who made money off of dead, born children but he is pro-life because that is what he identifies with over what he does. LOL!
So because I didn’t offer any source that means it is pure opinion? Please, if you need a source specifically tell me which one of them you need information for. 
Me hate the pro-life movement? Why hate something that only reinforces my own beliefs? Why hate something that amuses me? Hardly, it is pro-life ideology that should be hated because it is a tool of oppression and destruction. The people behind it are just confused and uninformed. They are innocent.
I don’t recall this historical event ever happening in history…mind to prove it? The pro-choice movement collectively offers a plan to stop it by making first trimester abortions easily available but unfortunately pro-lifers such as you have fought tooth and nail against this by adding more and more restrictions and hence more late-term abortions. Even according to a member of the NRLC, in one of the many issues of Newsweek in 2000 that covered the hot button issues within the presidential race, claimed that they wanted more late-term abortions in order make abortion itself more unpopular. This was their strategy and they have been doing it successfully as studies have proven. http://www.guttmacher.org/media/nr/newsrelease3201.html
Late-term abortions are only a problem in America…in other abortion-liberated countries, where abortion is offered early and accessible, it isn’t a problem and nearly ten times more rare. If pro-lifers would only let us do our job instead of interfering then late-term abortions wouldn’t be such an issue but unfortunately your people choose to make it an issue. Besides, even you favor late-term abortions. 
What knee-jerk feminism? I appreciate you calling us feminism but I think you over use because you do not understand it. 
Grown a conscious over late-term abortions? Hardly…many of either collapsed in by pro-life disinformation or threats. I can understand their position but then again I do not support it simply because late-term abortions have a purpose when needed. I am sure more pro-lifers would agree with the use of late-term abortions before an early one.
Not to our ideology. You have to understand that the pro-choice movement triumphs in a woman’s rights to their ability to control their fertility. For decades upon decades women have been subjected to the coercion policies of reactionaries and sexists. This means the access to contraception and if all else fails then abortion. 
However, adoption is more of an issue with child’s rights activists…not reproduction since the woman is not reproducing and it has nothing to do with controlling it. 
We aren’t helping women? The pro-choice movement has assured that the 1.5 million criminal abortions being performed before Roe v Wade would be performed in sterile climates, inside clinics or hospitals and performed by registered doctors or nurses that would be held accountable for what they did. 
What have you done? Nothing except complain and belly ache about how we do not help women while hundreds of thousands of women die needlessly on your watch. 
How can we put more effort into making sure women have other “choices” when those choices are far easier to attain in the first place? Crisis pregnancy centers outnumber abortion clinics and there are countless couples waiting to adopt. The resources and availability to these areas is very easy and accessible. There are no waiting periods, there are no protesters blocking and harassing them and they can be found in any county here in America. How can pro-choicers make such choices easier and more accessible when they already are? 
It is abortion that is made inaccessible and held in a very unfair level to these choices. You pro-lifers cannot be seriously boo-hooing about us giving choices. You only provide no choices. 
Don’t call the kettle black Mr. Pot. You haven’t offered any yourself.

Nope--no set definition. If there were you would undoubtedly link to it. There is no one ""in change"" of the pro-life movement that could set such a definition.
Why do the members of a religious group or political ideology have to follow everything that you think they should? You have a VERY black and white view of the world. There are plenty of Catholics who don't hold to every Catholic tenet. (John Kerry was one.) But in the case of the pro-life movement, there isn't even a centralized pro-life 'doctrine.' Pro-lifers are united only in their respect for life. Face it, you've lost on this one. Pro-lifers and well as pro-choicers have varying views. That's the nature of people.
This is just ridiculous. By your logic I guess someone who is for tax cuts could be 'kicked out' of that ideology as well. Or someone who was for 'free trade' worldwide. Funny though, I don't know who could kick them out. No one can kick you out of your own thinking. 
Bad analogy--though there are Jewish Christians, and probably Hindu ones as well--who are you to say they can't identify that way? A better analogy would be to say that a Hindu (or Christian, for that matter) might hold to many of the traditional Hindu views, but maybe not all of them.
They don't favor abortions any more than you do--you are using the same false thinking as people who call pro-choice people ""pro-abortion."" And I seriously doubt this is true anyway. It would, of course, seem true to someone determined to see something bad in the pro-life movement even when there was nothing bad to see.
Only in the extremely rare cases where the life of the mother was in definite danger.
You seem to operating under the false understanding that the pro-life movement was around and somehow 'in-charge' when all these supposed countless women were dying. 
I wish it were that simple. The adoption process is in terrible shape in this country. It NEEDS to be reformed badly. The system sometimes keeps kids in place (minority kids anyway) for long periods of time and charges exorbitant amounts of money before adoption can even happen. Right now it is far easier to have an abortion than it is to adopt. That's why I would love to see your side do more for the rights of women this THIS area as well--abortion doesn't have to be the only choice.

If on the other hand, you don't consider a fetus a ""life"" until it squeezes out screaming, then a pro-choice position wouldn't be in conflict with the taking of an innocent life.
Sometimes the world is black and white and to see shades of gray is just an illusion to mask immorality. Calling it closemindedness is just an attempt to deflect a principled stance.
I could care less if holding a woman responsible for her actions disgusts you. Unlike you, I don't think that there should be an easy way out of every situation. Does the concept of responsibility scare you or does the idea of forcing responsibility on someone scare you? 
Criminals are held against their will; I pay too much in taxes against my will; I have to get up early against my will. Grow up, there are plenty of things that are done against one's will. If the woman was a willing participant in having sex than she has a responsibility for the consequences of that decision and pregnancy is one of those potential consequences. Pro-choice people want to say ""it's OK that you acted irresponsibility, we'll just suck the extra life out of you and you can go back to being irresponsible"". The statistics on abortions are very revealing. 
There are many repeat abortions and there are many abortions performed on ""mothers"" who have already given birth to children in the past. I don't believe in abortion as a means of birth control.

I'd say that young kids can have a keen idea of what is right that is unencumbered with grown-up ""spin"".

The gov't having the power to force people to share their organs scares me. The gov't having the power to tell me what I must do with my personal life scares me. Fascist governments scare me.
Sex is not a crime.
That last is not against your will. However, the pro-choice argument is not that no one should do anything that they do not want to do. The pro-choice argument is that women should not be forced into something as personal and life-changing as motherhood. Pregnancy and motherhood is too special, too personal and too life-changing to be something that is entered into because a woman is mandated by law to do so. 
Your argument of ""do the crime, do the time"" is a horrible way of looking at motherhood. Pregnancy and motherhood should not be just a consequence, a punishment or a learning tool. Motherhood should be entered into because a woman wants to have a child, because the woman wants to be pregnant. It should not be a punishment for irresponsible behavor.
No, pro-choice people do not want to say that it's ok to act irresponsibly. Pro-choice people say that pregnancy and motherhood should not be a punishment for irresponsible behavior. Pro-choice people do not want people to act irresponsibly, pro-choice people want women to desire their pregnancies.
I agree, women who do not want any more children should have their tubes tied. I do not want women to use abortion as birth control any more than you. None of that changes the fact that pregnancy and motherhood should not be a punishment for irresponsible behavior.
When I was young I had, as many young people have, conviction that my belief about right and wrong trumped things like compassion and empathy and other ""touchy feely"" things. As I matured, I saw that compassion and empathy were more important than right and wrong. More than that, compassion and empathy became part of my ethics.
People also have pesky things called ""rights"". Whether or not I agree with them.
Like you and the other fellow? It's ok in the case of rape?
When people mature, generally their view of the world changes, as do their morals and ethics. My view on abortion changed when I matured. 
If you wish to call maturing a ""flip flop"", then you're more than welcome to. 
They have a self-centered view of what is right, and they generally lack empathy.
A three year old might ""know"" that it is wrong to hunt, might ""know"" capital punishment is wrong, might ""know"" that the war in iraq is wrong, etc. Generally, three year olds do not know the issues involved.

I tend to agree with you here. Pregnancy should never be a punishment forced on someone. However that is a different issue than women killing the baby growing inside of them. The problem is the mindset of a woman that would think of pregnancy as punishment in the first place. Most pro-lifers I know are mainly concerned about such cases of accidental pregnancy, and the solution to avoiding such awful ""punishment"" is to a.) be more careful in the first place, and b.) have a different outlook on bringing a child into the world to begin with.

It is exactly the same issue! If a woman cannot have an abortion, then she is being forced, by law, to continue the pregnancy. You are contradicting yourself. If you agree with me about the fact that pregnancy shouldn't be forced, then you would not be for making abortion illegal.
That is a wonderful goal. Making abortion illegal will do neither of those things. You will only harm more women. You are right, we have to change societies views until abortions aren't desired, then there will be fewer performed.
That is because you have no empathy. There are as many different situations as there are women to experience them. Sometimes a woman's situation is such that she does not believe she can afford the pregnancy emotionally, mentally, physically or financially. I am all for programs that try and help women with their situations so that they do not feel abortion is their best option, but making their only alternative illegal is flat wrong.
I am ""empowering"" to keep the option legal, to keep the option available. I am not urging women to do it. My goal is for every pregnancy and child to be wanted, and that no abortions are desired or performed. Making it illegal violates women's rights, will not stop them and will harm women.

Are you that blind? That is what this debate is about.

The issue of the legality of abortion pales in significance to the act of abortion itself. Why would pro-choicers spend so much more time worried about the legal issue than they would the issue of abortion itself? If you really want to help curb abortion, you would work toward that.
The point though is that it is rarely ever their only alternative. Certainly not often enough to warrant most of pro-choicers' work to be focused entirely on that one alternative.
You can't separate the two. If you were lobby for the right to allow people to conduct assault and battery, then you would be in favor of assault in battery. Period. If you lobby for the right to do something, you are favoring that action, especially when you aren't working toward making sure other actions are encouraged.
You say that, but what you are doing contradicts it. Lobbying to make it legal to kill means you want people to be able to kill. And again, if the pro-choice movement were working toward discouraging abortion and encouraing other options like adoption, your statement might have merit.
This IS the higher goal--why would you want killing to be the higher goal, after all? For the pro-life movement the debate IS about stopping abortion and that in and of itself helps women and their children. The rights issue is secondary--after all we are talking about saving lives. By choosing to only make your goal a right in what you argue for, you only argue for one option for women.

Whether or not a woman ""should"" get pregnant, the reality is the women do and do not want to remain pregnant. Saying we should change how they think about it is fine and dandy, but you are ignoring reality if you expect making abortion illegal will magically make women want their unwanted pregnancy.
I want to curb the desire for abortion. Making abortion itself illegal will not do that. Making abortion itself illegal also violates women's rights, and rights are not to be casually tossed aside, even to ensure another's survival.
Pro-choicers spend so much time on the legality because the legality is tied into the rights of women to their body. And those are being disregarded by people such as yourself.
...
Lets take this slow. When a woman is pregnant, there are two options: continue or abort. You wish to take away a woman's only alternative. Pro-choice people are fighting to keep an alternative available to women.
Only in your simplistic black-and-white world. Fighting for another's rights is not encouraging them to do something. I do not approve of people owning guns in their homes, but I believe you should have the right (within some limits, such as background checks, etc). Rights exist whether I approve or agree with them or not.
If you have a compelling argument why people should not have a certain right, that's one thing. Just because you disapprove of it or think it is not moral, that's nothing.
:p Your conclusions are laughable.
pfft.
The pro-choice movement is about women having the choice to have an abortion as an alternative to continuing the pregnancy. 
I personally work towards eliminating the desire for abortion by donating to programs that help pregnant women so that they aren't in situations where abortion is their best option.
When did I say killing is the higher goal?
Pro-life movement, I'm assuming you meant ;)
You believe that forcing women to carry a pregnancy and give birth is ""helping them""? Violating women's rights is ""helping""? Oh, I see... you're saving them from themselves, eh? What arrogance you have, assuming that women need you to make decisions for them, under the guise of ""helping them"".
Go on, convince me that making women's rights inferior to what they are carrying is ""helping them"".
No, individual rights are paramount. It is not ok to violate someone's rights, even to ensure the survival of someone else. 
I am for both options, carrying or aborting. You are arguing to make the only alternative to carrying illegal, and I am arguing to stop you.
You have yet to offer any evidence of the truth of that.
However, the pro-choice movement does not ""overlook"" it. That option is legal. If someone was trying to make it illegal, I really believe the same people in the pro-choice movement would fight to keep it legal, the same as it is doing for abortion.

Mr. Justice Harlan once wrote: ""[T]he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution. This `liberty' is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property; the freedom of speech, press, and religion; the right to keep and bear arms; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures; and so on. It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints . . . and which also recognizes, what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must, that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment.""
Justice Potter Stewart, a judge on the Roe v Wade case said in his concurring opinon: ""Several decisions of this Court make clear that freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage and family life is one of the liberties protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. . . . As recently as last Term, in Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.

If the State believes that the fetus, at any stage of development, is a human life, then it has rights distinguishable from those of its mother. If that's the case, then the State can compel the mother to take actions that will prevent injury to the fetus just as the State can remove children from a custodial parent in cases of abuse or neglect. In such an instance, a woman could be prosecuted for murder in the killing of a fetus.

For example, Scott Peterson was found guilty of second degree murder in the death of Laci's fetus.

Regardless, all murder laws are enforced. Abortion isn't considered murder. Again, how in the world do you justify an national ban on abortion, and oppose the Federal gov't involvment in our lives at the same time?
""The Abyss"" rationale was completely fiction. Humans never breathe liquid in the womb. All O2 is transfered through the umbilical cord, the lungs are in a collapsed state (really just a solid mass of tissue) until the first breath is taken outside the womb when they inflate.
Whether we can actually have the transfer of O2 from liquid might happen, but the rationale in the movie (that of ""we did it for 9 months..."") was fiction. This technology won't help a fetus in this form.

What are you talking about? My best friend is a pro-life woman. I know there are women who are pro-life. Why are you telling me this?
So many fallacies in her thinking.
1 - the idea that she, a complete stranger, gets to determine whose health is more important - mom or unborn baby. What if mom already has three kids and she is their only support? Does one unborn baby matter more than four people?
2-Not every pregnant woman will be a mother - or should be (due to number three).
3-Not every woman is a good mother. (or can be)
Tell her to bring it on. It infuriates me that she can't step outside of her own loving world long enough to see that not everyone has one AND that she has the absolute arrogance to get infuriated with women who won't risk their lives for her cause.

284,Why I'm against abortion...,abortion,attack,"I'm sure that's true, and we as a society should find ways to do better with that; but it still doesn't justify abortion.
I'm already in favor of this, and I don't know too many pro-lifers who aren't. The mentality that pro-lifers in general hate women and mothers is just not true.
Would it be an issue if the 'unborn baby' were in fact already born? Probably not. For many pro-lifers, the delemma shouldn't even be there. For a loving mother, she would never look at the situation as a choice among her 3 living children, so why would she do the same if one was unborn? For some reason that one issue of one the children being unborn changes the whole equation for pro-choicers, to the point where suddenly the baby is not a baby, but irrelevant. My wife doesn't think it should be that way and in most cases neither do it. Your response to this has been ""not all women are loving, though."" But that is exactly the point. In my opinion, aborting a baby in most cases IS an very unloving thing to do. That is why pro-lifers are generally against abortion.
Again, you have not shown how this justifies abortion.

Come on now, be honest. You know good and well that is not the reason she gets infuriated with other women.

285,Why I'm against abortion...,abortion,attack,"Would you please pay attention to what is being discussed. Where did I use this as justification for abortion? What exactly was it that I was responding to? hmmm?
You said the pro-life side doesn't demonize women and that pregnant women are always treated with respect - I told you from personal experience that is not necesarily the case when the mother is single.
I never said they did. I said some do demonize women and cited personal experience. I am glad you favor finding ways to help moms. Favor it big time and abortion rates go down. The Clinton years saw an increase in sex education and family planning assistance for women - and abortion went down. The current monkey in cheif is reversing all that and rates are going back up.
You can't protect that baby without her. No law in the world will change that.
What? In the example I cited we are talking about a women risking the her health/life and the livlihood for a pregnancy. Of course it would be different if the child were already born. What kind of lame question is that?
Why is the baby more important than the mother?
Or more than that - why do YOU or YOUR WIFE get to decide that for strangers?
Bacause in few other situations would it have to be. If a pregnancy will change her ability to provide for her children - it's not just some vague notion of having to choose - it is having to choose the life of one child, not yet born, over everyone else.
The life and welfare of myself and my son would not play second fiddle to a child not yet born. (Not that I really need to worry with these hips and my tubes being tied.) I also would not keep a child from rape. Those are the only sitauations in which I would abort.
Being pregnant is vastly different than being a parent. They are not mutually exclusive. 
And just how does a pregnant mother considering her own health different once a child is born? I am aware of no law that demands a parent put their health or life on the line for their child. You can't be forced to run into a burning building, or give up your internal organs, or stop taking medicine you need because of your child, yet you think it ought to be compulsary for pregnant women?
Every living already born person in the life of an unborn person does not take second place to the unborn. You don't know the circumstances of these people. How dare you and your wife judge them? Just who in the hell do you think you are?
And just so I am clear - the paragraphs above are in regard to the example I set - not all abortion.
And you and your wife seem to think that once pregnant a woman is irrelevant along with anyone else in her life. There is nothing but the unborn. Your rage at women considering their own health makes that pretty obvious.
And forcing them to go through a pregnancy they hate will magically make them loving, good mothers? Oh yes, all women just naturally want to be pregnant and mothers - they just may not know it.
Wasn't arguing that. Was arguing against the idea that women can't do this because that's not what good mothers would do. What a good parent would or would not do is pretty irrelevant. Abortion is about pregnancy, not parenting. If a woman isn't looking to be a mother, telling her that an abortion will make her a bad mama is pretty meaningless.
That is their narrow vision then. If they can't see why a woman might be compelled to make the choice, they will never be able to reach her or help her, and they will never be able to alleviate this problem.",285,286,topic_stance_votes_2
286,Why I'm against abortion...,abortion,attack,"Allegations without proof are not real allegations.
Of course not--that is why it is important to help some women realize the worth and joy of the miracle growing inside them.
What you call a ""pregnancy"" is really a life that will grow into a toddler, a teenager (like your son), and an adult.  You can keep trying and reduce it to terms like ""pregnancy"", but that doesn't change the fact that every time an abortion takes place, that life is ended.
Why should a woman view a baby that is about to be born as so much less important than a child already born? 
The point is, the only reason it's a either/or scenario is because the mother considers it so based on the fact that she doesn't view the baby about to be born as important, as if somehow magically it suddenly becomes worthy of her love the minute it leaves her birth canal. It's a child too, just like her others.
The argument that she should abort because she can't afford to raise the extra child is no different than an argument she should kill one of her own children already born for the same reason. Both things are terribly wrong.
Then you don't know the law very well. If a mother lets her child die out of neglect, even if she claims it's for her own health, she can be charged for murder. (as she should be.)
As you know, I didn't say they should.
This is so ridiculous. Why is it that anytime a person thinks for the unborn child and not just the mother, they are accused of something like ""rage at women?"" You are out of control, get a grip.
This is where you are terribly wrong, to draw a dichotomy between the pregnancy (which involves the mother and baby) and parenting (which involves the mother and baby.) Here's the deal: The ONLY substantial difference between a baby a week before birth and after birth is that the baby hasn't exited the birth canal. Oh sure, there's a cord attached and a placenta. But the mother (unless she's giving it up for adoption) still has the responsibility of giving it the nutrients it needs even after birth. 
Try telling an expectant mother who is singing to her unborn baby, avoiding alcohol, even reading aloud to the unborn baby (which many expecting mothers do) that she isn't being a parent. Go ahead, I dare you. Tell her what you told me--that having or killing that baby is not about parenting. What a mother does before the baby is born can't be separated from parenting no matter how much you want it to be. You indicated yourself that some mothers use abortion to get out of parenting (finances, for instance) so you are contradicting yourself.

And you have to realize you can't demand or create that emotional response. There will be women who do the right thingand never find joy in the pregnancy - and have no intention of being a parent to the child that is born. You will also not suceed in demanding a certain emotional response.
Face it - not all broads are born moms. 
I am not going to continue this if you can't bother to actually read what I write.
I have told you that I know it's ending a life. Have you always had this knack for prattling the obvious like a parrot?
First of all I would like to thank you kindly for completely ignoring the fact that I was referring to specifically to a situation where a woman's health and/or life may be at risk - even tho I SPECIFICALLY said that was what I was talking about.
Now with that in mind I will tell you. Sick and dead moms can't love or provide for themselves or their children. Doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that one out. If she is single mother and the sole support for her family and her health is at risk due to a pregnancy - the family needs to come first. If you can't see that - I can't help you and I would have to question if you ever notice all the born people on the planet at all. 
I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE HEALTH / LIFE RISK SCENARIO. Quit twisting what I say out of context - or can't you manage honest debate?
SEE ABOVE. I am talking about her being able to continue to support her family WHILE pregnant. If risks to her health mean she can't then her, the already born kids and the baby inside are not likely to make it. Of course - she may lose her children for being neglectful - as you feel she should per your comments below.
Neglect and purposely putting yourself at risk aren't the same thing.
I am not out of control. You said that it infuriates you and your wife that a pregnant woman would consider her own helath circumstances. Need I shoe you where? Are you now denying that? 
No I am not. Most states will allow you to drop off a newborn with no questions asked (at hospitals/fire station/police station), etc., you can give up a child for adoption, you can lose custody because you are a loser, you can sign away your parental rights, kids get abondonded in my neighborhood all the time. A ten year old boy was left in my friend's brother's back yard in his underwear - his parents did not want him anymore. And let's not even begin on dead beat dads - the number of jails needed to round those losers up would break the American tax payer. Parents walk all the time and nobody has to be a parent. Kids should be wanted and aren't. Especially special needs kids. There are around 100 waiting for adoption just in my county alone at any given time. Most them aren't infants. Kids are hungry, abondonded and abused all the time. We are killing them by the thousands over seas. This world does not need to be littered with more unwanted kids. You aren't gonna turn pregnant women into momies who love by sheer will.
Of course most pregnant ladies are gonna be parents and consider themselves though right away. But pregnancy and parenting are not mutually exclusive - some moms will never pregnant and vice versa.
