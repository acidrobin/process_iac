Arkansas Clinic Offers Free Abortions 
Wed Sep 28, 6:35 AM ET
A doctor has offered to perform free abortions on hurricane evacuees, saying it may be too dangerous for them to wait until they return home.
Despite protests from abortion opponents, Little Rock Family Planning clinic director Dr. Jerry Edwards said he has already performed six free abortions. The clinic usually charges between $525 and $600 for a first-trimester abortion.
""If we didn't provide it now, they would get it later — a late-term abortion that would give greater risk to the mother's health,"" Edwards told KTHV-TV in Little Rock.
Edwards, who runs the only abortion clinic in central Arkansas, was unavailable for further comment Tuesday, a clinic employee told The Associated Press.
Rose Mimms, executive director of Arkansas Right to Life, said Edwards is risking further traumatizing women who have already lost their material belongings. ""This just adds to the devastation these women already have in their lives,"" she said.
But Marvin Schwartz, spokesman for Arkansas-Oklahoma Planned Parenthood, said Edwards is providing women with a needed service.
""The timing of the abortion procedure is, of course, extremely critical. The earlier in the pregnancy, the less critical it is,"" he said.",0,1,topic_stance_votes_2

Now for these stupid stats that are so high level that they reveal nearly nothing. Like there are only 8-10 things that ever go on in somebody's life.
25.5% of women deciding to have an abortion want to postpone childbearing.
Why
21.3% of women cannot afford a baby.
Yes poverty is problem. It can also affect whether you get access to medical care. I nearly was denied. Me and a clever social worker had tell a pack of lies so I could get it. 
Or has your wife been footing all the bills so you are blissfully unaware that pregnancy and children are expensive?
14.1% of women have a relationship issue or their partner does not want a child.
This usually indicates abuse. A pregancy that resulted from violence or will result in more. But who cares if they are safe - I mean they are just women after all.
12.2% of women are too young (their parents or others object to the pregnancy.)
Little girls are physically, mentally, and emotionally ill equipped to deal with pregnancy. Also health risks to underdeveloped girls who became pregnant sky rocket compared to those of adult women.
10.8% of women feel a child will disrupt their education or career.
If a pregnancy were to disrupt mine I would end the pregnancy. See my job keeps me and my born child fed. But then I know - my little fatherless boy being raised by the gay man is probably expendable since he doesn't fit in your Leave it to Beaver world.
7.9% of women want no (more) children.
There are a miriad of reasons to not want kids. And I am dammed tired of the position that anything a woman may want or need in this life is selfish or a mere convenience.

Police Investigate Infant's Death
College Student Discovers Blood In Bathroom ....
UPDATED: 5:48 pm EDT October 4, 2005
OWINGS MILLS, Md. -- A college student led officers Tuesday to the body of her dead newborn girl at the bottom of a storm drain, hours after a roommate reported finding blood in their dorm room and the woman missing, police said.
Police were called to Villa Julie College at about 2:30 a.m. after receiving a call about a missing student, said Sgt. Vickie Warehime, a Baltimore County police spokeswoman. When officers arrived, they found blood in the dorm bathroom and a roommate who was concerned for the safety of the woman.
The 20-year-old student was found at her parents' home in Clinton in Prince George's County at about 8:30 a.m. Police said they spoke to the woman at length, and then she led police to a storm drain about 50 feet from the house, Warehime said. Her parents then took her to a local hospital for a full examination.
It was not clear whether the baby was born alive or stillborn. Authorities said they are still trying to determine how long the baby's body was in the storm drain.
""The investigation into the death of the child is ongoing, pending the results of the autopsy,"" Warehime said.
Baltimore County police planned to work with Prince George's authorities until the autopsy indicates where the child actually died.
""We do believe that the birth of the child took place here in Baltimore County,"" Warehime said. ""As to the condition of the child at birth and where the child actually died, we have to wait for the autopsy results.""
The body was taken to the state medical examiner's office in Baltimore. Police, meanwhile, interviewed students in the dorm and spoke with the woman.
""She has been interviewed,"" Warehime said. ""She's at a local hospital, and the investigation continues.""
Baltimore County police said a roommate of the mother heard what sounded like a crying baby in the bathroom of a dorm room she shared with the mother at the college Monday morning at 6:30 a.m., about 20 hours before she discovered the blood in the same bathroom.
A spokesman for the college referred questions to authorities.",100,101,topic_stance_votes_2
