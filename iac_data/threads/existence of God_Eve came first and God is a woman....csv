EVE'S TALK WITH GOD
""Lord, I have a problem."" God asks, ""What's the problem, Eve?"" ""I know that you created me and provided this beautiful garden and all of these wonderful animals, as well as that hilarious comedic snake, but I'm just not happy."" God replies, ""And why is that Eve?"" ""Lord, I am lonely, and I'm sick to death of apples."" ""Well, Eve, in that case, I have a solution. I shall create a man for you"" ""Man? What is that Lord?"" ""Man is a flawed creature with many bad traits. He'll lie, cheat and be vain; all in all, he'll give you a hard time. But he'll be bigger, faster and will like to hunt and kill things. I'll create him in such a way that he will satisfy your physical needs. He will be witless and will revel in childish things like fighting and kicking a ball about. He won't be as smart as you, so he will also need your advice to think properly."" ""Sounds great,"" says Eve, with ironically raised eyebrows, ""but what's the catch Lord?"" ""Well"" says God... ""you can have him on one condition."" ""And what's that Lord?"" ""As I said, he'll be proud, arrogant and self absorbed, so you'll have to let him believe that I made him first. And it will have to be our little secret......... you know, woman to woman.""

Hmmm, well you got me there, I counted and I got to zero, maybe you should encourage more woman to become preists? It still doesn't prove your point though; just because 0.0005% of the female population have a hard job becoming preists doesn't mean that woman (in general) are being treated as lesser human beings. If you're going to play that game, hmm, lets see, how many men compaired to woman are there of:


* Flight stewards


* Child carers


* Nurses


* Teachers


* Social Carers


* Canteen Staff


* Beauty Theropists


* Hair Dressers


* Wedding planners
Etc etc
Or maybe take for example going shopping, how many male lines of clothes, shoes, cosmetics etc are there compared to womans?
Yeah, I think we men have reason to protest about all this inequality.
I totally don't have anything against woman (just the few that moan all the time), dont get me wrong (I get on better with woman than I do men), but I get tired of the SMALL percentage of woman who still moan etc nowadays.

The Catholic church will argue most earnestly that its exclusion of women from the priesthood does not in fact treat them as 'lesser human beings'. The implacable fact of that exclusion, and its supposed 'justification', say otherwise: inferior status is imposed de facto, even if not de jure.
Now you are clutching at straws. Set aside, for a moment, the abundance of male flight stewards, teachers, nurses, social workers, hairdressers etc. which renders your use of those examples risible. Set aside too the low social status and poor financial rewards associated with the jobs you have listed. You are still ignoring the crucial distinction between professions that few of one sex choose to enter and a vocation that proactively forbids one sex from entering it.

35,Eve came first and God is a woman...,existence of God,attack,"You've got to be joking, you think that those jobs don't pay well (except nurses, teachers and canteen staff)???

And you think that they have a lower social status? That's maybe true for canteen staff but not the rest LOL.
Most of my above quoted female dominated jobs get anywhere in the region of £6.50 - £12 per hour ($12 - $24 per hour). 
And I don't think you'd look down your nose at a Flight stewardess, Teacher, Beauty Theropist etc.
These jobs may not dis-allow men joining them but how many staight men feel comfortable in an environment like this? Not many. Is it easy for a man to join a job which has so much prejudice agaisnt men?
