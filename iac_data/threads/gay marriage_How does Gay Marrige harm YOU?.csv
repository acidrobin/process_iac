0,How does Gay Marrige harm YOU?,gay marriage,support,"I want to know how gay marrige harms heterosexuals. And I want some solid evidence. I don't care what your moral, or religious beliefs are, because that is irrelevant. I don't care about your personal opinion about gays. I want to know EXACTLY how you are harmed, and I want it backed up. Doing the electric slide around logic by using arguments like ""if we allow gays to marry, then whats to say that we won't let people marry dogs?"". Well, that logic could be applied to any law. In fact, why let anyone have rights at all? And if you're going to throw around statements like ""marrige is between 1 man and 1 woman"", then I want to see evidence of this. I can't see any anywhere.
So again, where is your solid, logical evidence for your views?",0,1,topic_stance_votes_1

3,How does Gay Marrige harm YOU?,gay marriage,attack,"They can ""marry"" whomever they love. Benefits though, are a different matter. The state and society views marriage as an opposite-sex institution. It's not about anyone getting harmed; no one said it was.",3,4,topic_stance_votes_2

5,How does Gay Marrige harm YOU?,gay marriage,attack,Of course they have been. They are following the Bible which says homosexuality is a sin.,5,6,topic_stance_votes_2
6,How does Gay Marrige harm YOU?,gay marriage,attack,"Then banning same-sex marrige would be wrong, and there would be no reason for it. Unless it harms someone, a law should never be passed. If no one is getting harmed, then what is the point of the law. That is the point of all laws, and you can't abuse a majority power by forcing minorities to abide by your own morals with no base for them, just because you can. And marrige is between two human beings who love each other. Their race, sex, or religious beliefs shouldn't matter. The whole ""opposite sex"" thing was just fabricated by conservatives. Its only when the progressives and liberals came into power when this dogma was questioned.",4,7,topic_stance_votes_1

9,How does Gay Marrige harm YOU?,gay marriage,attack,"A law baning same-sex marriage, then I'd agree. But the reason same-sex marriage doesn't exist (other than Mass.) is not because of law; after all, there are plenty of states that don't have same-sex marriage with no law that outlaws it. You're barking up the wrong tree--this is a cultural issue more than a legal one.",7,10,topic_stance_votes_2
10,How does Gay Marrige harm YOU?,gay marriage,attack,What the Bible says sure as well better be irrelevant in the writing of our laws. Our government was designed to be separate from religion to protect all who would worship. Our laws need solid secular reasoning or we become a theocratic state.,6,11,topic_stance_votes_1

12,How does Gay Marrige harm YOU?,gay marriage,attack,"You're right, I worded that wrong. I meant that it should not be banned. 
If it is our culture to deny some rights to some sentient, human, American citizens, but give them to another, then we live in a twisted society. Gay marrige will eventually be legalized, I know that. The Nazis and the KKK eventually fell, so will this. Most people stop condoning discrimination eventually, however my goal is to speed up the process of moving forward.
And for all you bible thumpers out there, let me remind you that the KKK was a Christian organization.",10,13,topic_stance_votes_1

15,How does Gay Marrige harm YOU?,gay marriage,attack,BUt it comes down to gay people being harmed by not being allowed to marry. Any time a group is excluded because of someone elses religious beliefs that group is harmed.,4,16,topic_stance_votes_1
16,How does Gay Marrige harm YOU?,gay marriage,attack,"Marrige shouldn't be about benefits. I think a lot of people look upon an actual ceremony as a celebration. Why should we deny them that? It's something special, and a lot of people think of it as the happiest day of their lives. I don't think it has anything to do with ""I'm spending the rest of my life with you"", because that happens anyway. I think it's just about the celebration, and the joy that comes with it.
Also, if what you say is true, and they can just ""marry"" without the celebration, what's the point in banning it? They're getting ""married"" anyway, right?",4,17,topic_stance_votes_1
17,How does Gay Marrige harm YOU?,gay marriage,support,"Unfortunately, the only reason people have any issue with the subject is because of their religious beliefs. If it were not so, there would be no discussion upon the subject. I don't think you can really ask this of people and expect it to make sense. Yeah, a lot of people are harmed, but mostly because of religion and moral beliefs. Without these beliefs there would be no opposition to gay marriges. Ugly, but true.",1,18,topic_stance_votes_1

22,How does Gay Marrige harm YOU?,gay marriage,attack,Of course not. Unless you do not believe people other than yourself have any rights. And of course if you do not believe in democracy when it (in your view) adversely affects you to some small degree,22,23,topic_stance_votes_2
23,How does Gay Marrige harm YOU?,gay marriage,attack,Then again if I suffer damages because of someone elses actions then I am entitled to sue for damages. Unless of course you do not believe in the concept of holding people accountable when they harm others.,23,24,topic_stance_votes_1
24,How does Gay Marrige harm YOU?,gay marriage,attack,"Of course, but if it is the law of the land (and merely because some one is lobbying does not cause you to suffer damages) then tough you live with it",24,25,topic_stance_votes_2
25,How does Gay Marrige harm YOU?,gay marriage,attack,"This is a good question. I think government should get out of the ""mariage"" thing all together but that is another story. Given that government HAS interjected itself into marriage already, the obvious problems would be economic. Now, suddenly, business will be required to include benefits for people that they had not previously included (in order to be fair). Doing so greatly increases the cost of doing business which will ultimately greatly increase the cost of my purchases. Also, in the social service industry which is heavily funded through government contracts, there will be increases to the costs of those services which will likely increase my taxes. So I will take home less and pay more for the stuff I need.
I do not think it is a slippery slope to consider where such legislation will lead? Clearly men and women ""fit"" biologically for procreation. Clearly homosexual behavior does not ""fit"" biologically speaking. It is irrelevant if it is morally wrong or right. To encourage such things (and I distinguish encourage from simply condoning or accepting) is a dangerous ground to tread. You are correct that many laws have already gone down that path but that does not mean they are good. It is one thing to legislate to protect rights that are ""inherent"" to the individual. It is another thing to change the definition of what is inherent. Not that we should not do that from time to time; abolition of slavery is a good example of when we changed that and its economic consequences were indeed severe, but we must carefully weigh each item for discussion. The abolition of slavery, in part, led to a massive war. The cost was very high. Is this something that really is worth such a cost.
I personally do not know. I do know people who are gay, and I like them very much. I know some who do not support gay marriage and some who do.
I have no real conclusion. Just observation.

27,How does Gay Marrige harm YOU?,gay marriage,attack,I don't buy your argument. People sue others for damages all the time. If company x does something that harms someone then they are sued.

I truly believe that ye should be able to love who ye will and pass your estate to whoever ye will. That being said, what money will ye lose if ye have a last will and testament that assigns these assets? You can presently name whoever ye will as beneficiary for your life insurance and death benefits. Ye can establish a power of attorney to establish who makes medical and estate decisions in your absence. These things are all done prudently outside the bonds of marriage whether ye marry a man, woman, or tree.

43,How does Gay Marrige harm YOU?,gay marriage,attack,"Look, what we want is simple. We want our relationships accorded the same respect as heterosexuals are automatically given when they marry.
You, as a heterosexual, are free to marry the person you love with your whole heart. Of course, as a heterosexual, the person whom you love with your whole heart will be someone of the opposite sex. That marriage will be recognized in every state and will be accorded the respect due to a union sanctioned by the state. 
If your wife (I'm assuming you're a guy) was in the hospital anywhere in the country, all you'd have to say is ""she's my wife"" to gain access. You wouldn't have to pull out paperwork proving that you have the right to see the person on the other side of that ICU door, nor would you find yourself in a state that refuses to acknowledge that paperwork.
If your wife dies without a will, you won't have to fight off her surviving relatives should they decide that they don't like you and want to inherit everything of hers. If you're married, it's automatically assumed that everything goes to the spouse unless stated otherwise in a will. If you're not, it's automatically assumed that everything goes to the next closest of kin. 
If your wife had children before you married, and those children have lived with you for some time since you've been married, if something happened to your wife it would be assumed the children would stay with you.
What do you suppose would happen to my child (living with me and my ""Domestic Partner"") if something were to happen to me? If my son wanted to remain living here with my partner and continuing to attend school here, do you think the judge would let him stay? I don't. It wouldn't matter what my son wanted or what I have in my will. The child's biological mother lives in Indiana, so that's where any legal decisions would be made.
The only way to keep the states from discriminating against us is to have the 14th amendment finally taken seriously and same sex marriage federally recognized.
You have the privilege of having your relationship recognized in every state in the Union, and immunity from having your children taken away from you or being kicked out of the house if your wife dies.
