7,Spain on the brink of passing law to allow gay marriage,gay marriage,support,"Don't know if you've read this before already, but the interpretations of the Hebrew texts for Genesis Ch 19 have been seen buy many to have been deliberately mistranslated by the homophobic church leaders back in the day.
Two examples:Gen 19:4 often translated as - 'the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the poeple from every quarter'.
However, the Hebrew word transliterated as ""anshei"" was translated above as 'men', when it is ambiguous and can refer to people, including women and children. This seems to have been an attempt to make the mob all-male.
The second is the next verse Gen 19:5 often translated as 'They called to Lot, 'Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them.' 
Here the Hebrew word transliterated as ""ya,da"" is translated as 'to have sex', when it is ambiguos and can mean 'to know'.
Now considering that we already have a description earlier in Genesis as 'a tiny fortress in the barren wasteland south of the Dead Sea. The only strangers the people of Sodom ever saw were enemy tribes who wanted to destroyand take over their valuable fortress and the trade routes it protected', doesn't it seeem more likely that if some strangers appeared in Sodom, the entire town, not just the men, would want to know who they were (in case they were hostile - as many of the strangers in Sodom were) than to gang rape them?

Early Hebrew scholars seized on the opportunity to teach a lesson on the importance of generosity to the poor and of hospitality to visitors and made up a story about angels and rude rich people. Generations of bigots, ignoring the message about selfish wealth, have reduced the story to a statement on homosexuality. 
If god had a real problem with homosexuals, he'd have wiped much of the Mediterranean clear of all life. It strikes me that his letting the Greeks, Egyptians, Romans, and others flourish for millennia swamps one little bitty earthquake in the grand scheme of things.

25,Spain on the brink of passing law to allow gay marriage,gay marriage,support,"UK Civil Partnerships are not identical to marriage. There are a few small differences (and a heck of a lot more pages for the law books) because CPs are an entirely new entity. Most of the differences are minor, though I, and quite a few gay people in the UK, find one particularly insulting. CPs CANNOT have any religious component. Unlike heterosexual marriages which can be ""completed"" in a church by having someone ""proclaim"" them, CPs take effect upon the second signature, have no ""proclamation"" requirement, and cannot be ""performed"" in a church (though I guess nothing stops people from signing a document in a church).
It's a sop to the religious right and has quite a few religious folks angry that the government is seeking to dictate what can and cannot happen in a church.

83,Spain on the brink of passing law to allow gay marriage,gay marriage,attack,"Welcome to the United States of America, where, if the people have anything to say about it, RELIGION DOES NOT MAKE UP THE LAW! 
Also, to catch you up to speed, we've already established the fact that ""marriage"" is a Government institution, not a religious institution. So, let's not have to rehash that for you now. 
Just in case I've missed something, I will also remind you that ""human civilization continues to defile itself by doing such things"" would also include divorce, murder, theft, rape...etc. Are you attempting to say that those issues are somehow a lesser of a problem than homosexuality (or for you ""gay sex"")? 
I seriously doubt it. 
Mainly because the issues I listed all create victims, show me the victims of a concentual, committed homosexual union? I don't think you can. 
I will also refer you to WMS's post #716, in the thread entitled ""Let's Make a Deal."" where he reprints actual church cerimonial rites given to same sex unions. For your further education, these rites are VERY old. So, I'm not talking ""modern"" stuff here. 
So, now that you have been brought up to speed. Your religious feelings about homosexual love, or since you seem to have such a problem with that term...GAY SEX and GAY UNIONS, really don't have much to stand on as far as laws go.
Oh, and before I forget, your ettimology of the word ""HOMOSEXUAL"" is also not correct, well not completely anyway.
Yes, it stems from the word: Homo, meaning same.
But the later part is still: SEXUAL, not sex. The extended meaning of the word: ""Of, relating to, involving, or characteristic of sex, sexuality, the sexes, or the sex organs and their functions. 
Implying or symbolizing erotic desires or activity. 
Relating to, produced by, or involving reproduction characterized by the union of male and female gametes: sexual reproduction."" 
So, if we were to apply your definition to the word ""Homosexual"" one would have to call you Oedipus..and I really hate to tell you, but sexual contact with a member of your immediate family is known as INCEST.
Eeeewwww...
No, homosexual does NOT mean simply ""liking"" or having platonic affection towards someone of the same gender.
ho·mo·sex·u·al (hm-sksh-l, -m-)
adj.  
Of, relating to, or having a sexual orientation to persons of the same sex.
n.  
A homosexual person; a gay man or a lesbian.",65,84,topic_stance_votes_1
