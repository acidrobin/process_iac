1,I want a gun,gun control,attack,you aren't entitled to all the rights of an adult/citizen. Isn't there a law that says you have to be 18 to vote etc...same stuff I guess,1,2,topic_stance_votes_2
2,I want a gun,gun control,support,"Constitutional rights don't fully apply until you are of a legal age. This is why your parents can tell you what you can/can't do and so on. Besides, you can legally own a firearm, just have your parents buy it for you as a gift. Nothing in federal law says there is an age limit on owning a rifle, just purchasing them from a licensed dealer. Juveniles can possess handguns as well by federal law, just under strict circumstances.",2,3,topic_stance_votes_2

You can get a cap and ball revolver via mail order LEGALLY.",1,4,topic_stance_votes_2

5,I want a gun,gun control,attack,"Full rights only come to full citizens. Your legal status is called an 'infant' and legally you are basically regarded as not able to make decisions in your best interest until age 18. You don't have the full right to own property, make contracts, vote, and express your opinion. 
There are other non-full citizens. They are felons and the insane. It is pretty obvious why those two classes don't have rights and we can do what we want to them. In the same breath as a non-full citizen you don't get to choose what you want to do or what rights you get.",1,6,topic_stance_votes_2

My sons have owned their own guns since they were 11 years old. Of course I bought them, but I bought their shoes, too.
Maybe my mind ain't right on this one. emoticonXFrazzled",7,9,topic_stance_votes_2
9,I want a gun,gun control,attack,"Explain that one to the thread starter. He claims he is the victim of age discrimination when he states ""I am a person 15 years of age and I want my gun, yet I can't get one. Why not?""",9,10,topic_stance_votes_1

Are you zachvac? 
Why can't you have a gun? Who told you such nonsense?",10,11,topic_stance_votes_2
11,I want a gun,gun control,support,"You don't need an FFL to transfer an out of state ""antique"" firearm. I believe it is also OK for a minor to purchase and own an antique firearm. In addition, I believe the NFA doesn't apply to antique firearms. (Am I correct on that last one?)
So, zachvac can mail order a double barreled shotgun, saw the barrels short, and attach a pistol grip, legally.",11,12,topic_stance_votes_2
12,I want a gun,gun control,support,"Yes and no. Most NON CARTRIGE black powder weapons are not regulated at all. You may do whatever you wish with them. The NFA does not apply.
An interesting side note, there is a local guy here who carries a black powder pistol (wheel gun) for protection since concealed carry is theoretically illegal in kansas (though you can get a permit if you know the right people :) ). He loads it with modern powder (smokeless), though. In kansas, this is not a problem. I do not know about other states,",12,13,topic_stance_votes_2
13,I want a gun,gun control,attack,"to CCR1994, I guess I should have put smilees in, I don't really want a gun. Basically I was saying how there were logical restrictions on Constitutional rights (but now I'm scared that a kid my age can legally own a gun) and background checks and such aren't that bad when getting a gun. Many people have claimed that because of the 5th ammendment we should be able to go into our local store and just grab a gun and take it home with no check.",13,14,topic_stance_votes_1
14,I want a gun,gun control,support,I think in my state it is considered a deadly weapon still.,13,15,topic_stance_votes_2
15,I want a gun,gun control,attack,"Don’t believe it, Zachvac:
“Any statement given freely and voluntarily without any compelling influences is, of course, admissible in evidence. . . . Volunteered statements of any kind are not barred by the Fifth Amendment.” Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 478 (1966)
The Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination prohibits your being compelled to give testimonial evidence against yourself. (Like the baseball players who were compelled by subpoena to appear and testify before Congress). The right has absolutely no application to firearms transaction forms. When you go purchase a gun no one forces you to fill out the forms. Oh, you can’t walk out with the gun unless you do, but it is your choice whether to buy the gun or not. You can always refuse to fill out the forms and walk away without a gun. To argue otherwise would permit convicted felons to claim they have a right to use a fake ID to get around the background check (which is currently a felony offense punished by up to 10 years in VA), since using their real name would compel them to incriminate themselves. Thankfully, no court has yet succumbed to such illogic.
The right recognized in the Second Amendment is no more absolute that the “right of the people” in the 1st. and 4th. Amendments. None of these rights are absolute, and they are all subject to some rational limitation (like the ban on possession by convicted felons).",14,16,topic_stance_votes_2
16,I want a gun,gun control,support,"The argument I have heard the most regarding background checks has nothing to do with the 5th amendment. The argument is simply that if the second amendment is an individual right, requiring a permit to exercise that right should be illegal. Personally, I am inclined to agree for a couple of reasons. The first is that a rigth basically means ""no permission required"". If you must gain permission first, it is a privelage, not a right.
My second argument against background checks is the fact that we ahev had them for several years now, and there has not been one single study which suggests that they are doing any good. We spend hundreds of millions of dollars per year on the brady bill, for no observable effect. 
That is just stupid.",16,17,topic_stance_votes_2
17,I want a gun,gun control,support,"Emotion always produces government intervention because it happens to be politically viable. Brady in his wheelchair was a politician's windfall and they jumped on that bandwagon. Now we're saddled with hundreds of millions of dollars in background checks, plus personal fees for each check, that produce nothing tangible. Like every bureaucracy, it'll just keep expanding and suck up even more tax dollars. We're always very stupid when emotion enters the picture and triumphs over rationality.",17,18,topic_stance_votes_2
18,I want a gun,gun control,support,"My goodness, we are in agreement.",18,19,topic_stance_votes_2
19,I want a gun,gun control,support,"I agree with what you said George. I just want to add that if the assassin had been using a real gun, not a cheap POS ""Saturday Night Special"", Brady wouldn't be around to cry his little heart out about gun control.",19,20,topic_stance_votes_2
20,I want a gun,gun control,attack,"I am sorry, I didn't mean 5th, I meant the 2nd, the right to bear arms. Sorry for the confusion.",16,21,topic_stance_votes_1
21,I want a gun,gun control,attack,"No problem, Zachvac. I have actually heard someone argue that a requirement of filling out a firearms transaction form forces convicted felons to incriminate themselves when they go buy a gun (by an attorney, no less, which once again proves that lack of intelligence is no bar to success in the profession). 
I believe that the entire “collective right” theory is a sham. I believe that some of my gun control friends know in their hearts they are unable to debunk the overwhelming historical evidence which proves the Second Amendment was intended to recognize an individual right. I believe the reason why they are unwilling to admit that the right is individual is because they fear doing so will unleash a torrent of litigation that will abolish every law which regulates the possession of firearms. I want to again say that recognition of an individual RKBA will not have this doomsday effect. There are laws, like the ban on possession by felons, which will justly survive an individual right interpretation. I just wish I could get some of my more ardent (and unabashedly liberal) civil libertarian friends to give the Second Amendment a fair shake. They will rant and rave all day long about governmental abuse of other civil liberties. Yet, whenever the RKBA is mentioned, these staunch defenders of constitutional liberty will blanch and fall silent. Such conduct in my opinion reflects the triumph of the dictates of political correctness over reason.
Well, I for one do not believe that the Second Amendment should be treated like it is the red headed step child of the Constitution—that it must be kept locked up in the restrictive basement which some legislators reserve to bury rights they disagree with or for hiding those which they fear may frighten the more enlightened guest who visits us from overseas; where they know that another government’s long deprivation of the RKBA has caused its more timid subjects to become accustomed to its absence. So, my gun control friends, I say the time has come. It’s time to let her come out of the windowless basement you have sought to regulate her to and let her enjoy the sunlight we reserve for all our constitutional liberties. It’s time to stop the Orwellian double-think you force yourselves to engage in when you seek to cut and paste the Second Amendment out of our body of liberties. It’s time to recognize the reality that the right is individual and move on to discuss what restrictions should or would survive a constitutional challenge. In doing so you have nothing to fear but fear itself.

""We are reduced to the alternative of choosing an unconditional submission to the tyranny of irritated ministers, or resistance by force. The latter is our choice. We have counted the cost of this contest, and find nothing so dreadful as voluntary slavery. Honor, justice, and humanity, forbid us tamely to surrender that freedom which we received from our gallant ancestors, and which our innocent posterity have a right to receive from us. We cannot endure the infamy and guilt of resigning succeeding generations to that wretchedness which inevitably awaits them, if we basely entail hereditary bondage upon them.
Our cause is Just. Our Union is Perfect. Our internal resources are great, and, if necessary, foreign assistance is undoubtedly attainable….With hearts fortified with these animating reflections, we most solemnly, before God and the world, declare, that, exerting the utmost energy of those powers, which our beneficent Creator hath graciously bestowed upon us, the arms we have been compelled by our enemies to assume, we will, in defiance of every hazard, with unabating firmness and perseverence, employ for the preservation of our liberties; being with one mind resolved to die freemen rather than to live slaves.
We fight not for glory or for conquest. We exhibit to mankind the remarkable spectacle of a people attacked by unprovoked enemies, without any imputation or even suspicion of offence. They boast of their privileges and civilization, and yet proffer no milder conditions than servitude or death.
In our own native land, in defense of the freedom that is our birthright, and which we ever enjoyed till the late violation of it - for the protection of our property, acquired solely by the honest industry of our fore-fathers and ourselves, against violence actually offered, we have taken up arms. We shall lay them down when hostilities shall cease on the part of the aggressors, and all danger of their being renewed shall be removed, and not before.""
