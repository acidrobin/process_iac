0,Early Gay Rights/Polygamy Connection,gay marriage,support,"When the similarities in arguments of polygamy and gay marriage are pointed out here, as well as the way they analogize one another, the response by those who would prefer gay marriage being a topic uncompared to these things is that polygamy should be argued completely separately, and that the two issues should never cross paths.
Interestingly, while looking something up for a debate in another thread, I discovered that the first official gay rights platform (Gay Rights Platform of 1972) signed by over 200 gay rights leaders at the time, did call for legalization of . . . you guessed it, polygamy. It seems even the 'pioneers' of the gay rights movement had the sense to know that if marriage was going to truly be an institution of equality, and if gay people were going to use the ""equality"" mantra in their arguments, they had to note that the problem with marriage wasn't that it was anti-gay, but that it inherenetly wasn't an equality-based institution. They knew that these two issues didn't need to be argued separately.

Yet we've shown that we can have opposite-sex marriage without having everything else, haven't we? And there is no logical reason to believe that opposite-sex marriage is any less like polygamy than same-sex marriage, is there? So it appears to me that evidence is on the side of those who claim that same-sex marriage does not mandate polygamous marriage.
Further, even though being associated with polygamy is not a bad thing, such an association tends to make people forget that there are reasons to deny polygamous marriage which do not apply to same-sex marriage. So all a person has to do is say, ""I know polygamy's wrong, so same-sex marriage must be wrong too.""

That is a logically valid point, and it accurately describes one of the benefits of incestuous marriage. However, incestuous marriage also has a lot of good reasons that we should disallow it as well. We've got to weigh the benefits of incestuous marriage against the harms, and we have to see which one comes out on top.
Certainly the arguments of freedom and equality apply as equally to same-sex marriage as they do to incestuous marriage, but foundation of the debate is the harms incestuous marriage creates. Those harms are not present in same-sex marriage.
In the case of polygamous marriage, I'm not so certain that claims of inequality or no freedom can be made. Polygamists are as able to use the benefits of marriage as anyone else is, they just can't extend those benefits to everyone in their relationship.
