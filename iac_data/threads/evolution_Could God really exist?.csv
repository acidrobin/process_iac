4,Could God really exist?,evolution,attack,"I'm going to give an Anglican answer: I don't really know. :p
However, it's worth remembering that unhappiness is relative, and doesn't always have a real cause. In my experience when we are unhappy is when we come to rely on God, and hence draw closer to him (the old poem, ""Footprints"", gives some idea what I mean), so maybe that is part of the purpose. Unhappiness can also inspire great acts of compassion.",4,5,topic_stance_votes_1
5,Could God really exist?,evolution,support,"Firstly, you have to start thinking on the epic scale of the omnipotent being (i.e spanning the full extent of the universe, as well as those that might precede and survive it) something that seems to cause the suffering of several billion people might lead to creation of something that will benefit countless billions upon billions. What we might consider benevolent now, might not be in the grand scheme of things.
Now with regards to the omnipotent thing, you need to firstly clarify what sort of omnipotence you are talking about, whether we have a being who can do anything that is possible (which might boil down to a human) or something that can make four sided triangles.
Assuming we are talking near-true omnipotence, we suddenly encounter a being that can end itself and the entirity of creation. This deity might have a philosophical problem with making a perfect world - as such a universe would be without purpose, in just existing to exist it renders any good pointless. The deity then has to decide whether it would prefer a universe where more good than bad happens and whether it is willing to consider an ammoral universe as 'good' (i.e does a universe need more good than bad to be 'good', or is an equal balance acceptable). Is a life of suffering better or worse than oblivion? 
On top of this, just because a entity is benevolent and omnipotent does't mean it knows how to use its own powers. It might be omniscient with regards to its created universe but as it exists outside the universe it might have no idea what it has to do to create total perfection (if it even knows what it is).
The set of three god powers aren't exactly defined. Will an all good deity settle for balance or neutrality? Can an all powerful being break its own rules? Doesn't the all knowing entity need to be truely omnipotent or is otherwise going to be unaware of everything that holds its own information.
They are nice words, but pretty much all are logical impossibilities anyway (seeing as 'good' is completely subjective).",5,6,topic_stance_votes_1

15,Could God really exist?,evolution,attack,"Where in my quote are the words ""purely subjective""? I said personal experience. David Hume showed in the late 1700s that all evidence is personal experience: what we see, hear, touch, smell, taste and feel emotionally. No one since has contradicted him. Notice that 5 of those are what we call ""objective"". That is, what our 5 senses convey to us are experience of objects outside of ourselves. 
Now, there is a subset of personal experience called ""intersubjective"". This is evidence that is essentially the same to anyone and everyone under approximately the same circumstances. It is this limited subset of personal experience that science confines itself to.
BUT, that does not mean personal experience is not valid. If the larger set was completely invalid, then the subset could not be valid.
Since you obviously lack your own personal experience of deity, you can't ""know"" that the personal experience is valid. Equally, you can't ""know"" that your lack of experience is not wishful thinking on your own part. After all, deity could be trying to communicate with you, but you dismiss it as ""that bit of beef I had for dinner last night"".
Why would we consider the experience of others of deity to be valid? Because people who have reported this experience are level-headed, skeptical, and completely trustworthy in other aspects of their lives. After all, Theodosius Dobzhansky is one of the founders of the Modern Synthesis. His scientific work is universally admired. Why would we think that he would apply any less critical thinking skills to his personal experiences? Thomas Aquinas is known for his writings on the logical arguments for the existence of God. Those writings are still admired today. Aquinas demonstrated skepticism and critical thinking (he found many of the logical flaws with the arguments). But after he had done all this, Aquinas reported that he had experienced contact with deity that blew all those arguments away. Are we to use special pleading and say Aquinas abandoned all the skepticism and critical thinking skills we had already seen him demonstrate?
This is not meant to convert you. And I'm not going to get into Apologetics here. Remain atheistic, by all means. Instead, I am simply pointing out that the ""evidence"" for the existence of God is not confined to the Bible nor the circular reasoning evidenced in Hi_Its_Me's signature. Hi_Its_Me has made a mistake about the basis of theism. I'm engaged in pointing out that mistake.
I'm engaged in discussing your idea of ""purely subjective"" because dismissing personal experience as valid evidence seriously undermines science.
""Where have we arrived at the end of seven chapters? Joseph Ford has said: 'More than most, [scientists] are content to live with unanswered questions.' (3). One of the questions science hasn't answered and may never be able to answer - let none of us assume otherwise - is whether there is a God. We have not been able to say that it requires double-think or other intellectual dishonesty to have great faith in science as we know it at the end of the twentieth century and also to believe in God - even a personal and intervening God.
But why should anyone think such a combination of faiths might be necessary, or indispensable on a quest for fundamental truth? There are two reasons for thinking it might be. One would be to have first-hand, experiential evidence of God which was personally convincing. The second is because to dismiss belief in God summarily is to pass premature and unwarranted judgement on the sanity, honesty, and intelligence of a vast number of our fellow human beings who claim to have such experiential evidence, many of them the same persons we do trust implicitly when it comes to other matters. It ill becomes any of us to take the attitude that all evidence for God is false evidence, beneath consideration, simply by virtue of its being evidence for God, or even by virtue of its being outside the purview of science. Such attitudes are taken, sometimes in the name of science, but in truth this sort of attitude is intellectual dishonesty. Our most reputable scientists, whatever sins of arrogance that may occasionally commit, do not really declare that what they don't know isn't knowledge or that what they haven't experienced isn't experience.""

17,Could God really exist?,evolution,attack,"In other words, you had some experiances, but nothing that you could show anybody else.",16,18,topic_stance_votes_2
18,Could God really exist?,evolution,attack,"You can't dismiss the evidence that way. A couple of years ago Serbian guards were being tried for extensive rape of women prisoners of war. There was nothing the women could show anyone else. They had their experiences of rape, but there was no intersubjective evidence to show for it. By the time the charges were brought, the bruises were all gone as was the rest of the physical evidence.
If we apply your criteria that experiences that you can't show anyone else can't convince anyone, those women had no chance of justice. Fortunately for them, the criteria is flawed.
Or take another example: the stories of the paratroopers in Easy Company, 501st Parachute Infantry in Band of Brothers. For most of the actions, there is no evidence they can show anyone else. Should we not believe them when they tell us those experiences happened? 
You have already decided that you won't accept any of the testimony as valid. Why not? You can't say that it is because it is evidence of God. That would be circular reasoning and intellectually dishonest. 
When you find the valid answer to that question, you will also find what I consider the only rational justification for atheism. But your dismissal of personal experience that can't be shown to anyone else is not it.
BTW, here is another example of personal experience that is really subjective. It all happens in the patients' minds. Nothing physical involved. Yet we believe it enough to make recommendations that sometimes foot amputation should be performed!
N Honkamp, A Amendola, S Hurwitz, CL Saltzman, Retrospective review of eighteen patients who underwent transtibial amputation for intractable pain. J. Bone Joint Surg. 83-A 1479-1483, Oct. 2001.",18,19,topic_stance_votes_1
19,Could God really exist?,evolution,attack,"Yes, I can. You see, when it comes to physical rape, that is a physical action, and it leaves forensic evidence behind. You can point to scares, you can point to other people seeing it. There is more to than 'he said, she said'.
Poriest nonsense. YOu see, the stories about the paratroopers are something that can happen in the physical world, we can reproduce those experiances. 
They might be extrodinary in some respects, but nothing that is outside of being reproduced by others. We also have records of their training, we can objectively observe their training. Their experiances are consistant with their job and their training.
Your personal experiances is nothing that you can show me. In this case, you can not show me physical evidence that your experiances of 'God' are merely your interpretation of a state your brain went through. A young woman I know hears voices all the time. She attributes them to being spirits. 
I attribute it to probable schitzophrenia. Just because she thinks she sees/hears the spirits, doesn't mean those spirits actually exist.
For that matter, we know that there are amputees that have phantom pain. We know the cause of that even. It is all in the way the brain reacts. I know 
a person whose husband lost his foot. He feels phantom pain in the foot quite often. We know there isn't a foot there, but it is all in how his brain is intepreting the signals that do get to it.
Just because you have had an experiance that you interpret as being 'God' doesn't mean it is 'god'. Brain surgeons have managed to trigger out of body experiances, the feeling of alien abductions, stimulate long lost memories, and make people think someone who is not there is standing beside them when certain areas of the brain are stimulated. That is objective , repeatable experiments to show a lot of 'experiances' are just in the brain.
You can have your 'god' feelings, but you can't create a 'god' detector.",19,20,topic_stance_votes_2
20,Could God really exist?,evolution,attack,"But in this case I told you that the forensic evidence was not available. The rapes happened over 2 years before the women were able to file charges and bring the case to the war crimes court. Any damage to vaginas had healed, and other physical scars could be explained by other types of injuries. It did come down to ""she said"" and the guards denied. So, if personal experience is not valid evidence, then these particular women have no chance of justice. If you were the judge, they wouldn't. That's plain.
Not all of them. Many are unique to these particular people. Don't confuse general category with specific experiences. In order to say THESE PARTICULAR experiences happened, you don't have science; you have the testimony of the men involved. 
As you say, there are tests for schizophrenia. As Ferguson noted, the reported experiences come from people we trust in other areas. You can't dismiss them soley because they are about deity. You have to have some other reason to suspect any other disorder. 
:) You didn't read the paper. Not very bright. The paper is about the ABSENCE of phantom limb pain. BTW, please post a paper detailing the mechanism of phantom limb pain. We have many reports of the phenomenon, but I don't know of any about ""the cause of that"". 
When a foot is amputated deliberately, the phantom limb pain is reported to be absent. So, we are depending on the feelings of the people involved. And these feelings, according to you, go against what we ""know"" of the way the brain reacts. So, why should we accept this personal testimony? If personal experience is not valid, why would the authors recommend foot amputation in particular circumstances?
Which is one reason why theism and atheism are faiths. The experience could possibly be something else. Just as the atheist's lack of experience could be something else.
1. Please post the papers on surgeons triggering the out of body experience. I have done research on that but haven't seen those papers.
2. That is an incorrect interpretation of the data. Any objective experience has to be routed thru nervous tissue. What you see is converted to nerve impulses in the retina and that becomes what we see. But there is an objective entity out there that causes those nerve impulses.
Now, we ""see"" in dreams. So, it's obvious that the nerve impulses can be triggered by stimuli other than objective entities. The experiments that you describe are the same thing: artificial stimulation of the nerve impulses. I took the effort to get Persinga's work -- that is the one on sensed presence. If you look at the methodology closely, Persinga can stimulate sensed presence by very complex and artificial electromagnetic impulses. The problem is that you aren't going to encounter such impulses in nature. Therefore the experiments don't explain why people not in the experiments have the sensed presence.
OTOH, it's obvious that deity is going to have to communicate with us thru our material brains. What Persinga's experiments show are the internal circuits that would be triggered by deity. Only if you can find a common natural situation to reproduce the signals would you have an argument that sensed presence is not due to deity. 
No one has created a machine to do that yet. But, if the experiences are valid (and you have to show that each and every one is not), then evolution created one.
Look, I'm not trying to convince you to be theist. What I am doing is looking at specific arguments you are using against theism and testing them to see if they are valid. I've already indicated that there is a valid argument for adhering to atheism.
Unfortunately, you won't be able to find it as long as you keep incorrectly attacking the validity of personal experience.",20,21,topic_stance_votes_1

28,Could God really exist?,evolution,support,"No, it's not. Of course, we can discard omnipotence and just say that God is very powerful but not omnipotent.
Remember that we have 2 conflicting entities: free will and universal happiness. In order for us to never do anything that would cause unhappiness to another person, God would have completely regiment our thoughts and actions. But then there goes the ability to choose.
This is a mistaken view of free will. You are using free will in the sense that we are able to choose among limitless possibilitiies. But that isn't free will. Free will is simply the ability to choose among alternatives. There are many factors that limit the number of choices. For instance, in going from work to home, biology means that I can't choose to fly; I don't have wings. Geography, time limitations, and my physical limitations mean I can't swim to work. I can't choose that one.
However, I can choose to drive myself, carpool, or take public transportation. If I drive myself, I have a number of choices as to routes and the method that I drive: carefully or not so carefully.
Now, if God were to try to make everyone happy all the time, God would have to step into either my body or my mind and use force (mild force but force) to keep me from speeding, make sure that I always make the careful decisions, etc. in order to prevent my causing an accident.
Maybe you want a control freak god like that, but I'm glad that God isnt like that. Well, from our conversations, you would want a god like that. It's such an easy strawman to argue against.

29,Could God really exist?,evolution,attack,"No. Instead, it is accurate to say that a few forms of monotheism hold this position. But it is a minority position within theism. Welcome to invalid synecdoche. Sometimes known as making a strawman argument.
IMO, it is human tendency to want to ascribe supernatural backing to some of the horrific things that humans do to each other -- especially when you are on the receiving end. Thus you see the slow transformation of Satan from a simple gofer for God to an archenemy and polar opposite. People need something to blame for the persecution they are undergoing. 
Notice that nearly all this transformation takes place out of scripture so that the minority position that there is a battle of good vs evil comes from the Essenes, Book of Enoch, some gospels and letters not included in the canon, Milton, and Dante. That says nothing about its accuracy, but it does contradict that monotheism requires such a battle or that all versions of monotheism have such a battle.",28,30,topic_stance_votes_1
30,Could God really exist?,evolution,attack,"Actually, no. All the jurists have to do is decide that the women are believable beyond a reasonable doubt.
No one said ""ANY claim"". Let's not go to hyperbole here. Claims have to be taken one at a time.
It doesn't damage it at all. After all, in dreams no such object need to be in front of the eyes for sensation of sight to be experienced. That doesn't negate that the object actually does exist when a person sees it with open eyes.
ALL the experiments demonstrate is that there is a brain circuit for experiencing presences that are not physically there. Well, in order to detect presences that aren't there, there MUST be such a circuit. DUH! What matters is what triggers the circuit. Dreams demonstrate that there is more than one way to trigger the circuits that report vision. They can be triggered by nerve impulses from the eyes or they can be triggered by internal signals that do not originate in the eyes.
So, for people reporting sensed presence, what is the trigger? The problem with the experiments is that there is no natural situation that is going to recreate the signals they used in the experiments. Now, are there other natural phenomenon that would trigger the circuit? Fairly common ones? No one has reported such. But it's possible; I can't rule it out. Can an internal state trigger the circuit? Again, possible, but no one has reliably associated any mental state with sensed presence. Certainly no state that would be present in otherwise sane and healthy people.
And there is another question: why do we have such a circuit at all? Why hasn't evolution eliminated such a circuit as not useful and a waste of energy to make? Of course, if the people are really communicating with deity, it is easy to find all kinds of selective advantage for that to our evolutionary ancestors.",27,31,topic_stance_votes_1
31,Could God really exist?,evolution,attack,"For that to be the case there would have to be some additional characteristic of the women, over and above their mere words, that rendered their testimony more believable than the guards'. This goes beyond the simple 'one word against another' scenario you originally set up: you have moved the goalposts. To move from the analogy back to the original issue, do you claim that those reporting experience of sensing the presence of a deity possess such a property, making their testimony more believable?
I'm surprised you invoke dreams as evidence for your side of the argument. Dreams are a classic demonstration that the brain can be persuaded, without extraordinary external intervention, of the reality of non-existent presences and events: exactly the position of those who are sceptical of 'religious experience'.
There is no such 'must'. It is entirely possible that such sensations are an epiphenomenon of some other brain activity; dreams themselves are considered by some workers to be such an epiphenomenon, arising as scraps of memory are sorted and deleted during REM sleep.
Firstly, the 'circuit' need not have evolved for this function in the first instance: see above. More fundamentally, who says a religious sensibility is not evolutionarily advantageous? I for one am certain that survival of early human societies was aided enormously by the commonality of purpose and sense of control imposed by shared belief in supernatural forces.
But the selective advantage is just as real even if the deity is not. It is the believing, and the sharing of belief, that imposes the advantage: it wasn't necessary for Quetzalcoatl to exist for Aztec society to reap the benefits of believing he did.",31,32,topic_stance_votes_2

33,Could God really exist?,evolution,support,"Rate up front I am a Christian... so:
1) The unhappiness and evil in the world is from Satan, and yes God allows Satan to create this sin and unhappiness and so forth because we would have no choice if he didn't.
Its all about freedom and choice, if we did not have bad events in our lives, and sin and unhappiness we would plainly have great lives with no problems and we would all be graceful and good, and so forth. We would be drones. With out both sides, happiness and unhappiness, good and evil, and so forth we would not have choice for our actions and decisions in our lives.
God created us, and had prophets to teach the word of God in the Bible, but he never gave concrete proof or made it clear that there was a God so would come to him through Faith not Fact. If God was a Fact it would not be a decision, we have to believe and live our lives the best we can, but its not about being perfect, its about having the belief in God. 
Anyways the way I like to put it in to perspective for non-christians is in the way another person said it:
1) If we believe in God and there is a God and afterlife after death then you made the right decsion
2) If we believe in God and there is not God after death and such then at least we lived our lives in a noble way following graceful morals.
3) If we do not believe in a God and there is a God after death then you face perishing in Hell and ultimately have your soul erased.
4) If we do not believe in a God and there is no God after death, there was no loss. 
So in all those prospects its more ""logical"" to believe in God to avoid possible Hell and learning to come close to noble morals. 
The cost of not believing a God and going to Hell is much higher, then believing in a God and living your life in a good way and not having a Heaven.
And the other aspect of it, is it, if you become close to God, you get comfort in him, you can console in him, tell him your problems, it gives you a sense of comfort and safety to know, no matter what happens in life, I am safe.",15,34,topic_stance_votes_1

If you answered yes, consider that God (if he created the world as is) didn't allow people to do what they want. Consider that we cannot fly on our own, we can't travel faster than light, and God didn't create other planets for us to inhabit. We are limited by those things.
According to the bible, right? And you know that that is correct because it is the word of God?
Of course. Pascal's wager. It was not intended to be a reason to believe in a deity; rather, it was intended to show that the existance of a deity was worth considering.
However, since you present it as a reason for your faith, it is only fair to debunk your argument. Wikipedia says it better than I could, so go there and examine the refutations.

75,Could God really exist?,evolution,attack,"i disagree with your idea that people are predisposed to do good or evil. however, i know that some people do actions that they cannot control that end up hurting themselves and others.
let me explain the difference between sin and evil. evil generally refers to acts or events that negatively affect others, like causing pain or death. therefore a weather pattern or plague can be considered evil, as well as a murderer or tourturer. sin, on the other hand, is disobedience of the commandments of god. this is not subjective, but is clearly defined in the bible
getting into heaven is a matter of being free from sin, not just being good. of course, evil and sin has a lot of overlap, but not always. it is sinful to murder, except when god commands it, then it is sinful to disobey and not murder. similarly with stealing, adultery, envy, cruelty, etc. they are sinful when god commands to not do them, but not when god commands to do them
because of this, ending up in heaven or hell shifts from the question of good and evil to obedience and disobedience. ultimately, being good or evil (both of with are subjective) are not the primary factors that determine your after-death destination.
if these things extremes that you cite didnt exist, and the worst form of pain one could experience were stumping your toe on a rock, then this discussion would be ""how could god exist in a world where rocks stump so many people's toes?"". there will always be an extreme end of the pain spectrum. its possible that the worse form of suffering we have experienced is far less than what is capable. we can only measure these extremes relative to what we can experience.
no matter what level of pain or happiness existed, it would always be too much
first, the bible answers this question. hell was created for the devil and his followers. the devil's followers were originally the 1/3rd of the heavenly host that sided with him to overthrow god. however, with man's creation, the devil set out to get as many humans to join him on his way to hell. i guess misery loves company
second, god doesnt allow anyone to go to hell on account of their sinful lifestyle anymore than he allows people to get wet on account of them jumping in a pool. its a consequence attached to the action taken. people choose to take those actions, be it sinning or jumping in a pool, and implicitly take the associated consequences, ie. getting wet or suffering in hell eternally
third, no, there is no evil or suffering in heaven, neither will you have any memories of pain and suffering from your earthly life when you get there. in heaven, besides eating healthy food and living in a comfortable climate, your main source of enjoyment will be basking in the glow of god's glory, and continually expressing praise to god. these activities are engineered to keep you happy non-stop forever and ever. god is happy because his need for constant praise is being met, and you'll be happy because youre constantly praising god. well, at least you wont be in hell, so heaven must be better, right?",75,76,topic_stance_votes_1

the rest of their life when they werent suffering, i suppose
actually, people who suffer before they die may still go to hell when they die. the destination of heaven and hell is solely based on whether you die with sin in your life, or with your life cleansed of sin.
correct
correct. god cannot make any decisions for humans, and god cannot alter the set consequences of people's actions based on thos decisions.
correct again. see pascal's wager
wrong and correct. god left no imperical evidence of his existence, but the decision is a faith-based one, not based on evidence. you can still choose to believe that god exists, despite the lack of empirical evidence. god doesnt cause people to go to hell, people choose, of their own free-will, to not believe in god's existence based on faith alone, which is the rational thing to do, but which could end you up in hell
i did, and i stand by my statement. unless god's brainwashing process includes the removal of curiosity, i am willing to bet that a large faction of heaven's residence will start to complain about the boredom and futility of continually praising god forever. people will start to yearn for something more, if only for variety's sake. the only way heavenly bliss for eternity is even practical is if god turns everyone in heaven into mindless praising robots
because the bible says ""without faith it is impossible to please god"" (hebrews 11:6}. remember, faith is the belief that something is true, where evidence doesnt exist, or in the face of evidence to the contrary. herein lies the catch 22: the decision to believe in god's existence must be faith-based, according to the bible. christians who believe in god's existence by faith constantly look for concrete evidence to back up their faith-based belief. this in itself is already a contradiction. the more evidence you have to believe in something, the less faith is required, and therefore the further away from the will of god these believers drift.
god not providing evidence of his existence is keeping consistent with what the bible says about him. anything that looks like evidence (that will influence us to believe in god's existence without faith) should be ignored. christian science is an example of a movement which violates this scripture",77,78,topic_stance_votes_1

Nice sidestep. My point was that they never have a time without as much suffering to be able to compare to the time when they were suffering.

But he set those consequences.
Why does it seem that he is not all-loving?
Pascal's wager... Hopefully you don't mean that as a reason to believe in your god. Even Pascal didn't use it that way...

It is nice of you to admit that it is rational not to believe in god based on the evidence. Will you take that back when the Pascal's wager angle is refuted?

Also, are you saying that heaven gets boring after a while and that people are forced to spend eternity there anyway?

Most celebrities I know don't mind giving evidence of their existance... They get more attention that way.

79,Could God really exist?,evolution,attack,"actually, god could limit people's free will so that they wouldnt kill each other. everybody would be robots doing only what god wanted them to do. i suspect angels function this way, and like i said, in heaven, most likely resurrected people would be this way too. but i think god doesnt want people to be robots. there's no point in rewarding a robot for carrying out what you programmed it to do.
the prisoner's dilema doesnt control or limit free will. in fact, its a calculated decision tree.
lets not get too emotional. somebody who had a lifetime of suffering would have to compare somebody else's life of less suffering. 
everybody has to bear their own weight due to body mass and gravity. this is an inconvenience that everybody is inflicted with. but we dont consider it suffering, because its common to everybody, and there is no group that escapes the burden of their weight. if some people didnt have a weight problem and others did, there would certainly be an outcry that the weight bearing group is ""suffering all their life"". thats because theres a group that suffers relatively less to compare to
hell is the counterpart to heaven. if heaven is extreme positivity, then hell is extreme negativity. the argument for why hell should or shouldnt be so horrible is exactly the argument for why heaven should or shouldnt be so blissful. we always encounter the argument that god is malicious because he created hell to be so terrible, yet never seem to have a problem with heaven being so great. suppose we tone down hell, so that if you die a non-believer all you get is a slap on the wrist, and we proportionately tone down heaven so that when you die all you get is a pat on the back, would that make god seem more all-loving?
the both consequences balance out evenly if you ask me. god, by being the terrible fiend that created heaven, and the glorious king that created heaven, seems just as loving. if you dont look at the whole picture, your judgement will be badly biased
my god? watch those emotions, my friend. your question was if someone believed that god didnt exist, would that be grounds to go to hell. to spell it out, if someone didnt believe that god existed, and god actually existed, they would go to hell. pascal's wager sums it up, but you missed it. follow the context of the discussion 
faith is the opposite of rationality. this is no secret. taking something on faith as being irrational has nothing to do with pascal's wager
he did... the garden of eden, and heaven. no suffering exists there, although i cannot possibly imagine how it there could be happiness in either place
you read what i typed fairly correctly
everything we know about god, including everything i've argued thus far, is based on what the bible says. i quoted a scripture directly out of the bible that spells out the nature of god as far as rational evidence is concerned. the question ""why"" is beyond my scope. its in the bible, and the bible says that whatever is in the bible is the truth about god. not much to do there...

I will respond to this rather than the previous post because I don't like it when the posts keep getting longer and longer.
First, I would like to define happiness. I will use this definition from wikipedia:
""Happiness is an emotional or affective state that feels good or pleasing.
[...]
Happiness is often correlated to the presence of favorable events (such as a promotion, a marriage, lottery winnings, etc.) and the absence of troubles or bad luck (such as accidents, getting fired, divorce, conflicts, etc.).""
A world with only happiness would be a world without unhappiness (i.e. a world without events that would be considered unfavorable).
In order to achieve this without making people bored (assuming people react to events the same way), the world would have to have different levels of favorable events. This could be achieved, but a consequence would be that the less favorable events would be viewed as boring (but not as bad luck).
To show that this is a valid option, I would like you to consider a school-aged child. The child tends to remain happy throughout the vacations and is usually bored at worst during school. For some children, school represents a learning opportunity which they enjoy.
Such children demonstrate that a universe where people are not unhappy is plausible even without modifying people's reactions.
If people's reactions are modified, they could be happy because of favorable events without requiring boredom or sadness in between. Modification would not even be necessary if a universe was being created; it could just be created like that.
This is the most likely option which would be chosen by an all-loving deity who was creating the universe: create inhabitants who can be constantly happy.",81,83,topic_stance_votes_2

85,Could God really exist?,evolution,attack,What's the point of Heaven if it doesn't make you happy?,85,86,topic_stance_votes_1
86,Could God really exist?,evolution,attack,"interesting. i suppose you know that you just undermined your initial argument. but thats another thread...
implicit of the definition you gave, the favorable events imply that there exist unfavorable events. a favorable event cannot exist without an equally unfavorable event. you cannot enjoy the abscence of an accident if accidents dont exist
interesting. this would shift the scale of good and bad. think about it, lets say the best thing that could happen at your job is that you get a million dollar bonus, and the worst is that you dont get promoted. everyday you could get promoted or a bonus fom 1000 to 1 million. i'm talking EVERYBODY in the world works at a job like this, billions of people get promoted daily, and millions of them get million dollar bonuses once a week. after a while, the regular $1000 bonuses and promotion start to become mediocre, and not getting a promotion for 2 weeks straight would be really depressing, especially when your co-workers are getting million dollar bonuses in that time. unhappiness would still exist
this is a generalization that i'm uncomfortable with. there are many school age kids that are rebellious, angry, mistrusting, and sometimes depressed to bordering suicidal. i'd wager that there are just as many teens that are disturbed and unhappy as there are that are blissful and positive.
in this last paragraph youre talking about something entirely different. you can either change the environment so that nothing ""bad"" happens, or you can change people's response to the environment, so that nothing is percieved as bad. 
interestingly enough, this already exist. humans can, and sometimes do, view every event as a positive event. for believers, its the mindset that ""god is in control, and everything works out for a reason"". for the non-believer it may be ""every failure is a learning experience"". bad events are acknowledged for what they are, but they dont make the observer unhappy

87,Could God really exist?,evolution,attack,"My argument is that an omnibenevolent, omnipotent god is not self-consistent (in this universe). How did I undermine that?
Good, except for the phrase, ""a favorable event cannot exist without an equally unfavorable event.""
The word ""equally"" is a bit of a problem. Consider: is there a counterpart to everything good that could happen to you?
The rest of the reasoning is fairly sound.
However, would you say that meditators require much unhappiness for them to experience a very happy state? Couldn't they have a decent day and still achieve the same level of happiness?
Which means the competitive setup is not the best for making everyone happy. If the creator of a universe was truely omnibenevolent and omnipotent, wouldn't he or she create a setup that could be enjoyed all the time by the inhabitants?
ShootsemoticonXKill
...and misses the point entirely.
My point was that people can, under the right circumstances, be happy for longer periods of time than they are sad or even bored.
The existance of people who are denied the situation (if there really is a god who can be refered to in this context) shows that an omnibenevolent, omnipotent creator failed to create an ideal universe.
Either option is better than none, at least from the perspective of an omnibenevolent creator who wishes to ensure that everyone (and everything) he loves is happy.
Then why don't all people think like that? Why are some unfortunate?
Those are both options.
By the way, you seem to be trying to link excessive happiness with drugs, which have negative connotations. Endorphins (not endorphines) are not harmful and have no major side effects (unless you count the release of adrenaline in small children).",87,88,topic_stance_votes_2
88,Could God really exist?,evolution,attack,"because youre an atheist, of course. arguing that god doesnt exist because he sends people to hell is self contradictory

it seems as though that simply isnt possible, even for an omnipotent being. an omnipotent being is one that is all powerful, not one that can do the impossible. unless you can explain how everyone in the world could be always happy all the time, my view is that its impossible
people of any age can be happy for a longer part of their life than they are sad. this doesnt exclusively or even generally apply to children, which is the point i was making. however, this would require people who are percieved as suffering for a greater part of their lives in order for the happy people to appreciate their fortune. it ultimately all balances out
the option of creating external conditions for EVERYBODY to be happy ALL the time simply is not possible, even for god, as i said before

I would like to point out that if a deity created a universe, he/she would not necessarily make this the case.
If creating a universe involves creating the laws of physics, planets, and living things, then it is no real stretch to assume that happiness could be made possible without unhappiness (considering that the organisms would be the ones to react to it).

132,Could God really exist?,evolution,attack,"Here's a religious answere to your question I got from a book:
WHY SO MUCH SUFFERING?
5 People of various religions have gone to their religious leaders and teachers to ask why there is so much suffering. Often, the response is that suffering is God’s will and that he long ago determined everything that would ever happen, including tragic events. Many are told that God’s ways are mysterious or that he brings death upon people—even children—so that he can have them in heaven with him. As you have learned, though, God God never causes what is bad. The Bible says: “Far be it from the true God to act wickedly, and the Almighty to act unjustly!”—Job 34:10.
6 Do you know why people make the mistake of blaming God for all the suffering in the world? In many cases, they blame Almighty God because they think that he is the real ruler of this world. They do not know a simple but important truth that the Bible teaches. You learned that truth in Chapter 3 of this book. The real ruler of this world is Satan the Devil.
7 The Bible clearly states: “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.” (1 John 5:19) When you think about it, does that not make sense? This world reflects the personality of the invisible spirit creature who is “misleading the entire inhabited earth.” (Revelation 12:9) Satan is hateful, deceptive, and cruel. So the world, under his influence, is full of hatred, deceit, and cruelty. That is one reason why there is so much suffering.
8 A second reason why there is so much suffering is that, as discussed in Chapter 3, mankind has been imperfect and sinful ever since the rebellion in the garden of Eden. Sinful humans tend to struggle for dominance, and this results in wars, oppression, and suffering. (Ecclesiastes 4:1; 8:9) A third reason for suffering is “time and unforeseen occurrence.” (Ecclesiastes 9:11) In a world without God as a protective Ruler, people may suffer because they happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.
9 It is comforting for us to know that God does not cause suffering. He is not responsible for the wars, the crimes, the oppression, or even the natural disasters that cause people to suffer. Still, we need to know, Why does God allow all this suffering? If he is the Almighty, he has the power to stop it. Why, then, does he hold back? The loving God that we have come to know must have a good reason.—1 John 4:8.

10 To find out why God allows suffering, we need to think back to the time when suffering began. When Satan led Adam and Eve into disobeying God, an important question was raised. Satan did not call into question God’s power. Even Satan knows that there is no limit to God’s power. Rather, Satan questioned God’s right to rule. By calling God a liar who withholds good from his subjects, Satan charged that God is a bad ruler. (Genesis 3:2-5) Satan implied that mankind would be better off without God’s rulership. This was an attack on God’s sovereignty, his right to rule.
11 Adam and Eve rebelled against God. In effect, they said: “We do not need God as our Ruler. We can decide for ourselves what is right and what is wrong.” How could God settle that issue? How could he teach all intelligent creatures that the rebels were wrong and that his way truly is best? Someone might say that God should simply have destroyed the rebels and made a fresh start. But God had stated his purpose to fill the earth with the offspring of Adam and Eve, and he wanted them to live in an earthly paradise. (Genesis 1:28) God always fulfills his purposes. (Isaiah 55:10, 11) Besides that, getting rid of the rebels in Eden would not have answered the question that had been raised regarding God’s right to rule.
12 Let us consider an illustration. Imagine that a teacher is telling his students how to solve a difficult problem. A clever but rebellious student claims that the teacher’s way of solving the problem is wrong. Implying that the teacher is not capable, this rebel insists that he knows a much better way to solve the problem. Some students think that he is right, and they also become rebellious. What should the teacher do? If he throws the rebels out of the class, what will be the effect on the other students? Will they not believe that their fellow student and those who joined him are right? All the other students in the class might lose respect for the teacher, thinking that he is afraid of being proved wrong. But suppose that the teacher allows the rebel to show the class how he would solve the problem.
13 God has done something similar to what the teacher does. Remember that the rebels in Eden were not the only ones involved. Millions of angels were watching. (Job 38:7; Daniel 7:10) How God handled the rebellion would greatly affect all those angels and eventually all intelligent creation. So, what has God done? He has allowed Satan to show how he would rule mankind. God has also allowed humans to govern themselves under Satan’s guidance.
14 The teacher in our illustration knows that the rebel and the students on his side are wrong. But he also knows that allowing them the opportunity to try to prove their point will benefit the whole class. When the rebels fail, all honest students will see that the teacher is the only one qualified to lead the class. They will understand why the teacher thereafter removes any rebels from the class. Similarly, God knows that all honesthearted humans and angels will benefit from seeing that Satan and his fellow rebels have failed and that humans cannot govern themselves. Like Jeremiah of old, they will learn this vital truth: “I well know, O God, that to earthling man his way does not belong. It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step.”—Jeremiah 10:23.
WHY SO LONG?
15 Why, though, has God allowed suffering to go on for so long? And why does he not prevent bad things from happening? Well, consider two things that the teacher in our illustration would not do. First, he would not stop the rebel student from presenting his case. Second, the teacher would not help the rebel to make his case. Similarly, consider two things that God has determined not to do. First, he has not stopped Satan and those who side with him from trying to prove that they are right. Allowing time to pass has thus been necessary. In the thousands of years of human history, mankind has been able to try every form of self-rule, or human government. Mankind has made some advances in science and other fields, but injustice, poverty, crime, and war have grown ever worse. Human rule has now been shown to be a failure.
16 Second, God has not helped Satan to rule this world. If God were to prevent horrible crimes, for instance, would he not, in effect, be supporting the case of the rebels? Would God not be making people think that perhaps humans can govern themselves without disastrous results? If God were to act in that way, he would become party to a lie. However, “it is impossible for God to lie.”—Hebrews 6:18.
17 What, though, about all the harm that has been done during the long rebellion against God? We do well to remember that God is almighty. Therefore, he can and will undo the effects of mankind’s suffering. As we have already learned, the ruining of our planet will be undone by the turning of the earth into Paradise. The effects of sin will be removed through faith in Jesus’ ransom sacrifice, and the effects of death will be reversed by means of the resurrection. God will thus use Jesus “to break up the works of the Devil.” (1 John 3:8) God will bring all of this about at just the right time. We can be glad that he has not acted sooner, for his patience has given us the opportunity to learn the truth and to serve him. (2 Peter 3:9, 10) Meanwhile, God has been actively seeking sincere worshipers and helping them to endure any suffering that may come upon them in this troubled world.—John 4:23; 1 Corinthians 10:13.
18 Some might wonder, Could all this suffering have been prevented if God had created Adam and Eve in such a way that they could not rebel? To answer that question, you need to remember a precious gift that God has given you.
HOW WILL YOU USE THE GIFT FROM GOD?
19 As was noted in Chapter 5, humans were created with free will. Do you realize what a precious gift that is? God has made countless animals, and these are driven largely by instinct. (Proverbs 30:24) Man has made some robots that can be programmed to follow every command. Would we be happy if God had made us like that? No, we are glad to have the freedom to make choices about what kind of person to become, what course of life to pursue, what friendships to form, and so on. We love to have a measure of freedom, and that is what God wants us to enjoy.
20 God is not interested in service performed under compulsion. (2 Corinthians 9:7) To illustrate: What would please a parent more—a child’s saying “I love you” because he is told to say it or his saying it freely from the heart? So the question is, How will you use the free will that God has given you? Satan, Adam, and Eve made the worst possible use of free will. They rejected God God. What will you do?
21 You have the opportunity to put the marvelous gift of free will to the best possible use. You can join the millions who have taken a stand on God’s side. They make God rejoice because they take an active part in proving Satan a liar and a miserable failure as a ruler. (Proverbs 27:11) You too can do that by choosing the right course of life. This will be explained in the next chapter.

If he does not exist, (hypotheticly) and you love him anyways, nothing bad happens to you, If you do not belive in him, nothing bad happens to you. So someone who love Him knows that either way, nothing bad will happen to them in the next world, wearas if you do not love him, well you either do not live on after death, or you go to eternal suffering.

140,Could God really exist?,evolution,support,"The problem with Pascal's wager is that you can't just look at it from a Christian point of view, there is no way to narrow down which religion you are going to start beleiving in to ensure you an afterlife.

In the grand scheme of things, Christianity doesn't really even provide the justice you're after - a good person might be condemned to hell if they weren't a christian (or were just of the wrong demonination) whilst that murderer might have a death bed conversion and repent thus gaining access to heaven.
There is a danger in applying human morals and common sense to the universe, common sense breaks down very early in trying to describe how the world works before we even start getting down to the fundamental processess of the universe.
